00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 1>Experience. You know,</v>

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.320
there's something weird about when you watch some porn where they're pretending

4
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.070
to be school girls, you know, like, you know, the girl's 30, but she's.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.480
<v 0>Pretending to put them in the town.</v>

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.140
<v 1>There's something weird about those. Porns like, what is.</v>

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.060
<v 0>Happening here? No, exactly. One.</v>

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.470
<v 1>Guy's a milkman. The other guy, you know, and he just comes over.</v>

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.580
<v 0>What must you bring up? My fetish, milkman porn. He knocks on the door.</v>

10
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.750
<v 1>Girl answers. She's got pink tails. Um,</v>

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.540
my dad's not home right now. Um, I guess,

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.870
I guess you can come inside now. You know.

13
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
<v 0>Well, how about watching the baseball game?</v>

14
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.480
<v 1>Another thing is weird about porn. There's a lot of step sister,</v>

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.920
step mother porn.

16
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.450
<v 0>Step.</v>

17
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.130
<v 1>Mother step-mother and step-sister.</v>

18
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.000
<v 0>With his stepmother or dude with his step sister.</v>

19
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.640
<v 1>Like dad marry some new floozy dad's off at work and the sun sun's</v>

20
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.340
like 19. He wakes up and he's got a. And next thing you know,

21
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.660
his step-mom sucking his Dick.

22
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.390
<v 0>Oh, those are fun.</v>

23
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.870
<v 1>But it's very.</v>

24
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.730
<v 0>Popular. Well, there's a, you know, that's human sexuality. There's,</v>

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.530
you know, everybody has something they're into.

26
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:18.330
So I guess they make a movie for all of it.

27
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.010
<v 1>Yes. But also they're always looking for a new forbidden thing.</v>

28
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.380
So it's regular porn. It's not forbidden enough.

29
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.640
It's not just two people that are hot that are getting it on. Right.

30
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.710
It's gotta be something that shouldn't be doing. Oh my God,

31
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.950
we shouldn't be doing this. Right. That's a thrill for a lot of people. Right.

32
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:38.010
They feel sexually suppressed. So when they watch porn, like, oh my God, it's a,

33
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.220
step-mom she going to do it? She's got.

34
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.280
<v 0>Sure. So it's right. So it's like forbidden. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.100
Like you with the Westworld thing. Yeah. Yeah.

36
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.190
<v 1>I mean, that's the thing with people, right? They like,</v>

37
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.880
especially when people get told what to do too much when they're young and then

38
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.780
develop this desire to do forbidden things.

39
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.370
<v 0>Right. To be rebellious. Right. Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.630
I mean, yeah.

41
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.760
<v 1>But it's also pushing the envelope thing too. Right.</v>

42
00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.650
You get bored people if people like outrageous things and it does outrageous

43
00:02:13.651 --> 00:02:16.560
things are not outrageous enough any more than they get more outrageous somehow

44
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:17.394
or another. Right.

45
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.240
<v 0>That's right. That's why you shouldn't go down the path. Right.</v>

46
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.921
You should start.

47
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:27.450
That's why you're healthier working out like crazy or being obsessed with cars

48
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:31.230
or being obsessed with sports. It's like, it's,

49
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.340
you want to get more and more extreme with it. What you're dealing with tires,

50
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.300
you're not dealing with human beings that are being trafficked through Florida

51
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.830
with the idea that they might have some fame. You know what I mean, Florida.

52
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.570
That's where it all happens. Right. All bad things. Where was that? Epstein guy?

53
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.650
Florida. Yeah.

54
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.573
<v 1>Mar-a-Lago.</v>

55
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.230
<v 0>Florida. You ever see Rashida Jones, his documentary on porn?</v>

56
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.470
No, it's pretty, uh, devastating. Who's Rashida Jones came.

57
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.780
She was Quincy Jones daughter. She was on the, um, she's very funny, talented.

58
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:08.740
She was in, um, parks and rec and the office and the office.

59
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.030
And she made a documentary on just like all these young girls that,

60
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.740
especially now with social media and wanting to be liked and wanting to having

61
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.100
all these promises of fame and that what you think is amateur porn and is

62
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:21.934
harmless.

63
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.010
There's really a very high percentage of these people are being exploited

64
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.940
and, uh, it, yeah, it will make you look at porn very differently.

65
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.770
I'm sure I recommend it.

66
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.720
<v 1>W is there any kind of acceptable porn? Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.720
Like what if it's like 35 year old ladies that are just freaks.

68
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.880
<v 0>Or nobody? They just.</v>

69
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.850
<v 1>Want to on camera. They get it. They get a thrill out of people watching them.</v>

70
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.580
<v 0>I don't know if it's possible. What's that question, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.290
<v 1>You always worry if.</v>

72
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.250
<v 0>But do you, what happened to them? Put them in that mind space. Okay.</v>

73
00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.620
<v 1>We don't have a fear about men. Look,</v>

74
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.280
are you worried about men who are 35 years old who are having sex with women on

75
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:05.170
camera? Does do those trouble? You.

76
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.860
<v 0>Know, I'm not, I don't think about them at all. I'm concerned about.</v>

77
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.330
<v 1>Them, right? So we're concerned about the women. Is that right?</v>

78
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:16.780
Wait for it because we're sexist. Are we,

79
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.130
are we putting standards on the females that we don't put on the males?

80
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.920
Because we don't think that women can handle it or that you don't,

81
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:25.480
we don't think they can make that choice.

82
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.850
We don't think that they should be allowed to make that choice.

83
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:28.870
Or if they do make that choice,

84
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:30.910
we think there has to be something wrong with them and they need to be

85
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.460
protected. Whereas we don't have those feelings about a man.

86
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.651
<v 0>I just know that.</v>

87
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:40.450
So I think that when you're thinking about what leads you to that place,

88
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.650
there's a high probability that some man did something awful to that

89
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.170
girl when she was young,

90
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.780
that's such a high percentage of people that have had all women have had to

91
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:56.230
deal with some creepo at some point in their life. For sure.

92
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.190
And so I think it's built on that. It's like, well, you know,

93
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.430
I'd rather help her in some other way than watch.

94
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.260
<v 1>Porn. So is that something we inherently know? And how do we know that?</v>

95
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.100
<v 0>Yeah. Um, yeah, because men are big and aggressive and can do.</v>

96
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.460
<v 1>No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. When you see someone that's in porn,</v>

97
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.060
do we inherently know that they've been molested? Do we just know? Or is it,

98
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.340
I mean, we don't know, but have we investigated,

99
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.290
like there is a high percentage of women that do porn.

100
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.690
This is a fact that have been sexually molested,

101
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.060
but what I'm saying is your distaste for it.

102
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:32.890
Is it based on the knowledge of that?

103
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.850
Or is this an inherent perception that a woman who would do that must be

104
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:38.170
damaged? So something must be,

105
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.920
must have had happened to her when she was younger. That was awful.

106
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.880
Otherwise she wouldn't be doing.

107
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.300
<v 0>Well. It's like going to a strip club and you know,</v>

108
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.520
probably 80% of the guys are just seeing somebody dancing.

109
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.930
And 20% of the guys are thinking, wait, you shouldn't be doing this.

110
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.110
You know what I mean? I think 20% it's trip clubs. I don't know,

111
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.783
maybe higher.

112
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.310
<v 1>I just feel like I'm.</v>

113
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.520
<v 0>You know what I mean? I think we're able to, I'm sorry to cut you off.</v>

114
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.260
I think we're, uh,

115
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.100
I think human beings are able to not see everything that they want to see

116
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:14.690
because they're enjoying what's before them.

117
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.410
<v 1>I think you're right. For sure. We definitely make rationalizations. Right.</v>

118
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.410
But I'm wondering like why, if it's a man, we don't have any,

119
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.000
I guess it's because we don't think of a man of being, you know,

120
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:29.360
if a guy is a, a S an object of sexual desire for women,

121
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.190
we don't think of them as a victim ever.

122
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:31.791
<v 0>I know.</v>

123
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:35.480
Which is unfortunate because there are a lot of things happen to young boys.

124
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.140
You know? What did.

125
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.790
<v 1>You hear about this guy that Sue and Katie Perry?</v>

126
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.890
<v 0>You about the song? No.</v>

127
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.410
<v 1>No. She says maybe she he's not suing her,</v>

128
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.320
but he's accusing her of sexual assault. What? He's calling sexual assault.

129
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.490
She pulled down his sweat pants and exposed his Dick to some people. Right.

130
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.390
<v 0>Right. And then the knee-jerk reaction is, well, you're a dude.</v>

131
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.160
Or you would love Katy Perry pulling your pants off. And, um, that's right. And,

132
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.610
uh, but maybe he was really hurt by it. Who knows? He needs to grow a pair.

133
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.890
I love Katy Perry.

134
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.500
<v 1>Yeah. What the the problem? She pulls her pants down.</v>

135
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.650
He gets to see your Dick. Okay.

136
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.160
<v 0>Even when I was a young boy there, wasn't like, I was, it.</v>

137
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.620
<v 1>Sounds to me like Katy Perry is trying to.</v>

138
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.300
<v 0>You. Leave.</v>

139
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.320
<v 1>Katy Perry. Is that what.</v>

140
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.640
<v 0>You think she was doing now? Sounds like she pants them for fun. Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.050
That's what it sounds like, Lucy.

142
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.960
<v 1>Right now, if that was a guy doing it to a girl,</v>

143
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.470
I would say that is sexual assault. Yeah. Think of it very differently.

144
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.130
If a guy was there and a girl bent over in front of a bunch of guys to pick up

145
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:37.640
her keys and someone pants during our vagina was exposed to all these strangers.

146
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.040
I would say that guy's a piece of. Like,

147
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.310
imagine if that was your daughter or your wife, right.

148
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.550
Some guy pulls your wife's sweat pants down in front of a crew of people.

149
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.080
<v 0>Because I think we see the men as a threat, as a physical threat. But.</v>

150
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.240
<v 1>If Katy Perry does it to a guy, I'm like, huh?</v>

151
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.800
<v 0>Yeah, I know. Yeah. And you can ask.</v>

152
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.670
<v 1>The judge. I I'm like, get.</v>

153
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.760
<v 0>The out of it without explaining it or coming up for reasons why that is the</v>

154
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:02.594
knee jerk reaction.

155
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.220
<v 1>Uh, woman got arrested in New Jersey. She, uh, blew a 14 year old boy.</v>

156
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.280
They gave her a 10 year,

157
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.110
like a suspended sentence, a 10 she's on 10 year probation,

158
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.260
no jail time. And she keeps her teaching certificate.

159
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.540
<v 0>Really? She was allowed to keep her certificates.</v>

160
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.950
<v 1>Stop blowing kids. You crazy. She probably blew the cop blue judge.</v>

161
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.360
God,

162
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.750
that's my thought on that always is if a woman's willing to blow a 14 year old,

163
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.380
she'll blow you to that. Girl's crazy.

164
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:38.930
She just loves sucking Dick. She's like.

165
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.130
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

166
00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.880
<v 1>She, you could talk her into it. She's got standards. I mean,</v>

167
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:47.150
I think every cop that rest a 14, a lady who blows 14 year olds,

168
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.260
every cop thinks she'll suck his Dick too. Right. Don't you think they're.

169
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.093
<v 0>Crazy.</v>

170
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:53.240
<v 1>Crazy.</v>

171
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.470
<v 0>Woman. Yeah. Well, you.</v>

172
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.410
<v 1>Don't think so. Do I think she's crazy? Yes. For sure.</v>

173
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.410
But it's not a crazy, it doesn't scare me.

174
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.570
<v 0>No, there's something, you know, look where y'all,</v>

175
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.130
there's a lot of different ways to be damaged. Right. And that's her damage.

176
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.250
<v 1>But what I'm saying is like, that's not her, what is she doing?</v>

177
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.830
She's a grown adult. See how you even, you're looking at that.

178
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.270
There's a lot of different ways to be damaged.

179
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.120
But if that was a grown man having sex with a 14 year old girl,

180
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:20.250
you wouldn't worry about what damage he has.

181
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.940
You'd be worrying about what damage he's doing. So even in that situation,

182
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:27.390
you're worried about her being damaged. I'm not worried about her mean,

183
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:29.090
but that's what you said. Right?

184
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.560
You're you're what you were thinking about was her being damaged,

185
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.660
not her victimizing the boy. Right. Because we don't think of it that way.
