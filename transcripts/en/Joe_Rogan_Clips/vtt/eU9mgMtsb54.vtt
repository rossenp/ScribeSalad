00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. She was 18. It's only one.</v>

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.040
<v 1>I, I try to stay off a pornography, man.</v>

3
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:11.360
That's one of my biggest arch nesis is &lt;laugh&gt;, uh, pornography. Why?

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.080
Cause it just weakens me. It just, yeah. How so? I put all my sexual,

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.470
you know, my fantasies and stuff. They're not my anymore, you know, they live,

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.550
you know, somebody created 'em better than my imagination can.

7
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.030
And so they live in these, you know, on the internet,

8
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:33.110
in these boxes and it's like, and if it's not mine, I think then it's,

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.950
I don't value it as much or something. And so I think it,

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.590
it like weakens my ability to like,

11
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:43.140
be able to have sex and like be comfortable in, or the world and really oh yeah.

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.740
<v 0>Weakens your ability to be comfortable. Like how so?</v>

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 1>Well, because I get used to watching the sex</v>

14
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.420
and seeing it and not having to like,

15
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.180
be engaged with my actual feelings or anything.

16
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:05.690
So then I see it and I still get all the joys out of it. You know,

17
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.250
I'm still out there e-jacking and, you know, spraying out natural spraying,

18
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.730
but it's, I don't get any, I don't have any of the feelings attached to it.

19
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:16.450
So then when I am engaging with somebody that I care about or something,

20
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.970
it just doesn't calculate for me emotionally as well. Hmm. I,

21
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.200
and that's not, maybe that's just me. Uh, but it does.

22
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.880
It's definitely made it tougher for me over the years. Um,

23
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.480
cuz I would have a date set up with a nice girl and next thing you know,

24
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:35.520
I'm walking through the house and I start thinking about, you know,

25
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.560
a little bit of ussy or something and then some or something I'll even see a,

26
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.310
I'll see a pregnant puppy and see those nipples or something.

27
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:43.751
And the next thing you know,

28
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.110
you're on the internet jerking off and then you wait a minute, hold on.

29
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.910
Or like a, you know what I'm saying? Anything &lt;laugh&gt;,

30
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.190
anything could lead a man, a Jack off a, a pregnant.

31
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.910
<v 0>Puppy could make you thinking about human nipples. Is that what you're saying?</v>

32
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.950
You're not like getting excited about the puppy. No.

33
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.470
<v 1>No, I don't do anything. I don't,</v>

34
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.660
I don't believe in bestiality or anything like that. But I think if you, you.

35
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.300
<v 0>Don't believe it exists or.</v>

36
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.620
<v 1>I believe it exists, right? They caught a dude near me one time with a lamb.</v>

37
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.140
No, which almost sounds beautiful when you just say it. Yeah.

38
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.420
<v 0>The lines lay with the lambs.</v>

39
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.900
<v 1>Yeah, but I don't think.</v>

40
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 0>When you say near you, you mean in Hollywood? No. No, no. You.</v>

41
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.010
<v 1>Mean when you're a kid in Louisiana. Okay.</v>

42
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.690
&lt;laugh&gt; they got a lot of people out there, uh.

43
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.530
<v 0>Did on those natural born mushrooms. &lt;laugh&gt; I.</v>

44
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.010
<v 1>Know. Oh, I never told you at the end of that. Oh, sorry. So no,</v>

45
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.530
I took that back of mushrooms to that party. Right. And a bunch of people ate.

46
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.811
Em.

47
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.290
Who'd never had 'em before Uh-oh and then we played a game of hide and go seek.

48
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.410
Right. I was like, oh no.

49
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.640
<v 0>Yeah. Hide in another dimension. Oh, I was like.</v>

50
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 1>I'll count. You guys go hide. Right? Oh no.</v>

51
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.880
And I never went to look for it. &lt;laugh&gt;

52
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.160
that was the end of that, bro. I never seen one dude. This boy Timothy.

53
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.760
I've never seen that dude again. &lt;laugh&gt; um.

54
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.280
<v 0>People get lost in the woodsmen. Maybe they got eaten.</v>

55
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.600
<v 1>Oh yeah. Maybe they ended up in another realm, you know, they could have like.</v>

56
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.320
<v 0>Stranger things. Yeah. Have you see.</v>

57
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.200
<v 1>That show? Oh yeah. The first season I saw it. Phenomenal show,</v>

58
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.320
but I don't like that pornography. Oh. And I think it,

59
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.950
I think it should be shut down man. For real. Yeah.

60
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.310
Cuz I think it's killing like a lot of, I think it's,

61
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.710
I think it's harming a lot of men and I really, really do.

62
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.590
<v 0>Okay. Do you think that booze should be shut down? Should we make booze illegal?</v>

63
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:28.550
Cause that's killing a lot.

64
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.670
<v 1>Of men too. No,</v>

65
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.110
but I think eventually we'll kind of evolve out of booze as it's not like

66
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:37.750
something that it's not the hip drug that it once was.

67
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.420
<v 0>Yeah. Still like a social lubricant. That's a good point. You know?</v>

68
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:47.180
It makes people feel more comfortable talking to each other. Loosens,

69
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:52.060
inhibitions. It's fun. Like what is that? Uh, that ancient quote about wine,

70
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.540
you know, your tongue becoming more lively. People.

71
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.460
<v 1>Love wine. Yeah. And women love wine too. Especially divorceese if you see.</v>

72
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.290
Yeah, yeah. You like one,

73
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.010
I used to live with these rich people for a while and they always had one boy

74
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.243
&lt;laugh&gt;.

75
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.930
<v 0>Why did divorceese like wine?</v>

76
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.090
<v 1>I don't know. But when, when one of her friends would get divorced,</v>

77
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:14.050
they'd come over and just drink wine and they'd lay on the couch.

78
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:16.210
One of 'em tried to hook up with me on the trampoline. Of course did.

79
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.650
And I remember the dad used to at night over there.

80
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:21.600
This when and speaking of pornography,

81
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.400
the dad used to at night and I would sneak out there in the kitchen.

82
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:27.880
This is back when the family, you had like a family computer, you know? Right.

83
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.560
And he was in one part of the house. Right.

84
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.480
And I'd try to sneak to the refrigerator and get some chips or something. Oh.

85
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.840
Or get something olives or something. And he would, uh,

86
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.240
be over there by himself, just in the bone zone.

87
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.950
This where you can't even hear you're so intent on the screen.

88
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:44.990
You can't even hear. Whoa,

89
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.310
you could have your grandparents on each side of your head and you,

90
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:50.390
you caught 'em. Oh, I'd see. 'em I wouldn't watch for long,

91
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:51.110
but I would you watch it.

92
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.943
<v 0>Through the window?</v>

93
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.710
<v 1>No, I'd sneak out to the kitchen. Cuz the computer was kind of in the kitchen.</v>

94
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:57.190
They had a nice house. Right.

95
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.380
And the computer I'd have to elbow crawl over to the fridge and bro,

96
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.700
I would've to open the fridge a little reach in with my hand and press that

97
00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:07.500
light thing. So the light wouldn't come on, then open the door,

98
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:09.140
the rest of the way and fish for a snack.

99
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.540
And he's over there just in the glow of that screen bro.

100
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:14.860
And that's back when the monitors were big, you know,

101
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:19.860
and he's just over there just looking for the devil &lt;laugh&gt; and

102
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:22.570
he ended up getting divorced and it was, I think it was because of that.

103
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.810
But what.

104
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.570
<v 0>Was his wife like? Was she a wonderful sweet woman or.</v>

105
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.690
<v 1>Was she annoying? I think she might have been a little bit annoying.</v>

106
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.010
Business-centric sometimes business centric.

107
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.283
<v 0>A little too much.</v>

108
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.570
<v 1>Just how so? Yeah, maybe just too. Business-centric what does that mean?</v>

109
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.320
When it just too, too? Yeah. She might have been a little too ending,

110
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.320
but then if he's up for an hour and a half each night out there, you know,

111
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.080
looking at it. All right. And he comes back to the bedroom,

112
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.520
then you don't feel as desirable. I Don know.

113
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.880
<v 0>The question is what came first. The chicken of the egg. For what?</v>

114
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.800
Well for them, was she annoying first? And he started beating off or was he,

115
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.080
I think he had it in him. Was he beat.

116
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.400
<v 1>The devil? I think he had a pit of it in him. Yeah. The devil &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

117
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.280
<v 0>He had that devil in the Theo. I could see it in his eyes. He was talking to me,</v>

118
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.400
just hoping I'd go to sleep. He would drug me, but not to have sex with me.

119
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.670
He would drug me so so that he could freely he'd leave his socks on.

120
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.510
He wouldn't even take his pants off. He was an animal. He put a hat on.

121
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:23.483
He was an animal.

122
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.870
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; the worst is if you're jerking off with a hat on bro,</v>

123
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:30.550
you're going to hell. I think that's likeorara that's the worst bro.

124
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.470
&lt;laugh&gt; that's the most French thing you can do jacking.

125
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.710
<v 0>Off. Williamsro Kentucky Derby hat. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

126
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.660
<v 1>I yeah.</v>

127
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.660
Puts the worst hat to Jack off the worst hat to Jack. Probably a top hat.

128
00:06:43.661 --> 00:06:45.580
Cause you have to balance yourself while you're jerk.

129
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.700
<v 0>One of them chimney sweet hats. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

130
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.900
<v 1>Yeah. The best to be one of those Chinese hats, bro.</v>

131
00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.420
Cause if you squat down low enough to the ground,

132
00:06:56.421 --> 00:06:59.170
you can almost hide under written jerk off, you know &lt;laugh&gt;

133
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.170
those things would be dope, bro.

134
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.970
<v 0>The most confusing would be like one of them Daniel Boone, raccoon cap.</v>

135
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.211
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah,

136
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:12.930
but you got that tail in your eye &lt;laugh&gt; you pushed the you're blowing the

137
00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:16.810
tails in the way, the outta my way with his tail.

138
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.200
Oh right. About the finish. You get distracted by a tail. God.

139
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.473
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

140
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.720
<v 0>Choking up dusty coonfer &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

141
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.080
<v 1>And it's hard to when you're breathing out real fast, you know? Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.840
It's more of an, it's more of a intake sport.

143
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.413
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.910
<v 1>But I don't like him and you think it's healthy for people cuz I feel like you</v>

145
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.990
kind of like, you know, you lead a lot of men in like their aspirations to,

146
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.910
you know, control their beings and stuff.

147
00:07:50.911 --> 00:07:53.390
And these are just some of my weird interpretations, but you know,

148
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:57.510
to try and be on top of themselves in some ways and you know, stay focused on,

149
00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.283
on,

150
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.740
on controlling themselves in positive ways,

151
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.633
you know like mm-hmm,

152
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.260
&lt;affirmative&gt; staying fed and expanding their minds and thinking, you know?

153
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:09.460
Yeah. And not falling into easy traps, having.

154
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.293
<v 0>Discipline.</v>

155
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.060
<v 1>That's what I'm trying to say. Yes.</v>

156
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.580
<v 0>I think that it's definitely important to have discipline,</v>

157
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.010
but I think that if you are a person like say, if you're not in a relationship,

158
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:24.530
you're not getting any sex and you're horny and it's confusing and it's

159
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.490
distracting. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it becomes a big distraction. Like if you're,

160
00:08:27.491 --> 00:08:31.250
if you're horny and you're busy and you don't have anybody you're dating,

161
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.930
you don't wanna hook up with someone you don't like,

162
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.610
just so you could have sex with them. We've all been there before, right? Yeah.

163
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.360
If you ever had girls that you were friends with or you dated and the only

164
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:43.240
reason why he dated him for, for the sex and they,

165
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:45.520
they had a annoy the outta you and you couldn't wait to get the.

166
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.560
<v 1>Away from them. Yeah. Tiffany's this girl I'm thinking about. Tell me about.</v>

167
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.393
<v 0>Tiffany.</v>

168
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.280
<v 1>She had kind of side like too much. I don't wanna say sideburns,</v>

169
00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.440
but she had a lot of &lt;laugh&gt; you know, some girls don't know how to ride 'em uh,

170
00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:01.520
they were a little, they went.

171
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.600
<v 0>Down the cheek where it got confusing dude.</v>

172
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.400
<v 1>An extra quarter inch on a female sideburn is way too much. It's a lot.</v>

173
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.280
It is that extra.

174
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.880
<v 0>Quarter inch is a lot. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.040
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; it makes you think about, and if.</v>

176
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.910
<v 0>She cuts it, you're like, well, if you let it go, what would happen? Yeah.</v>

177
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.350
<v 1>True. So she's really in that hit or MIS range on that side hair. And so yeah,</v>

178
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:21.950
she had some family issues, but yeah.

179
00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:24.510
That's why I was thinking about what you were saying that I interrupted you. No.

180
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:27.390
<v 0>Everybody guys have that before. Most likely.</v>

181
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:30.150
And some guys wind up marrying those girls cause they don't wanna be alone.

182
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.830
Like sex for a lot of people is a requirement like a,

183
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:40.100
a biological requirement. Like your body is constantly producing sperm.

184
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:43.940
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you need sex. If you spend time not having sex,

185
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:47.980
you spend a month, two months, three months, you get desperate. Yeah.

186
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.020
And a lot of guys wind up,

187
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:53.300
just shacking up with some gal just cuz they know they could have sex with her.

188
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:53.861
And meanwhile,

189
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:56.610
they don't even like each other and they hate each other and it wants it to be a

190
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.650
terrible dysfunctional relationship. But she's basically your drug dealer.

191
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.370
That drug is. Wow.

192
00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.090
She's dealing out that for you and you just gotta have this weird, creepy,

193
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:09.250
dysfunctional relationship with her. One thing that pornography does, it's good.

194
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.450
And I'm not saying all pornography, but just regular pornography, like two guys,

195
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.810
uh, you know like, uh,

196
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.520
that are just living their lives.

197
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.760
<v 1>Where like in like Chicago.</v>

198
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.040
<v 0>I mean anywhere, but I'm saying like I'm giving you two separate scenarios.</v>

199
00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:27.840
Okay. Like two guys are delivering their lives. One guy says,

200
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.120
I can't take this anymore. I gotta get a girl. You know, I gotta get any girl.

201
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.440
And he winds up with this girl that turns out to be a nightmare and she's

202
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.310
disaster the devil and it just doesn't work out and he's just doing it because

203
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:43.190
he needs sex. And the other guy goes and says, you know what?

204
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.070
I'm just gonna watch a little porn and I'll beat off.

205
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.230
I'll just look at that girl. Those big tastes. Oh yeah. I'm like, woo.

206
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.550
I got it outta my system. Now I can concentrate on my life, my career.

207
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.070
And if I meet somebody, I won't be so needy.

208
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.910
I won't have this like massive requirement to be sex,

209
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.220
really stimulated and touched. Yeah. I'll,

210
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:03.180
I'll be free of that monkey on my back and I can just get to know them.

211
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.940
Yeah. So I, I used to always, I used to have a bit in my act.

212
00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.540
That's a good point. I used to have a bit in my act about like,

213
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.580
if you ever any critical decisions in your life,

214
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.660
this is my advice jerk off first. Then think about it. Cuz there's been,

215
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.130
I I've had this happen in my life where I was about to go on a date with a girl

216
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:21.970
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I jerked off instead. And I was like,

217
00:11:21.971 --> 00:11:25.250
what am I thinking? I don't want to go on a date with her. Yeah. She's annoying.

218
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.970
I don't like anything about her. I don't, I can't talk to her about anything.

219
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.210
Like the only reason why I'm doing this, cuz she's got a big.

220
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.130
That's the only reason. Yeah. But if you jerk off first, you don't,

221
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:36.050
you don't go through all that.

222
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.880
<v 1>Yeah. I, I just for, yeah.</v>

223
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:41.520
I guess for me it became addictive where I would just do that every time.

224
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.000
And then I was just at home for five years and didn't, you know,

225
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.400
go do any dates or anything. That's definitely not good. Right.

226
00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:47.201
And so that's yeah.

227
00:11:47.201 --> 00:11:50.560
I guess that's the difference if you get addicted to it and you find that it's

228
00:11:50.561 --> 00:11:53.600
just a repeat pattern. So you're not spending time with people at all. Yeah.

229
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.080
<v 0>I don't think it's without value.</v>

230
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.280
I don't think that looking at naked people having sex,

231
00:11:58.281 --> 00:12:01.080
which is arousing and that feels good. I don't think that's without value,

232
00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.640
but I think there's definitely a danger in like immediate access to

233
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.080
pornography. And today,

234
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.560
today it's the most immediate access cuz you get it on your phone.

235
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.550
Oh you can get it. Yeah. You pull up your laptop, open it up type.

236
00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:17.910
In some words you porn.com, blah blah, blah. And next thing you know,

237
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:21.150
you're beating off. Yeah. It's so easy. And this has never been the case before.

238
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.550
I mean, it's, it's unlike any other time period in, in human history. And uh,

239
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.710
when you have instant access to things, you can abuse.

240
00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:30.030
It just like people abuse food.

241
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.260
If you have a cabinet that is just filled with candy and

242
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.140
chips, chocolate bars, liquorish soda in the refrigerator.

243
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.460
If you're just one of those people that can't help themselves,

244
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.740
you don't have any discipline.

245
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.980
You will just eat all that all day long and get fat. Yeah.

246
00:12:45.981 --> 00:12:47.780
And that is just as much of an addiction.

247
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.140
As someone who has access to porn all the time,

248
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.100
it just beats off all the time or someone who has access to booze.

249
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:57.530
And just like, once it get up every day, all those things are okay though,

250
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.410
in moderation, if you have discipline, right?

251
00:13:00.411 --> 00:13:04.570
Like there's nothing wrong with having a bag of M and MSMS every now and then

252
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.250
for a, like, I feel like having some M and MSMS who gives a.

253
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.450
I work out all the time. I'm eating my vegetables, like peanut M and MSM.

254
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.520
<v 1>I, those are my favorite.</v>

255
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:14.240
<v 0>They're good. Huh? I, you kind of trick yourself. I'm getting a little protein.</v>

256
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.240
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. They put that trick in the middle. Just.</v>

257
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.520
<v 0>Get some healthy fats at that peanut.</v>

258
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.440
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; but I get no, it's a good know what I I'm saying point.</v>

259
00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:23.600
I just feel like we're we're at the point for me,

260
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.960
it seems like where the temptation is too powerful where it's starting to

261
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.840
overpower whatever. Well,

262
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:34.480
for me it was whatever my natural abilities to defend against it were well, you.

263
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.710
<v 0>Sober, right? Yeah. And how long you been sober? Almost.</v>

264
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.543
<v 1>Two years.</v>

265
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.270
<v 0>And so before you were sober, you weren't sober. Right.</v>

266
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.870
And you had a little bit of a problem. Yeah. Which is why you became sober.

267
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.190
Yeah. So you might have just natural inclinations towards addiction. Yeah.

268
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:49.990
Which I definitely think are real. And I think they,

269
00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.340
those natural inclinations exist a lot of times in guys like you and me cuz

270
00:13:55.341 --> 00:13:57.580
we're comedians, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and comedians are impulsive.

271
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.460
People who are just rule breakers. We're rule breakers. For sure.

272
00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:05.540
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I guess. Yeah. I, I, I, I am a rule breaker.</v>

273
00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:08.420
I never thought about that. Yeah. I don't like a, if the,

274
00:14:08.421 --> 00:14:12.380
if there's a rule of my first thing is to think of a way to think around it or

275
00:14:12.381 --> 00:14:13.900
something or to do something different. Of course. It's.

276
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.140
<v 0>Why you're funny. Yeah.</v>

277
00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:17.890
It's one of the of reasons it's one of 'em it's one of the reasons why you're

278
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:19.250
funny, you know, like you,

279
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.170
you were raised were by people and you didn't necessarily wanna listen to 'em

280
00:14:24.171 --> 00:14:24.811
and you know,

281
00:14:24.811 --> 00:14:26.850
you saw a bunch of other people in the neighborhood that were adults,

282
00:14:26.851 --> 00:14:30.530
like these idiots telling me what to do, this. And the next thing you know,

283
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.850
you're making fun of them. Next thing you know, everybody's laughing.

284
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.650
Next thing you know, you're a comedian, you,

285
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.360
that those wheels have been put into motion. Yeah. You know,

286
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:44.240
and the problem with that is that also leads itself to you wanna do Coke

287
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.080
or you wanting to, you know, do all kinds of crazy and, and porn too.

288
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.160
Porn's forbidden too.

289
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.720
Porn is porn is one of the weirder ones because it's this multi-billion dollar

290
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:54.720
thing. Right.

291
00:14:55.530 --> 00:15:00.400
Where there's some ungodly percentage of the internet is dedicated to.

292
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.240
<v 1>Porn. Yeah. It's the number one money maker on there. But isn't.</v>

293
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.870
<v 0>It like,</v>

294
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:08.760
what was the Nu the amount of bandwidth Jamie didn't we figure this out once it

295
00:15:08.761 --> 00:15:13.350
was like 30 something percent of all the internet bandwidth is porn. Let's say,

296
00:15:13.351 --> 00:15:13.810
guess.

297
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.950
<v 1>People won't stop jerking off. They're.</v>

298
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.190
<v 0>Not gonna stop. I wonder how many of 'em are women.</v>

299
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.150
<v 1>Watching it? I wonder if we had one day, nobody jerked off.</v>

300
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.110
If the earth would feel different, it would feel lighter.

301
00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.350
<v 0>Everybody be more.</v>

302
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.230
<v 1>Relaxed. No. If, if one day where nobody jerked off. Yeah.</v>

303
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.020
<v 0>But if no one was thinking about it at all, every body would just calm down.</v>

304
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.060
<v 1>A little. Cause I feel like it's so prevalent.</v>

305
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.220
Now you can hear people coming in the distance. I feel like now. Yeah.

306
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.460
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. You just put your, your you're gonna turn into a,

307
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.740
you're gonna literally turn into a monkey one day. &lt;laugh&gt;

308
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.700
that's the worst, bro. But that's that old fashioned jerking off.

309
00:15:50.701 --> 00:15:53.970
When you used to let your S hit your hand, that's a straight up,

310
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.330
that's a Confederate soldier, jerking off that's the whole,

311
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.210
I should jerk it off. The new thing is just shaft. Only.

312
00:16:00.211 --> 00:16:04.090
Nobody's with their balls anymore. You know, dude, when I was growing up,

313
00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:05.850
we couldn't even get porn. We had to get this dude,

314
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.130
Nick on Friday with draws a pitchs and, you know, cross for the weekend.

315
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.880
$4 to this dude, Nick $4.

316
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.320
<v 0>For drawings, bro.</v>

317
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.120
<v 1>You'd pay eight &lt;laugh&gt; and he had a nice thing, bro.</v>

318
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:21.480
And you would fold that thing up, bro. You could feel it heat.

319
00:16:21.481 --> 00:16:24.200
And in your butt pocket the whole way on the bus, sometimes you'd even,

320
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.600
was that good? The pictures was that good? Oh, he was so good.

321
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:28.560
He'd jerk off this guy's drawings. Oh, everybody would,

322
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:33.350
he must have made probably $60 on a Friday. &lt;laugh&gt; and this was in 1995.

323
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:34.670
You know that was $60.

324
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.510
<v 0>Like 160 today. Oh yeah.</v>

325
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.353
<v 1>Think about that.</v>

326
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.290
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

327
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.670
<v 1>I'm thinking about it. Yeah dude.</v>

328
00:16:39.671 --> 00:16:43.670
And we'd come back on Monday and people would have like these busted looking all

329
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:47.590
sketches, rain on them. People was like, oh, this one got rain on it.

330
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.550
&lt;laugh&gt; like, bro. That's they had that rain history, kids in it. &lt;laugh&gt;.

331
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:03.380
<v 2>The.</v>
