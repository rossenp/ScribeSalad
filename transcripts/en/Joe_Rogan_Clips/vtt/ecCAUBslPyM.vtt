1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.640
<v 0>Him full blast in the face. And a bunch of people do it. They stomp him,</v>

2
00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:06.920
they kick him. I mean, he's out cold with his pants down.

3
00:00:06.921 --> 00:00:08.240
They are kicking him in the head.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.760
<v 1>I don't think people realize videos,</v>

5
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.480
the effects that one of those ERs can have on your psyche.

6
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.960
And I think when people,

7
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.870
they see something like the lion guy or dude who caught the foul ball in Cubs

8
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.670
game or, you know, Metzker or anything like that, or.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.630
<v 0>This say this lady.</v>

10
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.630
<v 1>With the eight year old girl, it comes at you from everything everywhere. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.230
And then the psych, like the, the, the zeitgeist moves on, you know,

12
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:35.470
people kind of move on and think something else.

13
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:39.590
They're still getting hundreds of stuff a day saying, you, you. you. Yeah.

14
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:44.100
It's still happening. And so you all move on, like, if nothing happened,

15
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.830
but everyone added to their, this, this overwhelming,

16
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.190
like this thing you can't get out. I still think Mexico's flailing off that off.

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.590
He's still trying to defend himself, all these attackers from five years ago.

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.070
Mm. Like three years ago. But like, you don't just come clean of that. Right.

19
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.460
So all of people adding like, Hey, you for killing that lion.

20
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:09.140
Like you've added to their break in psychology. Yeah.

21
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.700
It's not an easy thing to get over and you don't see it all,

22
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.820
but it's so much, I mean, Ren easy started.

23
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.140
I called him and his wife, Mike get offline right now, Ralphie too.

24
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:21.940
And that was happening to him. It was like,

25
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:24.330
you need to give this as a someone else cuz it won't do you any,

26
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.210
even if you know you're wrong, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; be easy.

27
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:30.530
Apologized to all of us six years earlier said, Hey, I'm sorry. I lied.

28
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.210
And we all made fun of him. That was over. He doesn't need other people going,

29
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.650
you, you lied. He goes, you. I know,

30
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.690
I already told everybody I know I was wrong. Yeah.

31
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:38.810
You don't need 10,000 people telling you that. Yeah.

32
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:41.770
Doesn't do anything for you when you've already said yes. I agree. Yeah.

33
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.130
<v 0>You know, they don't, they don't care though.</v>

34
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.880
They just want to get their licks in. Yeah. And it it's terrible.

35
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.480
They are the cultural equivalent to this bar fight. Yeah.

36
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:52.480
Kicking guysomebody Down's knocked out. He hits the free shots.

37
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.200
In's they also want you to know they're disappointed in you and express their

38
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.000
rage at you. I'm unfoowing you. Yeah.

39
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.080
<v 1>That's all right. Just do it.</v>

40
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.720
Don't tell why are you telling me&lt;laugh&gt; adorable with.

41
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.760
<v 0>You? That's adorable when I let you know. Oh,</v>

42
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.390
follow &lt;laugh&gt; Alex Jones was right.

43
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.310
<v 1>Um, yeah. It's it's a, it's a nutty time we live in.</v>

44
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.430
<v 0>Yeah. It is a nutty time and it's a time of outrage.</v>

45
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.550
There's there's outrage sport out there to be had.

46
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.900
And there's, you know, there's a legitimate outrage. There's a, both.

47
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.740
<v 1>Both things are happening.</v>

48
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:27.860
Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt; my friend told me about these people in DC, um,

49
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.780
pulled over on the side of the road, decently busy highway. Um,

50
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:34.860
maybe sunset Boulevard type thing, but not

51
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.380
businesses like that, but it busy, like let's say three lanes here,

52
00:02:38.381 --> 00:02:39.214
three lanes there.

53
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.700
They sell these two kids walking home a 10 year old and eight year old just on

54
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:45.810
their own, just walking. Um, and this lady pulled over. What?

55
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.370
Who are you? Where's your parents? And they're like, I don't know.

56
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.650
I think they're probably at home. We're not sure. And she's like, well,

57
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:53.690
where are you going? She's like, we're going home. They're like,

58
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:55.330
where are you coming from? They're like, we're coming from the playground.

59
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.770
And she was like, no, no, you can't be on your own.

60
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.200
She called the cops and they got them, you know,

61
00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:03.280
picked them up and got 'em to where they lived and their parents were there.

62
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.360
And like, what's all this. And they're like,

63
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.600
well you saw your kids walking alone. And they're like, yeah for the park.

64
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:10.360
Right. And they're like, yeah. They're like, yeah, we taught 'em how to do that.

65
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.400
And they're like, what do you mean? Like we taught them.

66
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.040
We walked with them from the park enough times.

67
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.240
And we taught our kids enough to where we trust that they can come home from the

68
00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:21.790
park alone. We've taught them how to do that. We trust them with it.

69
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.270
And then people are like, oh, I guess so. And there was a split in the story.

70
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.990
Most people read it. 90% of the people who read it go, yes,

71
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:31.390
parents should be allowed to trust when their kids are trained enough to do

72
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.550
things like try anything at 16, that's a parent's decision. You know? Um,

73
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.860
10% of the people were like, no, I wouldn't do that with my that's them.

74
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.500
And those people reached out on Twitter on Facebook and said, you,

75
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.900
you should have your kids taken away from you. And that 10%,

76
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.580
even though 90% said, yeah, your parents should be able to teach their kids.

77
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.540
Whatever that 10% means.

78
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.380
Thousands of people coming at you saying you're a horrible teacher.

79
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.980
You're a horrible father. Imagine that if thousands of people say, you,

80
00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:00.730
you're a bad father. You're ruining your kids. And it kept happening.

81
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.290
It affects you and they didn't do anything wrong.

82
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.970
They did tell you when 90% of people think, yeah, you're on the right here.

83
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.810
And you're still getting all this negativity. Well, nobody.

84
00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.650
<v 0>Ever it's, damagingaging a. And nobody ever is prepared for that.</v>

85
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.650
No one's prepared for it.

86
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.050
<v 1>No one agentsagencies should have,</v>

87
00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:18.570
should be on the ready to help their client deal with this when it happens.

88
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.280
Cuz it'll happen to almost everybody you'll have something.

89
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.280
That'll get blown outta proportion. Yeah. You gotta be.

90
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.800
You gotta get offline immediately.

91
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.700
<v 0>Well,</v>

92
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.640
do you think that some of it comes from people have this feeling that anybody

93
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.693
who is

94
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.680
in that sort of a situation with a clearly wrong yeah.

95
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.400
Is just an open target or target.

96
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.470
<v 1>Them. I can go off on them. Look how easy it's do a Christianity joke.</v>

97
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.190
Now look how hard it was back then. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the Scientology,

98
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.150
same thing. And south park broke it up and now you're like,

99
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:50.230
you're not brave for making in fun of Scientology now. Right?

100
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.950
We're a Christianity. Everybody's doing it. Yeah. That whole brave. So easy,

101
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:55.910
easy. Now dude, that in the sixties you have a problem.

102
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.910
<v 0>Didn't that get exhausting, brave telling jokes. How much this be funny. Yeah,</v>

103
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.060
but John Don am my rare. I had a great joke. It's even covered. He goes,

104
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.780
I got a great story. He goes, how about just a, a funny one you made up. Yeah,

105
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:07.620
yeah, yeah, yeah.

106
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.940
<v 1>Yeah. True story. True story. Like I don't need a true story.</v>

107
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:11.220
How about a good one? Yeah. He goes.

108
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.140
<v 0>I don't need a true story. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

109
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.220
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. Wait, what were we just saying? I forget.</v>

110
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.290
<v 0>What were we just saying? Jamie? You forget too. God it. It marijuana.</v>

111
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.730
It's got its side effects.

112
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.210
<v 1>It does have its side effectsely has issue. There's no doubting that.</v>

113
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.730
<v 0>Yeah. We're talking about ER. Yeah. Um, yeah.</v>

114
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.610
Medker's ER is pretty rough people.

115
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:33.970
<v 1>He hasn't gotten out of that yet. No.</v>

116
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.970
<v 0>Yeah. People you, man. Say, you.</v>

117
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.880
I just feel like we're stalled out in our cultural

118
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:48.000
evolution in a way that I feel like we're we're in these movements of

119
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.960
change. And I think I see a lot of positive things,

120
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.800
but I don't see nearly enough like friendliness and compassion.

121
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.840
I think we really need more of that as human beings. This is not lasting.

122
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.360
You're not going to last. No one's lasting, you know, you're gonna die.

123
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.040
We're all gonna die. We're here for a certain amount of time.

124
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.200
It's not permanent. And while you're here,

125
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.520
we can make everything better for everybody just being nicer to each other can

126
00:06:12.521 --> 00:06:13.354
be done.

127
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.000
<v 1>I mean, it's not going to be done. So I think, but it.</v>

128
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.833
<v 0>Can be done and little.</v>

129
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.310
<v 1>Drips. Yeah. I think what you do is gotta affect your own life. See,</v>

130
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.430
I can't change it for everybody,

131
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.910
but what I can do is every time every read one of these blogs, make me angry.

132
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.910
Just go. I probably don't have the whole story on this.

133
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.950
Cause that's happened 20 times already. Oh for sure. So then it's like,

134
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.390
I'm not gonna get mad. You know? I am gonna,

135
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.350
I'm sure people are taking care of this. Yeah.

136
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.870
What I'm gonna do is go outside and enjoy some freedoms that I have like a park.

137
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.300
Yeah. You know,

138
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.740
actually enjoy your life instead of letting people take you down this horrible

139
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.580
road to hurt themhorrible road. You're hurting yourself. Yeah. And you're wrong.

140
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:49.380
You're hurting them. Yeah. get out there. Just leave. Call a friend,

141
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.700
go talk about something. Yeah.

142
00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.130
<v 0>It's just a strange time for, you know, just for saying anger.</v>

143
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.170
you. You're wrong. you. you. you. You're wrong.

144
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.890
We never had like more of an open forum for debating ideas,

145
00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:08.330
but people have never been more dogmatic and aggressive about their opinions

146
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:10.610
too. My God. And the left gets violent.

147
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.450
Now this is a weird thing that didn't used to happen before you saw Nick DePalo

148
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.930
get punched in the face. Yeah. By some woman at a show. It's so selfrighteous.

149
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.360
<v 1>That you.</v>

150
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.360
<v 0>Feel like she just had to punch him in the face, got a giant black eye.</v>

151
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.320
And it's like, you can't.

152
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.720
<v 1>Be violent against someone. And, and they used to go, well look who you're.</v>

153
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.920
Let's say it was like a dice type act mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then some of

154
00:07:28.921 --> 00:07:31.560
those people were like, hardcore kick a KPI. People like,

155
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:33.400
look who your fan base is. And you're like, that's not my fault.

156
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.240
I'm like asking 'em to be there. Right. Well, if you want that logic,

157
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.030
some of the people following you guys are pretty. Yeah.

158
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.950
I won't call you on that logic. Cause I'm at a hypocrite,

159
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.550
but like it ain't your fault. But like they are,

160
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.030
some of them are getting violent now. Yeah. It's crazy. They're so anti-free.

161
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:54.110
<v 0>Speech it's it's so exchange of information, it becomes idea wars.</v>

162
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.710
And when it becomes idea wars,

163
00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:59.300
they get this anything necessary by any means necessary mentality &lt;affirmative&gt;

164
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.500
and they think let the justify the means there's professors out there have been

165
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:05.660
quoted to saying that they believe in, uh,

166
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.060
violence when there is no other solution supporting Antifa and Antifa's

167
00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:13.500
disruptive violence and to, to take away oppressors and that free,

168
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.820
this is a big one. This is one that has been coming up lately. More, more often,

169
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.010
even the a C L U changes, stance on free speed each. And they,

170
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.170
they they're deeming free speech as something that's not hurtful to someone

171
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:28.610
else. Well, that's not what free speech is. Like what is the most recent one?

172
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:29.291
Oh, when they go hurtful, they,

173
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:31.690
what was the most recent reading about free speech?

174
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.330
There was something about the a C L U stance on free speech. Well, you can't.

175
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.370
<v 1>Infringe. My belief is you can't infringe on your fine.</v>

176
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:40.600
As long as you don't infringe in the rights of someone else. Right?

177
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.240
So like you can burn a flag if you want,

178
00:08:42.241 --> 00:08:44.760
but you can't burn a flag in my apartment. I.

179
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.680
<v 0>Don't think, I think they're shifting it. Right. But if.</v>

180
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.120
<v 1>You concern, right, if you go to what harm is mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's like,</v>

181
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:51.280
are we just talking like a physical harm or monetary physical,

182
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:54.280
or now we talk about like slight mental harm. Well.

183
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.400
<v 0>If it's racism, it's clearly emotional.</v>

184
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.200
<v 1>Harm, mental harm. You're you're damaging. Someone's psyche.</v>

185
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:04.520
If you're dismissing them in a racist way or you're insulting them in a racist

186
00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.680
way. I think that's one, you have to start applying out to white people.

187
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.240
Here's the problem with saying, okay, so I heard this theory that like,

188
00:09:11.241 --> 00:09:12.060
what if making.

189
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.710
<v 0>Fun of white people and dismissing white people? Yeah, because I like.</v>

190
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.030
<v 1>You white guy. You don't know anything. It's like, all right, well that's,</v>

191
00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:20.230
you've just put me into a category. I'm just racist human. I, I mean,

192
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.750
I know you don't like when people do that to you,

193
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:24.550
so I don't know why you're using those methods now. It doesn't make sense to me.

194
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.110
<v 0>Well, it's the tide coming in and out, right? Yeah. The,</v>

195
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:31.470
the whites owned slaves for so long and it was so oppressive that now,

196
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:32.390
as it's shifted back,

197
00:09:32.391 --> 00:09:36.380
there's still economic despair and all black neighbor hoods cuz of racist laws

198
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:40.220
and things haven't bouncd out yet. So you're allowed to go white people. Yeah.

199
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.220
So you're allowed to say white people until it goes this way and this way.

200
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:43.740
And then evens.

201
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:43.800
<v 1>Out.</v>

202
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.060
We got to the point where you're hitting on Christians and I'm not a Christian.

203
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.340
I don't care for them. Uh, especially Catholics,

204
00:09:48.341 --> 00:09:51.220
but like we're on them now is like, Hey, Hey, come on, leave them alone.

205
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.860
They they're they're honestly, all they do is take abuse. Now,

206
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.090
all they're doing is trying to worship their gut. You guys are on them and,

207
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.970
and calling them yolkles leave them alone for a minute. Yeah.

208
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:02.010
They're they they're down. They're down. You got 'em down.

209
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.690
You're not punching down. If you wanna punch. If you're on on a.

210
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:08.050
<v 0>Catholic. Yeah. Unless they're kids catching yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

211
00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:08.790
You'll let go.

212
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.090
<v 1>Do whatever you want. Join in. Wait, wait, what? No. Right? What you said,</v>

213
00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:11.970
what you said &lt;laugh&gt;.

214
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.000
<v 0>That is, I mean, that is one of the darkest things that they accused of.</v>

215
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:17.800
Transferring.

216
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.260
<v 1>People.</v>

217
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.160
<v 0>Go rape some, all over the place. That was the Pope Pope did that.</v>

218
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.920
<v 1>Yeah. There's an organiz. The guy who talks to God is yeah.</v>

219
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.040
That's that's what God told him to say. Anyway, he.

220
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.830
<v 0>Moved somebody who went on to rape a hundred deaf kids. Oh yeah.</v>

221
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.910
Oh yeah. A hundred.

222
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.150
<v 1>Yeah. Um.</v>

223
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.820
<v 0>What the man? Yeah. You look into that guy's background. Rattsinger look into,</v>

224
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.340
I mean, there's several cases of that.

225
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:46.460
There's so many there's documentaries on it. I think speak new evils.

226
00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:50.500
One of the documentaries of, uh, different priests that were just molesting.

227
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.860
Just scores of kids. Yeah.

228
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:57.180
And they interview the guys they're monsters. It's so crazy, man. I mean,

229
00:10:57.181 --> 00:10:59.770
they were just, that's what they did. That's what everybody did to them.

230
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.570
That's what they did. And they got away with it forever. Every once.

231
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:02.851
<v 1>In a while,</v>

232
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:06.450
someone will point out some like Jewish rabbi that like has raped a kid or

233
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:08.690
something like that. And so I see it happens in Judaism too.

234
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.490
<v 0>What is this? ACLU's long standing commitment to defending speech.</v>

235
00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:14.010
We hate is this recent good? That's.

236
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.530
<v 1>What they should be doing is in response to.</v>

237
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.080
<v 0>This. Oh, of somebody pub uh,</v>

238
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:22.440
someone's criticism published in the wall street journal a uh,

239
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.680
is different from those challenges to our work.

240
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.080
Her critique is pre is predicted how predicated on a fundamental

241
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:28.914
misrepresentation.

242
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.880
She falsely accused of the a C L U of having secretly change his policy and

243
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:37.280
regarding free speech and of launching an investigation to determine who leaked

244
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.670
the secret, uh, air quote, uh, quote leaked, and then quote,

245
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:45.030
secret document that she claims revealed this assertted change in policy.

246
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.431
In fact,

247
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:50.150
the a C L U remains fully committed to defending free speech as the document

248
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.760
she cites expresslyaffirms expresslyirms um, hashtag fake news.

249
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.120
So somebody put out some fake news, according to the a C L U good.

250
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.120
<v 1>I heard somebody say, it's hard to tell you should, you should not be able to,</v>

251
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.480
uh, it was like, I know something. Um, and say,

252
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:08.280
once there's violence committed because of your, um, organization,

253
00:12:08.281 --> 00:12:08.681
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

254
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:11.520
you can no longer say you're not a terrorist organization or you can no longer

255
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.310
say, uh, you have the right to protest when it causes violence.

256
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.270
And then this is on NPR actually. And then the coast was like, okay.

257
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.510
So just so you know, though, under the, and they're our liberal group, mm-hmm,

258
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.750
&lt;affirmative&gt; um, not crazy, but like liberal, right. And the guy. Okay.

259
00:12:23.751 --> 00:12:27.070
Just so you know, then they'll apply that same thing to, uh, black lives matter.

260
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:28.870
And he like, what do you mean? Like, well,

261
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:31.230
that guy who killed two cops because of the black lives matter. If,

262
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:34.500
if you're gonna say the follow words decide whether or not it's,

263
00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:38.500
then we have to outlaw black lives matter. And the guy was like, oh no, no, no,

264
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:39.820
no, no, no. We can't do that. I was like, all right,

265
00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:42.980
well then you can't say Charlotte people don't have a right to say, go home.

266
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.820
Kekes you're taking our jobs. They can say it. It's fine. They can say it.

267
00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:51.820
It sucks. They can say it. Yeah. All of it. You gotta say all of it.

268
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.410
You can, you can roll your to say that guy's an idiot. That's your right.

269
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.810
You don't stop them from talking because then it keeps going to the point where

270
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.650
rap is getting boycotted in America.

271
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.330
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you can't put your out. It, it goes,

272
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.570
it will always go to a point where it'd be super, super repressive.

273
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.680
Well, if one person who is doing anything wrong, can't speak,

274
00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:16.320
you've done something.

275
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.920
<v 0>Wrong. Yeah. You could easily compromise a group too.</v>

276
00:13:18.921 --> 00:13:22.920
And turn it into a terrorist yeah. Organization by infiltrating it,

277
00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:24.880
having someone cause violence. And that then what they.

278
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.840
<v 1>Occupy wall street. Exactly.</v>

279
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:28.160
They would send in some undercover cops mm-hmm to start fist fights. Yep.

280
00:13:28.161 --> 00:13:30.280
And then they get like, go home. This fist fights now.
