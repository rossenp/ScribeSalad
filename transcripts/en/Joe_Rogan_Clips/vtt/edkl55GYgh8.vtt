00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.220
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Good luck. That's right.</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400
There are people out there that actually want credit for coming up with an idea

3
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:10.650
that they didn't come up with. There are people out there that want like,

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.530
like show runners, right? That step in,

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:17.670
after someone's created a pilot and they say, I want created by credit, seen it.

6
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.650
And then I'll, I'll run the shutdown dance.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.460
That is one of the most bonkers things you've ever seen the conversation and a

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.833
room.

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.160
And then a year later you got to show and that person will show up and Sue you.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.670
Oh yeah. And it's happened. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um,

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.650
well I knew a dude who, uh,

12
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.120
submitted a script to a major Hollywood production company. Um,

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.300
they turned them down and then they went ahead and made the, made the movie.

14
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.810
Yeah. And they made the movie, it was a blockbuster with big time stars.

15
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.170
He sued them. He won, he should've went. And he got his name on the book.

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.600
On the movie. Yeah. Well that's yeah.

17
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.300
That's fair because people do that all the time. A lot of times,

18
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.310
if you're not a writer and you're an executive,

19
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.770
you're under so much pressure to come up with an idea,

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.530
somebody comes up with an idea and you're like, that's a good idea we could,

21
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:04.560
but I got a better, we could add some to it. Right.

22
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:07.860
But you're supposed to have a deal you're supposed to make. It's called.

23
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:10.620
Don't take what doesn't belong to you. Don't be a thieving. Cut.

24
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.120
Don't be a theater. The movie was the Expendables. Yeah. It's very, the guy was,

25
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.350
he was a writer for, uh, he was a, a student of Eddie. Bravo's really? Yeah.

26
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:23.130
So I was around when the whole thing was going down. Wow. We're all like, whoa,

27
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:27.960
they stole your idea. They just jacked it. Well,

28
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.810
speaking of the expandables, you know, my new favorite person is allegedly.

29
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:32.850
I should say allegedly to all the things I've just said.

30
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.730
I don't know if this is true. It could have been a big, giant lie.

31
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.700
Someone was on Adderall and just started lying. My favorite one,

32
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.700
my new favorite person is a guy named, sliced alone.

33
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.790
He went to his house for the fights. Like I learned some about him. It was me.

34
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.850
David Blaine showed up and you got to have him on the podcast. Dude,

35
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.090
Blaine shut up and did magic that let's,

36
00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.880
don't pay the rest of my life and not have David Blaine on the pocket.

37
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:59.830
Just saying fine. I'm just saying, he'd be a great guest. Don't get me wrong.

38
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.520
And I think you'd like it. I don't like you telling what to do. I'm just saying,

39
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.460
bro, this have to have a month. Is that like that picture?

40
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.780
I told his daughter to take that picture and I just got,

41
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.930
cause I wanted to jump in while they were all doing that.

42
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.330
And it was just me and behind them. How thick is the loan's hair?

43
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:15.150
That is preposterous. It looks fantastic. How is it still so good.

44
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:19.860
A couple of things about sly. You don't know here, so good. Cause he's slide.

45
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.740
I think he has like someone who like does him up before the picture,

46
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.180
like he knows you guys are coming over.

47
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.460
So he has his hairdresser like puff it all up.

48
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.670
He looks at shows up like that and just looks, you know,

49
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.780
I like how he's got the J little shirt on too. Great sense of humor. Oh he does.

50
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:36.030
I, I interviewed him once for a spike TV.

51
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.710
He was hilarious if someone heckled and he goes, Hey ma oh yeah,

52
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.420
he's got an a on top of that. He's I know I'm on Sasha.

53
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.980
I I'm, I'm not cool in that group. Well, there's Arnold. So solemn.

54
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:50.940
Cause he was watching the fight.

55
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.490
He didn't give a about any fights is very important,

56
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.160
but he's also really cool when you talk to him, I'm sure.

57
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.020
But me and Taleah Talia goes like this to me.

58
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.450
We're sitting there with all those legends and Leah goes like this. He goes,

59
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.130
I got weird going on in my chest, man. I feel weird.

60
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.970
He didn't know what to do with all this hilarious Frank Grillo is,

61
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.750
some of them are done. And they're like, what about me man? Oh my God.

62
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.460
He's trying to poke his head. Could you, do you get any more famous?

63
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.960
Imagine being a fly on that wall, you know,

64
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.870
it's still on is really good at besides horseback riding world-class horseback

65
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:24.430
rider so I can. No, man, I just made that up. No painting. Oh,

66
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.090
me, me delete Ashley about it. Me delete David Blanton.

67
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.840
Frank Grillo are following him around his house. Like a cup, like beta,

68
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.530
like Hmm.

69
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.270
Like little puppies as he's pointing to his insane

70
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.720
paintings that he's made himself. Oh dude, sells them for,

71
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.270
I won't even go to how much I went. How much you sell it for?

72
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:47.890
And the number he gave me, I went, of course. And I looked at Frank and I went,

73
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.520
Frank, I'm going to tell you, why are you asking him nothing?

74
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:55.870
I asked personal thoughts. Cause I asked personal questions of, you know,

75
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.890
cause I wanted one. Okay. But don't you feel weird saying, Hey man,

76
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.250
how much money do you make? No, I said, well, I said, I said,

77
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.710
if I wanted to buy, like you sell these, he goes, yeah, I go,

78
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.520
can you give me a ballpark figure? And the ballpark figure, I went, oh that's,

79
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.020
I'll never be able to buy that. But they were so,

80
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.600
so you should live your life and your goal should be having enough money.

81
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:18.910
So it seems reasonable to buy a Stallone painting.

82
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.070
That's what I thought should be your, those paintings. He's a great painter.

83
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.930
That's actually kind of cool. What is that? What's going on 10 o'clock um,

84
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.760
that's a dude's back. Notice that I don't know if he's a great painter. Ooh,

85
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.460
it's so good. Is that supposed to be him? I looked at,

86
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:39.190
I looked at Grillo and I got mad. I went, Hey, I'm a loser.

87
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.220
I'm going to get myself together. I got to do something else.

88
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.320
The guy does a lot of. Is that, did he take a, did he paint himself?

89
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.610
It's getting mixed in with oh, pictures of him. Paintings of him. Yeah.

90
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.320
No he's a look, man. The guy wrote Rocky and then would not accept them.

91
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:56.920
Having anybody else play the character when he was nobody,

92
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.880
he's got steel. Uh, Blaine plane took a video of me listening to them.

93
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.900
As you read the first page of the Rocky script in is in this office.

94
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.480
I would've ran through that wall. Like the Kool-Aid man.

95
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:12.910
Like I can't Boone.

96
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.690
I can't, I gotta get out.

97
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.750
He told us a story about how Joe Frazier came in to audition for it,

98
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.490
for the Apollo creed thing. And, and he said, he said, you know, I wanna,

99
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.180
you know, we decided to do some boxing, just, just to have him, you know?

100
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:31.900
Cause they were going to be fight scenes. And he said, he said, I tried to,

101
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:36.640
he goes, D Frazier started tapping me in different places. And I,

102
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.070
he literally was just like, what the is going on?

103
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.530
It was like getting caught in a buzzsaw saw. I was like, wait,

104
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:44.380
this is not going to work at a movie. What the are you doing? And then, and it,

105
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:47.650
same thing with Roberta Duran. He, you know, he's like boxing a little bit.

106
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.630
And he said, I started getting hit like in so many different places that it's,

107
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.970
I, I felt like it was in a washing machine.

108
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.800
The way he tells the story is all of those guys. They know what

109
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.390
[inaudible] and Peyton. Yeah. He's interesting.

110
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.600
His daughters are great too. He's a, yeah, he's a,

111
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.270
he's a really fascinating guy. Very, very unusual guy.

112
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.770
And the thing about him is like,

113
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:21.830
he's done so many of these big blockbuster hits that.

114
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:24.050
I think people forget that he can actually act.

115
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.120
If you go back and watch Rocky one, you go,

116
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.630
oh like this guy's a really good dude.

117
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.130
He was in Rocky one, man, you got to see like who he was, you know,

118
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:38.390
young guy. Well, the first blood, when he got that script,

119
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.210
he's the one who said, because he was a homicidal maniac, the character.

120
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.130
And he said, he said, this isn't going to work. He's got to be a killer.

121
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.310
But specifically you can't just kill everybody.

122
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:52.430
He's got to have a philosophy behind why he does this.

123
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.800
I love that movie. Yeah. That's that's young, angry,

124
00:06:57.801 --> 00:07:01.460
skinny faced alone. Ah, look at them. Cheeks son. He was 1 65,

125
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:03.260
I think when he made that. I believe it. Yeah.

126
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.710
Fascinating character in Hollywood. I mean,

127
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.280
you've never had a guy with the longevity that Sylvester's 45 years, 45.

128
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.130
He's still making action movies. He's 150,000 years old.

129
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.370
He's still making action movies. Yeah. Bill Burr was there.

130
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:22.940
He's been there the two times I've been there and bill, bill, bill,

131
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.740
bear went to the house. Yeah. He's he's there every time.

132
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.420
So good bill goes I'm I'm listen, I'm standing like a loser.

133
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.630
It Stallone it's Schwarzenegger. And I think, uh,

134
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.940
D uh Pachino and they're talking, it's my childhood. And I'm I kind of in,

135
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.840
I'm standing in that group sort of, and I'm like this and I,

136
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:46.760
I don't want to say anything. I want to say anything. Just so though, um, no.

137
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.380
With some of your esoteric knowledge so badly, so badly.

138
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.120
I w I was, I wasn't even listening. I was like, well, can I say, Hey,

139
00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.320
you guys ever read a Chomsky, Chomsky, whatever. Anyway,

140
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.850
look a loser. And Pillbra walks up behind me. Bill walks up here,

141
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.150
the new Rambo, just playing that most recent work I'm writing.

142
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.990
Joey Diaz said that this is Roadhouse on steroids. He was Joe Rogan.

143
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.830
Listen to me. It was movies. Amazing. He's want to see it.

144
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.660
It's it's Roadhouse on steroids. It's incredible. You'll love it. He goes,

145
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:25.040
get high to the gills. Look at this. Ooh,

146
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.960
boy, he's gonna kick. He beats all those guys off. Cause he does.

147
00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.160
That's a lot of guns to have to shut your, I don't know, bro. Shut your mouth.

148
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:38.060
I'm a fan, but still like he's, he's drawn available. Oh,

149
00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:42.020
it's a hundred percent realistic. you, man. You ain't even ask.

150
00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.360
What do you hate America? All I want to do is shoot an explosive.

151
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.240
Since he loved those communists. You were talking about dude. I swear.

152
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:51.710
I don't man. He booby traps. This house. everybody up, chopping them up.

153
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.120
Ah, dude, you draw first blood and he'll draw last blood.

154
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.540
He got real lean a few years back, like crazy lean.

155
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:06.060
He was playing this, uh, thing. He was playing a Hitman and uh,

156
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.110
it was actually a pretty good moving interesting movie. Like, uh,

157
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.590
like it didn't get enough credit. Like what was the bullet to the head?

158
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.910
That's it bullet to the bullet to the head was a pretty good action movie,

159
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.290
but oh. But look how lean he got? Oh, he got like,

160
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:27.330
like triathlete. Lean. Yeah. Not, well, no, CrossFitter CrossFit early.

161
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.820
I asked him if he had any injuries from all this,

162
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.920
he goes to his phone and showed me. He showed me a spine and all the operations.

163
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.760
I mean, he's been so it, bumps on my neck. Like Reagan's dying. Um,

164
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.430
I think it is, Hey, I'm watching this movie as soon as I get home. Of course,

165
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.640
who else is allowed to be that big in handsome dude? Only days of my mom.

166
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.830
My mom was the best looking man on the planet. I think. Yeah.

167
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:53.180
I think he is in this movie. We want to look like that. Yeah. But yeah, this,

168
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.850
this was not that long ago, but it was a good movie. Like a good solid,

169
00:09:56.851 --> 00:10:00.070
you know, action movie. Yeah. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. Look,

170
00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:02.640
I'm a Stallone fan. I've been watching that guy's movies forever.

171
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.100
But what I liked about this, it's a Walter Hill film too.

172
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.370
What I liked about this movie was, I mean, not just liked about it,

173
00:10:08.371 --> 00:10:12.360
but that Stallone got like super crazy lean. Yeah. Like he was, uh,

174
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.280
he looked into [inaudible] accounts Slater. There you go, buddy. Full stop.

175
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.100
Silver walks up to me right behind me. As I'm listening to these guys,

176
00:10:20.101 --> 00:10:23.160
trying to get him the car and he goes like this, he goes, Hey,

177
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.850
you've been here for an hour already. Get over it.

178
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.620
Just keep squawking.
