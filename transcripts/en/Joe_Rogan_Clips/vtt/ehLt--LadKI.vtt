00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I have to at least bring this up a little bit,</v>

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.620
to clarify a little bit what I did to John Dudley on the jujitsu

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:11.723
mats.

4
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.740
<v 1>You broke his nerve. See me what you did. Here's.</v>

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.260
<v 0>The only part that you're missing it missing a little bit. Right?</v>

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.320
So I'm giving him his wife, uh, like, uh,

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.400
like a digital private.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.900
<v 1>So you actually Andy's there Andy's there. Little dud was there.</v>

9
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:30.560
So it was getting.

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.690
<v 2>Worse. He broke his neck in front of his wife and his son.</v>

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.560
<v 0>So I'm just completely, you know, I'm chilling and like, Hey, this is this,</v>

12
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:39.170
this is that. And I'm not even,

13
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.690
I'm not even doing this in one weekend. Andy, John and me,

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.330
we did, we did archery,

15
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.630
which I had never done before then we did jujitsu,

16
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:53.420
which John had never done before. And then we went and got in the wind tunnel,

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.690
which John had never done before, you know? Cause Andy's like a sky,

18
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.470
God parachuting, blah, blah, blah. And so we did those three things.

19
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:03.320
It was kind of like a cool weekend. I mean, that's kind of an epic weekend.

20
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:08.000
Really? Let's be honest. So it's jujitsu time. So I'm like, okay,

21
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.700
cool. So I'm going over, Hey, this is the guard.

22
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:13.640
This is the mountain going over all the basic stuff. Um, uh, um,

23
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.230
I'm just giving the basic overall kind of concepts. So I get done with that,

24
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.210
you know, and I'm done, like I'm done. I I'm just done. I'm like, okay.

25
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.860
You know, great. It's good introduction. And then Dudley is like, well,

26
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:31.310
let's go a little bit. And I'm like, does the.

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.190
<v 2>Wrong language? I would've pulled them aside, come here. So, so, so he's like,</v>

28
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:35.120
let's go a little bit. And even.

29
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.310
<v 0>That, you know what? I'm totally cool with that. Of course he wasn't.</v>

30
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.650
I thought he wasn't meaning he wasn't, he wasn't thinking.

31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.380
<v 1>He was going to be there. Wasn't he he's he wants to experience.</v>

32
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.150
I shouldn't have even said, let's go a little, like.

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.250
<v 0>He was like, he was like, Hey, can we, can we try it? You know,</v>

34
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.430
something like that, just being cool. And I'm like, absolutely man, no problem.

35
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.140
So, so I laid down on the ground, right. And I'm like,

36
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.980
he says, well, what should I do? I go, you know, just attack me.

37
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.140
So I lay down on my back. I'm like, just attack me and guess what he did.

38
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.630
What'd he do? He freaking attacked me. He like came at me and Doug,

39
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.850
he's a big, strong athletic guy. He's six. What is he? Six. Five at least. Yeah.

40
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.690
So he come, he, he grabs it and I'm chilling, you know, I'm just like, okay,

41
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:21.230
cool. He comes at me. I think, I think he like grabbed me.

42
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.610
And so I kind of replaced guard and then I sweep him and um,

43
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.620
and saw mounted and all this is just pretty chill. And I put in a Z,

44
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:34.880
a Z kill choke. Right. Which I have a little Nokia's is choke. I have a little,

45
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.820
I have a little good technique for doing it, but no big deal.

46
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.870
So I put in these equal choke he's this is the thing that I really

47
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.720
wish I should have explained more because we hadn't rolled. I wasn't like, Hey,

48
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:50.240
when you start to feel like you gotta, you gotta tap out. Right.

49
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.900
He knew to tap out, but I kinda figured everyone knows how to tap out.

50
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.380
So I put the choking on him. Right? Well, he doesn't know what to do.

51
00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:01.300
So he he's grabbing me. He's pulling, he's squeezing me.

52
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.170
So he's on the bottom. I'm mounted. I've got these equal choking.

53
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440
And in order to defend himself in his own mind,

54
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.420
he's squeezing me into him, which the way I do my as equal choke,

55
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.480
it hurts. I mean, it compresses the choke even more.

56
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.330
<v 1>And so what are you doing specifically? Basically, I.</v>

57
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.960
<v 0>Put my hand,</v>

58
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.940
I make a fist and I put my fist in my sternum and then I grabbed the

59
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:27.940
form here and then arch my shoulder. So there's the neck right here.

60
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.500
It closes it. Right. So it's putting the fist into the fist into, right. It's a,

61
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.020
it's a trait, it's an air choke. It's gnarly.

62
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.470
And so I'm just doing this and you can see that hole and you shrug,

63
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.830
but as I'm doing this, he's panicking and pulling.

64
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.080
<v 1>Me into him. Oh Jesus. And.</v>

65
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.750
<v 0>He only did it for a second. And then he turned any taps out and I was like,</v>

66
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:50.860
yeah. You know, and I wasn't, I was just like, oh, you know, boom.

67
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.330
And then he taps. And then the rest of the stories, I guess,

68
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.670
I didn't know a lot about the rest of this day. I didn't know any.

69
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.470
<v 1>Of the rest of the story. Cause he didn't want to see.</v>

70
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.030
<v 0>Baby. Yeah. Fractured like his hyoid bone.</v>

71
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.250
And then it built calcium up around it.

72
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.050
So he calls up Andy one day and he goes, dude, I think I got throat cancer.

73
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.400
Is there something growing in my throat? And he goes to, the doctor,

74
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:17.470
gets an x-ray and he's like, Hey, did you do something to your neck?

75
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:19.750
Because there's a, there's a hairline fracture.

76
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:23.170
That's not now calcium deposit around it. And he's like, oh,

77
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:24.004
I know what happened.

78
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.840
So I guess in my defense,

79
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.760
why didn't.

80
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.890
<v 2>You just get him in like a head and arm toot or something?</v>

81
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.320
<v 0>It wasn't that it wasn't like a big deal.</v>

82
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.060
<v 1>It wasn't, it wasn't crazy. It wasn't crazy. It was just normal. It'd be like,</v>

83
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:41.410
if, if you grabbed.

84
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.420
<v 0>Somebody that showed up here was like, Hey, you know what, Hey,</v>

85
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:44.710
can you roll with me? He'd be like, oh cool.

86
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:46.780
And you put them in a kind of whatever presented itself.

87
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.460
Maybe you don't mock them. Maybe you'd.

88
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.130
<v 2>Do a commuter when you get used to doing certain types of chokes.</v>

89
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.070
And then you're doing it to someone who doesn't, especially that,

90
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:56.904
where you've got to fish.

91
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.870
<v 0>Yeah. And then neck and I w this is, I guess this is the only thing, uh,</v>

92
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.760
make no mistake about it. Even though I was just chilling. He was not,

93
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.220
he was going level seven, berserker mode, all be.

94
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.960
<v 2>He's such a good athlete. You know,</v>

95
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.920
about people that have never done jujitsu when they're doing it with someone

96
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.610
who's a black belt is they probably feel like they can just kind of go crazy and

97
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:24.510
you'll just absorb it and deal with it. And so they just try it.

98
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.100
Let's see what happens when I go crazy.

99
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.200
So now he holds us over my head know he broke his neck. Yeah. Oh, I.

100
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.610
<v 0>Know. I know. One day I'm like, I'm like, we're up in Montana. And I said,</v>

101
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:38.640
Hey man. He's like, he says, like, he was at my house. He's off.

102
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.910
Thanks for having us over. I go, bro, you, you know,

103
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:44.250
you taught me how to do this. You brought me up here. You take me hunting.

104
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:47.910
Like you're doing all this awesome stuff, man. I, you know, you're the man,

105
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.160
dude. I really appreciate it. He goes, yeah. And you know what you did for me?

106
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.070
I'm like what? And he goes, I broke my neck.

107
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.290
<v 2>It's awful, bro. It's all good now though, right? Oh yeah.</v>

108
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.780
It's not bothering him anymore. Oh, I don't know about that.

109
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.160
<v 1>I thought you meant it's all good between us. It's all good.</v>

110
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.760
[inaudible].

111
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.593
<v 2>And things about, you.</v>

112
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.620
<v 0>Know, he coughs, oh no. He coughs. Hopefully. I mean,</v>

113
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.040
I haven't talked to him about it. I don't like to bring it up a lot, but.

114
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.090
<v 2>So there's something in there that's with his throat making him cough.</v>

115
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.890
So they'd have to probably get in there and scrape it.

116
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.930
<v 0>So while we're hunting, he would be like,</v>

117
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.420
and then he'd look at me and I'm just thinking, oh, I'm such a,

118
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.120
such a horrible person. Oh no,
