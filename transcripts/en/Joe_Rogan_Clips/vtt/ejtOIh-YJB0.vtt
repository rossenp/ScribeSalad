WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, yeah. Anyway, go ahead. I just got wanderlust,</v>

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.900
huh? Yeah, I guess so. I mean.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.920
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.650
I guess so it was this a cool experience and once you get that taste of kind of

5
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:16.340
freedom, it's like a little bit hard to go back to a nine to five,

6
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:17.210
I guess I can.

7
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.160
<v 2>Only imagine. I can only imagine that feeling when you're 19 years old,</v>

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.730
you know, and to go back to a cubicle.

9
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.240
<v 1>Right, right. Something like that. Yeah. No torture.</v>

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.840
So we did some construction jobs in Virginia and then,

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.920
uh, and then, uh, you know,

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.030
I was a young guy trying to figure out how to live a meaningful life or

13
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:43.550
whatever, you know, what am I gonna do with my life? And, uh, did.

14
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.740
<v 2>You have thoughts? Did you have like an aspiration.</v>

15
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.810
<v 1>I guess, to provide some context? I was, I'm like follow a Christian path.</v>

16
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:55.460
So I was, uh, uh, that me always feels like I got to put some,

17
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.010
uh, caveats to that. Like it's like,

18
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.860
I understand for a lot of people that means shame.

19
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.910
I know you had like some mean nuns. Yeah. You heard that

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.520
one mean none in particular straighten me right out. I was like, all right. No,

21
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.740
that's I know it means a lot of things, a lot of people,

22
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:14.390
but for me it was always like,

23
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.370
it was interesting because it was summed up in like in the Bible, like,

24
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.160
uh, you know, love the Lord,

25
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.310
your God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself and God is

26
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:29.870
defined as love. And so that was kind of always the core focus for my mom.

27
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:32.930
You know, how I tried to decide what I was going to do in life.

28
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.590
And at the time I heard of a guy that was over in Russia,

29
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.530
building orphanages and needed help.

30
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.700
And so felt really strongly that, Hey, that was the right thing to do.

31
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.950
How did you know this? Uh,

32
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.700
so I have a brother that's adopted and when he grew up,

33
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.040
he wanted to find his biological mom and just tell her,

34
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.590
thanks for the chance at life or whatever.

35
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.210
And when he did it turns out she had another son who was going to go over there

36
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.770
and I met him and he told me about this guy. So, uh,

37
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.870
so I,

38
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.130
I basically felt it was the right thing to do and bought a ticket for a year,

39
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.870
you know, just the full years go over to Russia and, and I headed over there.

40
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:19.160
And that was kind of how the next chapter, I guess, started in life. Uh,

41
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.700
how old were you then? Probably 21 or something. Yeah, 21.

42
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.210
<v 2>So 21 don't know anybody over there. Don't know how to speak.</v>

43
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.290
<v 1>Russian. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was, uh, that was interesting. I, uh,</v>

44
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.730
tried to learn. Oh, absolutely. So this guy that I was,

45
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.710
it was building the orphanages, that American guy,

46
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.280
but I went over there and I didn't want to live in the American cause I wanted

47
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:44.180
to learn Russian. So he sent me to a neighboring village with, uh,

48
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.870
these two families. Both of them were like ex cons and you know,

49
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.130
I'd been spending a lot of time in Siberian prisons, but they changed, you know,

50
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.970
they were like super cool dudes. One guy was just covered in prison tattoos.

51
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.160
One of the funniest guys, I know, but he, uh, did drink a lot, you know,

52
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:04.360
they did. And those guys didn't cause they changed their ways, you know, prison.

53
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.970
So they, uh, they took me in like one of their own and uh,

54
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.300
and I spent the better part of that year with those guys learning the language.

55
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:13.390
And.

56
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.000
<v 2>How much did you know before you got there? How much running within.</v>

57
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.810
<v 1>Just the alphabet. Yeah. So it was, it was brutal. Yeah. I mean,</v>

58
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:21.730
I could make the sounds, cause I knew the alphabet,

59
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:25.960
but I didn't know what anything meant. So, so it was, yeah,

60
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.520
that was an interesting experience. Like just very isolating,

61
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.930
to be honest. But also it was a, I mean it was pretty cool, you know,

62
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.330
in hindsight. Yeah.

63
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.890
<v 2>So you could write things to people in that. What is that called Cyrillic?</v>

64
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.300
Is that what it's called? Right, right, right.

65
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.350
So you could write things in so you could read it as well. Yeah.

66
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.580
<v 1>Yeah. As I learned,</v>

67
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.890
of course I could pronounce out the words cause I could read it.

68
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:53.190
I didn't know what anything meant over time. I started to learn the, uh,

69
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.400
of course the guy lived to us with just taught me all the prisons laying and

70
00:03:56.401 --> 00:04:00.420
stuff. It was always sure. Yeah.

71
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.123
Great.

72
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.270
<v 2>Wow. So, um,</v>

73
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.190
that's a crazy thing to do to just go move there with no rush at all.

74
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.610
Did you buy a book on English to Russian? Yeah. I found.

75
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.280
<v 1>The best way. If you ever go to a different country now, no.</v>

76
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:20.880
Anything just have a notepad with you and throughout you'll start to like get

77
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:25.110
familiar with words as you live in there. And then at the end of the day, I,

78
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:27.870
you know, I'd write those words down. As I recognize them at the end of the day,

79
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:31.440
I would look up the definition and just five to 10 words a day,

80
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.520
just slowly learn. And, and by the end of the year, I was pretty,

81
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.210
you know, starting to get to where I could be comfortable.

82
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.340
<v 2>So go long conversation with people after.</v>

83
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.390
<v 1>Yeah, it was brutal. It was a long time to wait, but.</v>

84
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.020
<v 2>It seems like it would be harder than Spanish or French because you have to</v>

85
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:52.230
learn those crazy alphabet. It's so difficult. The alphabet.

86
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.060
<v 1>And the grammar so different. I, I, uh, I many times know anything about it.</v>

87
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.620
How has the grammar, you don't speak. Like if you want to say like, I love you,

88
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.770
you know, there's no, there's no form in the sentence.

89
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.740
Like you could say you love, I love you. You know,

90
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:10.320
you could throw the words in any direct in any order,

91
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.980
but the word actually changes based on its role in the sentence.

92
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.630
So when you're learning the language,

93
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:19.350
you just get all these words dumped on you and you have to like try to sort

94
00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:24.180
through, uh, you know, how it's formed. How.

95
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.280
<v 2>Would you say I love you in Russian? No.</v>

96
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.080
<v 1>You could say Yachty, be ALU blue or you blew out tibia or TBI. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.120
New blue. You know, there's like a, is there a.

98
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.430
<v 2>Reason why you'd say it in different ways? I think you could.</v>

99
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.970
<v 1>Emphasize make different it's it is a flexible language and that yeah.</v>

100
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:42.240
You could switch it up to emphasize certain aspects.

101
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.940
<v 2>Vigorous. Like would people be like, are you sure?</v>

102
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.550
<v 1>No, no. I think it works pretty good.</v>

103
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.310
Well, that's not a phrase. I got a lot of practice with what else?

104
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.530
<v 2>So when you were up there and these folks have these,</v>

105
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:04.430
a caribou and they're riding them and they're taking care of them,

106
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.500
do they shield the other caribou from seeing one of them get

107
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:10.334
slaughtered?

108
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.540
<v 1>No, they don't seem to be too worried about it. Like, uh,</v>

109
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.440
there's it's a very like mutually,

110
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.710
it's a symbiotic relationship with the reindeer and the reindeer.

111
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.130
They're always getting attacked by wolves and tore up and stuff.

112
00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:27.970
And they always are coming to the people for protection in those times,

113
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.540
not only from wolves, but even from like mosquitoes and gnats, you know,

114
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:33.190
they'll block big smoky fires.

115
00:06:33.191 --> 00:06:36.490
So the reindeer know people are their friends and I guess, uh,

116
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.500
sort of are okay with an occasional indicational sacrifice.

117
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.340
So.

118
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.370
<v 2>If they have 200 of them, how often do they kill one? They.</v>

119
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.450
<v 1>Try not to kill them.</v>

120
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:48.790
Like they actually really avoid trying to kill their own reindeer.

121
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:53.260
It's that you're mostly living off of, you know, moose and uh,

122
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.210
wild reindeer and oh, game birds and stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

123
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.720
<v 2>Okay. So because these are domesticated, they, they just behaved.</v>

124
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.850
They're really, it's so weird to see them like with sex.

125
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.750
<v 1>Yeah. They're uh, almost they've been,</v>

126
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.950
they were one of the first animals to be domesticated actually. Interesting.

127
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:14.350
Yeah. This is interesting. So they, before dogs, not before,

128
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.580
but one of the first I guess. Yeah. And then they, uh,

129
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.240
and they've been domesticated so long that they don't even know how to

130
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:25.030
domesticate wild ones anymore. So this.

131
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.930
<v 2>Is crazy, Jay, Jamie, go back to that. Let me see how they put up these TPCP.</v>

132
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.790
So is this, uh, there, they have this set up ready to go. Yeah.

133
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.340
And then when they get to a place and they decide to,

134
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.630
then they pull out the sticks.

135
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.011
<v 1>In the summer,</v>

136
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:42.610
you're moving every three days or so just following the reindeer herd through

137
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:46.690
the forest, you know, in the winter, they everything's a little slower,

138
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:51.070
you'll be in a place for a month or so, but just yeah, no mat nomads.

139
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.640
<v 2>And what is it doing? The weather sucks. Like they have this, this T tea.</v>

140
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.620
<v 1>Is out, you know, it's, you're just out in the weather also basically when it's,</v>

141
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:02.020
when it's really cold, negative 50, you know,

142
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:04.990
like they have a little wood stove in the, in the,

143
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.840
in the teepee and it was this thing pretty.

144
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.190
<v 2>Warm. It actually is the wind because the way they have these sticks set up,</v>

145
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.670
it's like they have these animals, skins that go over is that animal skin.

146
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.760
<v 1>That's canvas. But that is, yeah.</v>

147
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.350
<v 2>So it's, it just looks like it's the skin. So they have these canvas.</v>

148
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.370
Do they have loops where they tie it.

149
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.810
<v 1>Down? Yeah, they do.</v>

150
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.920
And then they put the lean sticks on the outside also to kind of hold the,

151
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.410
the a canvas in place. But nomadic.

152
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.890
Yeah, it is very nomadic and it's man. It's awesome though.

153
00:08:38.891 --> 00:08:43.000
It's so fascinating to live like that and compare it to the modern world. Like,

154
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.720
because not too many people get the opportunity anymore and it's, uh,

155
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.140
you're so wired for it. It's weird, you know? Like,

156
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.310
so your body just falls into place for it. Yeah. Your,

157
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.430
all your dopamine reset, you know,

158
00:08:56.431 --> 00:08:58.950
like you'll be out there fishing and every day you'll just be like,

159
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.490
you got a fish, you know? Cause you're relying on it so much. And uh,

160
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.240
whereas like in normal, everyday life here in town and stuff,

161
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.630
when you get that excited, you know, like you're always, uh,

162
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.750
you don't have any schedule. So every day you wake up, it's like, well,

163
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:16.290
what do I need to do today? And you can kind of, you're just free to choose.

164
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:18.900
You know, you can go try hunting, you can go collect berries,

165
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:21.630
you go find your reindeer and you know,

166
00:09:21.631 --> 00:09:25.710
like there's just a number of options, all available to you.

167
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:30.270
And uh, they're all directly related to your life. So you don't have any,

168
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.650
you know, there's no money being thrown around out there. It's this kind of,

169
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.420
I'm hungry. Let's go fishing. Let's go to that spot. Cause it's cool. You know,

170
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:43.230
what do they do if they get injured, that's a problem. They actually have.

171
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.310
There's good and bad out there. And it just can, they, uh, uh,

172
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:54.180
they can call in a helicopter, but it's so far out, you know,

173
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.171
it's going to be a problem.

174
00:09:55.171 --> 00:10:00.030
I've broken some ribs out there and had some myself had some serious injuries

175
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:03.120
that just wasn't an option. You know, you just got to tough it out.

176
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:07.320
Cause there's like, what's the refrigerator other than ribs, bro. Oh man.

177
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.660
The high chop,

178
00:10:09.661 --> 00:10:13.950
my knee with an act one time with cut a tendon that tendon on the inside of your

179
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:16.200
knee right in half. And the, uh,

180
00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.020
my other knee had recently had a knee surgery.

181
00:10:19.021 --> 00:10:21.840
So I was just laid up literally like three days,

182
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:26.220
I was just laying in a TB couldn't move. I had to roll over poop in a bag.

183
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.930
It was brutal. But then, you know,

184
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.370
they rubbed like pine SAP on it and it actually healed. And uh, really, yeah.

185
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.620
I've I've could have swore it would get infected,

186
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:40.770
but they were just packed it with pine SAP and yeah.

187
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.170
So a little dried up pretty fast.

188
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.450
<v 2>What happened to the ligament or? I don't know.</v>

189
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.730
<v 1>It doesn't really feel it as bothering me,</v>

190
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.700
but I didn't know it was cut at the time. It was only later when I did the MRI.

191
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:56.640
Yeah. They told me it was, but it was healed. Well, I don't know what it did.

192
00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:58.260
They said it was hanging on by a thread.

193
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:00.240
I don't know if it ever healed back or what.

194
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.490
<v 2>But I don't even care. You know? I don't, I.</v>

195
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.550
<v 1>Don't notice it. Yeah. As being weak.</v>

196
00:11:04.551 --> 00:11:09.020
So bothered my surgery knee hurts more than that knee.

197
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:13.130
So what kind of surgery? I see a couple of ACL's. Yeah. You know how it is.

198
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.700
Yeah, I.

199
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:17.630
<v 2>Do. So w when you, one of those videos was showing a net,</v>

200
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.790
is that the way they would fish? They.

201
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:21.560
<v 1>Would do both. Yeah.</v>

202
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.430
A lot of times you put nets out and a lot of times you'd just go cast your

203
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.090
Birch, you know, homemade rod and just.

204
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.730
<v 2>Yeah, this is, um, this is a net.</v>

205
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.190
They would just move it across the middle of the river.

206
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.700
<v 1>And set it and leave it there. Just trying there's a set in it right now.</v>

207
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.480
And then how do they.

208
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.260
<v 2>Do that thing that they do on the ice? When they do that, when.</v>

209
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.540
<v 1>It's frozen, when it's frozen, when they cut a hole.</v>

210
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:48.350
<v 2>And then they somehow, or another, get that net to go through.</v>

211
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.530
<v 1>To cut a hole, you cut two holes, and then, uh,</v>

212
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:56.770
you get a long stick and you shove it in the hole and slide then like

213
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.360
push the stick under the ice. And on one end, you have a string tied to it.

214
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:05.110
So you push it and keep trying that until you get it to slide under the ice to

215
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:07.000
the other hole. And when you do,

216
00:12:07.001 --> 00:12:11.230
you pull the stick out of that hole and tie your net on the end of the other

217
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:12.350
one, and you can pull.

218
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:15.900
<v 2>So on the string string on the end of the stick,</v>

219
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.270
do you catch it with a hook or something and try to pull it.

220
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.730
<v 1>Up? Okay, let me see if I can. Yeah, no, you just, uh,</v>

221
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.810
you pull the actual stick up through with the string tied on the back side of

222
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:28.710
it. So yeah, you just got to get the stick to,

223
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.340
you might have to three or four times slide it under the ice until it ends up

224
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:36.930
where the other hole is. Yeah. It works good. I did it on that alone show.

225
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.080
It was fun. Yeah. That's why I'm asking. Yeah. Yeah. And.

226
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.650
<v 2>So that must be really hard to do by yourself because I've seen people do it on</v>

227
00:12:43.651 --> 00:12:47.640
television, on those survival. Yeah. Oh, right.

228
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:51.720
<v 1>It wasn't too bad. No, it was, uh, that part wasn't too hard,</v>

229
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.380
but, uh, no. Yeah. I don't know.

230
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:59.580
It was all good stuff to learn out there with the natives and then came in handy.

231
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.040
<v 2>For sure. Have you ever seen the Werner Herzog documentary?</v>

232
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.990
<v 1>That's all the native that I actually first met that I was telling you about</v>

233
00:13:06.991 --> 00:13:11.340
that you're a guy, he, uh, isn't a nomad himself. He's a fur trapper.

234
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:16.140
So he does all that real similar to that Werner Herzog documentary,

235
00:13:16.141 --> 00:13:18.000
and actually, uh,

236
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.710
where they filmed that isn't that far from where I was in Siberia. So he one,

237
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:22.921
yeah,

238
00:13:22.921 --> 00:13:27.750
I went for a trapping and with him one year and it was kind of showed me the

239
00:13:27.751 --> 00:13:31.110
rough ropes on a, you know, he told, showed me a topographical map. He's like,

240
00:13:31.111 --> 00:13:34.230
there's a cabin, there's a cabin, there's a cabin, uh,

241
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.110
through some noodles and each of my cabins, you know,

242
00:13:37.111 --> 00:13:40.650
we stocked them with noodles and then he just dropped me off and said,

243
00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.450
see you in a month and a half or whatever.

244
00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:47.220
And so just was out there and I had a stupid little other

245
00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:51.630
wrestling go. Yeah, good times. This kids wrestle a lot. Yeah.

246
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.850
It's a good way to grow up, man. Always just outside, having a good time. Yeah,

247
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.743
I guess so.

248
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.060
<v 2>The Werner Herzog documentary was really fascinating because as you watch those</v>

249
00:14:03.061 --> 00:14:08.040
people and when they talk about like no depression

250
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.150
or they're all happy, they're always laughing. They love what they do.

251
00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:16.560
They enjoy what they do. But even though that's like, everybody's goal, right.

252
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:17.100
Everybody's.

253
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.790
<v 1>Goal is happy. Right, right. Everybody's like, that. I'm not doing that. Yeah.</v>

254
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:26.160
That's a fascinating conversation in of itself because I, you know,

255
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:28.260
having been up there and stuff, I'm just like, man,

256
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:29.640
this is an awesome way to live.

257
00:14:29.641 --> 00:14:33.180
If it was like my friends and my family in that context, it's like,

258
00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:37.770
I would probably choose that way of life. But you know,

259
00:14:37.771 --> 00:14:40.980
then you find yourself here in America and you're stuck on your phone. And,

260
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:45.660
and it's just so unsatisfying that it's, it's interesting to experience both,

261
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:50.220
but it's kind of hard to, uh, I mean, I mean,

262
00:14:50.221 --> 00:14:53.240
cause you're in where you, so my family's all here. Everybody's all here.

263
00:14:53.241 --> 00:14:55.250
We're not nomads, you know? Right.

264
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.730
But it's funny to have experienced that way of life and almost think, man,

265
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:01.100
that's kind of what we're made for. It's almost better. I wish,

266
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.350
I wish I could implement that in some way. You know, here.

267
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.150
<v 2>I'm aware of that because people say it, but I'm not aware of it in the sense.</v>

268
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.250
<v 1>That I've experienced before. I've never.</v>

269
00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.980
<v 2>Experienced like just completely living I've hunted. Right.</v>

270
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:16.630
I've camped out for a week. A time.

271
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.840
<v 1>Yeah. You start to get a feel for it. Maybe, maybe not.</v>

272
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.700
It seems like when there's no other option, like that's how you're eating.

273
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.940
We were eating mountain house. And when we.

274
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.040
<v 2>Shot a deer, then we'd eat the deer. Right?</v>

275
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.810
<v 1>Yeah, no, I, you were speaking of which, um,</v>

276
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.730
you've read those like Quanah Parker and stuff of movies, books and stuff. Uh,

277
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.370
me too. And now having lived with those natives, it's like,

278
00:15:42.371 --> 00:15:45.460
there's so much good there. You see like, uh,

279
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.020
they really are happy people. So there's a giant, um,

280
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.590
difference between the people who live in the village and the people who live in

281
00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:56.140
the forest and the people who live in the forest,

282
00:15:56.141 --> 00:16:00.520
you would genuinely call like happy people. Like this is they're knowledgeable,

283
00:16:00.521 --> 00:16:02.320
they're being productive. They're doing all this stuff.

284
00:16:02.321 --> 00:16:05.410
Whereas when you go to the village, it's just like, everybody's drunk,

285
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.290
nobody's doing anything. It's like just a total wreck,

286
00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.490
especially villages that don't have any rain you're hurting connected to them.

287
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:17.260
Cause they kind of don't have their cultural context to, uh,

288
00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:22.120
remain connected to. So the, uh, so at least in the villages that have rained,

289
00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:22.511
you're hurting,

290
00:16:22.511 --> 00:16:25.990
the kids can go out in the summer and live with the reindeer herders and kind of

291
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.370
experience that. And it gives them a source of pride. It gives them like,

292
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.820
uh, the experience of living in the forest becoming like kind of really

293
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.570
in touch with nature and all that. And whereas in the village,

294
00:16:40.571 --> 00:16:44.740
it's just kind of a dark hole. Everybody drinks the, in those native villages,

295
00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:48.850
it's like the statistic is that one out of three people die of suicide,

296
00:16:48.851 --> 00:16:52.300
homicide or accident. So it's just, and you feel it like,

297
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.830
I've got some stories of that. That's just brutal too. But the, uh, the.

298
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.800
<v 2>Now you were saying that these people that live in the villages outside of the,</v>

299
00:17:01.801 --> 00:17:03.100
the people that are nomadic,

300
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:07.150
those people live in a real way.

301
00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:12.850
<v 1>It's like, there's a, it's like unconnected to any other villages.</v>

302
00:17:12.851 --> 00:17:16.030
You have to only get there by helicopter. You fly in and it's, what.

303
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.510
<v 2>Are they, what is their, their job? Like what do they do? Some of them.</v>

304
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.810
<v 1>Like in relation to the reindeer herds. And I don't know.</v>

305
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.590
I think a lot of people live off of like grandma's pension, which, you know,

306
00:17:26.591 --> 00:17:31.330
in Russia is probably like a hundred bucks or something, you know? And, uh,

307
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.180
you know, some people work at the school and the administration,

308
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:38.260
it's just not a lot going on, but a lot of people are sustenance, like hunters,

309
00:17:38.261 --> 00:17:43.030
fishers, and trappers that live in the village. But yeah, it's, it's,

310
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.030
it's so weird. Cause the first time I went there, it was just like, man,

311
00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:50.130
this place is crazy. Everybody's drunk. And just like being in a zombie land,

312
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.380
like even when the reindeer herders will come from the woods,

313
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.050
they'll like run into their house, locked the doors, shut everything up.

314
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:59.430
And then you'll just see everybody like marching over to cars and then they'll

315
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:01.680
start banging on the doors and the windows and the,

316
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.950
and the guys inside the house get out of here. You know, I can just, just,

317
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:10.500
just drunks, just, it's just insanity, like, but it's, and it's weird.

318
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.590
Cause then you take the same people go into the woods,

319
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.060
they sober up and it's just night and day. It's so weird. And then, uh,

320
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.610
yeah, it's by the, you see the effects of it. So like I was telling you earlier,

321
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:28.320
it was pretty brutal. Uh, I, when I first went to the,

322
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:31.080
over there, there was like a little F you know, a nice family.

323
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:36.060
It was like Dasha and R Jones. You know, these and their two little kids. Well,

324
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.360
the first time I was there, I got back, uh,

325
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.640
or I met the family, you know,

326
00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:43.530
I lived with them in their TP and all this and that.

327
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.310
And then I went back to America. Sure enough. Right after I left a tree,

328
00:18:47.311 --> 00:18:50.670
fell on their daughter, out in the woods and killed her.

329
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.690
And then they, after that, got, you know,

330
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.580
started drinking a bunch, quit.

331
00:18:56.581 --> 00:18:59.580
The nomadic way of life started living in the village. Uh,

332
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.270
I went back over there, the girl or the, uh,

333
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:08.580
the guy got stabbed in some drunken brawl or whatever, and was in the,

334
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:11.700
in the hospital, uh, slowly recovered.

335
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:13.860
He had this big old gash with a piece of glass.

336
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:17.850
Someone had cut him open with he slowly recovered and then went back to his

337
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:21.270
village. The drinking continued sure enough. They killed him.

338
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:26.130
They took his body to back to the morgue, which the, uh,

339
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.200
uh, the freezers had broken. Right. So it's in the middle of the summer,

340
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.720
this bodies there, but it was a murder.

341
00:19:33.721 --> 00:19:36.810
So they had to wait for the police to come and investigate,

342
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.190
but it's way out in the middle of nowhere.

343
00:19:38.191 --> 00:19:41.370
So it took like a week and it's like a week later,

344
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.410
it was just brutal.

345
00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:48.000
Go over there had to pick up this guy who was your buddy?

346
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:52.350
And his wife is helping me like dress this body. Cause they're basically like,

347
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.520
okay, we're done with the investigation. You can go bury him. Composing. Yeah.

348
00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.660
Is crucial. I mean, and the wife is helping you. Yeah. And the wives helping,

349
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.760
we like took care of his body,

350
00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:07.290
like pick them up and like skin slips off and all that stuff. And then,

351
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.350
uh, take care of, you know, we took care of him, buried it and buried him.

352
00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:17.250
It was pretty rough. But then a year later I come back,

353
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.220
she had gotten remarried, you know, kind of starting her life. Again.

354
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.200
It turns out he hangs himself not long afterwards. So again, it's,

355
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:30.030
this woman has lost two husbands and her daughter, she just her and her son,

356
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.110
I just found out a little while ago, she got too drunk,

357
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:36.210
passed out in the snow and died.

358
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.390
So now it's just the one son left from this whole family.

359
00:20:39.391 --> 00:20:44.100
And you hear those stories often up there, it's like really rough,

360
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.640
you know, but that's balanced with what is, could be so beautiful.

361
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:52.630
It's like such a juxtaposition because you're out in this life where you have

362
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:55.030
like, people are happy, you know,

363
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:59.560
ultimate freedom and they're doing great, but when they,

364
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:04.360
but the village and the alcohol just does this whole other thing to them.

365
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:08.530
And it's like, these people who are so beautiful, so nice, so friendly,

366
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:12.310
you know, so open to you. Uh,

367
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.480
but you just see them suffering so much from this scourge. It's like, man,

368
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.390
it's brutal. It's crazy.

369
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.630
<v 2>That the scourge doesn't extend to the people that live in the forest.</v>

370
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:23.760
<v 1>Yeah. Once they get out in the woods, you know,</v>

371
00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:27.240
they don't have the alcohol available and they don't. But even if.

372
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.520
<v 2>They did, do you think they would drink it? It seems like, yeah.</v>

373
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.340
<v 1>They usually drink it. You know, like when they go to the village,</v>

374
00:21:32.341 --> 00:21:35.550
they get it and then they'll take off to the woods and they'll drink for a few

375
00:21:35.551 --> 00:21:38.460
days until it's all gone. And then it's also back to normal,

376
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:41.190
but it's back to normal. I think it's a genetic thing. Or did they have,

377
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:44.070
that's been a good question. I've thought about that. You know, there's that,

378
00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.790
there's that hypothesis like that maybe it is because people have been

379
00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:52.170
introduced to alcohol more recently that they're, they're not, uh, you know,

380
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.560
can't process it as well, but that was the thing. It could also, there,

381
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.330
you could also have the explanation.

382
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.990
It's probably a combination of both that when you do like have, uh,

383
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.430
people that are largely stripped of their culture and they're like, you know,

384
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.730
cause even the Ivanka is cool as their way of life is, you know, they had,

385
00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.561
you know,

386
00:22:10.561 --> 00:22:14.430
70 years of communism where they came in and they collected all the best

387
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:19.500
reindeer herders and said that they were like, uh, cool locks or what, you know,

388
00:22:19.501 --> 00:22:20.490
like the boars Schwab,

389
00:22:20.491 --> 00:22:23.010
because they have too many reindeer sent them all to prison, you know,

390
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:26.850
like collectivized, all these reindeer herds, these family herds,

391
00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:30.000
they turned into like government herds. So it's been like,

392
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.530
their culture is not completely intact. Uh, and it's like, well,

393
00:22:34.531 --> 00:22:37.470
there might be enough because just from that kind of thing,

394
00:22:37.471 --> 00:22:40.920
to explain some of the alcoholism,

395
00:22:40.921 --> 00:22:42.990
but I imagine it's a combination of both, you know.

396
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.540
<v 2>I've always wondered that about the native Americans,</v>

397
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.160
the same sort of situation, right?

398
00:22:47.161 --> 00:22:52.020
Like how much of it is despair for them being removed from their normal nomadic

399
00:22:52.021 --> 00:22:53.270
way of life. Right.

400
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.840
How much of it is just the fact that they don't have the genes to

401
00:22:57.841 --> 00:23:01.200
process alcohol because they didn't evolve with alcohol. You know,

402
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.710
there's that story of Cynthia Ann Parker was on the wall out there.

403
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.600
It was a quantum Parker's mother and she was kidnapped by the command. She,

404
00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:14.190
when she was nine and then recaptured by the Texas Rangers,

405
00:23:14.191 --> 00:23:18.600
I think it was the Texas Rangers when she was like 30 with a

406
00:23:18.601 --> 00:23:21.900
child. And she was begging to go back to the Comanches.

407
00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:23.490
She did not want to live.

408
00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:28.140
And she found a way of living that the settlers had was just pathetic.

409
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.503
<v 1>You know, they.</v>

410
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.171
<v 2>The command,</v>

411
00:23:31.171 --> 00:23:34.920
she lived in a world where everything was magic and like the sky was a God,

412
00:23:34.921 --> 00:23:38.700
the wind worshiped nature, you lived off the land,

413
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.490
followed the Buffalo herd. And then all of a sudden you're.

414
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:44.340
<v 1>In a village up in a house and you got it. Yeah.</v>

415
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.220
<v 2>Exactly. Jesus on you. You're like.</v>

416
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.090
<v 1>Man, it's the same, same thing over there. It's like, right.</v>

417
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:54.350
It's this juxtaposition of ultimate freedom in this beautiful way of life versus

418
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:56.780
like you're in the village, in this little house, you know,

419
00:23:56.781 --> 00:23:58.340
these people are never going to be good,

420
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:02.960
like in Russian society because they live in some remote village, no internet,

421
00:24:02.961 --> 00:24:04.910
nothing, you know, like, and then,

422
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:08.870
but they're also the ones that aren't connected to their way of life are also

423
00:24:08.871 --> 00:24:12.620
not going to be great Vinky because they've just lived in this little house and

424
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:14.000
drink a bunch. So

425
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.580
if people get caught in that weird in-between place.

426
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.420
<v 2>It seems like even if it's not cultural, there's some,</v>

427
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.460
there's some thing that draws people to that way of life when they

428
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:29.770
live like that. It's very satisfying.

429
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.880
<v 1>Absolutely. Uh, from my own experience, like, yeah, I'm not a native, you know,</v>

430
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.230
but, but I lived with them and it was awesome and it like spoke to me deeply,

431
00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.710
same thing, even on, you know, things like the alone show. It's like, oh man,

432
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.300
this is what we're built for. You know, like you really feel it it's, it's, uh,

433
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:48.370
you know, an interesting thing,

434
00:24:48.371 --> 00:24:52.300
like I don't have like a great memory or, you know,

435
00:24:52.301 --> 00:24:56.230
I don't usually have good, very vivid or interesting dreams,

436
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.930
but when I'm in the forest, you know,

437
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.740
it's like I have all these vivid dreams that seem really meaningful and

438
00:25:02.741 --> 00:25:05.470
powerful. It's like my memory's way better.

439
00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:09.070
I remember people that I long forgotten just because you go so long without

440
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.170
distraction, you can really delve into your thoughts and, uh, yeah,

441
00:25:14.171 --> 00:25:18.700
it's a fascinating thing to experience. And once you do, you kind of realize,

442
00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:19.661
you know,

443
00:25:19.661 --> 00:25:23.470
what's missing and it was interesting listening to you talk to like Elon Musk

444
00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:27.550
and as the, you know, inevitable March of progress moves forward,

445
00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:31.270
it's like we kind of lose things, but we don't actually know what we're losing,

446
00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.610
you know? And so, uh,

447
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.000
as far as like the natives and like one of the reasons I want to see them

448
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:42.130
preserve their cultural culture and their old ways and take it forward is just

449
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:47.020
as kind of a, a memory receptacle so that as things move forward,

450
00:25:47.021 --> 00:25:51.790
we can still connect, you know, with, with what we've lost. Cause it is.
