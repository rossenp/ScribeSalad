00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.853
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.490
<v 1>To have you, have you ever been to Teotihuacan?</v>

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.410
<v 0>No, I've never been there. I heard it's amazing.</v>

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 1>No, if something really interesting happened to me there now, when I,</v>

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.200
that not only is this square that we want to stand on this earth

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:20.580
mound and this guy who his nickname was gorilla giving us this wonderful tour,

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.980
just to spot the most romantic tour ever of this place for such a

8
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:29.880
rough place. And he goes, wait right here. And we're in this giant square.

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.950
And he runs down this dirt mound about, I don't know, say 150 feet away,

10
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.610
200 feet away. And he goes, can you hear me? And it was like, oh my God,

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.230
I could hear him. He goes,

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.090
this square was built with these mountains here to be able to speak at this

13
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:49.500
voice to 250,000 people. Whoa. And I was like, what?

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.200
And then we walk up there. Yes, that's great. Well it's okay. That way.

15
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.034
And then go left.

16
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.200
<v 0>You could look this way so you don't have to look backwards. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.410
<v 1>It's over here. So, so if we were to see that square,</v>

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.690
if we were to go straight around that pyramid and make a left,

19
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.280
that's where those mountains are. And, and the, the other thing is,

20
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.670
and these that's the same shot from a different angle.

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.160
That's near where these hype, these shaman lift, the Straumann had quarters,

22
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:23.670
like an area of this place. And there was this there's these, um,

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.960
sort of things. And I said, what are these? And he said, their reflection ponds.

24
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.390
I said, oh, like for like reflecting. And he goes, no,

25
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:34.500
no for reflecting. And I'd never considered that.

26
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:35.820
You don't look at the stars by going,

27
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.470
but that really you look down and you mark.

28
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.800
So in seven years when it comes around again, you're like, oh, pattern.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.520
Cause I'm always like, how do you look up and learn a pattern of that? Right,

30
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:49.320
right, right. But by looking down.

31
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.031
<v 0>Oh, that's crazy.</v>

32
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:55.890
So they had ponds just to look at the reflection of the stars and map them out.

33
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.120
<v 1>Yeah. The shaman did, that was like in their neighborhood. And if you,</v>

34
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.550
the way we're showing is if you had a birthmark on your head,

35
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:03.384
when you were born,

36
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.800
they immediately were like two boards rope and just put two boards and rope two

37
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.640
and began a lifetime of, of like, so you're a shaman,

38
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.170
which if you had a lifetime of that, you'd be like, hi, shaman shot. Hey Sean.

39
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.030
I mean, it's so it's like being born a Royal,

40
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.990
always the Sharman don't squeeze the show even more weird. Right. Because.

41
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.740
<v 0>You don't have a history or a bloodline of.</v>

42
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.640
<v 1>It. It's just, it's the study of what we are. And that,</v>

43
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:31.260
that is significant because I felt, it felt to me immediate like, well,

44
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:34.770
everyone can't do that. We need, you know, you don't have a thing on you.

45
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.300
So if you don't have the birthmark. Yeah. I mean, that's a really good, like,

46
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.930
uh, entry. Do you know at the gate when you went.

47
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.350
<v 0>So that th th that the Aztec temple as a musician, when you're sitting there,</v>

48
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:49.140
did you like, did it make sense? Like the acoustics,

49
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:52.560
like the way it's set up the, the, the way the sound works,

50
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.450
does it make sense to you? Like a real construct?

51
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.490
<v 1>It, um, it,</v>

52
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.850
it left a very lasting feeling of

53
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.760
that we're supposed to be here and that, um,

54
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.950
you know, it just, it really restored a lot of faith in humanity. I,

55
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:15.040
I didn't focus on the ritualistic murder that was going on there.

56
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.910
It was just the CR that's, the one set of people.

57
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.090
The other set of people built this, and they knew, and they knew,

58
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.790
and you know, much like the great pyramids that are really,

59
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.090
you know, in the shape of a Ryan's belt. Exactly.

60
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.980
That same concept of like, what's going on here matters. And if,

61
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.210
if that is your focus, think of how wonderful it can be. You know? Like,

62
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.830
how did those people know how to make that with no, without, you know,

63
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.610
they say without the wheel, that'd be like, really helpful.

64
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.200
<v 0>Seems insane. Yeah. The Aztecs didn't have the wheel. Right. Allegedly.</v>

65
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.410
Yeah. How the did they do all that? Well,

66
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:00.610
at least the way they did it physically, you can kind of like, they,

67
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.360
we know that they,

68
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.800
they murdered 80,000 slaves in a period of just a few days

69
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.810
after the construction of that temple.

70
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.010
<v 1>Yeah. So it was like, don't tell me, actually, don't worry about it.</v>

71
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.323
I'll take care of it.

72
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.760
<v 0>It's like say that they were going to be slaughtered.</v>

73
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:17.710
I think it was kind of like part of the gig.

74
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.353
<v 1>Yeah. Well.</v>

75
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.100
<v 0>Maybe I'm wrong. I might be wrong about that.</v>

76
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.060
<v 1>Well, I, I, it, it doesn't with that many people.</v>

77
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:29.290
It wouldn't sound surprising that you'd have some cooperation. I mean,

78
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.680
it's hard to imagine 80,000 people at once going, sorry, what?

79
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.110
And not being like, well, this man. Yeah.

80
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.560
That sounds like a cooperative event to me somehow, unless they were.

81
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.080
<v 0>Somehow or another locked up and they brought them out one by one.</v>

82
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.320
<v 1>That's an awfully big cage you've got there. Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.440
<v 0>It isn't. Yeah. 80,000. That's quite an arena. Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.410
<v 1>Yeah. They could have to build an extra one of those just to hold them.</v>

85
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.730
<v 0>You've got a giant football arena filled with.</v>

86
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.180
<v 1>That big it's that big. And, and, um,</v>

87
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.150
that what struck me as just the, because I play music as I thought,

88
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.040
okay. That means these acoustics are so perfect. Like who,

89
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.610
how do you discover that? Are you in a canyon? And you're like, wow,

90
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:14.830
this sounds, can you hear me over there?

91
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.840
And then you sort of triangulate and start doing the

92
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:23.410
geometry for how that works and like, oh, quick someone in veggie on,

93
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:26.890
but geometry first though. Cause I don't know it's. I mean, how does that

94
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.460
manifest itself? That understanding.

95
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.280
<v 0>How many thousands of years did it take before they figured out how to.</v>

96
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.530
<v 1>Construct something or someone on their death bed. It's like, wait,</v>

97
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.120
one last thing, I kind of thought.

98
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.060
<v 0>Acoustic sound kind of bounces off. That's.</v>

99
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.810
<v 1>Gotta be shaped like this, but the Pythagorean theorem, you know.</v>

100
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.300
<v 0>I've never been to any of the Aztec temples,</v>

101
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.420
but I went to a Cheech Anita and saw some of the Mayan temples.

102
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.200
And it just they're there whenever you were at a place like that,

103
00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.890
that's just magical. That's so old.

104
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:59.690
And amazingly constructed, you just think,

105
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.420
what the was it like to live back then? Like,

106
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.250
do we have a terrible idea of what they were like, like, course we don't know.

107
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.270
<v 1>Well, but it sort of dawned on me at some point that it was like, oh,</v>

108
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.320
you mean the people that wrote our history wrote it as, from the perspective of,

109
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.220
by the way, we're way better, way better, but okay.

110
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:21.320
Here's the story of these other people. Right.

111
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.800
You know what I mean by it by some kind of winner. Right.

112
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.200
<v 0>Right, right. A Dick head winner with guns. Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.000
<v 1>Like before we get started,</v>

114
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.160
I'm better than the person I'm going to tell you about.

115
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.160
<v 0>We can't, even though we can't do what they did, because what.</v>

116
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.920
<v 1>Is the emotion when you, when you're in that space, I'm trying,</v>

117
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.930
I'm trying to think of the right word to describe how I felt there. Right.

118
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.510
And I guess, all right. Yeah. It's it really is. It is art, but also there's a,

119
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:50.060
there's almost yeah. Reverence and there's almost like, uh,

120
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.750
some strange gratitude. Yeah. Like where you're like,

121
00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:57.320
thank you for I'm so thankful to be part of this.

122
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:02.180
Even just by living in the time to appreciate this. Yeah.

123
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.580
It feels it's. So, um,

124
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.380
it feels like knowledge expanding that I don't have. So I just feel like, oh,

125
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.380
if I can have a piece of that, if I can understand a piece of that,

126
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.380
but just standing there as sort of understanding it, right.

127
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.590
<v 0>We have such an egotistical perspective when it comes to our personal</v>

128
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:22.910
civilization that we let like this with the internet and with cars and with

129
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.010
planes and all that, this is the best way to do it.

130
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.120
<v 1>There's a word for it. I can't w R can you try to find such a thing</v>

131
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.800
please? Um, what is the word?

132
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:38.540
I know there's a word for the word definition is to believe that the

133
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.340
era you were in is the finest of them all up to this point. I think.

134
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.220
<v 0>Yeah. I've heard that word. I know what you're saying. That is.</v>

135
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.150
<v 1>It's some kind of syndrome. Exactly.</v>

136
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.480
It certainly was created by a man. There's some guy who's like, do the fun.

137
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.120
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think it was a girl. If it was, he was like one of them.</v>

138
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.580
All right. Phil bell checks.

139
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.630
<v 1>Don't don't you wish that there was like a supportive mother. I was like, yeah,</v>

140
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:05.030
sure, honey, you're the best too. This is the best.

141
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.070
Your number was way about him. It's yeah. Don't worry about him guys. He's fine.

142
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.083
You're the best.

143
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.661
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

144
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.650
It's like at the same thing with the native Americans and the settlers that the

145
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:17.630
settlers were imposing their lifestyle,

146
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.180
but the people that experienced the native American lifestyle,

147
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:21.650
they wanted to stay living like that.

148
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:24.800
<v 1>For sure. Well, I think because it omitted some of,</v>

149
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.550
so many of the things that the European culture was bringing. Yes. And,

150
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:29.480
and you can see,

151
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.680
it seems less like a distinct possibility that,

152
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:38.510
that European perspective, like when Pizarro and all that,

153
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:40.730
you know, was it 12 of them?

154
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.130
stores killed like a thousand natives in a, in a matter of hours. When,

155
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.980
you know, when they land, they're looking for gold, everywhere. Right?

156
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.780
At first they have this,

157
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.890
this belief that something big will come across the water and be their,

158
00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.390
and here comes a ship with a bunch of dirty that literally factually dirty

159
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:05.730
have written across the boat. And, and, you know,

160
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.120
I think about that perspective where they obviously were like,

161
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.060
these people are nice, but I've had enough of this.

162
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.870
They should have invented ships were better. So let's kill everyone here. Yeah.

163
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.733
<v 0>Well.</v>

164
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.550
<v 1>That's what I mean, Cortez, Cortez. That's what it is. Yeah.</v>

165
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

166
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.510
They didn't know what was going on because I don't think that previous to that

167
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:26.400
time they'd ever seen anyone on a horse before.

168
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.530
<v 1>No. And, and come across,</v>

169
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.100
you imagine a big boat and then a few horses where they're like, what the is.

170
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.920
Yeah. Uh, Gary, come over and look at this. It's just, it's impossible to find.

171
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.770
<v 0>I'm a man riding a beast. They're probably like what in the? Yeah.</v>

172
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.120
<v 1>With like rusty armor from being on a boat for months. Yeah.</v>

173
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.140
Like looking like being desperately, like,

174
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.840
like I imagine their relief when they come up on these horses with this armor

175
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:59.370
and all this stuff, and they're like, they're cool. This is going to be easy.

176
00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.380
You know? I mean, I, at first they,

177
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.560
they must have thought maybe we could do this with some Goodwill,

178
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:08.670
but quickly it's like, you guys are too primitive.

179
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.780
We're just going to take over here.

180
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.210
<v 0>And thought they were going to do it with Goodwill.</v>

181
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.830
I don't think there was any Goodwill back then.

182
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.360
I think people were just murdering people.

183
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.370
<v 1>Do you think that there's,</v>

184
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.530
perhaps that more people took more lives in a way,

185
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.930
like for per capita or something like that?

186
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.810
<v 0>It was a more brutal way of taking lives.</v>

187
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.460
I'm sure people take more lives today in war. But I think back then it was just,

188
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:33.510
it was hands-on.

189
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:35.310
<v 1>Right. But, but, um,</v>

190
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.350
it seems like more percentage of the people that are alive had an opportunity or

191
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:44.640
the possibility to kill someone today too. So it's like, if you,

192
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:49.230
if you are with 150 people, all of which have killed at least three people,

193
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.930
right. That's an interesting group. And then you land.

194
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.763
<v 0>On a boat.</v>

195
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.430
<v 1>And you've been there for months. You're like, maybe, maybe you are like,</v>

196
00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.280
we got to kill somebody and rape something and take something as quick as

197
00:10:59.281 --> 00:10:59.640
possible.

198
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.460
<v 0>I have no idea what the they're saying. Cause he can't speak their language. So.</v>

199
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.010
<v 1>It's easy to just, and they're being nice. So you're like,</v>

200
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.910
they're going to these people up in 5, 4, 3

201
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.560
silent count. And it's bizarre.

202
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:14.220
<v 0>Oh,</v>

203
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.170
that's the history of mankind is men showing up in boats and

204
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:20.610
killing everybody that they met.

205
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.760
<v 1>And then kind of doing their own version of a selfie on the dead button. Yeah.</v>

206
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.200
Right. Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have draw me.

207
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:29.650
<v 0>Well,</v>

208
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.390
imagine what it would be like if you could be a fly on the wall when Montezuma

209
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:38.340
met Cortez just to be there and see what that was like when these people

210
00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:40.440
who had never encountered Spaniards before,

211
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.360
and these guys show up in these boats.

212
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.700
<v 1>With two absolutely different beliefs and perspectives of what's</v>

213
00:11:47.701 --> 00:11:49.380
about to go down. What's crazy. Is that.

214
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.260
<v 0>That is why Mexico speaks Spanish. Yeah.</v>

215
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.290
People don't get that in their head. Like, oh max.

216
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:00.790
It's why all of south America, except for Brazil Brazell is Portuguese.

217
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.490
Yeah. I mean, people, we don't get it in our head. Like Mexico speaks Spanish.

218
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.650
Why did they pass horses? Spain's way the over there. How,

219
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.410
how has where they speak Spanish? That kids,

220
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.950
it makes no sense. But then you realize like, oh my God,

221
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:22.240
they were conquered by the Spanish. Whoa. Yeah. In a long,

222
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:26.290
long time of time ago, long. it. Because I,

223
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.680
because of having a, my music teacher as a,

224
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.930
as a young boy drill the song in 1492 from Spain through wind

225
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:35.764
and store, man,

226
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.810
the name of the paint of the scent that 14 92, 14 92,

227
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.700
which is which by my watch is a long time ago. It is, it is.

228
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:46.960
But it's not, you know,

229
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:50.950
like I had a joke in my act about the United States being founded in 1776.

230
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.770
People live to be a hundred that's three people ago.

231
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:59.920
That's real though. I know it sounds up when you hear you funny,

232
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:03.260
when you hear it, it sounds like you see, right. Well, that's not right. Well,

233
00:13:03.261 --> 00:13:05.860
what's funny is that's totally true. Yeah, it is right.

234
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.330
I mean that's we just got here. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah.

235
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.280
The thing is anything that happens before you were born,

236
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:14.020
it seems like a million years ago. Of course,

237
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.110
but also 1776 seems like yesterday to me,

238
00:13:17.111 --> 00:13:21.820
I wasn't alive and I'm ready to admit that, but I, that seems like, oh,

239
00:13:21.821 --> 00:13:24.500
that is just very close. I'm sure. Recent. Yeah.
