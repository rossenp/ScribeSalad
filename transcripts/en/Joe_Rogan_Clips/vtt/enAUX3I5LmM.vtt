00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 2>Was that a satisfying one for you? Because she was talking so much before, so.</v>

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.830
<v 1>It's not even about like the talking really. It was just about like,</v>

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.970
how dare you guys compare her to me, that's what it was for me. It was like,

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.710
I had watched film of her and I had my eyes set on her since I was 17,

6
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:22.590
before I even had turned pro. And I knew then when I was 17,

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.020
I couldn't beat her. So now that I'm, you know,

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.500
I was like 22 or whatever 23 is like,

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.950
what the hell does she do that make you guys think she can beat me?

10
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:36.300
Like either I'm just a terrible boxer or you guys just, I don't know,

11
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.343
think she's that good?

12
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.060
<v 0>I think sometimes when someone's overwhelming, like you are,</v>

13
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.700
the people try to pump up challengers in,

14
00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:48.800
in a way that they don't even really believe. You know what I mean? Like,

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.760
they'd kind of like, I'm just going to be honest.

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.700
I've had to do that before doing commentary.

17
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.560
Like pretend like there was certain dudes that I knew they were going to

18
00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:01.230
fight an accomplished champion and you knew they were.

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.400
And so you have to kind of play their strong points,

20
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.910
but if you caught me alone and it was just you and me, and it was like,

21
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
no recording equipment, Like he's,

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.620
but you can't necessarily say that because it's disrespectful to the opponent.

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.970
And because you want to kind of make it exciting. Yeah. Well I'm, I'm hype man.

24
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.470
Right? That's what I'm trying to do. If,

25
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.650
if John Jones is finding someone and I think Jon Jones is going to slaughter,

26
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.740
'em, I'm going to put point out the guy's strong points.

27
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.220
I'll point out John's strong points and I'll point out the guy's strong points

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.190
and what he has to do and what he can do and where he excels.

29
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.180
But sometimes they don't really believe that. And with you,

30
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:46.770
I think the problem is they're always trying to sell fights, right. But it's,

31
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.790
it's hard to sell when you, you here's everybody else. Right?

32
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.830
Here's you your way. You're, you're, you're so advanced in comparison,

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.940
like technique wise, ability wise accomplishments wise.

34
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.650
There's not a lot of competition for you in boxing where people are calling out

35
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:08.760
for other than occasionally people start talking about Les lolly, right?

36
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.830
Occasionally that comes up. Well, she's, you know, she's retired, she's retired.

37
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.950
She's probably 43.

38
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.920
<v 1>Yeah. And this is the thing I don't respect about that. Right.</v>

39
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.790
I hate when somebody else tries to take somebody else shine, somebody else,

40
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:28.590
attention, you know, it's like, she's, you know, nobody was trying to take her,

41
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.620
take her attention when it was her time. Right. And that's why I didn't,

42
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.260
I didn't like about hammer either. When I went in a world title fight,

43
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.930
why are you dumping in the ring and talking about some, you beat us, both.

44
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.260
You say congrats and get the out the ring, you know, but she's getting,

45
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.310
they're being disrespectful.

46
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.030
And then Layla gets upset because I become undisputed champion.

47
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.440
She's never been undisputed.

48
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.100
And people are comparing me to her and she gets offended when it was like,

49
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.390
to me,

50
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.140
I thought it was a good comparison because I feel like I box way better than her

51
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.010
in forums of me saying that me and her are equal or whatever,

52
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.440
she should have been happy because of that, because they're giving her more, um,

53
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.640
more prompts on her skills, which I feel like she didn't really have that much,

54
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.360
but you know, whatever. It was like, I never really had a problem with it.

55
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.020
And then all of a sudden it's like shock Masha knocked me out in my record and

56
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:18.280
this and that. And I just was like hater. That's all. I kept thinking to myself,

57
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.630
hater and I would have loved to fight her. But, um, at the end of the day,

58
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.970
I'm an active fighter. She's retired. So when people bring her up, like,

59
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.210
I don't want to have to keep saying that I beat her. Cause I think it's evident.

60
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.180
But at the same time, it's like, look, it was, she had her time.

61
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.720
This is my time. They don't even correlate with each other.

62
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.700
<v 0>Yeah. When was the last time she fought,</v>

63
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.600
it was like 2016 or something.

64
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.600
See if you can find the Laila Ali's last professional.

65
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.910
<v 1>2016. You thinking real? No, she retired like 13, 12 years.</v>

66
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.000
Yeah. Like I think her last fight was 2001.

67
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.960
<v 0>We're really hardly thousand seven. Wow. I was way off.</v>

68
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.053
<v 1>Am I say what?</v>

69
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.133
<v 0>2007.</v>

70
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.670
<v 1>I started boxing in 2006. I was like 11 years old and I started boxing.</v>

71
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:07.810
So I mean, I was 12.

72
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.360
<v 0>So basic. She, she retired when she was like 30.</v>

73
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.720
<v 1>I think we were of time. I think that that kind of eats at her. You know,</v>

74
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:21.400
she retired at 29, 30 in boxing when she was on top,

75
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.070
you know? And it was a lot of girls who wanted the fighter.

76
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.580
She left without fighting and Wolf left without fighting a girl named love,

77
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.970
love t-shirt Robinson. It was a few girls who she didn't fight.

78
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.760
<v 0>And Wolf was the scariest in her day. And Wolf.</v>

79
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:34.840
<v 1>Is still scary to me. Now.</v>

80
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.680
<v 0>Maybe she was draining James Kirkland screamed at him in the corner.</v>

81
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.530
She's a terrifying trainer. She's amazing.

82
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.970
<v 1>Trainer, terrifying.</v>

83
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.610
<v 0>Boxing. She has like, in my opinion,</v>

84
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:49.420
the most spectacular one punch knockout in the history of women's boxing.

85
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.060
<v 1>He said he used to be a boxing like that punch. There was like, what the,</v>

86
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.850
I mean, I dreamed to get a knockout like that. Like I thought my last fight,

87
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.610
I'm like, that's my dream. I want to knock this girl out.

88
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.760
Like an Wolf knocked up on the war. That was my whole thing. But it's like,

89
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.080
I feel for that, that she retired kind of early. So everybody always compare,

90
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.090
whoever was next up to her. But it was like still you're retired.

91
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.910
Nobody. Nobody is. Nobody fought because you.

92
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.560
<v 0>Retired. You ever worked with him Wolf.</v>

93
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.810
<v 1>No, I would love to though. I.</v>

94
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.710
<v 0>Would love to see that.</v>

95
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.800
<v 1>Yeah. I think she needs to just show me like how to sleep a girl.</v>

96
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.953
<v 0>Because.</v>

97
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.710
<v 1>Man, I'm talking about.</v>

98
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.980
<v 0>Oh my goodness, power, everything. No, Ann Wolf was a monster.</v>

99
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.560
And it's really interesting. Like when, uh,

100
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.330
she was training because you know her, her work ethic,

101
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.610
you could see it when she was training other fighters.

102
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.290
Like she demanded like some serious work from them and she had so much
