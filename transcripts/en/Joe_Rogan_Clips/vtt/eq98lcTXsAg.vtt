00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches. Yeah. Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.781 --> 00:00:06.690
I would just love to be a fly on the wall back then. I mean,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.110
when you're talking about people that had very little understanding of how the

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:13.800
universe worked or the rudimentary understanding of science,

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.180
just to hear the wisest of the wise amongst them and try to figure out what

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.830
makes everything tick talking about how acne is the devil. Yeah.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.460
Talk about how women were treated then that's, what's really weird.

8
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:28.310
It's like women have always been treated like. Always.

9
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.360
It's always been some weird sort of relationship between men and women because

10
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:35.300
we can get away with it. And that's really the bottom line about it all.

11
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.360
It's like what's happening today, I think,

12
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.040
is that because of the ability to express now,

13
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.150
like it's almost like something could happen to you in a bad

14
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.280
way and no one could know about it. Right. But now everyone can know about it.

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.640
If you express it. Yeah. If you express it, everyone can know about it.

16
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.890
Everyone can know. Sure.

17
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.860
And now everybody's realizing that and there's like a.

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.211
<v 1>Well, everybody's,</v>

19
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:05.630
it's like when black lives matter really came to the forefront, you know,

20
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:07.340
and all these white people are like, oh my God,

21
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:10.040
I didn't realize America was racist. And black people were like, really?

22
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.300
Cause we did. So all these women now are like, yeah, this goes on all the time.

23
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.150
And I even think about in comedy, you know,

24
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.290
and I went on this like Twitter rant the other day about it, this idea,

25
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.580
it's an art comedy as art and people feel ownership over it.

26
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:29.330
So you get these like boys' clubs, you know, I'm very lucky in that. I have,

27
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.680
you know, like you get like,

28
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.260
it's a group of dudes that run the show and they don't like girls,

29
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.490
whatever it is or the way a lot of guys make women feel. And it's so insane.

30
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:37.701
I'm like,

31
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:41.330
so because you moved to LA a year before me and you and your friends wrote the

32
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:42.590
same jokes.

33
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.730
You somehow think you own this art form that I've always felt a connection to my

34
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.690
whole life. Just because you.

35
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.210
<v 0>Remember it. Right. Cause, well, not only that, I mean, I don't mean you get it.</v>

36
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:55.120
Like, do you understand it? But I mean, does it happen to me?

37
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.240
Does it happened to you? No.

38
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.710
<v 1>And the truth is I was able to avoid it because of what I did in my career early</v>

39
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:05.210
on, because like winning a show like that makes you, you get to headline.

40
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.210
<v 0>So I was never, I missed respected. It's.</v>

41
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.800
<v 1>Not even that as much as I just was never in the trenches as much because I got</v>

42
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:15.290
to headline, which is always the goal. Like I just had a different path.

43
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.090
<v 0>How much time? How much,</v>

44
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.900
how many years were you doing standup before you won last comic standing? Whoa,

45
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:21.920
that's crazy. Right.

46
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.720
<v 1>So for me, I'm even more firmly, I guess, planted in my,</v>

47
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.450
in my convictions about sympathizing or empathizing with women who didn't have

48
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:36.200
the same advantage. Um, and I want to just, or anyone being bullied,

49
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:38.840
but I see it, you know, at clubs that we do,

50
00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:42.770
and these are my home clubs and I love it coming up the last 10 years I've

51
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:47.030
watched, oh no, he's a good guy. And this guy cyst like systematically,

52
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.840
like daily harasses women and all the guys like, no, he's, we're cool.

53
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.500
He's friend, we're friends with him, you know, it's like, I've seen that.

54
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.730
I'm not going to say names,

55
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.700
but there are people who go out of their way to be horrific.

56
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.750
And I never see the guys around us. And these are all, you know,

57
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.450
contemporaries say anything. Cause it's like, no, he's a good guy.

58
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.250
He's our friend and women will DM me. Female comics will send me messages.

59
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.060
This is happening to me. He said this to me. What do I do? And I'm like,

60
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.630
all you can do is be kind, work on your jokes. that guy.

61
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.440
He doesn't mean anything, but it is a thing. It.

62
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.910
<v 0>Does mean something psychologically.</v>

63
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:22.770
If you have to go to the club and then you see that guy,

64
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.050
and if you see him right before you have a set.

65
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.640
<v 1>Oh my God. Yeah. I've had, you know, disagreements. I was nervous.</v>

66
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.730
This isn't you. When I, when you and I had that, this,

67
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.580
the thing about your phone number, I was like, I don't want to run into Joe.

68
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.510
I'm so afraid of Joe. And that's someone, who's a friend of mine, you know,

69
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.930
it's already such a weird thing to go to work. But the girls who were like,

70
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.830
oh yeah, I, he told me I wasn't funny. He told me I was a. He told me this.

71
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:48.840
He told me I was too XYZ to this.

72
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.460
And just as if the guy owns the art form, when what breaks,

73
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:57.720
my heart is like real comics like you, or like Sebastian or like people that I,

74
00:03:57.721 --> 00:04:00.870
or mark Marin, like guys that I look up to that I think are so brilliant.

75
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.680
They don't have time to sit there and get in the head of some girl.

76
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:07.830
Who's just trying to make 15 bucks. You know, it's not your emo,

77
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.830
it's only losers. I always.

78
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.920
<v 0>Feel that we're all in the same boat together.</v>

79
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.720
And that if you have a vagina and I have a penis, it doesn't, we're all comics.

80
00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.550
Like I think the really, I mean, that's God, it sounds like even to be sincere,

81
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:25.590
sounds like such horse. And it's weird day and age,

82
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.310
because you feel like you're trying to cover up and try to, I'm not those guys.

83
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:32.700
Hey. Yeah. But I'm not that Harvey Weinstein guy. I'm different.

84
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:36.160
I'm a sweet come with me. I'm a sweetie. We could sleep on the couch together.

85
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.600
Wouldn't even bother me. But you know what I mean?

86
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:44.220
Like there's but I think it's very important that all of us,

87
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.930
um, that, that work together. Look, I could learn from comedy about, from you.

88
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.940
I can learn from anybody. I mean, I've,

89
00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:57.180
I've seen people do do stand up. They've seen me do stand up.

90
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.440
They do it different than me. We talk, you've got a different method than I do.

91
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.550
There. There might be something you see, it's always, we're all peers.

92
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.170
<v 1>And we're peers. But.</v>

93
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.450
<v 0>I feel like that with friends.</v>

94
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.050
And I feel like that with peers and I feel like that within it, you gotta,

95
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.030
you gotta be open. And if you're not open, you're going to miss stuff. So.

96
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.990
<v 1>Very secure.</v>

97
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.610
And I really do believe that insecurity whether you're a woman hating another

98
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:26.700
woman, whether you're a dude trying to like step to another guy,

99
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.760
it all comes from insecurity. So when you're, oh,

100
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:32.550
I run the show with my buddies or, you know, I've been doing it three years.

101
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.610
I'm owed the world. Like you're told that you're that you're owed more right.

102
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:37.140
Or conquered show, but I should have more.

103
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.610
It comes from this insecurity of if she gets something that I deserve and it

104
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:44.510
comes from this place of you think you deserve something. Um,

105
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.130
and that was a big thing for me after I did the show,

106
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.960
the men that I had to tour with were horrific, like mental scars,

107
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.640
indelible marks on my brain horrific because there wasn't this entitlement,

108
00:05:56.641 --> 00:05:59.930
like how dare she take that? You know, how dare you win the show?

109
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.720
How dare you not roll over and die. But,

110
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.280
so I see that and I don't have to deal with it as much. Um,

111
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.830
but my heart breaks because I wish that these girls five years later could look,

112
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.000
could realize from like a bird's eye view when it's happening. I'm like,

113
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.080
but that guy's got nothing.

114
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.500
Like if you really are going to be that mean to a fellow comic,

115
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:20.240
you obviously hate yourself so much.

116
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.080
<v 0>Yeah. But you don't see that. Like, I wouldn't see that if somebody hated me,</v>

117
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:25.950
even if they were a loser, when someone hates you, it sucks. No, no,

118
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.700
no hate yourself. Hates them. Like if you're going to.

119
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.670
But if someone hates on you because they hate themselves, it still sucks.

120
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.600
I had a guy.

121
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.350
<v 1>When I started, I was doing these like comedy contest and like orange county,</v>

122
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.140
which were a total racket, but I don't even know the guy.

123
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:41.200
I think he was another comic. And he was like a middle-aged dad.

124
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.980
And he would on a weekly basis, write me hate email,

125
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.950
calling me names that I had never been called in my life.

126
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.480
I was like 23 or something. You were, like just railing on me.

127
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:56.620
And I didn't like someone jerking off of her. You don't know how to handle that.

128
00:06:56.621 --> 00:07:01.120
No one I've never even had a woman be that mean to me. And so I, I took it.

129
00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:04.090
I wrote back a couple of times, like, what's your problem? And it was just,

130
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:07.540
he was just a crazy person firing off at someone.

131
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.690
And a year later he wrote me an email to be like, I'm in rehab now.

132
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.420
I'm so sorry. I've got a wife, I've got kids.

133
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.580
So you enter into this art form and into the city with the best of intentions,

134
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.650
trying to keep your soul as clean as possible.

135
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.130
And you have no control over the crazy. That's going to be in your path.

136
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.100
You only have control over how you heal from it, I guess. Yeah.

137
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.170
<v 0>And I think every comic is crazy in a certain way. There's just no way around.</v>

138
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.370
If you're funny, I've never met a single funny one. That wasn't crazy.

139
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.330
They're all crazy. It's just, everyone's crazy. It's a different, crazy, well,

140
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:40.750
here's.

141
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.860
<v 1>The other side of it. So you get women and, and my whole thing is like,</v>

142
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:47.590
you should be fired from your job for not being funny.

143
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:49.570
Not because you didn't like someone. Right.

144
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.930
But I think some people take it a step further. They're like more for women.

145
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:56.260
I'm like, no, no, no. Do the jokes be funny?

146
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.540
You shouldn't get the gauges because you're a girl.

147
00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:01.780
You should get a chance and you should have a chance to prove yourself and not

148
00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.620
have one standing in the way, but this like more women in comedy, right.

149
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:09.640
The jokes be funny. I will, I will fight for you to get that chance,

150
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.760
but I'm not going to hire you just because you're a woman. Yeah. Yeah. The more.

151
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.600
<v 0>Women in comedy thing, it's like, I just want humans to be good at it.</v>

152
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:18.100
I want good, funny people. Yeah.

153
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:20.800
And I think there are more women in comedy now than ever before,

154
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:24.280
but I think there's more people in comedy now than ever before. So saturated,

155
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.470
it's so saturated, but I think it's a good thing.

156
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.410
There's a lot of competition and there's a lot of support.

157
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.180
Like one of the things that bothers me the most about any sort of weird that

158
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:36.250
goes on with comedians, whether it's boy, girl,

159
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.500
or anything else is that there's a comradery that we share

160
00:08:41.501 --> 00:08:45.940
that is very unusual in a fairly competitive art form,

161
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.330
competitive in that I don't think it's as competitive anymore.

162
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:53.920
And what I mean by this is that I don't think that the idea of like getting a

163
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.540
sit-com or the host of the tonight show or, you know, these,

164
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:59.940
these limited number of gigs that are available.

165
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.830
I don't think that's where it's at anymore.

166
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.820
I think there's more people like you that are doing Netflix specials and me and

167
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:08.040
we both do podcasts. Like that kind of thing,

168
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.590
I think is way more open to people.

169
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:13.320
And it's way easier for us to all,

170
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:17.310
to be supportive of each other and supportive of each other in the art form of

171
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.760
standup. Like what's important in our world is don't steal.

172
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.240
Don't be an to your fellow comedians, support each other,

173
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.610
and I'm going to be there for you if you're there for me.

174
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.870
<v 1>I think there's two things to that. Um, I agree.</v>

175
00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:33.110
I think it's also easier to be supportive when someone's undeniable.

176
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.050
I think when you're first starting out and when you're kind of in the clubs and

177
00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:37.060
you're all kind of fighting for,

178
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.880
to figure out what you have when someone's genuinely funny, man, or a woman,

179
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.130
I'm the first one to be like, yes, love that.

180
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.600
Like I visibly fell over Sebastian when I bring them on stage and I'm sure he

181
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:52.430
like, doesn't love it, but I'm like, he's. And, and you are, I mean,

182
00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:55.460
this sounds like a, like I'm stroking your ego, but it's true.

183
00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.020
Like you single handedly,

184
00:09:57.021 --> 00:10:01.880
I think change the sort of landscape in the way that we consume

185
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.000
comedy. Like you have this massive podcast,

186
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.420
you guys don't know we're in a studio that is at least 2 million square feet.

187
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:10.250
And there are stuffed animals everywhere.

188
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.180
Like once we're not Teddy bears and there's elk horns and there's an interactive

189
00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:18.410
dinosaur exhibit, like it's huge. Um, he's like a monster drink fountain.

190
00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:21.440
It's crazy. But you, you know,

191
00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:23.900
having this podcast and then people see what's possible.

192
00:10:23.901 --> 00:10:28.070
So what's funny is you did this and you built this sort of podcast empire and

193
00:10:28.071 --> 00:10:29.360
there's other big ones too,

194
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.540
but this is definitely one of the most consumed on the planet.

195
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.670
So then it sort of opens up this new avenues.

196
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.980
Then you get all these other comments on, do podcasts too,

197
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.100
and not everybody's equipped to do it. And there is I think, a,

198
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:44.030
a glory in being one of the originals because you kind of paved the way.

199
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:45.800
And then also I up.

200
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.140
<v 0>A lot in the beginning and got better at it.</v>

201
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.590
And I was having a conversation with a good buddy of mine this morning about it.

202
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.200
And he was asking me about conversations.

203
00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:57.050
We were just talking about conversations about letting figure.

204
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.340
There's like an art form to letting people talk in a way that's easy to consume

205
00:11:01.341 --> 00:11:02.930
for the people that are listening. Very good.

206
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.620
<v 1>Listener. And I think a lot of when I started my podcast, I did it.</v>

207
00:11:06.621 --> 00:11:10.100
So I could work on my listening skills. I know you were, and that was so nice.

208
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:14.420
Talk about support and you did not have to do that. Um, and I think, and I've,

209
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.630
I don't do a lot of podcasts. I begged to do yours.

210
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.460
So it was not like you asked me. And I was like, I'm busy, Joe,

211
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.910
but I don't do a lot of them because not every comic is a good listener or

212
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.660
equipped.

213
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:23.811
<v 0>Well,</v>

214
00:11:23.811 --> 00:11:26.810
we were talking before the show started about some bad interviews you've done,

215
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.660
you know? And there's, there's always going to be, it's like,

216
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.720
you got to want to talk to people. I like,

217
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.770
I liked talking to people like this is one of the reasons why podcasts is a good

218
00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:40.520
fit for me is because I'm curious. You're.

219
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.580
<v 1>Very curious ape. Yeah. Very curious. I like.</v>

220
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.450
<v 0>Talking to people. I want to, like when I was saying, uh, like,</v>

221
00:11:47.451 --> 00:11:52.040
would I be a woman for a day? I want to know how the your brain works. I know,

222
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.750
I know you, don't how mine works. And I know, I don't know how yours works.

223
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.800
I'm fascinated.

224
00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:00.550
And I think that we try to figure men and women try to figure out our

225
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:04.330
interactions with each other through trial and error and when sexual harassment

226
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:05.860
and sexual assault and stuff like this,

227
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:09.130
what's coming out in the news with Harvey Weinstein and, and others.

228
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:10.870
And even the Kevin Spacey stuff,

229
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.200
we're starting to see the Kevin's based stuff.

230
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.480
It's not very applicable to what I'm talking about.

231
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.400
Cause it's men doing it to men. But the Harvey Weinstein thing is it's like,

232
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:23.830
here's someone who's not even trying to think about how women think.

233
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.780
<v 1>No, not only that. He was trying to think, how can I, how can I do this?</v>

234
00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:31.230
The most? He had like a network of people helping him exact that plan.

235
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:32.940
This wasn't like, I'm drunk, touch my Dick.

236
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.920
This was my assistant's going to squirt you in.

237
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.960
I'm going to send spies to try to cover this up later. Like it's maniacal. Did.

238
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.690
<v 0>You ever see that article from 1945 with, uh,</v>

239
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.110
what was that woman's name? I'll send it to you again. Oh, oh yeah. The lady,

240
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.840
the Irish lady, the actress that was like, if this is Hollywood easy, Jamie,

241
00:12:51.841 --> 00:12:54.420
I'm going to send it to you again. Put this up on the, on the big screen.

242
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.230
I got a better version of it where it's not cut off is probably like, yeah,

243
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:01.230
goodbye. Yeah. This is 1945.

244
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.130
She was complaining that people were trying to her all the time and she couldn't

245
00:13:05.131 --> 00:13:06.600
get any work. Cause they said she was cold.

246
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.710
<v 1>She was like, uh, in order to get work, I have to like leave my husband,</v>

247
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:12.840
get rid of my kids and be just fuckable.

248
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.350
<v 0>Irish film star, Maureen, O'Hara sorry. Uh,</v>

249
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.890
today charge Hollywood producers and directors with calling her a cold potato

250
00:13:19.891 --> 00:13:24.210
without sex appeal, potato tea.

251
00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:28.170
She refuses to let them make love to her. So as the mere New York correspondent,

252
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.410
sorry, I.

253
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:29.970
<v 1>Read it. Can I read it in her Irish accent?</v>

254
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.330
I'm so upset with this that I'm ready to quit.

255
00:13:33.331 --> 00:13:37.380
Hollywood Marine says it's gotten so bad. I hate to come to work in the morning.

256
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.880
I'm helpless a victim,

257
00:13:38.881 --> 00:13:42.030
a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign because I don't let the

258
00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:44.610
producer and director kiss me every morning or tell them,

259
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.210
or let them call me and have them spread a words around town that I'm not a

260
00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:51.720
woman that I am a cold piece of marble statuary, statuary.

261
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.890
I guess Hollywood won't consider me as anything except a cold Hunka marble until

262
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:56.724
I divorced my house.

263
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:00.480
My husband give me baby away and take my name and photograph on all the

264
00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:04.350
newspapers. If that's Hollywood's idea of being a woman, I'm ready to quit now.

265
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.750
Crazy how good my accident is. Yeah, it's very.

266
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:11.340
<v 0>Good. Um, but 1945, but this is what I've always said about Hollywood.</v>

267
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:12.240
And this is one of the,

268
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.230
the real problems with the people that are involved in the business.

269
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:18.420
Not just in terms of like the way it's set up,

270
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.560
but the problems for the person that's doing it.

271
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.540
That's trying to be an actor, an actress.

272
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:29.460
Here's the problem you have to get picked. So because you have to get picked,

273
00:14:29.461 --> 00:14:33.150
you have to go into places like, please like me, you're already insecure,

274
00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:35.010
which is why you're an actress in the first place. Right?

275
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.690
The reason why you're an actor in the first place,

276
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.790
because you want an exorbitant amount of attention,

277
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.710
you probably didn't get it when you were younger.

278
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:45.060
There's something missing Daniel Day Lewis. Oh, he's a different cat. Yeah.

279
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.730
Or like Christian bale, a few of those folks out there.

280
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.520
There's a few of those freaks. Especially Daniel Day Lewis.

281
00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:54.560
He's like been working the last two years as a cobbler making shoes.

282
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.950
He's my favorite. I love that guy. He's such a weirdo, you know?

283
00:14:57.951 --> 00:14:59.990
And then when you watch him in some movies, you know,

284
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:03.440
like there will be blood and you're like, oh, okay. This is like your you're.

285
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.100
You're not even really acting. You just become new people. Yeah.

286
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.580
Like you're is that he becomes the guy on the set all the time.

287
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.270
He's the guy all day. I don't want to spend that much time outside of my body.

288
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.163
I don't either.

289
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.950
But the problem that I faced when I first came here was I got,

290
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.780
first of all, I never wanted to act. I had zero intention.

291
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.680
I wanted to be a comic. But then I started getting these development deals.

292
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.020
I went on to auditions in my very first, my,

293
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:35.900
my early days of being an actor, I got both shows.

294
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.610
That's I got this show called hardball. And then I got news radio.

295
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.240
Those are the two first two auditions that I ever went on. I know I didn't.

296
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.250
I just got lucky. I mean, I got his lucky as a person can get. Yeah.

297
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.220
Part of it was because I didn't want to do acting.

298
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:56.510
I wasn't nervous about it is a thing. And also I was coming from fighting.

299
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.330
So I was used to like really being nervous

300
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.650
[inaudible] yeah. So I could go in there, like, Hey, what's up?

301
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.510
How you guys doing, right. Yeah. I was fine.

302
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.340
<v 2>Because there's a kick in the nose now, then it's fine.</v>

303
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:11.630
<v 0>Yeah. I'm not going to get a concussion and bleed out of my ears. Right. This,</v>

304
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.050
but this environment where you're always wanting to get picked.

305
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.080
That's why everybody out here is left wing.

306
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.290
It's not even there they're really left wing. They have to be,

307
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.910
you have to wear a pink hat. You have to say, you know,

308
00:16:25.911 --> 00:16:28.450
all the things that you need to say, you're,

309
00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.200
you're literally formulating an act and you bring that act into

310
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.050
auditions. You bring that act onto the red carpet.

311
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.510
That's why you're seeing these people like Harvey Weinstein,

312
00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:42.380
who would donate to the Clinton campaign and do all this.

313
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.090
What seemed to be like very left wing stuff, you know?

314
00:16:47.091 --> 00:16:49.720
And he was the darling of left-wing Mamie's Miramax,

315
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.800
which is like really kind of a progressive studio. Meanwhile.

316
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.830
<v 1>It's just a house of sexual assault. I mean,</v>

317
00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.580
I think you can be a total pervert and have good politics, bad politics.

318
00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:01.414
I don't think, but.

319
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.600
<v 0>Pervert. Right. There's a big difference between what he is in a perfect,</v>

320
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:05.560
that's fine. I'm a total.

321
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.910
<v 1>Psychopath predator. Um, and it's interesting too, because look,</v>

322
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.170
Donald, Trump's a, he's a, he's the worst that being said,

323
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.770
we're going out and we're attacking people. There are people like,

324
00:17:17.771 --> 00:17:20.440
I don't speak to my parents. They voted for Trump and I'm like, cool. Well,

325
00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:24.670
when they're dead, you can, you can rethink that those four years, you know?

326
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.650
And we out actors, like he's a Republican, like what are you doing?

327
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.490
<v 0>Well, some of them revel in it. Right? Like James Woods. Okay. Is hilarious.</v>

328
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:35.890
He's on Twitter all day long fighting with him. Yeah.

329
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:40.690
<v 1>But he also was not of the best moral ground. Here's something interesting. Uh,</v>

330
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.500
on my book, there is a Weinstein logo. Um,

331
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.980
my book is the last one to be published. Get the out.

332
00:17:47.981 --> 00:17:52.560
It's on the back or it's in the, I'm sorry, it's on the spine. Um,

333
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.290
and what I've been likening you to, and I feel like the people now it's a.

334
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.020
Like they got absorbed Weinstein books was only two women.

335
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.050
It wasn't like a huge company. I'd never met him or anything.

336
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.430
I liken it to like,

337
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:06.120
when your grandpa comes back from world war II and he brings back like a plate

338
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:09.690
with a Nazi in Sydney on it, like, cause they had, they made their own.

339
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.140
Like Nazis had like a whole home goods line. Um,

340
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.770
and he brings that one thing back. That's what that book is like,

341
00:18:15.771 --> 00:18:16.560
like one of the last.

342
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.420
<v 2>Ones with the w now they don't have them anymore. Well.</v>

343
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.650
<v 0>Look, before this had happened, anybody would have done a Miramax movie. I mean,</v>

344
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.700
he was the guy. I mean the movies that they put together,

345
00:18:28.701 --> 00:18:31.400
they put together some of the greatest movies of all time. I.

346
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.730
<v 1>Think it's crazy. I think we're getting to a place now where we're realizing,</v>

347
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.620
oh yeah. For every everything there's an upside down, every upside down world.

348
00:18:39.621 --> 00:18:43.850
There's, you know, a whole stranger thing. Yeah. There's an underbelly to every,

349
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.410
the, every business you can think of.

350
00:18:45.411 --> 00:18:48.740
There is a CD horrible side of it with horrible people.

351
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.010
And most of us choose to live in the light and think things are good.

352
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.000
Every industry has that. And we're just at a place now where like,

353
00:18:56.001 --> 00:18:58.010
we're kind of shaking it out and people are coming forward,

354
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:02.570
but this has always existed. And it's rampant in every business.

355
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.080
Don't.

356
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.280
<v 0>You think there's also,</v>

357
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.590
there's like there's systems, right?

358
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.960
And system systems of power where someone gets to a position

359
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.440
where they have this massive amount of power,

360
00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:23.270
almost like royalty and what a guy like Harvey Weinstein was

361
00:19:23.271 --> 00:19:27.770
essentially like a Royal in some ways, right? Like royalty,

362
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:31.130
massive power, right? Massive money.

363
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:34.640
All of these people terrified of them. This big booming figure,

364
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:36.950
almost like a kingdom would cut your head off. Right.

365
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.280
And when you have that kind of power,

366
00:19:40.281 --> 00:19:44.450
it's such an unrealistic position to be in

367
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.580
that. I think it's human nature to exploit those unrealistic positions.

368
00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:53.570
That's why this Maureen O'Hara articles fascinating to me,

369
00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:55.790
because this has always been the case,

370
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.030
these unrealistic positions where someone has to get chosen.

371
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.380
There's one person who has a billion dollars and makes a hundred movies a year.

372
00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.820
And EV and people have to be chosen to be the chosen ones to be in those movies.

373
00:20:07.821 --> 00:20:09.770
So you have a whole ecosystem, right?

374
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.640
And then you have people that are depending on that ecosystem for their own

375
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:14.210
service. And.

376
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.940
<v 1>Nobody, even if they know something wants to say anything, it's like, well,</v>

377
00:20:16.941 --> 00:20:17.210
I didn't.

378
00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.650
<v 0>Know what you can't be the first one and then get fired. And then you're. Right?</v>

379
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.700
That's what they're thinking.

380
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.290
<v 1>You don't want to be the first. Well,</v>

381
00:20:24.291 --> 00:20:27.110
that's the other thing you don't want to be first. Right?

382
00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:29.480
Because Rose McGowan was talking about this stuff forever. And they're like,

383
00:20:29.481 --> 00:20:32.630
whatever, she's crazy. Nobody wants. Especially for women,

384
00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:35.600
nobody wants to listen to that woman. And historically, you know,

385
00:20:35.601 --> 00:20:38.630
like Monica Lewinsky, her life got wrecked.

386
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.380
And she was a young woman with the most powerful man in the world.

387
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.620
And we love bill Clinton and she gets called a. You know?

388
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:50.110
So it w th there's paradigm shift where people are now speaking.

389
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.071
And in terms of like,

390
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:53.860
if you're talking about exalting one position and someone getting chosen,

391
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:56.620
that's shifting too. People are like, it. I got a cell phone.

392
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.250
I don't need your movie. Right. I have 8 billion followers on Instagram.

393
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:02.680
You know, I'll just show my book. I'll just show my butt.

394
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:06.040
I'll just make a video about me eating pizza. I'm relatable now.

395
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.520
And so everything is shifting everything, shaking out.

396
00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.040
I don't think this is ever going to go away,

397
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.800
because if you're the kind of guy that does that, that's just something that,

398
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:15.720
oh, I think you're.

399
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.920
<v 0>Wrong. I think it's going away. I don't, I don't see how, uh,</v>

400
00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:23.520
I just don't think you can get away with it anymore. Well, it's for, for sure.

401
00:21:23.521 --> 00:21:28.230
Going to get watered down. There's always going to be some amount of influence,

402
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.890
powerful people have that are in a position where they're choosing people.

403
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.650
<v 1>Implying that if you are, that,</v>

404
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.530
that kind of crazy where you're assaulting women,

405
00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:41.190
that you're choosing good over evil, you just do. If you're a predator,

406
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:41.940
you prey.

407
00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:42.660
<v 0>On things, right.</v>

408
00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.480
He couldn't do that when he was 20 and he didn't have any money.

409
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.380
And he wasn't the head of a think. So I think this is just who he is.

410
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.370
I think sometimes.

411
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.970
<v 1>It's who you are. So this whole, I went to rehab. I'm apologizing. I'm going to,</v>

412
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.000
I'm going to listen. I'm so sorry. It's like, it's who you are.

413
00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.160
And you can maybe stop, but that, I do believe that that's we like to think, oh,

414
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.880
just go, hell, go reflect for a little bit.

415
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.500
<v 0>I love that they have a rehab that they all go to. If it's in Arizona,</v>

416
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.810
we can fix you. Is it canyon? Ranch?

417
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.690
<v 2>I don't know what it's called. It's not. They go there with Kevin.</v>

418
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.520
Spacey's there right now. They go for a week.

419
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.070
<v 1>Absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. So Dave Becky gave the whole,</v>

420
00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:23.640
a gate, wrote a follow-up letter to Lucy Ks, which I thought was,

421
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:28.320
it sounded very genuine. And there is something too, you know,

422
00:22:28.321 --> 00:22:30.720
we have these levels that you exist on, you know,

423
00:22:30.721 --> 00:22:35.430
and you can't be aware of. I feel like I'm going to put my foot in my mouth,

424
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.220
but you can't be aware of everything that's going on all the time.

425
00:22:38.221 --> 00:22:39.810
Some people think he was aware of it,

426
00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:43.320
but when you're dealing with these high level deals and you're at a certain

427
00:22:43.321 --> 00:22:45.930
dollar amount and you're flying high above everyone else,

428
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:48.390
you genuinely might not know what's going on,

429
00:22:48.391 --> 00:22:51.210
but you almost have a responsibility when you are that powerful.

430
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:53.190
And someone tells you something about your client to like,

431
00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.490
maybe take it seriously. If I go on a Twitter rant, my manager calls,

432
00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.620
she was like, you're acting like a maniac. Well, okay. But let's.

433
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.230
<v 0>Let's follow that up then. What, what does one do?</v>

434
00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.300
So if someone is a Dave Becky,

435
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:06.390
and you think that this woman might be telling the truth,

436
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.360
and I don't know what Louis said to her today, Becky,

437
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:14.280
but we know that Louie told mark Marin a lie as mark Baron talked

438
00:23:14.281 --> 00:23:17.400
about it on his podcast. And he said that he asked him, Hey man,

439
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.250
are you jerking off from the girls? He said, no, I'm not. It's just a rumor.

440
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.270
It's. And he goes, why don't you just talk about this rumor? And he goes,

441
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:28.860
I can't, you can't do that because then it'll give it credence. Which I guess I,

442
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.220
I kind of understand if it wasn't true,

443
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.850
but I don't think I have any this. Yeah. I don't have one either.

444
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:39.530
<v 1>Definitely. Don't I don't want to seem like I'm going one side or the other.</v>

445
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.020
Okay.
