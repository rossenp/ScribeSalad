00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.720
<v 2>When you were thinking about doing this, what made clean water, what made that,</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:10.290
the thing that you chose to have as your main charitable organization?

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.790
<v 1>So I was living in Australia and they were</v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.760
experiencing a, like a,

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.540
a pretty significant drought and Australia is very developed

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.380
it's, um,

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.120
and to see the major headlines to see the rules, like,

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.740
oh, you can't water your grass right now. You can't wash your car right now.

10
00:00:31.741 --> 00:00:36.330
And just to see that happening in somewhere so developed it had it in the back

11
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:38.070
of my mind, like, wow, water,

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.980
isn't that something that should be taken for granted.

13
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.920
And it isn't just this unlimited resource.

14
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:48.480
And so I was studying environmental science and I remember one of my

15
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.190
professors mentioned that the wars of the future would be on water, like, and,

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.460
and in some countries it's already the case. And to me,

17
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.330
that was kind of like that one sentence that I couldn't unlearn,

18
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:04.350
I couldn't stop thinking about. And it just hit me at,

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.160
at a core of like, that is so wrong.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.660
And I, I, yeah, I was 19 or 20. And, um,

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.670
at that point I felt like I had like, uh, a little bit because of traveling.

22
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:21.090
Like I had a little bit of a sense of what was going on in the world.

23
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.220
But to know at that 0.1 in six people didn't have clean water. I was like,

24
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.054
wow,

25
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.920
I didn't even know about one sixth of our planet and what their

26
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.180
daily struggle is.

27
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:38.010
And like the fact that it's a problem that has a solution.

28
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.890
And it's something that like,

29
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.230
I don't know what cause could have as big as an impact as

30
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:51.210
water, because you think like, okay, if you, what, what can you live without?

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.330
Um, you can't even survive three days without, without water.

32
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:00.390
So, um, and just like thinking about health,

33
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.810
half of the hospital beds are filled because of unsafe drinking water.

34
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:07.560
If you think about environment, if you think about education, um,

35
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.580
for the hospital.

36
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.930
<v 0>Beds in the world, is that what you mean?</v>

37
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.300
<v 1>Yup. And like half. Yeah. Like, um, the,</v>

38
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.130
for children in the world, the greatest killer is diarrhea,

39
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.300
diarrheal disease. And that is because of unsafe drinking water.

40
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:25.920
And that is like,

41
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.700
I there's this documentary that came out recently.

42
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.900
Well within the last year called, I think it's brave blue world and Matt Damon,

43
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.500
um, shared something at the, at the beginning about like,

44
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.870
imagine that right now we find the cure for all childhood

45
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.380
cancers. And then imagine in 50 years from now,

46
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.420
these kids are still dying from this very cancer that we have a cure for.

47
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:56.160
And that is what's happening with clean water. And I mean, if you, it just,

48
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.980
I don't know, it's still poisoned my boils, my blood,

49
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.130
just like thinking about like how wrong it is. And when you,

50
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.330
when you see how wrong it is, I mean, I feel like,

51
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.890
of course I would want to support that and, and do something. And like,

52
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.800
when I first started learning about it, I was, I,

53
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.300
the first water project I was able to find was in Haiti.

54
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.320
And I was learning about how some places, they don't even name,

55
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.820
give their kids a name until they're five years old, because,

56
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.040
okay, so who's affected by the water crisis, women and children, children,

57
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:33.874
their bodies,

58
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.230
aren't strong enough to withstand and to fight back all the

59
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.600
bacteria and viruses and all the, um, things. Yeah,

60
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.650
exactly. So,

61
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.060
so they won't even give their kids names until they,

62
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.360
they think they'll be able to live. Right. So like,

63
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.240
just thinking about that is like, these are,

64
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.110
these are real people like these are, I don't know.

65
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.050
<v 0>Well people today. Yeah, exactly. Not real people. 5,000. Okay.</v>

66
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.180
<v 1>And like just the idea of not even giving your child a name because of that</v>

67
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.680
fear of like, they might not even live. So you don't even want to get, like.

68
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.690
<v 0>My friend, Lex, Lex Friedman,</v>

69
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.320
he's a scientist that works with artificial intelligence.

70
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:20.620
He posted something on his Instagram. It's a yesterday,

71
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.950
it's a crazy statistic about, um,

72
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.470
children and infant mortality from, uh, believer.

73
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.980
It was 200 years ago.

74
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.470
Look at this in 1843% died before the age of

75
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:37.150
five today. It's 4%.

76
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.970
Just imagine that that was all over the world, 43%.

77
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.960
But that's not the case everywhere. Obviously, if you're not naming your kids,

78
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.140
it's probably, uh, uh,

79
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.290
that's probably where the gap is because it's not 5% of American children die

80
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.450
before that age. Yeah.
