00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So when you put.</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>Together JFK,</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.810
you have this film that is about this incredibly important subject,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.100
but yet you want to make it interesting and you want to make it a great film and

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.960
you succeeded in doing that. But what is,

6
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.180
what is that like doing that balancing act of having so much information to

7
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:23.610
tell that story is so complex.

8
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.700
<v 2>It was three hours in 10, 12 minutes. And, uh, I got it through the system,</v>

9
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:32.880
which is unbelievable. I'll tell you how later, but at the time I was,

10
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.550
I needed the protagonist and the protagonist. And who was the guy? You know,

11
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.650
the only person who ever brought any kind of charges publicly was Jim Garrison

12
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.330
in new Orleans. He was a district attorney and I read his book.

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.530
He wrote two books and I actually got to know him. And, uh,

14
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.300
he was a man who would like 20 years after he did this and went through hell,

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.870
came back to it and wrote another book. And that's the book I Mo I bought.

16
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:02.720
In other words, he was devoted to the subject like you are.

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.120
He believed a lot more than me.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.530
He'd been a Patriot in world war II and he'd served in Korea. He'd been,

19
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.540
he'd been a sheep. I mean, he'd been called every name in the book.

20
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.820
He, but he, as a Patriot, he firmly believed that, uh, Mr. Kennedy was killed,

21
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.050
uh, by these intelligence forces. And he went after it.

22
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.600
And in those days you just couldn't do it.

23
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.150
You couldn't prove a covert operation.

24
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.900
He got killed by the press killed. And that's we've.

25
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.960
Now we've found out a lot more about why, what was going on.

26
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.300
We know a lot more facts about how the media went after him with,

27
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.860
a lot of accusations and made him look as bad as possible. Well, Kevin.

28
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.710
<v 1>Costner did an amazing job of playing him in your movie too. Well.</v>

29
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.890
<v 2>It was the basis of the bait. Once you get a Costner in the middle of it,</v>

30
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.250
then you can start to move. You got an interesting central character.

31
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.070
Then you bring in all these crazies that you read,

32
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.320
you read about people like Jack and Maui, Walter.

33
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.470
Matthau all the lunatics around new Orleans,

34
00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:08.150
Dallas involved in the war against Cuba, and you get Lee. And then,

35
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.670
so I wanted, then I wanted to Lee Harvey, Oswald character,

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.300
which is to tell a little bit of his story. So I had two stories,

37
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.110
Garrison and Oswald. I got to know marina. I didn't, you know,

38
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:23.060
the track to a lot of the Oswald story, not enough of it, but there's more now,

39
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.320
but it's,

40
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.730
he seems to have been definitely in the employ of the CIA when he went to Russia

41
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:31.790
the first time. And when he came back again, he was,

42
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.660
there's too much evidence of it. Yeah. We want to bring that out too. But,

43
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.760
uh, that story becomes, and then the third story would be the daily Plaza,

44
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.670
the actual asset fascination. So Garrison's not there.

45
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:47.510
He has to go back into the past to, to find this out, right?

46
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.220
So there's that thread, that whole Dallas section is part of the,

47
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.820
as part of the structure. It starts the movie, but it also,

48
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.070
we go back to it at the right time. And at the climax,

49
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:02.080
we go back to it for the time, the way, the way it probably happened.

50
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.860
C so then that's three stories. And then the fourth story,

51
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.650
if you want to know the truth in my thinking at that time was a Donald

52
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.100
Sutherland, a business that comes into the movie at the halfway point.

53
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.350
And he gives Garrison a lot of new information because Garrison

54
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:19.090
thinks he was dealing on a local level.

55
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.440
He thinks he's dealing with something that's in new Orleans.

56
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.690
He's not sure what beyond it. So he,

57
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.450
and now Hoehn says it's a much bigger story,

58
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.170
which sends Costner to the last act, going to Dallas.

59
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:36.220
And it's too much for the Costner character. He, you know,

60
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.440
he's blown away by it.

61
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.110
He knows he's up against forces are much larger than he ever thought.

62
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.290
<v 1>And this trial, who was the,</v>

63
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.010
what was the motivation for the Donald Sutherland character.

64
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.490
<v 2>Fletcher Prouty. He was a Lieutenant Colonel in the air force.</v>

65
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:54.090
He was the focal officer between the CIA and the Pentagon,

66
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.870
but an old timer world war II done a lot of service.

67
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.450
And he was in charge of basically providing the CIA with military

68
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:07.620
equipment for covert operations. He worked in Tibet.

69
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.210
He worked on a lot of the operations in the fifties and the late forties.

70
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.280
We had operations going on in Ukraine, uh, Ukraine,

71
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.710
uh, at China Tibet. He was, uh, he trained,

72
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.550
uh, Tibetans in the Colorado mountains and many stories.

73
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:29.700
He's written several books. Uh, he was, uh,

74
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.360
he was a keen observer of the differences that were going on.

75
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:38.160
He knew Dallas used to brief him and told me stories

76
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.310
about then everything changed after Kennedy was clearly described.

77
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.440
You got to meet him. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah.

78
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:46.800
I hung out with him here at Garrison, too. I mean,

79
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.780
both of these were authentic men and Fletcher described, you know,

80
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:55.290
the difference after November 63, he felt it right.

81
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:59.040
Or he left the Pentagon a year later. It was over, uh,

82
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.190
there was something that changed in the country and sure enough,

83
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:06.090
we were in Vietnam faster than you can imagine. The combat troops. Yeah.

84
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.760
<v 1>Another crazy character in that whole,</v>

85
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.300
the whole historical record is Jack Ruby. Yeah. He's a, he's a very strange one.

86
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:19.380
And uh, I just read a book called, uh, chaos by Tom O'Neill.

87
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.600
It's about the CIA and a Manson in the sixties. Oh yeah. I know the book. Yeah.

88
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:25.800
Yeah. It's very interesting.

89
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:30.750
But Ruby is in that book as well because Ruby was actually visited by,

90
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.880
I forget his name, jolly something jolly. What's his name?

91
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.110
Jolly west. Thank you. Um,

92
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.610
who was the central character in MK ultra,

93
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.530
who they believe was involved in these various? Uh, see.

94
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.150
<v 3>Yeah, that's a plastic. So.</v>

95
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.470
<v 1>Now it comes off my arm. Don't worry about it. I'm listening. Uh, but he was a,</v>

96
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:57.710
a central character in the CIA's of

97
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:02.000
LSD during the whole operation, midnight climax in San Francisco.

98
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.310
And they ran a free clinic and Haight Ashbury.

99
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:08.960
That's connected to Manson where they were giving people LSD and running

100
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:09.794
studies on him.

101
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.990
And he went up to visit Ruby in prison and Ruby who had shown

102
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:19.970
no psychological trauma or distress after he left was a mess

103
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.470
curled up in the fetal position on the ground and was thinking they were burning

104
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:28.280
Jews in the streets and literally was in a psychotic state.

105
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.300
And they think they dosed him up while he was in jail. Yeah.

106
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.890
He seems to be the mob connection.

107
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.690
<v 3>To this thing. Yes. Yeah. You can put your arm back back. Yeah. It's uh.</v>

108
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.200
<v 2>No, uh, rubies, uh, his contacts alone.</v>

109
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.730
It goes back many years to the forties. He was quite a,

110
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.880
he was mobbed up completely and didn't want to do it. He was forced into doing,

111
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.130
why do you think he was forced? What, what do you think it was?

112
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.290
I think he was scared about what, well,

113
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.710
I have never followed that in depth because the, you know,

114
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.660
people may say that we organized crime, killed him.

115
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:05.110
I don't believe that because they didn't have the power to pull this thing off.

116
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:07.570
I think that they they're an element to it. Yeah.

117
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.430
You wanted somebody to run out on his wall, right?

118
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.620
Probably on his wall was intended to die there on that day, USA. Uh,

119
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.280
there's a lot of things that pointed that direction, but he didn't,

120
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.450
and he couldn't be allowed to go to this crazy Jack Ruby to do. I mean,

121
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.330
they killed off that, oh, everything that I was all said,

122
00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:29.740
and that station police station has gone. Yeah, it's a hearsay. But, uh,

123
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.150
what he said in the corridor outside, it's very interesting. And, uh,

124
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.640
we know that Ruby was there. So it will be,

125
00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:39.580
I think was pushed into this thing because they had to make it,

126
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.730
it was a quick operation. You got to get to them, you know, and it's really.

127
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.580
<v 1>Crazy. The story plays out 12 years later,</v>

128
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.040
when on the Geraldo Rivera show,

129
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.630
Dick Gregory brings us a prude or film and introduce it to the American public.

130
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.990
And then they get the chance to see Kennedy's head going back into the left.

131
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.420
Yeah. And everybody's like, what? Yeah.

132
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.100
<v 2>That's disgusting story. But, uh, you know, the, on the, on the,</v>

133
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.500
on the Ruby affair, don't forget the will also,

134
00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:09.610
he was urgently asking the Warren commission, get me to Washington.

135
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:12.730
I want to talk to Jesus. You know what? He knew. He didn't know everything.

136
00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:15.490
I don't think anyone knew everything that he knew his part of it.

137
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.840
So the whole idea was how can you get cancer out of the blue like that?

138
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:24.070
So suddenly so suddenly and die so quickly. Now there again,

139
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:27.880
there's a lot of cancer experimentation going on at this point in the sixties,

140
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.070
the doctors in the MLK cancer too, there was a huge, huge,

141
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.450
uh, experiment. There was a doctor in new Orleans. I forgot his name,

142
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:41.560
but working on it. And Derek David ferry was one of these people who knew him,

143
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:46.660
very had a lot of mice and he was operating on his mind. He was using his mice,

144
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.790
his cancer, uh, feeding them huge doses of cancer.

145
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.950
The idea was that they said they were going to kill Castro with it, uh,

146
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.640
you know,

147
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.380
inject Castro with a needle and kill them because they make it so

148
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:03.150
strong. And they're getting this cancer to play.

149
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.950
They're building up through these mice,

150
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.720
a cancer that was so powerful that could kill. I mean,

151
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:13.080
I heard everything on this film, but that seems to be truth to this.

152
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.430
<v 1>Do you feel like you're going to put it to bed with this documentary in your,</v>

153
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:17.660
in your mind? Like you can.

154
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.370
<v 2>I mean, I'll have Jim to Eugenia working with me. He's, he's followed his thing.</v>

155
00:09:22.371 --> 00:09:26.960
Like he's a fifth generation researcher and he's very, very up to date, but, uh,

156
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.570
when is this coming out? It's I don't know yet. Well,

157
00:09:29.571 --> 00:09:32.660
I don't know if we can get it out. We're going to try. Okay.
