00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How, when you say get flack for it,</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:08.400
how much do you pay attention to criticism? Zero. Good for.

3
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.880
<v 1>You? Uh, I, I don't, I haven't read about myself in over a decade.</v>

4
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.160
<v 0>That's amazing way to.</v>

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.520
<v 1>Go. Well, the first time I did, I remember when I got a computer and I was like,</v>

6
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:23.990
oh, I mean, they, you, you can sometimes I feel like such a, like a dumb, nuts,

7
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.110
like, I'm like, oh, you can talk to someone. And like,

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.710
who's like into your tunes. It's like, I, I, and I did.

9
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.950
And you know, sometimes people like to bond over what they don't like.

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.650
And like,

11
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.230
and also they like to pretend it makes 'em feel better to pretend they have

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.860
intimate knowledge view, Joe Rogan. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; well,

13
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.300
the thing about Joe is you see, yeah. What he, and it's gotta be negative.

14
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.220
Some always. Oh, because it, it suggests that we're, we're close enough to,

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.860
I know his secrets, you know, he puts on good face for you,

16
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.540
but I know his Joe's secrets, man. So thing about Joe is, and it's,

17
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.250
it's a, it's, that's kind of an in. And so I, when I went on,

18
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:05.810
I was like, oh no, no, actually I'm doing this. And they said,

19
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:10.610
you're not the real, the, and I just let it be known. Uh, yes, I am.

20
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.210
And, and then all of a sudden it was like, Hey Josh, how? And I thought,

21
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:18.850
oh my God, this is, what am I gonna do? Go door to door and correct.

22
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:19.890
People's perception.

23
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.960
What happened in 1742 is it's, it's a waste of my.

24
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.040
<v 0>See some people who don't have like a,</v>

25
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.040
a wise sort of perspective on the internet getting wrapped up and

26
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:37.680
doing just that because they see them responding to criticism and going after

27
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:38.514
people and.

28
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.030
<v 1>You know what it's because, um, they, they don't want to be blamed.</v>

29
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.870
They don't wanna be misunderstood. Right. I totally understand. I understand.

30
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.830
My wife has been one of my biggest inspirations ever.

31
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.910
And like, um, that, that thing that I really learned from her is like the,

32
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.710
you can't blame when you blame someone it's like saying to them,

33
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.340
uh, when you point the finger,

34
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:09.940
it's like saying you are guilty before you even have a chance to talk and save

35
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:14.500
your perspective. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; what that's, nobody likes that.

36
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.940
You know what I mean? Nobody wants to like start by being blamed for something.

37
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.820
It makes you shut off immediately.

38
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.850
And now you have these disengaged people &lt;affirmative&gt; blaming each other and

39
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:29.930
being mean to each other. And again, if we're talking about doing what you like,

40
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.370
I don't like that. And, and,

41
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.850
and I also have friends that I really love that engage in that quite a bit,

42
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:37.370
and it's a trouble spot for them. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And so,

43
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.690
instead of doing it myself, I, I try to like, look at that and say, Ooh,

44
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.850
I don't, I don't want that. I,

45
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.600
I love my music and I try to make it as real as I can.

46
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.880
And I try to make it as different as I can. And that,

47
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.400
and I accept if you don't like it,

48
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.120
but if you have a vinyl or if you have a CD still, I love it.

49
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.760
And if you don't, it's still a hell of a coaster, right. It's not bad, you know,

50
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.720
I mean, could be a worse coaster. The art looks cool. You know, I,

51
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.320
I need to be okay with that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and accept that.

52
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.680
&lt;laugh&gt; because otherwise what I'm please like it. Well, you're also,

53
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.600
you're not looking at that review, right. That reviewer is wrong.

54
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.070
<v 0>You don't unmanageable numbers too. Right.</v>

55
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.390
Because you'd be interacting with literally thousands of people every day and

56
00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:24.111
trying to correct them.

57
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:27.030
And then once people find out that all they have to do to get your attention is

58
00:03:27.031 --> 00:03:27.864
to be negative.

59
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.670
<v 1>Then I've had moments of that before, because, um,</v>

60
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.990
I really have always cared about fairness and justice,

61
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.980
but especially in the last bunch of years, you know, it's like, um, uh,

62
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.420
I have to be okay with what I did for me. Mm-hmm,

63
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.700
&lt;affirmative&gt; people don't really know what the they're talking about and what

64
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:51.900
really goes on. But if my expectation is that I'm gonna get,

65
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.860
take everyone to a spot where like, this is what actually happened. Right. Um,

66
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.180
I'll, I'll be sad and disappointed. You.

67
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.690
<v 0>Also engaging people that don't want you to be a good guy. Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:06.850
So if they want to go, you, you just want us to think that of.

69
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.890
<v 1>Course. Yeah, of course. And, and, um,</v>

70
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.650
and I'm actually kind of investing time and energy into like, no, but yeah,

71
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:14.484
but no, right.

72
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.210
<v 0>I, I mean,</v>

73
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.570
you're investing time and energy also into your persona or your public percept,

74
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.600
public reception.

75
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.000
<v 1>To you. I don't have a persona. I've had many times where, because of being, um,</v>

76
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:26.400
like, oh,

77
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.840
like feeling strange about things or angry about things or this,

78
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.960
I, I take them out on stage some sometimes because I,

79
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.320
I grew up watching bands like,

80
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.150
and Iggy and all this stuff where sometimes you go see abandon, it's scary.

81
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.590
And it's wonderful to be scared by this music is like, whoa.

82
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.590
And everything that comes with it. It's so real look out. Right.

83
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:54.030
It can actually drive you backwards. That's exhilarating. And also on stage,

84
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.310
that's the place for that. Yeah. Out in real life, doing that,

85
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:02.060
like while you're at the ATM, not so much, you know what I mean? Yeah. But to,

86
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.900
to, to cut your tethers loose and go, I don't know what I'm gonna do tonight,

87
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.380
which I have done many times and walked out there,

88
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.140
but I will embody the emotion that I'm, uh, feeling right now. And,

89
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.020
and you can go ahead and take that to the ATM and deposit that cuz that's,

90
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:19.060
what's gonna happen. The problem is,

91
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.490
is if you're not doing well,

92
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.330
then that's how that.

93
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.370
<v 0>Yeah. You're gonna feel that when you get out there, but it is.</v>

94
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.370
<v 1>Supposed to, well, um, I'm willing to do anything up there. Uh,</v>

95
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.490
and I don't know why, because I feel like that's the place. That's why,

96
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.050
because that's the place for it. It's, that's the art of it. Well.

97
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.770
<v 0>It's also what you said that you enjoy the randomness of it. Yeah.</v>

98
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.400
I think that you're when talking about manifesting,

99
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.360
if you go up there with that spirit, that enjoying the randomness of it,

100
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.880
then that sometimes the spirit will move you in a direction that you didn't even

101
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:52.470
expect. Right.

102
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.120
<v 1>Well, yeah. I, um, yeah, because, um, you feel one with your actions.</v>

103
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.200
So in the, now you have no choice. Right. And, and preparation it's too late.

104
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.280
It's, it's already done the, the preparation is over. It's like a fight. Yeah.

105
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.560
That like, um, you're not gonna learn anything extra till it's over. Right.

106
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.440
Right. You know? Right. You have to be in the moment there. And um,

107
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.310
I enjoy that because enjoy that. It's too late. I love insurmountable odds.

108
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:22.230
That's all I need to do. Something is tell me, like,

109
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.750
there's no way you're gonna make it and be like, that sounds great.

110
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.470
Why do we have to worry? We're not gonna make it. You know what I mean?

111
00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:34.550
There's something to that. And, um, um,

112
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.980
but I also realized like how, um,

113
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.220
I guess the manifestation aspect of this has gotten important to me again,

114
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.140
cuz it's what I did in the beginning. And as I, you know,

115
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.380
have these moments of being lost and feeling like I don't understand what's

116
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:55.140
going on and wondering why, when really it's cuz of me mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

117
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.130
you know? Yeah. Um, that, um, &lt;affirmative&gt; that

118
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.930
the best thing I can do,

119
00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:04.490
that's why the records have gotten so dark cuz that's all,

120
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.770
all I'm seeing and it has to be real. So it is real dark, you know,

121
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.610
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but there's a beauty in that too,

122
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.570
but I don't wanna make my new normal &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

123
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.960
my dad's always like, don't get accustomed to, but you know, cuz it's like,

124
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.320
once you get used to that, you're like this, this is life. This is normal.

125
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:24.560
Right. Is everyone cool? And,

126
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.600
and people end up people you love end up going.

127
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.920
No it's not, you know? And, and you go wait a minute,

128
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.240
but I'm so used to it.

129
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.790
How I thought you were gonna hop in this jacuzzi me the tub of water's great.

130
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.830
It's, water &lt;laugh&gt;. And, and I, so, uh, I'm,

131
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.750
I'm really like, I'm so thankful, uh,

132
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.950
to have like a great group of a family of artists that I get to collaborate

133
00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:57.110
with and like my, uh, some great kids. I got three of them.

134
00:07:57.111 --> 00:08:00.100
Every time I go in a room, there's another one of them in the, there, you know,

135
00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:01.300
there's so many kids and,

136
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.740
and my wife who like really has the courage

137
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.340
to help has had the courage,

138
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.220
her whole life to like go that's it's time to, to go, you know,

139
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:20.650
it's time to do this. Like, you know, um,

140
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:25.330
someone that has really inspired me to have a

141
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:28.890
partnership like that is rad. Yeah. You know,

142
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:32.250
I mean talking about someone that

143
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.090
has had a really rough beginning, um,

144
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.720
but never blamed doesn't spend pointing the finger and blaming mm-hmm

145
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.000
&lt;affirmative&gt; cuz the goes nowhere.

146
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.040
Some of the most interesting people in the world,

147
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.920
the ones who had a rough beginning yeah. Because of the care coping mechanisms,

148
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:53.320
the pinballing off offer and getting to yeah. Wonderful strength. Yeah. Well,

149
00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:55.640
and that's the other thing is the strength mm-hmm,

150
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.480
&lt;affirmative&gt; the strength to, to go right now. And, and that,

151
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.400
that strength for is so

152
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.680
inspiring for me. It's it gives me strength through her, you know, it's like,

153
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:09.440
that's beautiful.
