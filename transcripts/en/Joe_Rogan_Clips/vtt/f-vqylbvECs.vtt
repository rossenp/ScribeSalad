00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So one thing that I wanted to bring up,</v>

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.100
we talked about before the podcast that I actually read a whole article about,

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.020
we were talking about on the podcast,

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:14.070
whether or not Chris Cuomo was really lifting a 100 pound barbell.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.370
Now I had completely forgot.

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.060
We even talked about this until I stumbled upon an article online about it.

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.190
And in the article, it actually referenced us talking about it on the podcast.

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.920
Right. And, uh, apparently wasn't,

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.630
they think I'm quite stupid for believing that Chris Cuomo really

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.610
had this a 100 pound barbell or dumbbell that he was

11
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:42.810
lifting. It looked very light. It did look very light, but so my thought was,

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.650
how big is Chris Cuomo? So that's a good point.

13
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:49.460
I thought he was bigger than he is Googled it. Yeah.

14
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.570
He's only 182 pounds, which it says he's

15
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.840
six, two, a hundred eighty two pounds. I don't know if that's accurate.

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.930
That's yeah. That's probably 2, 180.

17
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.520
<v 1>Well, he doesn't.</v>

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.910
<v 0>Be a lean thin guy. He doesn't look that, but anyway,</v>

19
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.120
that makes him 20 pounds lighter than me. Okay.

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.720
So very unlikely that he's carrying that Dumbo, right? Like that.

21
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:16.430
So then I'm like, okay, I got to ask some people who would actually know. So,

22
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.770
um, I sought out some people online and one of them was, uh,

23
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.690
Rob Carney. He's been on the podcast before. He's a world's strongest gay.

24
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.860
Oh yeah. I know that guy. He's awesome. Follow him. Love that dude. And uh,

25
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.840
I think he won recently a pound for pound strong

26
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:40.160
man title. I believe he's not a big guy. He's a, he's a tank tank,

27
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.790
but he's only about five 10 maybe. Um,

28
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.690
but gorilla strong. So, um,

29
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.340
so he says to me, uh, so I say to him, have you ever seen the thing?

30
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:56.480
And he says, I just watched a video. I think it's fake. LOL.

31
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.470
He doesn't look to be bracing hard enough for it to be actually a hundred

32
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:01.304
pounds.

33
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.710
<v 1>Yeah. It's kind of wishy washy in his seat.</v>

34
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.900
<v 0>He's a real expert. Right? So he's an actual strong man. So, uh,</v>

35
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.960
I'm pretty convinced. So then I asked Robert Oberst,

36
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.220
who's an all also Robert is enormous.

37
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.350
Absolutely. One of the strongest men in the world,

38
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.670
he's a Goliath sit next to him, 300 plus pounds.

39
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.110
So he says the picture looks possible because his elbows up and stable,

40
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.920
but the video where he's at his desk showing the weight off,

41
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.040
he moves it around, out at an angle.

42
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:38.600
That would be the smallest head of the top of the bicep, taking all the weight.

43
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.720
And it doesn't even phase him. He said, if it's real,

44
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.230
he's stronger than anyone I've ever seen. Use a dumbbell.

45
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.690
I'd say it's a 40 pound weight with a 100 pounds written on it.

46
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.700
He said, lots of Insta, famous lifters have faked dumbbells and plates.

47
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.080
Ah,

48
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.090
two X tyranny and Robert Oberst both of them call.

49
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.530
So I refer to the, I defer to that. Wow.

50
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.580
<v 1>It does. When he's sitting in the chair, the desk there, it looks very light.</v>

51
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.900
<v 0>182 Pounds. And that might not be true. Cause I bet if you Google,</v>

52
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.190
Google what my weight is, they probably don't know what my weight is.

53
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:15.780
Either a hundred pounds is a lot,

54
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.670
but 182 pounds for a managed six foot two is not a gorilla like Brendan

55
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.110
Shab okay. If Brendan Shaw was doing that, I'd go. I bet he could do that.

56
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.820
Brendan Shaw, Brett Baron and shops 270 pounds, 260 plus pounds.

57
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.680
He's huge. He's huge.

58
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.130
<v 1>Yeah. But even then, like even seems like, it seems like, it.</v>

59
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.510
<v 0>Seems like, yeah, I obviously didn't look at it close enough. And I also,</v>

60
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.540
I don't, I'm not a lifter in that sense. Like I don't,

61
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.890
I don't lift heavy weights. Like the heaviest I ever lift is like,

62
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.650
I might squat a couple of hundred pounds for reps,

63
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:51.900
but most of the I do is kettlebells. Right?

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.500
So I'm doing like the heaviest ones I do are like 90 pounds or maybe,

65
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.580
and that's rare.

66
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.600
Usually I'll use like a 70 pound kettlebell or 50 pound kettlebell,

67
00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:02.820
depending upon the exercise. They're not heavy. Right.

68
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.600
I'm doing like a functional movements that use your full body. Right.

69
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:09.780
So I'm not in that lifting world. But if you wanted to talk to like, um,

70
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.450
you'd have to talk to like the like CT Fletcher.

71
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:16.230
You'd have to talk to like those powerlifter dudes who really understand those

72
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:17.064
are the ones that, so.

73
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.620
<v 1>It's a little uncomfortable that I'm sitting right in front of you.</v>

74
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:23.340
And I'm not in the list of people that you're asking because on my Peloton,

75
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:26.700
there are three and a half pound weights that sit on the back of the seat.

76
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.050
And once in a while you have to take those out and curl them sometimes two in

77
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:34.560
one hand, mind you. And it is quite a workout.

78
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.540
<v 0>Okay. So he's 200 pounds.</v>

79
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.250
He says he went from 218 pounds to a pretty lean 200 pounds. He cut out,

80
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.840
uh, said he cut out about, cut dairy and bad sugar.

81
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.950
2014 cutback booze. So he's 200 pounds,

82
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.950
his body fat plummeted to 12%. Okay.

83
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.870
So he's dialed in on his stuff though. Right. But he's,

84
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.110
he's taller than me. And he's uh,

85
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.280
he's my weight is not, there's no way he's handling that weight like that.

86
00:05:05.281 --> 00:05:09.270
I can't handle that weight like that. Can we see the video? I'm Jackson.

87
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.910
<v 1>Oh man. I wish I didn't have my jacket on. I.</v>

88
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.970
<v 0>Would be showing you what's up. Show me what's up. Roy Jones Jr.</v>

89
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:18.840
Flexed his arm in that chair. He has two of mine.

90
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.280
Does he really on his left? It's crazy.

91
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.340
The left arm is so much bigger than his right?

92
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.490
Because he's got like probably one of the best left hooks.

93
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:29.700
Not probably one of the best left hooks, a human beings ever thrown.

94
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.380
So his left bicep is gigantic. It's so much bigger than his right.

95
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.580
He was joking around about it. But when he flexed you're like, Jesus Lord,

96
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.060
just like, uh, alien head in there. Yeah. See there it is.

97
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.030
<v 2>He does have shoulders.</v>

98
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.250
<v 1>Yeah. Well that move when he does that.</v>

99
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.520
<v 0>Well, that's not, that's kind of braced, dad's.</v>

100
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.340
<v 3>A hundred pounds. That's so heavy. A hundred pounds.</v>

101
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.060
<v 0>This is, this is where I'm less go back.</v>

102
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.150
That when he's doing the little hammer curls,

103
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.600
this is where I'm less likely to believe this one right here.

104
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.430
When he's doing that. He's not.

105
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.670
<v 1>Even, there's no strain at all.</v>

106
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.430
<v 2>In his back. I think it looks too light.</v>

107
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.360
<v 0>Yeah. It just doesn't look again. I don't know.</v>

108
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.420
This is not my world. I can.

109
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.630
<v 4>Show you a video of a guy about like the Bradley Martin. I do a of YouTube.</v>

110
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.320
<v 0>Right? Doing like hundred and 20 pound dumbbells. And he's struggling with those</v>

111
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.893
similar.

112
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.690
He's a giant who is Bradley Martin show Bradley Martin Bradley

113
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:32.980
Martin takes girls.

114
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.910
He puts like weights on bars and then has girls hanging on the bars and it

115
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.890
presses him. He's enormous. He's a YouTube famous lifter,

116
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.000
but all completely do this. He's he's cleaning and pressing a girl.

117
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.700
But the dude is like,

118
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.710
where's he like 6, 3, 6, 4, 2 70. Oh my goodness.

119
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.600
He's a huge man.

120
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.500
He's he's a huge legitimately huge man.

121
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.100
So he's struggling. There's a video of him on there with a hundred pound dog.

122
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.950
Well, I get my feet wet in that bar, but you know when he's,

123
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.230
when he's doing deadlifts, oh my gosh. Size, this.

124
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.860
<v 4>So much weight on the bar that.</v>

125
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.110
<v 0>Look at him and you go, oh, okay. Oh, that.</v>

126
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.860
<v 4>Real as. Cause people always say, it's fake. Leave the bar, Ben,</v>

127
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:19.390
this guy doesn't have to fake anything.

128
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.670
<v 0>Ain't no faking going on right there. That's good.</v>

129
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.240
The way that weight is moving, when you see the size of him too,

130
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:28.000
he's it all makes sense. But his tricep.

131
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.350
<v 1>Doesn't wiggle. When he points itself.</v>

132
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:34.623
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

133
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.430
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

134
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.580
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

135
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:43.720
They're going to be available everywhere.

00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:47.320
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

137
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.310

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.410
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

139
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:57.520
Buh-bye.
