00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You guys, you comedians,</v>

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:07.680
there must be every once in a while, like a real tragedy to process.

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:08.550
That must be very hard.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.250
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I it's, it's not that common. The comedians take their own lives.</v>

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:16.650
I mean, that does happen with Robin.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.810
Robin was a big one for a lot of people because he was,

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.090
he was not just a comedian.

8
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:24.210
He was like a cultural icon in terms of like his films.

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.950
You think of all the different movies like I was in.

10
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:27.840
And he had such a range too.

11
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.470
That's what you like to me when you know how brilliant a person really is. Like,

12
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.370
do you remember that film that he did about the, uh, crazy, uh,

13
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
film processing guy? It was like 24 hour film.

14
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.400
You remember those little film booths,

15
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.360
photo booths that people would go to bring back in the old days, you youngsters,

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.110
we would have a camera and the camera would have film in it.

17
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.410
And you'd have to bring the film to a place where processing and Robin Williams

18
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:57.270
did a film about a guy who was a psychopath who was obsessed with

19
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:01.410
someone from processing their picture one hour photo. That's what it was nice.

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.730
It was great. And you just, from that film,

21
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.080
you realize the range this man had, right? No. I mean,

22
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:14.880
from Goodwill hunting from, you know, somebody different, he was a genius.

23
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.020
Yup.

24
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.930
<v 0>Yeah. And, and the human race is so lucky to have geniuses in it.</v>

25
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.060
You know what I mean? Like we all feed off them.

26
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.270
<v 1>Yeah. And they elevate us.</v>

27
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.570
<v 0>And it costs them sometimes, but we all need, we need those people.</v>

28
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.150
<v 1>Yeah. To be a guy like that,</v>

29
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:34.110
to be dealing with the kind of RPMs he was dealing with,

30
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.130
you know, it would spit out these amazing works, but you know,

31
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:42.450
just a cost on himself.

32
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.890
<v 0>You know, in good VAR, good morning, Vietnam in the, in the initial few minutes,</v>

33
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.910
like, it's pretty clear that it wasn't scripted because the P you know,

34
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:54.300
there's this like kid in the control room. I mean, they concede is that as a,

35
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.850
it's a military DJ and radio announcer during Vietnam. Right. And,

36
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.481
and, uh,

37
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.420
the military command didn't really like him because he was saying things that

38
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.920
were sort of like, thought,

39
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.010
not sufficiently sort of respectful of the war or whatever,

40
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:10.800
but of course the troops loved him. Right. He was a real guy. Right.

41
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.720
And so Robin Williams,

42
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.750
it was pretty clear if you watch the beginning and it's worth watching it,

43
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.070
that he, that it wasn't scripted because the kid in the,

44
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:21.660
in the sound booth behind him,

45
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.050
you could watch him react to this like three minute,

46
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.020
like the outpouring for Robin Williams,

47
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.630
where he's like channeling different people. And it's all coming out.

48
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:35.310
It's totally insane. And this kid can't even stand up. He's laughing so hard.

49
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:37.260
I'm like, that's not acting right.

50
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.270
That's a guy actually has had no idea this was coming.

51
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.920
Right. Right, right. It's amazing.

52
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.710
<v 1>Yeah. I met him only once and I met him after one of my shows. I didn't know.</v>

53
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.260
I was talking to him until a couple of minutes into the conversation.

54
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.760
He had a crazy big white beard and he waited in line with everybody else to meet

55
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.160
me. And, uh, I was talking to him when he was 10. I always tell him, oh,

56
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.830
I love this bit. I love that. And I love how you put that together. I was like,

57
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.670
oh, thanks man. Thanks. I pre I'm like, holy.

58
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.060
This is Robin Williams. I didn't know.

59
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.140
I literally had no idea until like several minutes into our conversation.

60
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.650
He must have loved that. That was pretty cool, man. That's very cool.

61
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.590
It was cool that, you know, he, first of all,

62
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.400
was cool that he just went to the show by himself. Right. You know,

63
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.290
he decided he wanted to come see me.

64
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.540
Maybe somebody told him I was funny and he came to,

65
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.020
and then he waited in line to meet me and then wanted to talk about individual

66
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:36.400
bits and how he loved how I put this one together. And that one, it was crazy.

67
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.730
It was like, I realized in the middle of it, I'm like, oh my God,

68
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.160
that's awesome. It was, it was, it was pretty wild,

69
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.880
but that just shows you what kind of thoughtful person he was. You know,

70
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.340
he wasn't into being seen. In fact,

71
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.760
he had a baseball hat on and glasses and his crazy big white bushy beard

72
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.020
couldn't even recognize him.

73
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.300
