00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Is this a,</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.140
is this something that you still truly enjoy doing?

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.970
<v 1>I wouldn't say I ever enjoyed doing it really. I mean, I enjoy life.</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.730
I enjoy just, you know, staring at the sky from my hot tub.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.530
It's just that I want to carry on doing it rather than, you know, dying instead.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.900
<v 0>So almost an amazement, it's an investment, but it's also, I mean,</v>

7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:26.640
it's obviously some sort of an intellectual person.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.210
<v 1>No, not really. That's humanitarian pursuits. I mean,</v>

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.440
some people view it as an intellectual pursuit, but I don't, I really fail,

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.450
you know, I've ever, ever since I was a young kid,

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.960
I have wanted to spend my life making a difference to the world,

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.660
improving the quality. And of course, in this case,

13
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.740
quantity of life of humanity and I've,

14
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.280
I'm just one of those incredibly lucky people I've been able to end up in this

15
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:55.050
position of essentially leading the crusade to do that in the biggest

16
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:55.884
possible.

17
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.190
<v 0>So this is something that you felt compelled to do from a really early age.</v>

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.870
<v 1>Not this specific thing. So what actually happened was that as a teenager,</v>

19
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.780
having pretty much decided that this is what I wanted to do with my life.

20
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.170
The first thing I did was I got into artificial intelligence research.

21
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.660
And the reason that happened was because when I was a teenager,

22
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.720
I tried my hand at programming. I found out it was pretty darn good at it.

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.800
And I thought, well, okay.

24
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.980
One of the big problems in the world is the problem of work.

25
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.860
The fact that people have to spend so much of that time doing stuff that they

26
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:24.540
would not do unless they were being paid for it.

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.940
And therefore we need more automation.

28
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.710
So I'll work on that because I'm good at it.

29
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.800
And I had no reason at that time to believe that I was going to be any good at

30
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:34.410
biology, but specifically, particularly,

31
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.620
and there were other people who were particularly good at biology and I had made

32
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:38.790
the mistaken,

33
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.190
but absolute assumption that everybody realized that aging was by

34
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:45.780
far the world's biggest problem.

35
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.510
And therefore biologists would be working on it in grinding away.

36
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:50.640
And of course he didn't hear much, but Hey, it's a really hard problem.

37
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.870
So that's not a surprise.

38
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.620
So it wasn't till my late twenties that I found out that I was wrong.

39
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.910
What happened with that? I met and married a biologist, quite a funny one,

40
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.180
actually, who was a full professor at that time at UC San Diego.

41
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.860
She was in England on sabbatical. And, um, through her,

42
00:02:07.861 --> 00:02:10.170
I not only learned a lot of biology just by accident, you know,

43
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:10.981
over the dinner table,

44
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.720
but I also found out gradually that she wasn't interested in

45
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.270
aging. I just kind of, it hadn't occurred to me.

46
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.580
So it didn't come up in conversation.

47
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.380
I began to notice that it wasn't coming up in conversation.

48
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.980
I started asking questions and she would say things like, you know, well,

49
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.490
I mean, like it's just decay, isn't it? And I would say, well, yeah,

50
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.490
but so what, and she said, well, I mean,

51
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.690
you're not going to learn a fundamental truth about the universe from studying

52
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:41.280
decay. And I would say, well, that's true. Yes. But, but, but it's bad for you.

53
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.530
And she would say, but that's not my problem. And I would say, well,

54
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.740
it kind of is. And that would be about as far as we would ever get.

55
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.320
So eventually I came to terms with it because it wasn't just her,

56
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.470
of course it was all the other biologist that was meeting. Um.

57
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.780
<v 0>And the strange closed-mindedness.</v>

58
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.160
<v 1>Well, you know, as I say,</v>

59
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.180
have had to find ways not to think about H and so eventually I thought, well,

60
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:07.360
that's just won't do. And I had, I bet I switched fields.

61
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.750
And I happened to have, um,

62
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.200
invaded myself into a position where switching fields was something I was able

63
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:18.670
to do. I had a very undemanding job at the university of Cambridge doing

64
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:20.800
bioinformatics, um,

65
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.030
which allowed me to do my artificial intelligence for search in my spare time.

66
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.700
I was being paid well enough. And, you know,

67
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.680
I had access to the university facilities and all that.

68
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.640
So all I needed to do was repurpose my spare time and, you know,

69
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.000
paying my way to go to conferences because of course back then nobody knew me

70
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:41.080
and I wasn't being invited. Um, and, um, so I, I know it went pretty well.

71
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:44.320
I started doing quite well received stuff. Uh, and, uh,

72
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.790
so I became quite well respected in the field very quickly. Um,

73
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.400
and for the first five years, that was all that was happening.

74
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.550
Cause I was basically harmless and it was then five years in,

75
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.550
in the year 2000 that I had this kind of Eureka moment,

76
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.940
fat damaged repair was the way to go and stay talking about what the impact

77
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:01.774
could be.

78
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.050
And people started to think I had gone completely crazy and it took a little

79
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:07.840
while for people to, um, come around.

80
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.260
<v 0>So w when you say that, uh, at an early age,</v>

81
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.540
you felt compelled to try to help people, like what, what was.

82
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.480
<v 1>So what actually happened was this,</v>

83
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.550
it was all down to my mother's desire for me to practice

84
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.930
the piano. Um, you know, she, wasn't a particularly good pianist herself,

85
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.470
but she wanted me to learn how to black, how piano. And so she was,

86
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.500
she put pressure on me to practice all the time and I was resistant,

87
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.780
but somehow or other,

88
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.940
my mother had already instilled in me a sense of introspection, you know,

89
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:42.160
a desire to understand why I thought what I thought.

90
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.840
So I actually decided to think about why I didn't want to play the piano.

91
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.050
And it took very little time for me to realize that the fundamental reason that

92
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:56.890
I didn't want to spend so much time tapping away on this thing with the

93
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.670
best case scenario, outcome of this would be that I would become a good pianist.

94
00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.090
And that was just not good enough, you know,

95
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.320
because there were already lots of other good pianists. So I would not be,

96
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:08.710
you know,

97
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.030
contributing significantly to the quality of life of mankind by becoming just

98
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:17.230
another one and additional That's right. And so I thought, well, I won't do,

99
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:17.830
but could have.

100
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.600
And of course this was gradual after that probably eight or nine.

101
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.790
Um, so over the next few years,

102
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:29.680
I'm going to say this general idea that I playing the piano was a waste of time,

103
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.880
um,

104
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.830
crystallized into the understanding that I could actually articulate that

105
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.640
I wanted to make a difference to the world. And, um, so that's how I, you know,

106
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.660
by the time I was 15 was when I started programming and I've just taught you the

107
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:44.200
rest.

108
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.490
<v 0>That's an interesting mapping out of your future, you know, at nine years old,</v>

109
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:52.330
recognize that you're not going to make a significant contribution to the world

110
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.270
by doing something that other people have already done. Yeah, that's right.

111
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.340
That's a really interesting way to look at the world where you're nine.

112
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.610
I have a nine-year-old daughter. I can't imagine her thinking like that.

113
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.000
<v 1>I mean, when I started, um,</v>

114
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.400
working actually at this bioinformatics project that I mentioned, um, I came,

115
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.600
I had a lot of exposure to a lot of top flight biologists

116
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.330
and it turns out that there were fields that were just fashionable.

117
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.280
Right? Yeah.

118
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.230
And lots of top biologists would be competing for separately with each other to

119
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:29.390
make the next advance in one particular narrow,

120
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.440
narrow area that was just really fashionable and other areas would be completely

121
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:37.160
neglected. And I thought, well, if going on here,

122
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:41.630
why are these smart people choosing to do something

123
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.340
that minimizes the likelihood that they having an impact? In other words,

124
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.340
basically, whatever they, whatever they find out,

125
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.540
they didn't matter. They themselves didn't matter at all,

126
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:55.850
because they could have been hit by a truck or done something a bit different

127
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.820
than someone else would have found out the exact same thing, 10 minutes later.

128
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.540
So they were making no difference. I never understood.

129
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.440
I still don't understand it.

130
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.580
<v 0>So you've always felt compelled to make a difference.</v>

131
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.200
Is that something that your mother instilled in you?

132
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.610
Is it something you just had? Is that, yeah.

133
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.710
<v 1>Well, I don't really think my mother instilled in me.</v>

134
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.100
I think the introspection was, and I, I, if you ask me how she did that,

135
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:19.700
I had no idea, but, um, but yeah, somehow,

136
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.160
nah, I don't think that, um, um, but no, I think the, um,

137
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.040
the wanting to make a difference, he just intrinsic in me.

138
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:32.450
And that's something that I just realized as a result of the introspection.

139
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.330
<v 0>When you look back at that now that's gotta be an interesting course where you</v>

140
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:42.980
you've recognized at a very young age that you wanted to make some sort of a

141
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:43.814
difference.

142
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.990
But th knowing that you had had that epiphany at a young age,

143
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:49.620
when it comes to like being a pianist or,

144
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.420
or doing something that's going to significantly impact people that is not a

145
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:57.740
standard path, that many people are gone. That's a,

146
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:00.560
it's a very interesting way to set up your life.

147
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.400
<v 1>Well, I wouldn't say I sat my life up. I say, I would say I had intentions,</v>

148
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.890
but if we look at how I got from there to here,

149
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.800
[inaudible] enormous amount of, it was just sheer luck. Right. I mean, you know,

150
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.400
people's lives. Right, exactly. So I would say, you know, I had a,

151
00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.720
I had a hope I had a, you know, general aspiration,

152
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.170
but, you know, I would say that, um,

153
00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.290
I'm just incredibly privileged to have been able to reach the pinnacle of my

154
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:39.800
chosen field of endeavor. You know, hardly, anyone can say that. Yes.

155
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.200
<v 0>No, that is you're you're, you're also, well, you fit the part too.</v>

156
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.590
You're a weirdo, you know, I mean, you know, you're a weirdo.

157
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.880
<v 1>Suddenly, you know.</v>

158
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.810
<v 0>I say that with all due respect in a compliment as well. Of course.</v>

159
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.760
<v 1>It, it, it definitely, yeah.</v>

160
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.080
It's definitely difficult to make a difference to the world if you're following

161
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:04.050
the rules. And so I'm,

162
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.700
I'm always instinctively looking for ways to do

163
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:13.140
things that other people might've overlooked. I mean, even trivial things.

164
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.380
<v 0>Is there anything that frustrates you about this pursuit?</v>

165
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.220
<v 1>I'm not easily frustrated kind of guy. I mean,</v>

166
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:24.870
of course sometimes it gets to me hustler, how slowly things are going,

167
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.160
how resistant people are, how irrational the resistance is.

168
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.760
But even that, you know, I've, you know,

169
00:09:31.761 --> 00:09:34.830
I've already from some of the things I've already said, you understand that I'm,

170
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.610
I'm, I'm really sympathetic to humanity in this regard.

171
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.550
I understand that most people just, you know,

172
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.370
the psychological burden of the,

173
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.190
the prospect of physiological decline is so enormous

174
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.090
that they've got no choice. They've got to put it out of their mind. And,

175
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:57.840
you know, some people fail, I don't know, psychologically stronger or whatever,

176
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:02.370
and they can bite the bullet and actually work on this, even though it's a very,

177
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:04.980
very long haul. Uh, but some people aren't,

178
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.080
and that doesn't mean that they are no more,

179
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.540
that are less deserving of the benefits.

180
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.200
<v 0>It's a very strange thing where people put on intellectual blinders and they're</v>

181
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:16.020
talking about aging and dying. It is very weird.

182
00:10:16.021 --> 00:10:19.620
Have you had heated discussions with other intellectuals about this?

183
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:21.990
Because I would imagine all the time. All the time.

184
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.250
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the whole thing came to me first when I was at Cambridge,</v>

185
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:30.570
actually as an undergrad, this was sometime before. Of course it's early 1980s.

186
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.030
Um, so when I was in my first year, I probably 1982, uh,

187
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.180
I brought in a stage hypnotist to do a show.

188
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:42.930
You ever seen a stage hypnosis show? Okay. So this guy, you know,

189
00:10:42.931 --> 00:10:47.010
he's got an audience of a few hundred people, all of us can be undergraduates.

190
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.570
And, um, so the first step is, you know,

191
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.760
do some stuff that gets some particularly amenable

192
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.620
people into a light trance.

193
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.450
And he brings a few of them up on stage and starts to go further. Right. Um,

194
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.080
so there was this one particular part of the show that stuck in my mind, uh,

195
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.870
what happened was this one guy was brought up and got into a really,

196
00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:14.820
really deep trance. And then the next step was that the hadn't this says,

197
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.630
okay, this is actually your right elbow. And this is your laptop. I,

198
00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.420
they switched the guy to elbows, right? No elaboration of the continent,

199
00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:24.660
the implication for there just getting the person to completely,

200
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:29.370
completely implicitly believe this thing. Right. And then he said, right.

201
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.930
I would like you please to touch your right elbow with your left forefinger.

202
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.530
Right. And so of course there was all this wrangling and writing and so on.

203
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.060
I couldn't do it. Right. Um, and that was funny in and of itself. Um,

204
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:47.070
but that wasn't the photographs. What happened next was the key thing. The,

205
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.020
he says, okay, you can stop now.

206
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.470
And the guy stops and says, he couldn't do Goodyear.

207
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.550
And the guy says now, and then they, he said,

208
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.720
why not ask the guy to explain why he couldn't

209
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.240
and here is the code across,

210
00:12:04.241 --> 00:12:09.010
because what happens is the guy gives a completely unhesitating lucid,

211
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.650
grammatically correct explanation for why he couldn't do it.

212
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:15.400
And the explanation of course will have the hole in it, the size of Canada.

213
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.210
But the fact is that I won't see it.

214
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.920
He'll just be sitting there with a straight face just doing this.

215
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.760
And his friends came down to graduates, right? High IQ,

216
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.640
highly respect for each other's intellectual [inaudible] for their own

217
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.550
intellectual rationality. And, um,

218
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:38.530
and that rolling in the aisles and the guys just all affected.

219
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.030
So, um,

220
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.050
when I started to have these discussions with people about aging and started to

221
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:48.700
find out that people make these unbelievable

222
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.630
arguments in favor of it, um, you know, I got this right.

223
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.310
I call it the pro aging trance.

224
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.040
And it was based on that experience from my youth.
