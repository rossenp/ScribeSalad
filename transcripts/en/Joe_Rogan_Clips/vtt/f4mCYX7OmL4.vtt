00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I wanted to come. I wanted to tell you, I got,</v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.910
I got beef with Malcolm Gladwell. Really? You spoke to him,

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.220
you need to connect us. What do you have.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.053
<v 1>Beef with them about?</v>

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.750
<v 0>I love him. Right? Listen, listen to his stuff all the time.</v>

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.880
And then he, uh,

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.370
he did something with some guy and I think he was a little tipsy,

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.330
but he was talking about how he could do stand up. Doing stand up is easy.

9
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.240
He really said that. He said, I want to send you the clip. Oh.

10
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.960
And I just want to be like, Malcolm, come on fam. He said that. Yeah.

11
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.290
Or something. I have to find it. He was like doing standup. It's nothing. But,

12
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.400
and he intellectualized it.

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.520
It's a certain set of thing in the room with people drinking.

14
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:43.080
And he tried to like, and I want him to feel it, like I want him to. And so.

15
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.360
<v 1>That's like a guy who watches a fight and thinks I'll that.</v>

16
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.310
<v 0>And when he said that, I was like, Malcolm, you come on man.</v>

17
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.680
And it's like, like I couldn't watch him anymore. I was like so angry. And uh,

18
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.740
and I, I watched a few clips of him here and I was like, man, I miss Malcolm.

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.290
But, uh, he needs to know you can't be.

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.090
<v 1>If it's really said that, he's he just, he.</v>

21
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.933
<v 0>Doesn't.</v>

22
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.900
<v 1>Know. It might just not understand what it is, but.</v>

23
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.810
<v 0>I want him to, I want him to out, like,</v>

24
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:13.270
I want to take him to a black room or him like the realist.

25
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.300
You know what I mean? Go do your thing, man.

26
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.640
<v 1>I might as well see it. Just see him bomb. Just feel it. Cause you just crackle.</v>

27
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.230
Feel the heat coming off his body.

28
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.640
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Yes.</v>

29
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.620
I mean, it's like, to me, it was like, man,

30
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.220
you wrote a book about 10,000 hours and you sitting there going, I can do this.

31
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.590
It's like, come on, man. Don't do that.

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.610
<v 1>It seems like,</v>

33
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.280
but this is what I've been saying about standing for awhile is that if you talk

34
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:42.330
to someone, they, a lot of people have been funny in their life.

35
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.720
Most people said something funny or everyone can talk. Right.

36
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.420
So all you're doing up there is talking and you say something funny.

37
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.070
It seems like I can do it. Yeah.

38
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.310
<v 0>Yeah. But you're, you're talking and saying something funny.</v>

39
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.490
The people who know you and love you and know your quirks and your ticks and all

40
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:57.300
that stuff.

41
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.590
You're in front of strangers who may or may not be in that audience.

42
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.530
<v 1>That's the difference, Jean? I don't know if you've ever seen this,</v>

43
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:09.060
but there's a lot of people that are maybe podcasters or they do other

44
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:13.830
things. And then they're doing standup. Occasionally their crowd. Yes.

45
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.380
And they think, yeah, they're doing good standup.

46
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:20.820
But then they'll go on in the store and they'll get sandwiched into a lineup in

47
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:25.110
the, or of murderers. And then it's a glee.

48
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.330
It gets ugly because reality sets in because if they're all there

49
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.270
to see you and they're all your fans and they paid money to hear you talk,

50
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.110
they just want to see you like, Hey, there's the guy from the show.

51
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.110
<v 0>Yay. And they probably never been in the.</v>

52
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.770
<v 1>Comedy club.</v>

53
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.770
So if Malcolm is doing these speeches and he's doing these speeches in front of

54
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.070
these large audiences, he's probably said some funny things.

55
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.590
So he probably thinks that he can do stand up.

56
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.150
<v 0>But when he got, I was like, ah, man, I need, I need, I need this.</v>

57
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:55.440
I need to find dude, I need to talk.

58
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.700
<v 1>It's not one it's. I don't think people understand what it is. It's a weird,</v>

59
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.370
it's a very weird art form because I don't,

60
00:03:02.371 --> 00:03:06.250
I think it's only truly appreciated by people who've done it.

61
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.000
Like truly appreciate it in terms of what's actually happening. Yeah.

62
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.160
And it took me years to realize that what was going on when you're killing

63
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.590
is a sort of a form of hypnosis. There's a, the ma the,

64
00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:23.380
the audience is letting you into their mind and they're letting you think for

65
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.970
them. That's why when you have clunky or you blow yourself up, or you,

66
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.080
you have a distorted perception of yourself, or you have too many words,

67
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.110
it's like annoying. It's frustrating. It's hard for people to absorb.

68
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.530
You lose some of that grip that you have on them.

69
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.360
But when someone has an economy of words and they lock in and their

70
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.810
jokes are tight, and then they keep going and going, you're lost.

71
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.560
You're lost in their thoughts. You just let those people carry. I love it.

72
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.690
And then my favorite thing is to sit in the audience and loves someone kill it.

73
00:03:53.691 --> 00:03:57.250
I just go along with them. Like, ah, it's so fun. It's so fun.

74
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:02.140
But to break that down to just sentences and words, and you say this,

75
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:04.960
and you say that it's not, that there's so much more to it.

76
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.110
<v 0>There's so many elements. That's basically back to Malcolm Gladwell, man,</v>

77
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.630
Malcolm, you're crazy. You in these comedy streets for him.

78
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.940
<v 1>Malcolm, I'll pull you up. I want them to go right after</v>

79
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.150
Or even.

80
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.800
<v 0>Uglier. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I was like, oh God,</v>

81
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.140
like for real, as my wife, like, I couldn't, I can't,

82
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:31.240
I couldn't listen to him for a minute. And that was my man,

83
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.530
because he had these podcasts when he was dissecting stuff. And you know.

84
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.660
<v 1>He's a brilliant guy. Fantastic.</v>

85
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:41.550
Sometimes brilliant people overestimate their perceptions. They, they,

86
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.520
they overestimate their, their ability to break something down. Yes. I mean,

87
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.050
I've had conversations with people about fighting that way, where people say,

88
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:52.930
Hey, if anybody ever came out to me, I would do this. And then I would do that.

89
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.070
Like they say that in my, oh, okay. This is, uh, it's hard for me to hear.

90
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.620
I'm just going to let you talk because really I want to just tackle you right

91
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:00.640
now. Chose the light.

92
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.620
<v 0>Down here. I wasn't ready. I wasn't.</v>

93
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.480
<v 1>Ready. But people have this idea.</v>

94
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.530
Cause the person moves in a way that's similar to the way that they can move.

95
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:11.260
They think I can do that. I lift weights. I'll that guy up.

96
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.870
They have these ideas and they think, oh, he's out there talking.

97
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:17.860
I'm a brilliant guy. I'm smarter than them. I understand things. I write.

98
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.430
I'm always performing because I'm always talking about this. I stand up.

99
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:22.264
It'd be easy.

100
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.670
<v 0>I literally yelled. I was at Malcolm. What did I do to you take so personal?</v>

101
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.370
Like, why are you taking my big man?

102
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.440
<v 1>I criticized them. I didn't have to hear his exact quote.</v>

103
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:34.300
I got to send it to you. Have we found it? He was.

104
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.130
<v 0>Feeling sorry. It's him. And another guy.</v>

105
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.090
<v 2>He was talking about jobs that are really hard. And he picked standup comedy.</v>

106
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.780
And there's a couple of quotes that guide defended stand up comedy very.

107
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.613
<v 1>Well. It seems like,</v>

108
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.800
but is this something that you and I couldn't figure out where.

109
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.960
<v 2>Where exactly was it on somebody else's post the podcast.</v>

110
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.250
It did somewhere like an interview.

111
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.850
<v 1>Okay. So you saw it in quotes, right? Right. Yeah. Can I see the quotes?</v>

112
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.560
<v 2>It wasn't very fit. Wasn't very.</v>

113
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 1>Clear. Oh, okay. So, but basically give me your synopsis of it. Then.</v>

114
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.690
<v 2>He thought people were too drunk. So it was really easy. Like it was,</v>

115
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.570
the room was set up for them. They're coming to see them. So it's easier.

116
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.740
He just doesn't know like he's guys a very like singular.

117
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.930
He must've been like one or two standup shows and just like, oh wow.

118
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.450
<v 1>He's right. Sometimes though. He's right.</v>

119
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:20.750
Sometimes we've all seen shells where people are laughing at. I didn't.

120
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.490
<v 0>Wanna, I didn't wanna hear it from him. Right?</v>

121
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.163
<v 1>Well,</v>

122
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.580
it was a show and you went on Jessel.

123
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.930
Nick went on and Diaz, maybe Louis CK dropped.

124
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.890
Right? Dave Chappelle did 10 minutes there.

125
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.130
Good luck. Not having a heart attack.

126
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.860
<v 0>All right. Go have fun, man. Go, go, go.</v>

127
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.960
<v 1>But he's also right in that we've all seen mediocre thoughts</v>

128
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.310
get passed off and the audience laughs like there's certain clubs.

129
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.810
I don't want to mention any names,

130
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.140
but you can go to them any night of the week in Burbank or in north Hollywood.

131
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.210
And you can see locations, dog, comedy and people are laughing.

132
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.090
They're laughing. And it's like real clunky.

133
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.400
<v 0>Low rent. What if that's the only, that's where he was like in those rooms,</v>

134
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:09.910
it could be.

135
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.480
<v 1>He was straight. But I mean,</v>

136
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.980
this is a difference between talking about any sport,

137
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.760
right?

138
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.300
You could watch someone do it poorly on a playground or you could watch someone

139
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:24.980
do it exquisitely as a professional and he'd go, oh, oh, here it is.

140
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.900
Gladwell stated comedians deal with people in a tightly controlled setting.

141
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.610
And that he can not imagine an easier set of circumstances for navigating a

142
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:38.780
social situation. And that of a standup comedian, they go to Vegas,

143
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.760
they go to the comedy cellar, they control their environments, man. I was like,

144
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.990
this, this is what is this article? That's a on it.

145
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.940
What's it from Malcolm Gladwell fails standup comedy one-on-one yes. So.

146
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:53.840
<v 0>Wrote that. See that's how I.</v>

147
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.840
<v 1>Was it, uh, was the person who wrote it</v>

148
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:00.110
was have their name anywhere. I had it.

149
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.370
<v 2>Really? The guy is the.com. Nathan timmel.com.</v>

150
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.740
<v 1>Nathan. Yeah. Well he's right. Yeah. That's right. Yeah.</v>

151
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:14.150
I mean he's in Malcolm's right. In a sense. He's right. In a sense.

152
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.100
But he doesn't understand is there's a mind wrestling that's going on

153
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.500
before you actually go and do that and to sort of

154
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:28.490
diminish the difficulty of that. It just shows that you haven't done it.

155
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:29.330
That's what it felt like.

156
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.130
<v 0>Yeah. And so I was like, I can't listen to this. Cause I couldn't, I couldn't.</v>

157
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.370
Cause he said it in the same exact voice, he says everything else.

158
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.860
And so when he's breaking down something that I really want to.

159
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.890
<v 1>Hear him dissect. He's so brilliant in so many different ways. I couldn't.</v>

160
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.723
<v 0>Shake it. I was like, ah.</v>

161
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.920
<v 1>Yeah. That 10,000 hour. Yeah. He wrote outliers. Right? That's him, right? Yes.</v>

162
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.880
Yeah. That, that book is amazing. It talks about the Beatles and how the beat,

163
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.530
like people think the Beatles came out of nowhere.

164
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:59.460
Those did thousands and thousands of shows that's what's up, it's just numbers.

165
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.950
It's numbers and concentration and focus.

166
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:06.450
And just that being what you really want. It's not just numbers.

167
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.770
It's numbers of like passion, numbers of focus. Yeah. Yeah.

168
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.400
He's wrong. He's wrong. But I get it.

169
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.120
I get why he thinks that it's it is a tightly controlled environment,

170
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:21.720
but it's so easy to bomb in that tightly controlled environment. He has no idea.
