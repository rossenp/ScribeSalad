00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Where there's the CDC.</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.340
<v 1>Now the world here to Fowchee said us government held off promoting face masks</v>

3
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.610
because it knew shortages were so bad that even doctors couldn't get enough.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.130
So is he just saying that now.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.740
<v 2>This morning, or today, since we start.</v>

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.550
<v 3>So guess what you all, every, we all got lied.</v>

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.900
<v 2>To. No, I got lied to.</v>

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.190
<v 3>Held off on promoting face masks because it knew shortages were so bad.</v>

9
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.120
Doctors couldn't.

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.660
<v 1>Get enough. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.040
Recently the CDC said the only people that should be wearing masks are people

12
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.390
that are treating COVID patients and that regular people shouldn't be wearing

13
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:36.200
masks.

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.490
And then the world health organization said that asymptomatic people it's

15
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:43.550
extremely rare that they transmit to other people.

16
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.350
So we were worried about asymptomatic people,

17
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.880
which is the reason why we kept kids out of school.

18
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.890
<v 3>And we were worried about overwhelming the hospitals,</v>

19
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:51.560
which is why we did all this other stuff as well. Me.

20
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.100
<v 1>Crazy about my kids' school. I was like, Hey, you this.</v>

21
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.510
Doesn't even kill the kids. It's killing. The kids. Get killed by the flu.

22
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.890
Meanwhile, you don't even scan the teachers or the staff or anybody.

23
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.960
People have the flu. They didn't want to miss a day of work.

24
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.140
They just show up and give it to everybody. That's normal.

25
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.220
And kids actually die from the flu. And it's not a small number.

26
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.540
It's not a small number of people that die from the flu last year was 62,000.

27
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.360
I mean, it's not as many as COVID, but then you're hearing,

28
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.430
you're hearing two camps. You're hearing one,

29
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.340
the COVID deaths are actually underreported.

30
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.230
Cause a lot of people die from COVID and they don't even register it. Okay, boy,

31
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.120
I guess it's worse than it is. And then you're hearing. No, no, no.

32
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.950
Actually we're getting incentivized to report deaths as COVID Elon Musk on the

33
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:40.520
podcast said if you got killed by a shark, but you were COVID positive,

34
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.670
they would list it as a COVID debt. Obviously he was being facetious. Yeah,

35
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.530
but not entirely because there's a lot of people with leukemia that also had

36
00:01:48.531 --> 00:01:50.990
COVID listed as a COVID death, obesity,

37
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.030
heart attacks listed as a COVID death because they tested positive for COVID

38
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.170
cancer also had COVID COVID death. I mean.

39
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.730
<v 3>That's really disturbing. You know, when you hear those statistics,</v>

40
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:06.530
then you see these things that they're saying.

41
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:09.890
And just the lack of trust that you end up with the government when the

42
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:14.450
government is already people just generally don't really trust the government a

43
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.130
lot. Right? Right. There's no one.

44
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.280
That's always thinking the government is always giving them the straight skinny.

45
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.870
<v 1>Back to this click baity.</v>

46
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.160
My wife pointed out this story yesterday where she's reading about this kid that

47
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.400
died 17 year old kid, perfectly healthy.

48
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.120
It says she reads into the article type one, diabetes

49
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.620
type one. Diabetes is not perfectly healthy. No,

50
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.100
that's really sick and dangerous. And you have to take insulin to stay alive.

51
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.670
<v 3>Yeah. And think you can get complications from that. Like, oh,</v>

52
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.610
everyone's living type one. Diabetes. Diabetics can live real normally.

53
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.340
And then they can have an instance that causes them to die. Yeah.

54
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
<v 1>They can have their foot removed. Yeah. There's all sorts of that goes wrong.</v>

55
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:56.480
When you have diabetes, your immune system is severely compromised,

56
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.300
but it's like, we're w we're our information. It's not pure.

57
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.810
We're getting all this money thing and Fowchee telling us the only reason why

58
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:07.900
they told us not to wear a mask is because they knew he didn't have enough.

59
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.320
Like, holy, how many people died because of that? You.

60
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.950
And then the world health organization says actually, no one died because.

61
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.100
<v 4>Of that. You don't have to worry about it. You really don't need to wear a mask.</v>

62
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.110
Like what is happening?

63
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.470
<v 3>I think so much of this ego plays so much into this of people not wanting to</v>

64
00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:29.250
admit they're wrong. Not wanting to. Here's another thing that people won't say.

65
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.790
I don't know. Right? I don't know. Like as a leader,

66
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.780
I've been in situations where I did not know this.

67
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.260
This is something I tell leaders all the time. I say, listen,

68
00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:39.570
tell your people the truth about what's happening. By the way,

69
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.780
we're seeing examples of where this is factually not happening inside America.

70
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.420
Right now, if you're a leader, tell the people the truth about what's going on.

71
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.140
That's what you need to do. And then people come back to me and they say, well,

72
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:53.280
what if, what if I don't know? What, what if I don't know the truth?

73
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.090
Then what you do is you say, Hey, I don't know the truth. Hey guys,

74
00:03:57.091 --> 00:03:59.250
I don't know. I don't know exactly how this is going to play out.

75
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.960
These are some contingencies that I'm preparing for that is so much more

76
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:08.610
acceptable from the troops. Then when you try and pretend like,

77
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.650
you know what you're talking about? It, it turns out you're wrong, right?

78
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.460
I mean, Trump does this so much that people lose track of it, right?

79
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:15.900
Where he thinks something.

80
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.550
And he just goes out on a limb and he just walks right out on a limb and says,

81
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.120
Hey, this COVID self will be gone in a week. And, and you know,

82
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.180
then he just saw his off the limb behind his foot. He does that all the time.

83
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.510
It's,

84
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.870
it's a good example of how not to lead because then people start to trust you

85
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.790
less and less. And then when things like this happened,

86
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:35.940
where you find out that they actually did purposely.

87
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.400
Now think if they would have said this, like, oh, we're worried about,

88
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:40.710
we don't have enough masks. Then you know what? You come out and say,

89
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.390
you come out and you say, listen to everyone.

90
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.350
We're not a hundred percent sure what the masks do for people.

91
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.560
But we do know this inside of a medical environment,

92
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.610
we have to prioritize getting those people that are absolutely exposed.

93
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.050
These masks. That is why we are going to put, uh, uh,

94
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.430
some kind of a control over who's allowed to buy them. You just tell the truth.

95
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.990
It was kind of happening.

96
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.960
<v 1>At some places like Amazon was only doing that. The only sell on those,</v>

97
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.370
what does it? N 95. Yeah. They were selling them only to hospital workers.

98
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:14.970
And they were allocating them along with, uh,

99
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:19.560
other types of a hand sanitizer. And there's a bunch of different things.

100
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:22.150
They were selling specifically to them first and first.

101
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.450
<v 3>Perfect example. What you don't do is say, Hey, everyone, don't worry about it.</v>

102
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.410
Right, right. Were.

103
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.460
<v 1>Found she did. But if him, if he's saying that like, well, Hey,</v>

104
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.890
oh now we can't trust you ever again.

105
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.100
<v 3>Exactly. Yeah. That's, that's the freaking problem.</v>

106
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.340
You're looking at this guy next time. There's some kind of disease next time.

107
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.380
There's a problem. Yeah. How do we know? We can listen to your ideas.

108
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.120
<v 1>Also thing he was saying a couple of weeks ago,</v>

109
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:47.850
the United States doesn't open up soon. We could,

110
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.680
we could face permanent damage. I was like, oh, economic damage. Yeah.

111
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.520
Permanent economic. Yeah. And I'm like, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey,

112
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:59.510
how come you say this before? How come you didn't say, Hey,

113
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.470
we have to weigh in the pros and the cons here. You know.

114
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.180
<v 3>You, you should have, and this is actually something that I, uh,</v>

115
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.670
I talked to Peter T about it. I said, Hey,

116
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.860
it seems like maybe some people should be quarantined and other

117
00:06:14.861 --> 00:06:17.650
people shouldn't. And he's like, yeah, absolutely. A hundred percent.

118
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.580
Like my dad, who's an older guy. Who's you know, he's an older guy,

119
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.090
compromised immune system. Guess what? He should be isolated.

120
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.260
He should be quarantined. Yeah.

121
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.300
Should my 17 year old son should my 20 year old daughter,

122
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:35.620
my 21, 20 18 year old, my 10 year old. Should they be an isolation?

123
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.180
Should they be quarantined? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Hey, the first week,

124
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.820
two weeks where we're hearing, it's a 10% bother. You know,

125
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:44.710
we're hearing all these things. Cool. You can make an,

126
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.470
you can make an inextremist call. You can say, Hey guys,

127
00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:49.660
I don't know what's happening, but in Italy it looks real bad.

128
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.090
Guess what we're going to do? We're going to shut down for two weeks. I'm sorry,

129
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:55.480
but this is what we're going to do. And you go, and the, the nation says, ah,

130
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:01.000
okay, okay, we get it. And then two weeks later you say, you know what?

131
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.920
It looks like. It's really might impact our medical systems.

132
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.580
We're going to shut down for another two weeks. Just another two weeks.

133
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:13.570
Never goes, you know, I gotta pay my mortgage,

134
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.760
but okay, two more weeks. And then you say, then you gotta,

135
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.000
then you gotta have the courage and the ability to put your ego in check and

136
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.630
say, you know what? Thank you may or may not have been necessary.

137
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.510
We don't know right now, but it looks like we can start opening back up.

138
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.450
Let's rock and roll. The other problem is once they tell.

139
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.770
<v 1>You what to do, they don't want to stop having that power and control. Oh yeah.</v>

140
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.520
They love the governor literally said wear masks because then we can get back.

141
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:43.180
Some of our freedoms, you're going to give away freedom.

142
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.760
<v 4>You got that kind of power. Maybe I should.</v>

143
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.700
<v 1>Run for governor. I didn't know. I could get just control freedoms.</v>

144
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.490
You got my vote. Give away freedoms.

145
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.540
<v 3>Th the, the businesses surviving, right?</v>

146
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:59.410
You're talking about the businesses surviving. There's a lot of businesses that,

147
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:04.300
especially little businesses, right? Little jujitsu schools, little restaurants.

148
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.920
You want a restaurant to operate on 50% capacity that

149
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.110
restaurants aren't making this kind of money where they can throw away 50% of

150
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:18.280
their profits. Exactly. 50% of their capability make money. They still,

151
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.460
because they still got to have that cook. That, that cook is there.

152
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:24.430
The dishwasher's there. Right? There's your bare minimum. Yeah.

153
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.190
And they gotta be there no matter what, if you serve 50 people. Great.

154
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.280
If you only serve 25, you don't make any money. Yeah. So there's,

155
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.210
