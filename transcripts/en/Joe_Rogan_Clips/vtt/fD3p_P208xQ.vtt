00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.840
<v 2>But dude, you're still rocking at the top of the food chain. It's amazing.</v>

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.320
<v 1>I'm saying I'm people, people were saying I'm too old. I'm 38. Well.</v>

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.840
<v 0>Look at your victory over Viente Luque and then look what Lu just did to Tyron</v>

5
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.200
Woodley. You're still at the top of the food chain.

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.870
Cause I was real recently that you beat.

7
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.270
<v 1>Him. Yeah, it was. I mean, it was what a year. It was two years ago.</v>

8
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.710
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; two years ago. I beat the, but uh, yeah man, people say,

9
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.710
and I'm I'm I'm I'm too old. And I guess once you get knocked out one time,

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.670
you just, they throw you to the side.

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.460
<v 0>That's people that don't understand the human chin. It's just like, it's just,</v>

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.420
it's just a fact. You get hit with the perfect shot.

13
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.020
<v 1>There's it would even hard. It wasn't even hard. You know, I've been hit harder.</v>

14
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.580
Tyron hit me harder. Jake Ellenberger hit me harder. This was just right.

15
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.580
<v 0>On the button. It's crazy. Isn't it, to be.</v>

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.420
<v 1>Honest with you, it was like, it was like a, a relief being knocked out. I mean,</v>

17
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.410
I got close to 80 something fights with kickboxing MMA together and

18
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.330
I've never been knocked out and it was always one of those, you know,

19
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.930
Lee going into a fight. This is gonna be it. Hmm. This is,

20
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:13.010
this is gonna be the time I get knocked out.

21
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.970
This is always going through my head. And now that it happened,

22
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.930
this is not that bad. &lt;laugh&gt; it's really not that bad.

23
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.520
I would rather get knocked out than get just the crap beat outta me for five,

24
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:24.160
five minute rounds.

25
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.160
<v 0>Have you ever been knocked out in training? No.</v>

26
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.600
So that was the only time ever in your whole crew been knocked out and it was a

27
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.320
wild punch too. The fact that he caught you with a Superman punch.

28
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.720
<v 1>I know man did the memes after that with her. I dunno if you saw that, but.</v>

29
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.320
<v 0>It was funny. You gotta think though, you've dished it out so many times.</v>

30
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.950
I know, you know, through kick by career and MMA. I mean,

31
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:46.830
there's so many times you flatline people.

32
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.910
<v 1>And then, uh, yeah, I get, I get knocked out by a guy in a lot,</v>

33
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.270
in a lighter of weight class. My dad, my family is pretty rough. They don't,

34
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.790
they,

35
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.430
they bring it up as much as they can &lt;laugh&gt; I was in the hospital that night

36
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.860
and uh, my dad's doing it like a face book, live thing, cuz you know,

37
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:07.900
we had a bunch of bunch of, you know, karate families,

38
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.380
Andrate kids there and we pretty much sold out that arena. Greenville,

39
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:12.740
South Carolina were, I mean,

40
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:17.500
everybody was there to watch me fight and then I get crushed or I get

41
00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:20.140
knocked out and then, uh, you know, everybody's wanna know how I am.

42
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.780
So I did it like it was probably 2:00 AM.

43
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.290
Did a Facebook live and dash just eat me alive, eat me alive. Yeah.

44
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.450
I got knocked out. He's like, yeah, by a smaller guy too.

45
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.570
And he just let me have it. But yeah, that's grew man. That's how he is.

46
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.290
It is what.

47
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.930
<v 0>It is. Yep. You know, you,</v>

48
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.650
you took it really well in terms of like the way you reacted and social media

49
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.610
and the way you reacted and you were asked about it, you know, showed poise.

50
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.760
<v 1>Thank you. I mean, what, what can you do? I mean,</v>

51
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.040
you can't just sit there and cry about it. No, you know, uh, yeah.

52
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.440
It bothered me for a while that you know, why did I not see it coming?

53
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.400
I normally see this stuff coming. Do you.

54
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.400
<v 0>Think you were relaxed when he hit you? Is that what it.</v>

55
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 1>Was? I think it was definitely a distance thing. Cause when I, when I,</v>

56
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.280
I had psychic, I watch it over and over and over again.

57
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.600
I don't remember any of the second round. I don't remember any of it.

58
00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:09.280
All I remember is getting up off the stool, looking across the,

59
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.440
the cage and I seen his bloody nose. He's banged up and I'm like, all right,

60
00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:15.160
time, time to pick it up. I M gonna finish him this round.

61
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.000
This was going through my head and that's all I remember.

62
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.470
And I got knocked out five, five seconds left in the second round. Wow.

63
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.550
I don't remember anything.

64
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.750
I don't remember sitting up talking to him in the cage.

65
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.310
The people say I was like high fiving people as I was walking by.

66
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.870
All I remember is like these sparkles kind of fade away

67
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.590
and I see Chris Wyman's face right there. He's laughing at me.

68
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.500
He's like smiling at me. And he said, if you ask me that again, I wanna lap you.

69
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.140
I guess I asked them the same question. I kept saying, you know what happened?

70
00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:44.820
How'd I get knocked out. I got knocked out. Just kept saying.

71
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.180
<v 0>That's what people do when they get knocked out. They,</v>

72
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.580
they ask the same question. What happened over and over again.

73
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.780
<v 1>It was such a weird thing. And then, you know, not remember any of that.</v>

74
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.980
And then just being in the back, it's like, I got teleported there.

75
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.450
I was fighting. And, and then I was there and I,

76
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.650
I remember him helping me trying to answer the doctor's questions. He like,

77
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.690
you know what day it is. I'm like, uh, and Chris, like Steven, come on.

78
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.810
You know what day it is? He's like trying to help me out answer these questions.

79
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.650
But, uh, that's all I remember, man, is, is that, but, uh, it's it was a relief.

80
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:19.570
Like I have nothing. Well, what else? I mean,

81
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.120
that's like the word thing that can happen. Why.

82
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.760
<v 0>Why, why do you feel like it's a relief?</v>

83
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.040
<v 1>Well, you know, it was such a worry, you know, I've, I've knocked out people.</v>

84
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.560
I've, I've seen how they are, you know, getting up off the canvas and the, the,

85
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.093
you know,

86
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.320
what has done to people psychologically getting knocked out and that's always

87
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:41.350
been kind of like, how would I handle that? You know, how would I handle that?

88
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.870
How would I, how would you've seen people get knocked out and they,

89
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.350
they try and come back maybe as soon as pops. So, which is not a good thing.

90
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.510
They should, it's a terrible thing. Yeah. They should give their time,

91
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.150
you time for their body to heal up. But, um, you know, I've seen people do that.

92
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.830
It was always a worry for me. How would I handle that? Yeah.

93
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.830
<v 0>I always get concerned when I see someone who gets knocked out and they want to</v>

94
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.900
get right back in there. I'm like, Ooh, you're asking for trouble.

95
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.500
Cause you might feel fine, but you probably are a little loose.

96
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.780
<v 1>Yeah. It's funny. You said that because they UFC wanted me to fight,</v>

97
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.940
wanted me to fight two months later in my hometown. Wow.

98
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.980
And after the day after was going to get some breakfast with some,

99
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.500
with some friends, um, still in Knoxville. Oh,

100
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.530
with the fam and I get a call from, um, Dana, I think it was hunter.

101
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.170
Hey man, you still wanting to fight and Greenville, South Carolina.

102
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.130
Of course the athlete and myself said yes.

103
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.050
Like I wanted to jump back in there and yeah. But then, you know,

104
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.170
reality kicked in and you know, I look over at my pops and he is like the, he,

105
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.080
I think he already know it was, he said that he, he just shook his head.

106
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.840
Who was it.

107
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.673
<v 0>That you were supposed to?</v>

108
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.000
<v 1>Um, I don't think we had anybody. The USC should have made it. Anthony Pettis.</v>

109
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it was only like two months later.

110
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.720
It should have been Anthony Petti in my hometown, but,

111
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.320
and I didn't find out that UFC was in Greenville. I found that out,

112
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.520
watching some fights.

113
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.240
<v 0>Like, uh,</v>

114
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.520
so you saying UFC should have made a rematch with pets or re or you should have

115
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.640
had that should have been when you fought Pettus. Yes. Was in your hometown?

116
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.160
Yes. Yes. We, we would've sold that out.
