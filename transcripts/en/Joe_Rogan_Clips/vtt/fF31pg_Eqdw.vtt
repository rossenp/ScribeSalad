00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.400
<v 2>So, so when you base your,</v>

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.880
your core beliefs on things that are not reality based, mm-hmm,

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.480
&lt;affirmative&gt; on things that are, are based on wishful thinking.

5
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.200
So a lot of people get into astrology because they want to believe that,

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.881
you know,

7
00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:21.110
there are F faiths out there that are gonna look after them or whatever. Yeah.

8
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.190
And if you indulge in wishful thinking that way,

9
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:26.990
the evidence now shows you actually compromise your mind's immune system.

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.390
So when you believe things, because you want to, you want them to be true,

11
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.150
your mental, your mind's immune system gets weaker.

12
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.430
And there's now actually now empirical research that indicates this. So,

13
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.220
so if you, for example, um, except that &lt;affirmative&gt;,

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.220
uh, that, that clinging to your, your,

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.900
your articles of faith, uh, no matter what is a virtue,

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.060
you're less likely to change your mind when evidence comes along. Right.

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.980
And when that happens, you become more susceptible to conspiracy thinking more,

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.810
more susceptible to, uh, uh, divisive, political ideologies,

19
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.290
more susceptible to, uh, science, denial, um,

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.530
your re your mind's resistance to bad ideas starts to decay.

21
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.210
You can actually damage your mind's immune system by indulging and wishful

22
00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:18.044
think. Mm.

23
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.120
<v 1>That makes sense. Do you, do you highlight specific Strat energies, uh,</v>

24
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.080
in your book for looking at things accurately and looking at things objectively?

25
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.120
<v 0>Yeah, I mean, so,</v>

26
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.000
so science is clearly a shining example of what's possible,

27
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.260
uh,

28
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.640
in the way of idea testing and the way of validating things with evidence mm-hmm

29
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.910
&lt;affirmative&gt;. So, um, you know, S that are specially good at, uh,

30
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.910
testing things in laboratories or with experiments. Um,

31
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.870
now philosophers have always gone in for a, kind of a related,

32
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.350
but slightly different kind of idea.

33
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.470
Testing philosophers don't have laboratories except the ones between their ears.

34
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.180
And basically we test ideas against each other, and we test ideas, uh,

35
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.900
with questions and a lot of ti, and we test ideas against our,

36
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.700
our intuitions about right and wrong, and try to figure out what makes sense.

37
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.060
Um, that's a complimentary kind of idea testing that scientists go in for,

38
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.700
and it's one that has done a huge amount to

39
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.050
educate and, um,

40
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.410
enlighten us over the centuries. And so there, uh,

41
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:35.330
what I try to do in the book is, is take things from this cutting edge science,

42
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.170
I call cognitive immunology. It's the science of mental immunity.

43
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.090
You combine that with ancient wisdom about how to, how to pursue wisdom,

44
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.023
how to find wisdom,

45
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.760
and you actually get some really powerful ways to strengthen mental immune

46
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:49.594
systems.

47
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.880
<v 1>In, like, what ways, what, what do you use personally? Do you need it,</v>

48
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.521
or you've,

49
00:02:55.521 --> 00:03:00.240
you've been sort of indoctrinated into the world of objective thinking to the

50
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:02.440
point where you don't need any systems that you follow.

51
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.560
<v 0>Well, I try, I try not to think that I have all the answers and that I've, uh,</v>

52
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.840
you know, got it all figured out. Um, look at humility.

53
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.520
We know this humility is really important for,

54
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.080
for a well-functioning mental immune system for everything.

55
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.880
<v 1>Right. Well.</v>

56
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.680
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, sure. Let's go, let's go with that.</v>

57
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.350
My research in specializes in, you know,

58
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:26.550
trying to understand how the minds, it develops resistance to bad ideas.

59
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.610
Um,

60
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.230
and once you think you have all the answers you stop learning and your thinking

61
00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:37.030
starts to go haywire. Mm. So you gotta maintain that humility, or, you know,

62
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.980
you're just, you're compromising your own mind.

63
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.540
<v 1>Humility specifically.</v>

64
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.540
<v 0>Humility's important, fair mindedness. Like, so, so if,</v>

65
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.660
so a lot of people do this, they, they, um,

66
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.180
they ridicule or derive other people's ideas for failing to meet basic

67
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.380
standards, but then they don't apply those same standards to their own views.

68
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.210
<v 1>Right? Like, do you have anything example of this? Um.</v>

69
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.930
<v 0>Sure. Um, well,</v>

70
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.290
well, I think a whole lot of political, uh,

71
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.490
rhetoric has this character, right? Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; slam the other side,

72
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.690
um, ridicule as,

73
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.960
as us sloppy thinking or as ideologically driven,

74
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.120
but never examined to see whether your own views. That's.

75
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.360
<v 1>A perfect example of it. Right.</v>

76
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.680
And politics is probably the very best example of how people do this.

77
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:35.080
They get super tribal. They only look at exactly the,

78
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.080
the other side is being bad and their side,

79
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.750
they find justifications for every questionable behavior or every weird

80
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.190
scandal, every, you know, everything that doesn't fit the narrative.

81
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.310
<v 0>Yeah. And, and I'd say that politics is probably the best example,</v>

82
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.790
but religion and ethics, um, and sometimes economics or others.

83
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.630
So wherever values come into play, people get very attached to their ideas.

84
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.710
Cause we all want to think that I, that we are, we are right,

85
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.860
and to true and virtuous, right?

86
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.980
So whatever ideas we've already internalized as beliefs,

87
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.220
they have to be the virtuous beliefs and any new incoming information that

88
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:14.060
challenges them from the other side of the political aisle or from another

89
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.380
religion or from those atheists over there, that's the enemy.

90
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.210
And in your mind's immune system attacks that information and you never

91
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.130
become, and you never gained the fair mindedness needed to learn.
