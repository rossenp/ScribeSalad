00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. My friend, Jesse Reed, who was a very funny comic,</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:06.630
her mother was saying, you know, you should have daughters. She goes, you know,

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.060
you let the kids on the phones too much. He goes, mom, at 10 years,

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.910
they're going to be the phone. She was like, the phone's going to be inside.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.310
<v 1>Of them soon. So it's like, well, what am I fighting? Am I finding mine? I.</v>

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.430
<v 2>Limit my kids' time on the phones except the older one. Of course</v>

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.340
he's tired. You're like, I just don't think that, um, it seems like a challenge.

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.430
I just don't think it's a challenge that we ever.

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.230
<v 0>Faced. Are they allowed to watch in fours.</v>

10
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.330
<v 2>All day? That's all we have. Thank God, projected. Um,</v>

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.640
what else is, um, the, the keys, uh, screen time screen time is a big key. Yeah.

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.400
Um, tell her about Epstein. Epstein. Didn't kill himself.

13
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.570
That's big before they start Googling.

14
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.520
<v 0>For themselves. They gotta, now, now it up your sleep. When you're under,</v>

15
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.410
I fall asleep to a podcast, you're going to laugh.

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.270
I used to fall asleep to Alex.

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.490
I would listen to Alex's clips on YouTube and I would fall asleep to just a lady

18
00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.460
syndrome. And I would be able to put me asleep. I think.

19
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.110
<v 2>His best video is to this day.</v>

20
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.840
He's the one of the greatest painters of our time. You got to ball,

21
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.930
but you got to watch when I first met him. Yeah.

22
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.710
He wasn't shown some people see today. And the,

23
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:16.940
I was shown that he is today is changing because of his not being, uh,

24
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.420
not drinking he's in. Oh yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Cause he's clean for 90 days.

25
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.830
Interesting. Sounds different.

26
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.060
But what I'm thinking is when I first saw like nine, 11 road to tyranny,

27
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.160
it was one of the first videos that I ever watched. I was like, whoa,

28
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.580
like it's one of the first videos that ever opened my eyes up to certain

29
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:32.241
conspiracies.

30
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:35.930
And one of them was the conspiracies of using agent provocateurs to incite

31
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:40.310
violence and riots to incite that feeling of chaos.

32
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.190
And then they use that as an excuse for the police to come in and start

33
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:45.760
arresting people. Because now it's no longer a peaceful protest.

34
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.000
They do it all the time.

35
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.140
So he was making this argument about the world trade organization, WTO. Yeah.

36
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.590
And so he showed all this videos of these guys coming in with a government

37
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:58.430
issue, work boots on, they have like the same souls is like government issue,

38
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:02.240
work boots that were in a ski mask, breaking buildings, light and on fire,

39
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:04.580
smashing everything. And then the cops come in and clean everybody up.

40
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.930
And then they actually made it a no protest zone. And so you,

41
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.940
a guy went through or a woman, I forget which,

42
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:13.850
but had a pin with a WTO on that with a red line on it.

43
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.490
They told him you had to take that pin off the.

44
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.770
<v 0>America. Yeah. Well let's just every,</v>

45
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.620
every protest resistance movement has been infiltrated.

46
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:24.860
The FBI did a COINTELPRO. It did it with the black Panthers.

47
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.800
They've just done it with everybody. We.

48
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.570
<v 2>Plays that video and you see that and it's like real clear.</v>

49
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.960
And then you hear the w how it all played out that all the agent provocateurs

50
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:34.280
wound up going to a safe house.

51
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:37.220
And then the police released them negotiated with the police.

52
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.930
The police released them and you're like, wait.

53
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.600
<v 0>A minute. What? Yeah, you just don't even have breasts made. Right.</v>

54
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.510
It's probably somebody's job in the FBI to dye their hair pink,

55
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.180
like go into Portland and start throwing rocks at Ben Shapiro.

56
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.470
<v 2>Back then they were just allowed to wear ski masks and. Right.</v>

57
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.890
You just start smashing and you didn't even know who they were. Yeah.

58
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.660
You just assumed that that was, I mean,

59
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:00.190
it's such a crazy way to stop a protest and I never about it until I watched a

60
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.610
smart.

61
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 0>Way to, when you think, you know, it's, these guys know what they're.</v>

62
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.260
<v 2>Doing, but doing that kind of forever, you know,</v>

63
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:10.680
that's like standard operational procedure, a hundred percent,

64
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.070
this is a weird time for conspiracies.

65
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.730
<v 0>It's weird. They've gone mainstream, which is not good. It's very dangerous,</v>

66
00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:20.700
very dangerous jumps into a lot of them. He's into a lot of them.

67
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.410
And I think there's not a huge,

68
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.250
there's only a small group of people that want a rational discussion about them.

69
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.050
People really just want to be emotionally fed. Does this feel right to me?

70
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.430
And there's a very, like I had a guy call me today is very smart guy,

71
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.410
wrote the Franklin scandal, which is a book about the original Epstein thing.

72
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:40.290
Like the original sex trafficking thing. What's that? Well,

73
00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.890
the Franklin scandal was a, it was a scandal out of Omaha, Nebraska,

74
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:47.400
the frankly credit union, where there was a guy who was embezzling money.

75
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.740
And then he was being investigated for that. But they said,

76
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:52.470
he's all he has all this money because he's running an interstate pedophile

77
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:55.950
network. And he's pandering kids to, you know, people in Washington,

78
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:57.000
DC and New York.

79
00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.880
And there was a headline in the Washington post or the Washington times that

80
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.660
we're like call boys, get a tour of the Reagan white house. And you know,

81
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:05.970
this was a scandal with real victims. We want it to testify.

82
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:08.520
And then people started dying. You know, the private investigator,

83
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:12.710
they hired his plane broke up. Um, one of the girls that, uh,

84
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.790
testified was found guilty of perjury.

85
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:16.230
And then she was put in solitary confinement.

86
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.940
They had to use two grand juries in Omaha to get rid of this scandal.

87
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.163
And it's one.

88
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.100
Now it's not as sexy as like a pizza gate or something because it's happened in

89
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:29.640
the eighties and nineties. But this shows you the blueprint for the government,

90
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.180
you know, using marshaling resources to,

91
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.740
to silence people that were victims of this stuff. This is not new congressmen,

92
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.070
senators, blackmail being used by intelligence agencies. None of it's new.

93
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.700
It was pioneered by the mafia, you know, intelligence, Whitney web,

94
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.590
who lives in Chile. And I've had her on my show.

95
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:48.780
She writes a lot about this stuff. You know, this is, you know,

96
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:51.210
if you want people to talk, you need info. You need leverage.

97
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.440
There's nothing that there's no more leverage than you having sex with somebody

98
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.330
who's underage. Then they own you forever.

99
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.240
If they have photo audio video of you doing that.

100
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.280
So these things have been going on for a while.

101
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.950
And Franklin scandal was one of the first, but you know, the guy who wrote it,

102
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.920
this guy, Nick Bryan called me today. And he goes, I can't get any agents.

103
00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:10.020
It's very hard because like, you know,

104
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:14.290
the reality is mainstream media is uninterested in, in,

105
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.480
in a lot of these stories unless they're current and they're sexy and

106
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.950
online fringe, people are only interested if they're insane. Well,

107
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:23.850
there's so many of them. Yeah.

108
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.990
<v 2>Now though, too, you so many, it's hard to keep track. Like you,</v>

109
00:05:26.991 --> 00:05:30.830
you was just saying that you were just in Dallas, did you drive, did you do the.

110
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.790
<v 0>Drive? But I went to the, where he was, uh, shot where he was shot.</v>

111
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.340
So there was five Canadians there and they were like,

112
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.460
I was just started giving them an impromptu tour of Dallas because they were

113
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:43.350
like, is this where Kennedy got white? And I'm like, yeah,

114
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.310
this is how it happened.

115
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.070
<v 2>How many people you think have stood there and went like to ask, right? Yeah.</v>

116
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.120
I wanted to do it. Yeah, there it is. There it is.

117
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.060
<v 0>I want it to do with a Popeye's chicken sandwich and just write, you know,</v>

118
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:55.080
this is America.

119
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.850
<v 2>It says, this is where princess Diana was killed.</v>

120
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.210
Is that really where Kennedy was killed.

121
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.580
<v 0>Though? It's exactly where he was shot.</v>

122
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.970
That's exactly where and how cryptic is that.

123
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.640
<v 3>Angry? You look, yeah. You're a crazy person.</v>

124
00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.560
I'm just trying to have a little fun. Yeah. That's a weird thing to.

125
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.250
<v 0>Get around, but then you go to school book depository. Well,</v>

126
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:15.100
and it is super close. Like it could have happened. Oh, 400 huggers.

127
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.090
<v 2>Listen,</v>

128
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.940
everybody who says there's no way he could have made those shots is out of their

129
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.770
mind. That's not that far.

130
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.850
<v 0>The thing that makes me think it's a conspiracy. It's literally everything else.</v>

131
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.250
It's every other component of the store.

132
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.620
Oswald being shot immediately. Yes. I mean, that's.

133
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.860
<v 4>Oswaldo sure. Surely could have been in on.</v>

134
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.350
<v 0>It. Of course. Yes. He could've. He could've.</v>

135
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.200
<v 2>Definitely been in a, or he could have definitely been set up.</v>

136
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.150
<v 0>Basically those things are possible.</v>

137
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.360
And Dallas has an interesting energy because of that. Yeah.

138
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.930
Like it's a great city, but it does feel like, it feels like a city of thing.

139
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.980
People that keep their mouth shut a lot of big corporate steakhouses pie,

140
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.330
hotels. A lot of people carving up, you know, deals,

141
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.070
you know, it just feels like something's going on. Yeah, there it is.

142
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.360
There it is. So that's where.

143
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.570
<v 2>He is. And that's the building up there. See, that's not that far.</v>

144
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.470
I think they said it's just like 150 yards or something like that.

145
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.920
It's not when.

146
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.950
<v 0>You're actually there. It looks even closer than this. Yeah.</v>

147
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.600
<v 2>How many yards was it? Jamie,</v>

148
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.440
find out how many yards Oswald had to shoot to hit Kennedy,

149
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.700
but it's totally doable. And people that say, that's not, you're crazy.

150
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.470
They're nuts. And people that say that you can't, uh, like load a gun that fast.

151
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.230
Maybe you can't. I bet you, someone can do it faster than you.

152
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.890
I've seen guys use bolt-action rifles fast as. Yeah.

153
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.650
Could they get off three shots in that amount of time? I don't know,

154
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:41.500
but I I'm not, I don't think it's magic.

155
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.330
I don't think it's like something impossible.

156
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.910
The other thing they said was like that the scope was off.

157
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.570
Like anybody said that doesn't know about scopes I'll have to do is handle it a

158
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:52.390
little bit, drop it, bang it against things. To me, it goes.

159
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.610
<v 0>Off the idea that that guy was killed immediately.</v>

160
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.980
And then obviously I've read it a couple of books on it,

161
00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:59.770
but the idea that he gets killed immediately, that's where you go.

162
00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:01.840
Something's wrong. Something's cool.

163
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.250
<v 5>I, 183 meters is what I just found 183.</v>

164
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.290
<v 2>Meters. What does that in yard or what is it about 200.</v>

165
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.690
<v 5>Yards? Is it flipped? It says,</v>

166
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.270
I don't know if this is what the actual measurement was,

167
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.193
but that's what I just found.

168
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.041
<v 2>That's interesting.</v>

169
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:17.980
I didn't know how much of a disparity it says it was never more than 90.

170
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.900
<v 5>Yards from, from the location. So there's a lot, I mean,</v>

171
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.910
oh, okay. So where he went.

172
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.300
<v 2>When he got the final shot, was that far? It was 200 yards. No,</v>

173
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:29.134
that doesn't make any sense.

174
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.140
He was never more than 90 yards from Oswald's location.

175
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.060
How does that work to separate? Okay.

176
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:41.230
I didn't know that 183 meters was 200 yards. That's.

177
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.470
<v 5>Crazy. Yeah. A meter is pretty close to a yard. Yeah. It's pretty straight.</v>

178
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.830
<v 2>But that's why I thought it would be like 185 or something like that. Like,</v>

179
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.900
there's actually a formula for doing that for converting, uh, meters, two yards.

180
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:54.970
You add one of the last numbers or.

181
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.470
<v 5>I forget that. It's a.</v>

182
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 0>It's an interesting thing because it really is.</v>

183
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.030
<v 5>You know, Christopher.</v>

184
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.180
<v 0>Hitchens said that the Kennedy assassination was the movement that like that</v>

185
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:08.730
moment was the psychic movement of the sixties started.

186
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.140
Like that was the fracturing of reality for a lot of people in the same way that

187
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:13.770
maybe Epstein.

188
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:18.270
<v 5>Was where it just kind of no president, it's gotta be way bigger.</v>

189
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.300
It's huge. It was huge. It was this big thing.

190
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.133
<v 0>That, you know,</v>

191
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.910
was it a traumatic event that people dealt with in a bunch of different ways?

192
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:26.300
No. One's.

193
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.050
<v 2>Sitting around going, do you remember where you were at the scene? Well,</v>

194
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:31.220
you don't have the friends. I do.

195
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.210
<v 0>It's a lot of people on Reddit saying that, but it's like nine 11.</v>

196
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.420
<v 5>Of course. Almost. Yeah. You know, similar. Yeah.</v>

197
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:40.730
Like those are the events.

198
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.330
<v 2>You knew somebody in nine 11. Yeah. It's probably bigger. Do you.</v>

199
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.030
<v 0>Think it's possible that down the road, not to the government, like data,</v>

200
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:50.300
but that we find out that there was a substantial coverup, you know,

201
00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:53.930
we didn't know about Saudi Arabia, their involvement for awhile.

202
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.740
There's for nine 11. Do you think it's possible that we just.

203
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.170
<v 5>Don't know? No. The whole story let's totally.</v>

204
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.220
<v 2>Possible. I don't,</v>

205
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:05.510
I don't have any idea what was being done or who was involved.

206
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.840
And I know that there was a bunch of hijackers and they flew planes in those

207
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:11.770
buildings, but who was behind that? Who the knows? How would we know?

208
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.260
Great question. What part of, you know, what part of Saudi Arabia,

209
00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:18.170
where they all came from a cool where'd they get their orders from like,

210
00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:20.210
how did they, how did they organize this? I mean, yeah.

211
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.730
I think they know a certain amount and I think a certain amount they'll probably

212
00:10:22.731 --> 00:10:25.640
never know. Yeah. And we'll all go to our death, not knowing,

213
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.590
what do you think about that one that got shot down.

214
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.690
They shot that let's roll one.

215
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.020
<v 0>They shot, they shot that down. Yeah. You know?</v>

216
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.650
<v 2>Yeah. They said that thing. The, the flight, the, the rubbish,</v>

217
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.900
the wreckage was scattered for miles.

218
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.850
<v 0>I mean, there's, there's no way they didn't shut that down,</v>

219
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:43.580
but there's a lot of things about that day where you look back at it and you go.

220
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.490
<v 5>This is just weird. Yeah.</v>

221
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.520
It's weird that a building fell that wasn't hit by anything. It's just weird.

222
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.450
I'm not saying it can't happen, but that's odd. It's definitely odd.

223
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.930
<v 2>That's the way, the way it looks is odd. It looks like a controlled demolition.</v>

224
00:10:56.931 --> 00:10:58.970
But yeah, if you watch the full version,

225
00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:01.970
there's a guy who used to be like a full on nine 11 truther.

226
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.760
And then he started like, Dennis, see, I had attention.

227
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.990
I started just paying attention to the flaws in his way of thinking. And uh,

228
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:12.590
one of the things that he found out was that the version of tower seven that

229
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:15.890
most people see is a version. That's very quick. It just,

230
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:19.760
it implodes and it just falls down. But for minutes before that,

231
00:11:19.761 --> 00:11:23.840
you can watch the center of the thing collapsed inside of it. Oh, interesting.

232
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.800
Have you ever seen.

233
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.010
<v 0>That version? I've never seen that version pull up the, we see that version.</v>

234
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.450
<v 2>Yeah. It's very interesting. Full version of tower seven collapsing. Yeah.</v>

235
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:33.780
Well.

236
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.110
<v 0>Because the nine 11 people get so crazy. They were like,</v>

237
00:11:36.111 --> 00:11:38.530
there were no buildings. It's all holograms. There were no planes.

238
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.480
New York doesn't exist. I mean, it's great. It's not,

239
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.450
but I want to see the uncut building seven because maybe.

240
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.490
<v 5>A plane hit the Pentagon it's I mean, well, okay. But just released.</v>

241
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.060
I just want to see one video of it happening. Right? Just show me one video.

242
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.930
Do you think they have a video? Is there somewhere.

243
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:56.921
<v 1>On the Pentagon?</v>

244
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.400
Just show me one video would have been probably over plane hitting the Pentagon.

245
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.070
<v 5>There's one, but it's very weird. The frames are very.</v>

246
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:05.260
<v 1>Weird. Yeah. It's weird. Just show me the video.</v>

247
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.630
I want to believe he might hit the Pentagon.

248
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:10.360
<v 2>The Rover on the moon is taking beautiful view.</v>

249
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.550
<v 1>This is what I'm saying. This is the problem. This is like a kiddo.</v>

250
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.090
<v 2>Imagine if you have a sh some that's like a thousand times worse than a,</v>

251
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.980
like one of them doorbell cameras,

252
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:23.970
they got a thousand times worth viewing the pen. They.

253
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.730
<v 0>Got there. They're putting it together from cell phone cameras. I get,</v>

254
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.520
I understand that that technology was different.

255
00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:32.100
Just show me a video of a plane hitting the Pentagon. I'm good. I'm with you.

256
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.500
What do you think? It could be a missile? I don't know,

257
00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:38.070
but I just want to know why we just, no one video.

258
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.560
<v 5>We got to see video. Isn't that.</v>

259
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.290
<v 0>Crazy? Why am I crazy for saying,</v>

260
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:47.400
can I just see one video of the thing happening that you said happened? Well.

261
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.760
<v 2>Did you know that maybe this is not true and Jamie's going to be checking this</v>

262
00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:52.380
one out. So, um,

263
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.300
the area in the Pentagon that got hit was refortified was the same

264
00:12:57.301 --> 00:13:00.120
area where they were doing the accounting. Yeah.

265
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:04.050
Where they were trying to figure out where the trillion dollars is missing.

266
00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:08.370
That runs field was talking about the camera. Just that I think the day before,

267
00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:12.270
right. It's an interesting situation.

268
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.060
Did he say that there's like missing money? Like there's yeah. And.

269
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.210
<v 0>Like rumps, wasn't willing to like out on the lawn, like these people,</v>

270
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.030
what are they doing? They're just doing, you're not in a bunker.

271
00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:23.190
You're out on the lawn. I don't know what happened, man. Listen.

272
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.310
<v 2>It was something crazy. Like trillions of dollars, 2.3 to.</v>

273
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.360
<v 1>2.3 Trillion. I'm like, I mean, you know, and so the next day,</v>

274
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.680
see if that's true.

275
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.730
<v 2>That, that area of the Pentagon that held the accounting,</v>

276
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.040
I don't think they tell you what, just see if you see,

277
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:42.720
if you can Google the area of the Pentagon that was hit contained the accounting

278
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.740
offices. [inaudible].

279
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.650
<v 5>The dark couple have at January. Like I read that though. I know the,</v>

280
00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:52.650
I understand your suspicion. I'm trying.

281
00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:56.070
<v 0>To lie or you're trying to hold the seven, had a lot of financial records in.</v>

282
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.790
<v 3>That's what I heard, what I heard. I don't know.</v>

283
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.520
<v 2>All the satellite dishes that were pointed. Absolutely.</v>

284
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.100
<v 0>Well, the way I look at conspiracy, I don't want to believe in any of them.</v>

285
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.710
Right. That's the whole thing. Like I want there to be a plane hit dependent.

286
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:12.150
I want, I want it all to be what it is. I, I, yes. We know.

287
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.720
<v 2>That a bunch of elites were going to an island to have sex with. Yeah.</v>

288
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.100
<v 3>They could do whatever they don't want. You can also know like, Hey.</v>

289
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.240
<v 5>How much of this is true? Like, this is.</v>

290
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.930
<v 2>This is a wacky one. Yeah. This is one that if you told your mom,</v>

291
00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.720
like 10 years ago, she'd be like, Timmy, you're back on the drugs.

292
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.820
<v 5>She would, she'd be like, what the.</v>

293
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.790
<v 2>Is wrong with you? No, one's going to an island to kids. Right.</v>

294
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:38.880
But it's the same thing. It's like, now that that's.

295
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.850
<v 0>On the table, you look at other events and you're like, well,</v>

296
00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:46.800
we don't know necessarily how all of these things happen though. We don't know.

297
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.940
We don't know. We don't know.

298
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.680
<v 5>We just have to go. There's listeners, conservative, firefight,</v>

299
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:56.120
like fire companies from Queens, from out by long island. That like.

300
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.780
<v 0>Because they've gotten sick and stuff have demanded like a new investigation.</v>

301
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.160
<v 5>And these are not like crazy people. These are people that just go, listen,</v>

302
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.100
we're all dying from first responders and things. We just.

303
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.490
<v 0>You know, we want to know exactly what the hell we breathe in and what the hell.</v>

304
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.070
<v 2>Is it? Well, it's all the burning chemicals from the basement of the building.</v>

305
00:15:15.071 --> 00:15:15.790
Right? It wasn't that.

306
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.780
<v 0>I guess that fires burned forever. I guess that's what it is that.</v>

307
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.880
<v 2>Those guys got so many of them got sick. So many of them got cancer.</v>

308
00:15:21.881 --> 00:15:24.220
It's horrible. It's horrific. It's really, it's really.

309
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.180
Donna Summers died from that Donna summer, the disco person. Well,

310
00:15:28.181 --> 00:15:29.410
I don't really care about that.

311
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.730
<v 5>Um, what I like her, she was amazing. She's.</v>

312
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.850
<v 1>Great. But how was she saving people at nine 11?</v>

313
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:40.090
<v 2>No. No. She had an apartment that was near the site of the buildings.</v>

314
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.100
<v 0>The summers running into the building to do.</v>

315
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.630
<v 2>I think you live down there, man.</v>

316
00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:46.600
If you have an apartment down there and you're still you're breathing that air

317
00:15:46.601 --> 00:15:50.230
man. Interesting. She's got a lung cancer. I think I thought she was a smoker.

318
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:51.840
I don't think she was.

319
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.770
<v 0>But she would just smoke cigarettes and you know,</v>

320
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:57.970
do Coke and live a fun disco life. I think she found the Lord. I had no idea.

321
00:15:57.971 --> 00:15:59.410
She was a first after.

322
00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.320
<v 2>She, uh, you know, she gave up on all that hot love.</v>

323
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.560
She was gone through the wreckage. Yeah, no, she was not.

324
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.750
<v 0>Going through the, we just live and just living in her apartment.</v>

325
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.260
<v 2>Okay. I think that's the idea. There,</v>

326
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:14.120
there are people that are probably very sick. Oh yeah. Yeah.

327
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.630
And they were lied to the risks. Well,

328
00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:21.040
I don't think anybody knew that nobody had ever had to endure an Inferno in the

329
00:16:21.041 --> 00:16:24.880
basement of a gigantic building in a metropolitan city that lasted for weeks

330
00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:27.760
crazy. Right after planes crash, all the dust is in the air,

331
00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:32.680
all the pollutants and particulates. And everybody's breathing all that in.

332
00:16:32.681 --> 00:16:34.660
I mean, you got to go back to work eventually. Right.

333
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.360
So when do you pursue work? A week later? Two weeks later. Guess what?

334
00:16:37.361 --> 00:16:38.890
The air is still up. Yeah.

335
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.230
<v 0>Well, I'm sorry to hear about Donna summer. Yeah.</v>

336
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.660
I'm pretty sure that's correct. Yeah, but I'm a song.

337
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.660
<v 5>A lot. Can we see if it, can you pull up a video.</v>

338
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:48.970
<v 0>Of Donna summer breathing in the fumes that grabs.</v>

339
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.110
<v 1>You, bro? Oh.</v>

340
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:55.780
<v 0>She's great. I started John's beach. Who was really good Jones beach live Chris.</v>

341
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.960
She was, she was older. She had, you know, she was, it was her comeback.

342
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.100
It was like the 2000 and a summer blamed nine 11 for lung cancer.

343
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.350
So it was like 2000. She was coming back. She.

344
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:07.900
<v 5>Released an out like a greatest hits album.</v>

345
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.930
Do you and your ad blocker you son of a. Those ad blockers. Yeah.

346
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.350
I have.

347
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:17.380
<v 0>My producer. Ben has him too. And he's always good. I know that Donna.</v>

348
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.910
<v 2>Summer 9 1 1 9 11 gave me cancer. Well that's song, is it? No,</v>

349
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:26.230
that's not a fun song was convinced that inhaling toxic air after nine 11 gave

350
00:17:26.231 --> 00:17:27.820
her the lung cancer that eventually killed her.

351
00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:29.680
TMZ is learned source close to the singer,

352
00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:31.900
tells TMZ who we're hearing this morning,

353
00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:34.960
that Donna was in a New York in New York city during nine 11,

354
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:37.150
living at an apartment near ground zero,

355
00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.700
Donna became almost paranoid about breathing the air,

356
00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:41.890
which was heavy with a rancid odor.

357
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.230
<v 0>Gotta move. You gotta move kind of.</v>

358
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.770
<v 2>In the months and years following nine 11 Donna's feelings intensified.</v>

359
00:17:47.771 --> 00:17:50.340
One source tells us that when he was around Donna,

360
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:54.360
she would constantly spray some sort of disinfect in the air. Danny Terrio,

361
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:59.190
the horse host of dance fever tells us when he was around Donna

362
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.210
post nine 11,

363
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:04.770
she would hang six sheets in her dressing room to prevent dust from coming in.

364
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.740
Oh my God. She sounds like she did die of it. And she also sounds.

365
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.060
<v 0>Like she was being annoying in the end.</v>

366
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.360
She sounds like she's being a little annoying with her sheets.

367
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:15.680
It's a little annoying, Donna.
