WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Does it matter what Ocasio,</v>

2
00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:06.000
Cort automat tweet or Trump tweets we're we're.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.880
Did you see that one with AIO Cortez and this giant

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.320
transsexual gal, um, in, uh, this beautiful. No, I already love it.

5
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:18.720
Beautiful outfit. I mean, she's, I don't know how tall AOC is.

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.550
She looks like she's about five, seven in me, probably this,

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.590
this lady next to her is a gigantic. And what was the,

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:27.990
and she's painted orange with a, with white face paint and she's clapping.

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.870
And what was this about? What was this for? Apparently, uh,

10
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.230
AOC went to a show and she was just giving the gal props yeah. And clapping.

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.790
And she was like super animated. Like you don't really see a,

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.420
a Congresswoman do. Yeah. You know? And, uh, and this, this, uh,

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.420
trans woman was beyond thrilled. I'm assuming it was a, I mean,

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.940
did you see the one where they're at the rally and they start talking about

15
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:52.740
eating the babies. That's amazing where AOC, somebody stands up that, I mean,

16
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:53.860
that's one of the funniest things.

17
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.780
Is that someone who's doing like an onion thing? I hope so. I think so.

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.860
I think that's somebody who's just doing a, you know, a character, you know,

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.090
or someone who's like legitimately my mentally ill somebody's legitimately

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.730
mentally ill, but it was too funny and too good where I'm like, no, this,

21
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.490
this is somebody who's really cause they got into it. You could see,

22
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.530
I love that. It's like the scene from Bo at, uh, where he's doing the,

23
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:18.210
the speed, the thing at the rodeo. Yeah.

24
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.530
And you could see their faces starting to change. Cause they're like, oh wait,

25
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:21.610
something's off. Yeah.

26
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.880
You could see Acaia Cortez's face start to change as a woman started talking

27
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:29.040
about eating infants. Yeah. And you could see Acaia Cortez. Yeah.

28
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.440
I remember this so good. &lt;laugh&gt;.

29
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.240
<v 1>It's not getting, you know, getting with a fossil.</v>

30
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.160
Fuel's not gonna solve the problem. Fast enough. A Swedish professor saying you,

31
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.230
we can eat. Yeah. That people, but that's not asked enough.

32
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.750
So I think your next, uh, campaign slogan has to be this.

33
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.910
We got to start eating babies. We don't have enough time.

34
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.550
There's too much CO2. All of you.

35
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 0>Oh my God. This is amazing. Like, you know, I'm watching here. I'm like,</v>

36
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:02.070
maybe it is a real person. I think it's a real person. I love it.

37
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:04.540
There's something too good about it. If it's not a real person,

38
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.220
she's gonna be the star of one of the she's amazing movie. She's she amazing.

39
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.640
Amazing.

40
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.780
<v 2>She just, we just heard her say that. And as I was Googling it, uh,</v>

41
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.620
snoops came up and it says,

42
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.420
did us AOC supporter suggest that fact check mixture of results,

43
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:21.460
which I'm not gonna go to the thing to read what they say, but like,

44
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:22.700
why wouldn't they just say true? Because.

45
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.290
<v 0>That'ss what it said, because it might have been a joke. Correct?</v>

46
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.410
I think slopes leans pretty left. Hard left and establishment. Yeah.

47
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:35.450
They're very establishment. Like they check things against, you know,

48
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:40.010
mainstream organs of opinion. Yeah. Oh this, this is great actor.

49
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.010
It might be, might be what does it say?

50
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.080
A woman's true.

51
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.720
<v 2>She's yeah. They have stunts of doing this.</v>

52
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.000
<v 0>A conspiracy group. She was an AOC supporter. Okay.</v>

53
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.960
They stated the internet troll was to troll Ocasio, Cortez. Good job.

54
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:57.240
Conspiracy crew. Great job.

55
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.760
She apparently was working at the behest of a fringe conspiracy group with a

56
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.160
history of such stunts. Of course. Yeah. Why not? Of course have five. Right?

57
00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:08.760
Have fun. Have five. And it seemed fake. Right? It seemed, uh, I mean,

58
00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:09.720
it seemed real, but it seemed,

59
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.720
it seemed like there's no way someone really would want to eat babies. It would,

60
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.120
it it's an extreme position. It's an extreme position.

61
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.510
I just love did you see the, her, the video with her and the transla lady? Yeah.

62
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.550
I was looking for that. I saw it,

63
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.430
but I was trying to find it again for that's that's insane.

64
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.710
This lady's like you think she would ever come on this show? Ocasio. Cortez.

65
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.350
Yeah, sure. She would interesting. That'd be nice to her. Yeah. I like, yeah.

66
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.150
She's sweet. She's 28. She's she's DED though.

67
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.580
She's gonna get rid of planes and yeah. Shes is silly girl,

68
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.460
a bartender two years ago. Pour SoCal, lime shots.

69
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.300
You need a far left to balance off the far, right? Yeah.

70
00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:52.300
You needs to be a little more crazy people reasonable and you it's great

71
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:55.100
that we have a game show host versus a bartender. Yeah, that's great.

72
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.900
Which one's the game show host again? Uh, Trump. Oh, that's right.

73
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.370
And then she's a bartender. This is how it ends. Listen. She, why not?

74
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.570
She could I'm P make it. I will make Logan Paul president, dude.

75
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.010
He's a smart 10 years. He will run.

76
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.650
YouTubers are going to have millions of dollars.

77
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:12.610
Millions of fans and no skills when they're all 40. That's true.

78
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.930
I will make him the president of the United States.

79
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.850
He will not be that bad at it. He's disciplined. He's got a heart. I, I will,

80
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.960
I will be his Steve Badden. I'm gonna get involved in that. Yeah. I mean,

81
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.600
has already had two fights. Yeah.

82
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.120
Two boxing matches a hundred percent percent of the, the whole world.

83
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.273
I think the next,

84
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.920
the next group of political figures may come from the internet.

85
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:36.080
They may be YouTubers. Maybe it's possible. Yeah. Did you watch that fight?

86
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.040
I watched a little bit of it. What'd you think they're not bad? I mean, they,

87
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:43.510
they got, they worked their asses on they. Yeah. They, they clearly did.

88
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.230
They were in real good shape to fight six round.

89
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:46.670
The thing that happened when he hit him,

90
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:49.830
when he was down that two point thing that he lost is that legit.

91
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.510
You're not supposed to hit them when they're down. Okay. There it is.

92
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:57.470
Look at that. Give us a volume. Can you do that or no bad idea.

93
00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.653
Amazing.

94
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.580
<v 3>Impeccable genius. You.</v>

95
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.180
<v 4>Believe just incredible from the revolutionary of our time.</v>

96
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.300
<v 0>I love you so much. Thank you for being what's the hug. Oh, adorable. Somewhere.</v>

97
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.380
Pana is sitting there being like YY &lt;laugh&gt; that threw me off so hard.

98
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.740
What were we just talking about before that? Um, the K load of Paul fight.

99
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.100
Oh yeah. So they got wild. Um,

100
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.610
it's hard to keep your together when you're fighting in front of all those

101
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:23.870
people.

102
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.970
But if one of them had been able to keep their together and not go wild and just

103
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.410
box, like, um, I don't know which one box is better.

104
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.690
It seems like Logan Paul was training with Shannon. The cannon Briggs.

105
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:37.490
Who's legit as. I mean, he's like, you know,

106
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.610
he was one of the top heavyweights in the world, former world champion. I mean,

107
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:44.160
he's, he's knows how to teach box. He knows how the box. Right.

108
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.400
As good as it get. Yeah. So he was working with Logan,

109
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.520
Paul and he said some crazy like Logan,

110
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:52.040
Paul could be heavyweight champion in the world. He's white. He got money. Yeah.

111
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.120
That's what he said saying to be the president. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

112
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.720
I don't know about that, but I do know he's a real athlete. He's an athlete.

113
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.000
Yeah. A hundred percent. He dedicated himself to it. I mean, I,

114
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.240
I did a podcast at his house and he was training all day.

115
00:06:04.241 --> 00:06:07.360
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; ice bath, all the thing, you know, whatever you can tell,

116
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.480
you can tell like, and the same thing with KSI, they're both athletes.

117
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.960
They both know how to fight a little bit and they probably up someone.

118
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:17.030
Who's not as good as them, but it's um, they both got wild.

119
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.590
And what that means is you,

120
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:21.910
you start swinging for the fences and sometimes you land and sometimes you

121
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:22.110
don't.

122
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.910
But if one of them could have stayed technical and just boxed and just fired off

123
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:30.710
sharp jabs and cleaned right hands and moved a lot and kept your hands up and

124
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.630
boxed, don't get emotional. If they could just box and not get emotional,

125
00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:35.350
they'd start landing. And if you start landing,

126
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:36.830
you start hurting the guy and he goes,

127
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.900
start hurting the guy with punches that aren't, your heart is shot. They don't,

128
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.140
you're not winding up with them. You're not exposing yourself.

129
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:44.540
You're just fighting. Technically.

130
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.220
That's the difference between someone who knows how to box a little bit and,

131
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.020
and starts slugging versus someone who's smart. Right. And someone who,

132
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.770
who understands that when you're fights. Yes. When you're under rest,

133
00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:01.050
you have to keep your, your calm and be able to see everything.

134
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.210
And the more you tighten up, the hard it's to see things,

135
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.050
and then you start swinging and then you you're barely paying attention. Right?

136
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.490
You, you, you might land and might knock the guy out still.

137
00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:10.890
You still have power. It's not an absolute thing. Right.

138
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.970
But when you look at guys who are really good boxers,

139
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.930
like Floyd Mayweather does not get into slug fests. Right. You know,

140
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.080
he just executes everything prosecuting. Yeah. He's figuring you out.

141
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:23.960
He's finding the holes. He's popping. 'em in there. He's not getting hit.

142
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.920
And then eventually starts chopping people down and breaking them down,

143
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:29.840
you know? And that's what he did with Connor. Connor had, I mean,

144
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:32.600
it was a great money grab for Connor, but that, that didn't make any sense.

145
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:36.840
Right. But that these guys, what they are, is they both like at a similar level,

146
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.350
the reason why it's so fun to it's.

147
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.990
Cause they're both like they can hit a little bit. They both are good athletes.

148
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.370
Yeah.

149
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.390
And they're both kind of learning how to fight and they're both super famous.

150
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.710
Yeah. Online. Yeah. And then they get together and then they're even bigger.

151
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.510
I mean, it was explosive. They sold out the staple. What does that hold?

152
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.670
Oh know, it's crazy. 20,000 people. A lot of people it's a lot of people,

153
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.540
it was one of the 18 at advance, you know? Oh yeah. Because yeah.

154
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.980
And it was a good fight. It's wild in terms of like entertainment value,

155
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.180
they went after it. They didn't.

156
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.980
But I think if one of them learned how to just box,

157
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:16.300
just stay like a samurai and just box and never let that emotion get ahold of

158
00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:20.530
you hard to do in this. Yeah. In the staple center. It's always hard to do,

159
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.570
but it's even more hard to do when you talk to each other. Is it,

160
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:26.610
is there a similarity when you're, when you you're playing arenas now,

161
00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:30.170
is that different when you're in an arena versus you being in a smaller venue?

162
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.010
Well, it's nothing like a fight. Of course. The thing about fights is like,

163
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:36.210
here comes here. It comes here, comes it's happening. Right?

164
00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.890
It's like all the preparation, all your nightmares, you get knocked out,

165
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.920
all the weird feelings. You like, you get hurt in training.

166
00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.600
You have to work around it. It still hurts. And you get in there,

167
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.320
all that stuff that they're dealing with when they go in there is like,

168
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.360
stand up times a million. Like the, the thing about standup is if, like,

169
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:55.560
if you do your prep work and you get your together, you could do it many,

170
00:08:55.561 --> 00:09:00.040
many nights in a row. Correct. They can't do that. That's they got one chance,

171
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.400
one chance, one chance,

172
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.560
you know that one time you did a joke and it just came out like. Yes.

173
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.840
And you're like, I wish I could do that show again. And ROS you away.

174
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.840
It ROS you away. Well, they, sometimes people have moments like that.

175
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.360
Athletically, like you just, you up you, your chin was up hot.

176
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:17.590
You came and swinging. You got clipped. Once you got clipped in the first round,

177
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.430
you tried to box in the second and third, and then he takes you out in the,

178
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.030
the fourth. And you're like. If I just played my fight. Right.

179
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.510
And played my game. Right. I could've outboxed him. Yeah.

180
00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:29.390
But instead I did something stupid and I got clipped, but then it's also,

181
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.030
I guess part of it is the show. Yeah.

182
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.660
Part of it is the spectacle it's so I'm saying so much easier to do comedy. No,

183
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.100
of course closed. Of course, of course I will.

184
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.260
I do wanna fight Chelsea handler that it's a good fight. That's a great fight.

185
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.740
Me. And Chelsea's a good, fine with that. Um, first of all,

186
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.653
which fight over though,

187
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.100
I mean that her latest documentary it's hello privilege. It's me.

188
00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:53.220
Chelsea we'll fight over that. Um, which was wild. I mean, you know,

189
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.860
it was a little wild. Did you see it? No.

190
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:57.690
It's her talking a white privilege in the back of her Bellaire mansion in the

191
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.130
backyard. It's a fun one. And um,

192
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.650
I just think she should go around and apologize for all the things like she

193
00:10:03.651 --> 00:10:07.770
should go to the Gaza strip and do hello Gaza to me, Chelsea and. Hello,

194
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.690
Tuskegee to me, Chelsea. I don't think they're allow. Yeah, well, right. No,

195
00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:11.690
she goes, gotta go to graves.

196
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.530
She should just apologize for everything America's ever done.

197
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.240
Go to native Americans, you know? No, I mean, I, I, I kid around,

198
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:22.640
but maybe these it's a joke. Don't you know, this is a joke.
