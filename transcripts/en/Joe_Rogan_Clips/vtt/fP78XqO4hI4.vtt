00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.120
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.320
<v 1>So, uh, check this out. That'surricanehardcore that's even crazier right now.</v>

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:08.990
What.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.760
<v 0>Hurricane Irma holds about twice the destructive energy of all bombs</v>

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.400
used in the second world war.

6
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.880
<v 1>7 Trillion, Watts of power in it right now.</v>

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.990
<v 0>So why can't we get like some kind of a windmill up there? Yeah. And collect.</v>

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.230
<v 2>It. You would have to have a big one and then it would become the biggest weapon</v>

9
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.590
ever. &lt;laugh&gt;. Well, why.

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.470
<v 0>Don't we design that instead of the galaxy note eight that no one wants to buy.</v>

11
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.543
I got it. How about you?

12
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.150
How about you buy a giant wind windmill thing and put it up there

13
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:40.230
and make all the power, please. So.

14
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.420
<v 1>I have some friends that are, are in Florida right now and the,</v>

15
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
the unforeseen problem that being out here and not knowing what to why,

16
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.980
and what people are doing there. I also have an uncle in Orlando.

17
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.420
Who's telling me he is not leaving right now because the roads are gridlocked

18
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.460
and the highway there's nowhere to go. Oh,

19
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.380
so my friends who left Tampa yesterday got up at like nine in the morning,

20
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.220
packed all their up and were like, all right, let's go. Where are we gonna go?

21
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.570
They were, are like, let's take side roads,

22
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.450
cuz it's probably gonna be busy everywhere. So they did for a while, three,

23
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.010
four hours of side roads. And then eventually you're gonna run outta gas.

24
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.570
You gotta go get gas first place. They stop. No gas. They're all out.

25
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.850
Oh no. So they continue on the next one waiting the gigantic line to fill up.

26
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.040
But now it's again, like hopefully we can live off a, of this tank of gas. Oh,

27
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:27.440
for the next till we get where we're goings and everybody has to leave right now

28
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.880
because the whole state could be potentially under 10 feet of water. Yeah.

29
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.080
The couple days. Yeah, the whole state and 10 foot, uh,

30
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:36.040
storm surge is coming in the whole state. I mean the,

31
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.960
it won't make it all the way to the middle probably, but, but it might gigantic.

32
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.640
We don't know, obviously too, the.

33
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.480
<v 2>The only positive if there's any positive, the,</v>

34
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.310
and compared to the last hurricane is that it's not gonna stall over Florida.

35
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.870
It's gonna keep on going and losing energy. The higher it gets, but on, uh,

36
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.830
Orlando should be, might get really. You know, that's Disney road,

37
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.830
Disney road might be gone this weekend. &lt;laugh&gt; right. And they just rebuild it.

38
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.980
Yeah. They just rebuild it all or all this new stuff too. So whoa.

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.980
<v 1>Oh yeah. There's like that 90% of this island, uh, Barbuda is gone is gone.</v>

40
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.020
Inhabitable, inhabitable, shiny, dead. They don't even know some of the too.

41
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.100
Cuz they can't see it. It was all happening last night.

42
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.060
They can't get over to find out what's going to get reports of it. Even they.

43
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.340
<v 0>Probably have no. So they don't know if the people are dead. They don't know.</v>

44
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.180
Right.

45
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.850
<v 2>I mean there's I elements are so small. I mean,</v>

46
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:28.450
what is this the size of like Texas or Ohio or something like that? It's uh.

47
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.170
<v 0>Yeah. It's the size of Ohio. The storm is yeah. 400 miles across.</v>

48
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.523
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

49
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.410
<v 0>That's scary. How wide is Florida? Florida's not 400 miles across.</v>

50
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.170
Right? I.

51
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.090
<v 1>Don't know exactly, but it's probably, I would go 300, 200 feet.</v>

52
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.960
<v 0>Groiffy so it's gonna be like a giant eraser that just</v>

53
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.843
rolls up Florida.

54
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.200
<v 1>And they're still not sure it could turn, you know? Right. It can always,</v>

55
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:52.720
this things can always turn. It could go back.

56
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.480
It could turn left and go to Texas. You know where the.

57
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.600
<v 0>Grossest people that have ever lived, the people speak of Florida.</v>

58
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.520
The people that go, I, they miss, they stay and they survive. And the,

59
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.200
the storm miraculously turns knew it. They're like, I knew it. No,

60
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.560
you didn't stupid. You didn't know it.

61
00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:13.160
You're no better than the people that got killed by it. You got lucky. You.

62
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.080
<v 2>Know, that's a lot of people in, in Houston. That's how they feel.</v>

63
00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:18.360
They make it a party. They, they, you like,

64
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.750
they have hurricane parties and this one really caught 'em off guard.

65
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.790
Did you know, uh.

66
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.910
<v 0>How did that cut catch 'em off guard. They saw it coming from days away.</v>

67
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.270
<v 2>Well, they, I think they in their heads think, oh no, you know, we're fine.</v>

68
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.350
We've been fine for years. You know, they're drunk.

69
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.590
<v 0>That's the problem. They're partying.</v>

70
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.510
They're listening to kid rock they're on top of the room.

71
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.780
They they're making out they're we don't care. We'll stay up here.

72
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.820
We got a boat. We're gonna be fine. We'll catch fish.

73
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.780
<v 2>There was an episode. I was, there was an episode I was on.</v>

74
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.500
I don't know if it was the last time I was on or whatever,

75
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:54.660
but we were talking about floods in Houston and I showed you that, that, that,

76
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.300
that concrete or not concrete pavement, that sucks up water. Uh,

77
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.450
I wonder if that would've been any help if they had implemented it that like

78
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.570
all, all over the place.

79
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.730
<v 0>Maybe hermeable. Um,</v>

80
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:12.170
but I think the amount of water they were dealing with is just so unprecedented.

81
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.410
They showed the difference between hurricane Katrina and hurricane Harvey.

82
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.170
Like the sheer amount of volume of water. It's insane.

83
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.800
Like this was such a big, big hurricane. That's just,

84
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.200
I wish there was a definitive answer as to if all this is

85
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.640
a direct result of like human behavior industry,

86
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.080
car exhaust. I wish there was a definitive result. Like we could see it like,

87
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:44.630
yeah, here is the number that you can show. What do you show me here? That,

88
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.670
that concrete. Oh, the water drinking concrete thousand. How does that do that?

89
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.150
I have.

90
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.430
<v 2>No idea. &lt;laugh&gt; it's magical. It's crazy.</v>

91
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.590
<v 0>Absorb runoff from fast floods. If you're watching it, folks,</v>

92
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.590
the people that are just listening it, it doesn't even seem real.

93
00:04:57.591 --> 00:05:02.340
It's like they have this giant water truck and it's poor waring water all over

94
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:06.820
the concrete and it's just dissipating almost instantaneously into the concrete.

95
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.300
It's super weird.

96
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.140
<v 2>I wonder if it has like a basement and what it does is it goes through like kind</v>

97
00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:14.460
of like a concrete filter and, and goes underneath.

98
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.140
So the actual water is just like underneath in the basement. Yeah.

99
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.580
<v 0>Man. I don't know what the it does. It doesn't even seem real.</v>

100
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:22.890
It seems like a scene in the Terminator or right. You.

101
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.723
<v 2>Know? Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.850
<v 0>Well, either way, like what they dealt with in Houston is so much water. I,</v>

103
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.970
I just doubt that. I mean, maybe that would've helped a little,

104
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.170
but I think that they're dealing with just some insane amount of water. Yeah.

105
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.970
That it shows what it is. Jamie. Yeah. It's like some sort of filtration system.

106
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.970
Yeah, I guess so. So it allows the water to go through it and it can like,

107
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.920
I don't know. It still seems.

108
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.000
<v 2>Like it was probably too much water.</v>

109
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.040
<v 0>Yeah. That Harvey was a monster hurricane.</v>

110
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.240
The crazy thing is how much bigger Irma is. Like I think we're numb to it.

111
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.400
I think we look at it and it doesn't make sense to us. You know, got 185.

112
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.720
<v 1>Mile sustained winds for over a day. No.</v>

113
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.553
<v 0>Like, no, no.</v>

114
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.720
<v 2>No, no. F Kot center is just gonna start rolling. Like a cataari.</v>

115
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.720
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; no, uh, but here's the thing, right?</v>

116
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.240
Is this the strongest they can get? No, they get stronger than this could be.

117
00:06:13.241 --> 00:06:14.060
Yes. The.

118
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.030
<v 1>The categories they track, this was the highest they'd gone.</v>

119
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:19.790
And now this one is the new bar to be basically.

120
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.230
<v 2>A Delta airline accidentally flew through it. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, yesterday by mistake.</v>

121
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.510
And it got out at the last minute. What? I forgot. I,

122
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.270
I read that this morning when I woke up, it got out. Yeah.

123
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:33.430
I guess it accidentally was flew into it and it was,

124
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.230
and somehow it got out of the hurricane. Oh.

125
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:38.820
<v 0>Okay. The pilot piloted his way out. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh,</v>

126
00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:41.740
I thought you meant it got out that the pilot did this. Oh, oh, oh.

127
00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.540
Delta pilot flew through Irma. One of the most powerful hurricanes recording.

128
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:48.220
All hundred 73 pastors are safe. Why would they do that?

129
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.740
<v 1>I don't know. The last one to fly out to Puerto Rico.</v>

130
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.020
<v 0>Oh, they had to, they had to fly through it. Did they? Did they</v>

131
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.410
judge it wrong? Yeah.

132
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.330
<v 2>They went through 185,000 mile hour winds. Can you imagine that turbulence?</v>

133
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.010
Well, it's.

134
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.690
<v 0>Not that fast. It's 187 miles an hour. Right, right.</v>

135
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.970
That thing is giant, man. When you see it on the ground or, you know,

136
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.250
in one of those overhead maps and you realize how big it is,

137
00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:18.760
like how big that is. &lt;laugh&gt; that's so crazy. So they were part of it,

138
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.120
I guess. Yeah. Does it show, I'm trying to figure it.

139
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.720
<v 2>Out. These people. Oh, it's like, yeah, it's going right now.</v>

140
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.840
<v 0>25 Hour mile is gusting 40. You.</v>

141
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.440
<v 1>Look at it. Uh, headed it towards it. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.600
You might had to turn around or.

143
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.240
<v 0>Whoa. Hmm huh.</v>

144
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:42.070
So they were, they were following it in real time. God. Yeah.

145
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:44.430
People were following off flight track. What was going on? Yeah. God.

146
00:07:44.431 --> 00:07:48.190
So he got stuck in the actual hurricane. Yeah. He flew through the hurricane.

147
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.110
&lt;laugh&gt; oh my God. That is insane.

148
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.110
<v 1>Oh wait. They landed.</v>

149
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:58.070
Hold on 52 minutes on the ground in San Juan they've landed and turned around.

150
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.540
<v 0>Oh they tried to make it back to America. Have to climb.</v>

151
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.300
<v 1>Out of San. This is the airport. It has to climb outta S J U.</v>

152
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:08.340
And they're doing so between the outer band of Irma and the core of the storm.

153
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.140
They went in between the bands. Oh, oh my.

154
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.420
<v 2>God. That's insaneup.</v>

155
00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:14.260
<v 1>Pile. It needs to be hugged by everybody.</v>

156
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.380
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;. So he went in between the bands and in do, wow.</v>

157
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.650
That's the most incredible thing about weather satellites.

158
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:25.170
They can literally navigate this guy through those bands and tell 'em like where

159
00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.010
the storm is ahead.

160
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.010
<v 2>Yeah. They have, uh,</v>

161
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:31.970
portable Doppler here now in Los Angeles to the AC where it's so accurate.

162
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.970
Now that, uh, that you can just see your street level of like,

163
00:08:35.971 --> 00:08:37.810
if there's a cloud in above you.

164
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:41.280
<v 0>Uh, look at this while it looks terrifying.</v>

165
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.600
Delta maintains that their pilots had everything under control.

166
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.160
Our meteorology team is the best in the business. Eric Snell,

167
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:53.120
vice president for Delta operations and customer center told the Washington post

168
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.920
DL 3 0 2 departed San Juan with 173 passengers on board, according to Delta,

169
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.440
Jesus Christ.

170
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.440
<v 1>It's good PR for them.</v>

171
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.200
<v 2>Jesus. Yeah, of course.</v>

172
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:07.480
Being on theairplane probably was the worst flight you'll ever have in your

173
00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:08.320
life. They took a hard.

174
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:12.200
<v 0>Look at the weather data and the track of the storm and worked with the flight</v>

175
00:09:12.201 --> 00:09:14.950
crew and dispatcher to a agree.

176
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.750
It was safe to operate the flight. Ooh.

177
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.670
<v 1>What'd you do if you're about to get on that plane and they're telling you what</v>

178
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:21.710
they're gonna do, I would.

179
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.230
<v 0>All over myself.</v>

180
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:27.270
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; I I'd probably say I'll stay at the airport and risk it. Oh.</v>

181
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:31.910
<v 0>Like, this man. I'm going to sleep. I'm going, I'm going to take my backpack.</v>

182
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:32.803
I'm sleeping on the ground.

183
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.140
I assume that you guys turn this thing into some sort of a hurricane shelter.

184
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:37.940
Have you been to.

185
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.580
<v 1>The airport in Puerto Rico? No, I haven't been to the San Juan one,</v>

186
00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:43.580
but I was at a one on the other side of the island. It's made of the cardboard.

187
00:09:43.581 --> 00:09:43.740
You.

188
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.620
<v 2>Do not want to, right? My God.</v>

189
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.500
<v 0>You don't get in the plane. You're right.</v>

190
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.700
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; I probably get in the plane. It's like a run down Burbank airport.</v>

191
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.340
<v 0>But they got away with it. Puerto Rico didn't get totally hit.</v>

192
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.930
They only got like a little piece of it. Yeah.

193
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.890
Well that's the thing about these kind of storms.

194
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:03.250
So you could just get unlucky and it just runs right over your spot or you can

195
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.730
be right next to that and go, Lord was looking out for us like, okay.

196
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.090
You sure are you sure? You just didn't get lucky?

197
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:14.250
Like we're dealing with impossible forces, like a hurricane,

198
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:18.320
the size of Ohio. Is it impossible force like that?

199
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.040
I don't think we really understand what the that means.

200
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.800
I think that's one of those things where someone says a trillion billion

201
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.160
dollars, like yeah, let's look, but you don't really think about it. You know,

202
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.320
you don't really, really understand what that means.

203
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.320
Cause it's too much the size of the universe. It's too much the power that,

204
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:38.710
that thing has. It's just too much. Doesn't make sense. You'd have to see it.

205
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.590
You'd have to be there.

206
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.510
<v 2>Do you see the video? I don't know if it's real either, but the video of a,</v>

207
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.190
I don't know if it was today's hurricane this, guy's trying to hold his truck.

208
00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.950
Like he had like a pickup truck trying to hold it so it doesn't tip over.

209
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.500
Oh geez. And the winds were so strong. He just gets squished from, by, I mean,

210
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.860
my it's hard to see cuz it was raining so hard, but guy's.

211
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:02.060
<v 0>Gotta be crazy. Why would he do that? Yeah.</v>

212
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:05.540
Standing a truck is about to flip and you think you're gonna stop it with your

213
00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:09.340
hands. You watch too many movies. It can pick up a truck.

214
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.060
Can you pick up a truck? No. Then get the out of there. I can put this.

215
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.900
<v 1>On YouTube, but we can watch.</v>

216
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.610
<v 0>It. I what is it? The video. Oh, this is the guy. Oh Jesus. Oh dude.</v>

217
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:24.050
That's a wrap. Yeah. Yeah. He's crazy. &lt;laugh&gt; that? Guy's crazy.

218
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.450
Look at that thing. in the breeze. You should have got out of there man.

219
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.370
<v 2>Oh yeah. He just sandwiched.</v>

220
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.890
<v 0>Yeah. He got crushed. He didn't handle it. Well, no I would.</v>

221
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.770
You can't get out from under that. That's too much weight. You're dead.

222
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.120
<v 2>It's those fast ones that get me like that guy probably just was like, oh,</v>

223
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:46.680
well my truck't about to boom. You're dead. Well.

224
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.800
<v 0>The thing thing about these kind of hurricanes are how many of 'em can you get</v>

225
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:55.320
in a row? Cause if they're saying there's two more in a row behind Irma.

226
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.840
<v 2>2005.</v>

227
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.320
<v 1>I think it was, they got hit for like four Florida got hit like four times in a.</v>

228
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.960
<v 2>Row and like two weeks. Yeah. But these are like three weeks, four weeks. These,</v>

229
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.200
those are like twos and threes. These are fives and you know, Jose, you know,

230
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.910
Jose's going right for Washington DC. You know.

231
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:14.710
<v 0>Hurricane Jose.</v>

232
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.870
<v 2>Jose's gonna be the big one. Do you think? So? I know. True.</v>

233
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.870
Probably won't even hit United States.

234
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.550
<v 0>I'm worried about 'em all man. I'm worried about earthquakes.</v>

235
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.870
I'm worried about asteroids. I'm worried about super volcanoes. I,

236
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.990
we are dealing with just a small amount of history. That's what's going on.

237
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:32.750
I mean, especially when it comes to weather.

238
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:42.940
<v 3>So.</v>
