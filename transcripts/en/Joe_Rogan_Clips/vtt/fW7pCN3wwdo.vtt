00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.760
<v 3>Yeah. But there's also like gun culture that people don't like,</v>

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.480
the celebration of shooting things. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and blowing things up.

4
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:12.200
People get angry at that because they,

5
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:16.120
they feel like it's glorifying it and they feel like you're gonna get those guns

6
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.880
and put 'em in the hands of, uh, toxic male people.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.950
And they're gonna wanna shoot.

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.870
<v 1>People if 400 million guns in this country. If we were a problem,</v>

9
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.723
you would know it.

10
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.413
<v 0>Yeah. But.</v>

11
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.550
<v 1>It's really that simple. It's an.</v>

12
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.350
<v 0>Olds, so many guns. Right. That's, what's crazy. And to think about.</v>

13
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.710
<v 1>Guns and people and, and,</v>

14
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.870
and yet still we don't lead the world in gun deaths. Who does?

15
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.460
That's a good question. I think we cuz came in like we were like, right.

16
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.860
I think we're like at 12 number 12 or something like that. Really?

17
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.700
<v 0>Yeah. We're not. I thought we were number one. No, we're not.</v>

18
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.620
We need to work harder boys. Not &lt;laugh&gt; we're.

19
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.340
<v 1>Number one. No, but even, but even, but even still again,</v>

20
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.580
65% of those are suicides. Right. But then if you,

21
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.460
and so I can hear people say all the time, they'll say, well,

22
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.970
&lt;affirmative&gt; those suicides are, are,

23
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.410
are more efficiently done because of guns. So I was like,

24
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.490
so what's the solution ban guns, guns.

25
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.490
<v 0>Make it harder. No. To kill.</v>

26
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.850
<v 1>Yourself. I mean, by banning guns. Yeah. Like I said, but like I said,</v>

27
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:21.570
at the beginning of this, the only logical conclusion it's to ban guns.

28
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.680
<v 2>What's that United States is low.</v>

29
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.280
If you're going per capita mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

30
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.560
But that like you take the top 10 and you add 'em all up and it's not as many as

31
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:31.960
it happen in the United States. So.

32
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.740
<v 0>We're number one.</v>

33
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.760
<v 2>Number two behind.</v>

34
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.840
<v 1>Brazil in terms of the actual, like total number, total deaths. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:38.760
Total deaths. Now what's the population of Brazil do that.

36
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.990
<v 0>Brazil's got a lot of people. Wow. We're number one.</v>

37
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.190
Uh, number two by 14,000. But the.

38
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.950
<v 2>Per hundred thousand, we are number 25 20.</v>

39
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.430
<v 1>Which is which, which I think is a more accurate assessment.</v>

40
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.230
If you take into account the number, what is,

41
00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:57.870
what's the population of people in Brazil.

42
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.710
<v 0>So we capital we're number 20 Brazil has a lot of people go back to the actual</v>

43
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.580
numbers again. What are we at there? Two.

44
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.220
<v 2>Right on that. This is of 20 16, 20 16.</v>

45
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.460
<v 0>So there's 6,000 ish. Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.220
So 6,000 ish more in Brazil per year than the

47
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:16.780
United States, which is, uh, that's surprising,

48
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.980
but deaths per a hundred thousand, they have 19, we have 10, that's a big jump.

49
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:21.814
It's almost double.

50
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.730
<v 2>And there's way more people in India and they have way less and.</v>

51
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.850
<v 0>Yeah. Way more people. Right. They have like a billion people. Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.050
And then Mexico is surprisingly low. Go down there. Look at Mexico.

53
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.530
That's really low. I I'm kind of shocked by that.

54
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.050
They have less than half what we have. Huh? Interesting deaths per.

55
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 1>100,000. You talking, are you talking about population?</v>

56
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.970
<v 0>No. Um, the amount of deaths they have total. Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.880
<v 1>From, but what's the population of.</v>

58
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.160
<v 0>Mexico? Well, it says deaths per 100,000. They have 11.8 deaths.</v>

59
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.840
We have 10.6. So wouldn't that make them more than us?

60
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.473
There's a total death.

61
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.320
<v 1>In terms, in terms of per capita. Yeah. Per capita. But as far as,</v>

62
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.400
as far as total numbers, bro, look at.

63
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.040
<v 0>Venezuela 38. Oh yeah. Death per a hundred thousand. They have a lot more, holy.</v>

64
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.040
This, their number one or El Sal eight El Salvador's 39.

65
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.200
It's only 2,500 people died. I'm just comparatively.

66
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.400
That's why it's a super dangerous 13 in Greenland.

67
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.910
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But Greenland has a population of two.</v>

68
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.510
<v 0>People. Yeah. They just killed each other and they jumped up to number one.</v>

69
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.230
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. It's um, wow. Puerto Rico's that high on the list.

70
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.190
Go back up to that. I'm gonna have to call John Don kinda separately.

71
00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:33.950
It's part of America. Uh, because it's not same the Virgin. I mean, it is,

72
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.750
it is not America. It's like neither is Hawaii, you know? I mean,

73
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.060
why is America? But let's be honest. We stole that. You know,

74
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.300
not we, but somebody did it's five hours by plane in the middle of the ocean.

75
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.620
How the is that America? It is true. And.

76
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.420
<v 1>Uh, it's kinda like all cities in Houston. Yeah.</v>

77
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.700
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; it's this place. I mean, this, uh, this chart is kind of surprising,</v>

78
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.410
like seeing those, the, the death numbers that, that is surprising,

79
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.450
but so number one, all total deaths though is Brazil.

80
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.450
So we're number two for all total deaths, but Brazil,

81
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.810
I don't believe has the same population as America was Brazil's total

82
00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:18.970
population. I wanna say a hundred thou,

83
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.800
a hundred million rather that's my guess.

84
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.920
<v 1>Two hundred and eleven, two hundred eleven. And we have 300 million,</v>

85
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.320
300 about yeah.

86
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.800
<v 0>Hmm. Yeah. Brazil's dangerous as though. In some,</v>

87
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.280
some areas like the faves you ever see city of God. Yes. Woo.

88
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.480
What a crazy movie that is.

89
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.550
<v 1>In an eerily way. Very beautiful at the same time. Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.670
<v 0>Yeah. Well, it's a brilliant movie. Yeah. It's a brilliant movie. So yeah,</v>

91
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:48.390
Brazil's got a strange situation.

92
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.950
<v 1>I mean, I think recently they just think the new president just kind of</v>

93
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.630
loosen the grip on the gun laws in Brazil, but generally speaking,

94
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.510
the gun laws in Brazil, very, very strict. Hmm.

95
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.940
<v 0>Did it is interesting that places with the highest gun laws in America are the</v>

96
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:08.220
places with the most amount of gun violence. That's so.

97
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.660
<v 1>Strange. Well, I think, I think because by and large, the,</v>

98
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.220
the attempted solution for the violence,

99
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.300
because those places also have the highest concentrations of inner cities,

100
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.300
right? And so there are solution for those,

101
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.650
for those things was always gun control and in response to it,

102
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:27.770
it's always more gun control. And if that doesn't work, add more gun control.

103
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.050
If that doesn't work, sprinkle a little bit more gun control.

104
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.690
And if that doesn't work, let's put just a little bit more gun control.

105
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.970
This time I promised this gun control will work and then it keeps happening.

106
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.530
Gun control, gun control, gun control, gun control.

107
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.400
That's the point that I'm making the answer is always going to be gun control.
