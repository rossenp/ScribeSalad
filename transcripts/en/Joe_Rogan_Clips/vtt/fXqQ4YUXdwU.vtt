00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>Story of how he got in. Is there, is there a video out.</v>

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.580
<v 2>There? Scientology, Scientology?</v>

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.460
<v 0>How did he get in? Like what happened?</v>

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.430
<v 2>That's a good question. I think somebody recruited him from a movie. He was.</v>

6
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.680
<v 0>Good though. He was in movies. He was in</v>

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.800
[inaudible] the guy who made that happen.

8
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.460
[inaudible] who got him.

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.790
<v 3>Let lists on Scientology. There's like season four.</v>

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.490
<v 0>The remedy. She did my.</v>

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.860
<v 2>Podcast. She talked about it. You know, when I first met her,</v>

12
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:40.430
she was deep in it. She was with Kevin, James. She was on king and Queens.

13
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:43.280
And that's when I first met her that he was like, she's a Scientologist.

14
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:48.080
It's like, whoa, she's really nice. She's very cool, man. That's just a cutie.

15
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.170
<v 1>To mind control experiment. That's all that is. Yeah. Well.</v>

16
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.570
<v 2>Somebody figured out how to control people long time ago.</v>

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.110
It's called come up with a set of rules and say that this is like,

18
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.250
someone's looking out for this set of rules, whether it's God or it's Buddha or.

19
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.600
<v 0>[Inaudible] create a mythology, do this, do that. And people follow it. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.250
So the crazy thing is the stuff that, you know, it's nothing but reports of,

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.373
uh.

22
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.210
<v 1>Child abuse. It just.</v>

23
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.850
<v 2>Yeah. It's one of the big problems with Colts, you know, wanting to Joey Diaz,</v>

24
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:23.870
his ex-girlfriends was in a call like when she was a kid. And she said that, uh,

25
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:26.780
the guy was the head of the call. Molested everybody. Of course less.

26
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.840
It all the girls. Yeah. Molested. He wanted to everybody's white. Yeah.

27
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:34.400
It's all just that's who starts? Yeah. Well that's all these calls.

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.100
That's what happened. [inaudible].

29
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.290
<v 0>David Koresh has. That's a crazy thing, David.</v>

30
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.300
<v 1>Koresh. They shut that. Ship the down. We're allowing this to happen. It's like,</v>

31
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:48.590
we want it to happen. It's like, it's a CIA MK ultra experiment. Wait,

32
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:48.830
what do you.

33
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.663
<v 0>Mean?</v>

34
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.640
[inaudible] well, I realized [inaudible] look at the time.

35
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.090
[inaudible] let me feed the beast. I love writers. I don't know.

36
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.350
[inaudible] and when you look into it, you got to look in that. Yeah.

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.940
We'll get into it. I've been looking into it. Think about this. Think about it.

38
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.180
How crazy that religion is. Think about that. Think about how.

39
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.680
<v 1>It's allowed to survive and thrive. Scientology.</v>

40
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.770
<v 2>Even better. I'll do you one better Scientology. Doesn't have to pay taxes.</v>

41
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.460
They figured out a way [inaudible].

42
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.700
<v 0>Hold.</v>

43
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.440
<v 2>On. I'll tell you, I'll tell you the actual facts.</v>

44
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.940
I'll tell you the actual fact,

45
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.070
they organized a massive lawsuit campaign against the IRS.

46
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.400
And they said that if you can say that all these different religions,

47
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:48.770
whether it's Catholicism or Mormonism,

48
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.560
Mormonism has very questionable backgrounds.

49
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.980
Mormonism was started by Joseph Smith, who was a known con man. I mean,

50
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:59.210
Mormonism of course it's yeah. There's there's like he found it when he was 14.

51
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.890
He said he found golden tablets that contained the loss work of Jesus.

52
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:05.710
And only he could read them. Cause he had a magic sear stone.

53
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.630
Like when you look at the actual, what you're talking about,

54
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:11.440
a guy who we know the guy, right? So Scientology was like, well,

55
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.470
so what if you can take that if you'd take Mormonism,

56
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.860
like why can't we get tax exempt status? And they said, no, you.

57
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.790
You're not a real religion. And I'm like. If, if,

58
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.400
if anything is a religion where religion and that sense, I support them.

59
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.040
I don't think, I think all religions should have to pay taxes.

60
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.320
But I think that if anybody gets a free ride,

61
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.963
Scientologists should get a free ride.

62
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.910
If you're going to have this goofy loophole and then they qualify.

63
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.630
<v 0>Just [inaudible] Mormons, get.</v>

64
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.540
<v 2>Up to that's. What happened? Any is massive lawsuits. It was,</v>

65
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.670
and this is all you could find it. I saw,

66
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.440
I saw the documentary filed a shitload of lawsuits and the IRS was.

67
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.430
So I'm, I'll go and clear the dock. It's so amazing books. Amazing doc.

68
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.440
It's a great book. The books even better. Great.

69
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:58.240
Because it goes into the history book everything's allowed to happen.

70
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.000
The thing is no one could pay attention to everything everything's allowed to

71
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:01.811
happen all the time.

72
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.570
And then once we find out that something's happening and it's like, okay,

73
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.030
now what [inaudible] anyway,

74
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.340
you can't shut down a religion where you can't shut down.

75
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:12.640
Anybody's freedom of speech. If you have an ideology,

76
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.580
your freedom of expression, your ability to gather and talk.

77
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.740
<v 1>All I know is if, if I had a country to run, I would start.</v>

78
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.150
If I was running the country,

79
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:26.880
I would start Colts and have mind control experiment.

80
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.481
<v 2>I would too,</v>

81
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:31.080
but I wouldn't have time in between negotiating oil deals and trying to figure

82
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:32.010
out whether or not we should stay.

83
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.720
<v 0>In tomato and prime in Paris, climate control.</v>

84
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.580
I know what you're saying. And in a way, in my way, you're right. But.

85
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.930
<v 2>No one has the time to do not enough to micromanage the entire world.</v>

86
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.280
They're too busy, right?

87
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.070
<v 4>It's just, there's there's only so.</v>

88
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.890
<v 0>Much. You can let people take care of themselves.</v>

89
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.630
<v 2>I guess you could let people take care of themselves. Illuminati got key.</v>

90
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.430
<v 0>It's got enough time for my control experiments. There's too much going on.</v>

91
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.910
Well, they definitely have done some control experiments too.

92
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:14.430
That's part of the problem around a country. I'm thinking of

93
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.500
[inaudible] comic book guy, right? It's comic books. I would definitely

94
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.800
[inaudible]. You're going to start a religion. You're gonna

95
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 start a religion. You're going to start a real in

96
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 this way. And we're going to just watch mastermind. Who is I want to know from you and you better tell me my country 500 years. Hold on, hold on. You know it, 

97
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.633
you.

98
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.230
<v 5>Have a question, Brian, you better tell me this. Cause I know,</v>

99
00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:46.950
you know the answer, but as a dictator, I want you to know.

100
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.240
I want to know right now on this podcast, who's running this country.

101
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.760
<v 1>I have no idea. Come on bro. I don't.</v>

102
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.260
<v 0>Know. Give me a little idea. Cause I know you gotta, I don't know, bro.</v>

103
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:01.730
You're out. You're playing dumb right now.

104
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.290
And I guess I'm going to ask a Satan based on nothing but

105
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.760
circumstantial evidence. I'm going to Oprah. I believe the guests.

106
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.033
<v 6>Uh.</v>

107
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.060
<v 0>Educated guys control the banks. That's I don't know who would they be?</v>

108
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.350
Roth trials. I don't know. I could be wrong.

109
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.300
That could be could no, no.

110
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.180
I looked up on the day.

111
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.580
<v 2>And the Ross child's like a family. Here's what's hilarious.</v>

112
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.360
It's 1 billion to like 70 trillion.

113
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.560
<v 0>700 Trillion, 700 billion or trillion 700 billion number.</v>

114
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.190
The amount of money they own. It's either a billion or a hundred percent real.

115
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.890
Oh, a hundred percent. There's a family that owns all the banks. No.

116
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.890
<v 2>There is a family that has a considerable amount of money.</v>

117
00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:50.540
They pass down from generation to generation. And these, these.

118
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.483
<v 0>[Inaudible], we don't know. We don't know. That's what they say. Okay. Hold on.</v>

119
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:04.270
<v 2>They say between 1 billion and 700 million, it says 500 trillion. Do.</v>

120
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.480
<v 0>They even exist? Now do the rough Charles even exists?</v>

121
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.530
That could be a conspiracy. Can I say one thing? The Rothschilds or hoax? Okay.

122
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.520
Think about.

123
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.390
<v 5>The Rothschilds. When,</v>

124
00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.700
when you talk about the Ross Charles and these different big families,

125
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.850
if there's one thing in common, it's a hoax. Nope. Follow me on this.

126
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.000
If you hear it. Nope. They're all Jewish. And by the way, it comes up.

127
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.220
If you look at their roots, if you look at the roots of these, a lot of these,

128
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.380
a lot of these rumors, a lot of these rumors and conspiracies,

129
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:27.400
they start in the,

130
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.860
the free male Nazi camps and the ultra right wing camps.

131
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.380
And a lot of the antisemitic anti you know.

132
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.300
<v 0>History goes way back. That goes way back.</v>

133
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.250
<v 5>Into Europe. That goes way back with the Nazi.</v>

134
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:45.640
So just be careful where these things come from. You'll find that their roots.

135
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.800
And I know, I don't know your, but their roots,

136
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.540
their roots sometimes start in really awful places. So.

137
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.360
<v 2>You should read a book every now and then, Hey, listen.</v>

138
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.920
<v 0>I got some books for you, Lawrence, right?</v>

139
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:59.950
The guy has had clear and the looming tower to.

140
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.090
<v 5>The plant paradox, which I'm reading now about food. Very interesting.</v>

141
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.210
<v 0>Unless it benefits me to believe something, unless I make.</v>

142
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.820
<v 1>Money from it. Like I say, [inaudible].</v>

143
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.200
<v 0>You're a idiot. You know? Like what if I believe this dude, you could be,</v>

144
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.170
your kids could be go to college. If you want to make measurable.

145
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.990
If you just sign off and say, you believe it like, uh, that's not,

146
00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:26.920
what's going to happen. Is it illegal? If I don't believe it? Well,

147
00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:31.390
I get thrown in jail. No. Then I don't want to, if I don't want to believe.

148
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.010
If it, if it doesn't hurt me, I, it shouldn't be.

149
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.270
<v 1>Uh, such a big deal. That's you know, that's I don't know what to believe, man.</v>

150
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.840
I don't know if the Rothschilds are real. I don't know. Reptilians of real.

151
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.770
I don't know. Satanism is real. I don't know. One thing I'd say.

152
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:48.550
<v 5>Is learning,</v>

153
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.080
getting closer to the truth can be achieved by looking at all the

154
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:55.740
independent lines of inquiry. All the lines.

155
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.370
<v 0>Come to one consensus come to the truth. Brian Kelly. Yeah.</v>

156
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.140
I'm saying you're trying to tell me exactly how.

157
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.630
<v 5>To, I'm just saying general I'm spelling I'm general.</v>

158
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.840
Cause I would never tell you to get close. Probably come on, come on, man.

159
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.040
I'm talking about.

160
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.980
<v 2>Let me say this because I think this is really important.</v>

161
00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:14.690
One of the problems that I've had me personally I've had with any idea is that

162
00:09:14.691 --> 00:09:16.370
once I have an original idea,

163
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.700
or once I start looking at something in a certain way, I become married to it.

164
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.170
Yes. And I've had real problems with that.

165
00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:23.420
And then all of us have this confirmation bias, which I understand.

166
00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:25.850
But I'm just saying I've had real problems with that. Like personally,

167
00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:29.240
where I had to look at like what I believed and go, well, why do I believe that?

168
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.820
And why, why do I think? And there's been a bunch of times,

169
00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.880
whether it's through big foot or UFO's or, I mean,

170
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:38.510
I've looked at the JFK assassination, a hundred different times. You know,

171
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.730
there's been times when I said, well, maybe won't got lucky.

172
00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:42.170
I mean like people do get lucky.

173
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.980
Like I I've shot the first animal I ever shot.

174
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:48.800
I shot at 200 yards and I probably shouldn't have hit it. And it dropped,

175
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.960
I could've that up. You know, you can, if you're aiming at something,

176
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:56.660
pull the trigger and hit the president in the back of the head. It is possible.

177
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.470
I don't think it did. It seems to me more like some other was going on.

178
00:10:00.471 --> 00:10:04.100
If you look at all the different pieces of evidence, but I don't know, man.

179
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.040
And the problem with saying this happened, that happened,

180
00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:11.690
which I used to do all the time is that you don't know. You don't know.

181
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:16.640
You don't know until you do know when you say, you know, and you might be wrong,

182
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.810
it becomes a ego thing. Yes. You can get closer.

183
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.000
<v 5>To the truth. You can approximate. So hear scientists.</v>

184
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.780
They always say it's so fascinating. Scientists start always with doubt.

185
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.720
And what they do is they always say, if you really cornerstone is they'll say,

186
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.370
well, this is the most likely, uh, based on the data I've looked at,

187
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.900
are there literature I've read carefully. This is the most likely possibility.

188
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.700
It's really a symbol. Hear how they talk that way.

189
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:44.930
Because like with global warming or anything, Kraus, uh,

190
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.410
listen, I've had him on my podcast. I listened to you,

191
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.560
both the podcast you had with him and try to read some of his books.

192
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.960
<v 2>It was tough. But yes, book is rough dude.</v>

193
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.110
When he starts to have to have a backyard symmetry when he was going to the

194
00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.840
gauge symmetry and I up by opening up my podcast,

195
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.950
asking him to explain gauge symmetry. I know it's insane.

196
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.370
I got some medical physiques. I got, this is what I got some hole in your head.

197
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:07.940
I got that. There's.

198
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.480
<v 5>A web, there's an invisible web. And we come into contact with it. W w we,</v>

199
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.470
we become mass.

200
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.000
<v 2>You stand as skeptical as we are of this. These are the same that put together.</v>

201
00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:20.300
The large Hadron Collider, Sierra spinning Adams,

202
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.250
just slightly under the speed of light,

203
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:27.200
slamming him into each other and recreating the very instances right after the

204
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:30.860
big bang. And they're doing that right? Crazy. There's a team of scientists.

205
00:11:30.861 --> 00:11:34.160
How many? 130 countries. Yeah. Thousands. Thousands. I.

206
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.390
<v 0>Feel like I find out how many, you guys all agree that Nikola Tesla was, uh,</v>

207
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.160
a great scientist for.

208
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.993
<v 2>Sure.</v>

209
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.800
But you gotta remember the Nikola Tesla lived in a world where he was so far

210
00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:49.130
ahead of the curve and there's very few people that were able to compete with

211
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.540
them or even understand what he was deejaying.

212
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.790
<v 1>Okay. Do you know that if you go to YouTube and you punch in Nikola, Tesla,</v>

213
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:57.250
hoax, fraud, nothing comes up.

214
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.260
<v 2>That's amazing. That makes sense. That's also a guy.</v>

215
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.790
<v 0>That lives buddy, on the plan dispute trying to say all that was.</v>

216
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.320
There's no, you go to YouTube. Punching Nikola, Tesla,

217
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.370
hoax fraud, not one video.

218
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.930
There's videos that come up that saying, uh, something else was a hoax. NYCLA.

219
00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:22.710
Tessa proves it. Or, you know, Nixon, Nixon, Tesla proves hoax,

220
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.750
but not one video of anybody ever say Nicholas,

221
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.510
but, but.

222
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:36.240
<v 1>This is just the fact you can take it or leave it put in Albert Einstein,</v>

223
00:12:36.241 --> 00:12:41.190
hoax, fraud, endless videos. It's free.

224
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.000
<v 0>Videos. And they're like, wait a minute.</v>

225
00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.300
It's an Albert was an Albert Einstein time.

226
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:52.830
Magazine's man of the century. Okay. But let me stop. Okay.

227
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.480
Hold on a second. Let.

228
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.610
<v 2>Me just help you here. You're getting very dramatic.</v>

229
00:12:56.611 --> 00:13:00.360
So let me stop for a second. If you put in, if you put in Holocaust hoax,

230
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:03.930
you'll get an equal number. Um, I'm not talking about, but you know,

231
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:08.070
that's true. If you put in Sandy hook hoax, you're getting an equal number.

232
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:10.890
You get it, you get a tremendous number of people to think that.

233
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.650
<v 0>You're right. It's amazing.</v>

234
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.880
<v 2>Well, also not him.</v>

235
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:18.420
How about people that don't think that Richard Pryor was genius.

236
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.670
<v 0>Prior? Have you ever.</v>

237
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:23.280
<v 2>Met a comic once that doesn't think Richard Pryor is one of the greatest of all</v>

238
00:13:23.281 --> 00:13:25.290
time. They don't exist. There are videos.

239
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:27.390
<v 1>Of people trying to prove that he was wasn't the.</v>

240
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:32.130
<v 0>Greatest. No, but I mean, look, I, I believe, you know, Nikola Tesla.</v>

241
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.390
<v 2>I don't think that Einstein was a hoax dude. It's not causation though.</v>

242
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.340
<v 1>I'm not, I don't know nothing. All I know is there's nothing on Nicholas Tesla.</v>

243
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.070
<v 0>No meaning, but there's thousands of Albert. I,</v>

244
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.740
you look into his life like, oh,

245
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.100
besides the Tesla doesn't have.

246
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.290
<v 3>That. Is he the only guy at.</v>

247
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.340
<v 2>Thomas Edison,</v>

248
00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.960
Thomas Edison was always accused of stealing the ideas of Nikola Tesla. In fact,

249
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:04.860
Thomas Edison, electrocuted an elephant in the middle of like, what was it?

250
00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:09.660
The world science, Thomas, Thomas Edison, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Edison,

251
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.710
electrocuted a elephants there's video because he wanted to prove that

252
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.030
alternating and direct current like ACDC, which is Tesla's idea.

253
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.730
There's video of an elephant electrocuted, not by Thomas

254
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.850
Denison's Thomas Edison did it.

255
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.290
The reason why he did it is to prove or to try to like it was propaganda against

256
00:14:28.291 --> 00:14:32.610
Tesla's ideas, which are more advanced. He wanted a moveable,

257
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.780
like he wanted, he wanted there to be alternating currents and.

258
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.370
<v 0>Tesla, Tesla, and Einstein were alive and kicking at the same time.</v>

259
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.410
Tesla there's quotes. The quotes could be. You know, Tesla, Tesla,

260
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:47.340
several decades.

261
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:53.420
He thought Einstein was fraud. That could be a phrase that I've heard.

262
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:58.100
I've heard that, but there are quotes that can be of Tesla.

263
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:01.670
There's I keep, they keep popping up. No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.

264
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.080
There's quotes.

265
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.630
Tesla quotes saying the theory of relativity is basically a joke

266
00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:12.110
there's test. Hold on. No, no. What I'm saying is it could be,

267
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.880
but it keeps coming.

268
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.150
<v 5>Up. We know that the theory of relativity is used, right?</v>

269
00:15:17.151 --> 00:15:19.250
So that we know that that's not so much a theory anymore,

270
00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.080
but here's what I think that he's addressing.

271
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.550
So Einstein from what I have read is Einstein was a great mind,

272
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.380
but he was coming up at a time where he got most of the credit. He got,

273
00:15:30.381 --> 00:15:31.220
he became very,

274
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.690
he became a famous scientist when there were a lot of scientists working on very

275
00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:36.410
similar ideas.

276
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.170
<v 0>An average scientist and contributing.</v>

277
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:44.510
<v 5>To, to the larger debate about, uh, um, uh, um,</v>

278
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.730
what is it? New, uh, quantum physics, right?

279
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.630
<v 2>There was also a big debate about their methods.</v>

280
00:15:49.631 --> 00:15:53.140
Whereas Tesla was a big fan of experiments.

281
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.640
Einstein was a big fan of equations and one of the big, big criticisms.

282
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.460
<v 0>What does it say? What do you call it today?</v>

283
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.000
<v 2>What does this? Tesla's overrated, debunking Tesla.</v>

284
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.480
Tesla's a popular figure in conspiracy culture. What does, what is it saying?

285
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.423
What is he saying?

286
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.160
<v 0>[Inaudible] what is he saying? Yes. He said right.</v>

287
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.440
<v 7>Here, he says Tesla was a popular figure today,</v>

288
00:16:17.441 --> 00:16:20.260
but he's also a self publicist and this stuff he didn't invent.

289
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:22.930
<v 2>No, not event alternate and current. Yeah.</v>

290
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.510
He just was one of many people working on it. Okay. What,

291
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.020
he's probably one of the, for forefront minds, right?

292
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.370
Being a showman helped popularize too. She's so good at that. Eventually had to,

293
00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:37.570
I don't know if he's right or not. [inaudible].

294
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:37.840
<v 0>He said.</v>

295
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.980
<v 7>There's no one saying anything against him. [inaudible].</v>

296
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.560
<v 0>He's, he's a hundred percent official.</v>

297
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.490
<v 1>Story. He's not against not, he doesn't believe in that one country. No,</v>

298
00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:49.030
you're right.

299
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.230
<v 2>A hundred percent. And that's one of my,</v>

300
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.060
the only criticism that I had about that guy.

301
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.160
Like when we talked about the Gulf of Tonkin,

302
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:56.740
he doesn't want to even admit that Gulf and towers, a false flag

303
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.270
operation Northwest. He was trying to downplay. I'm like, look, man,

304
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.120
whether or not, you know what happened in any other place? Well, you know,

305
00:17:04.121 --> 00:17:09.040
the joint chiefs of staff wrote down a memo saying what the plan was to

306
00:17:09.041 --> 00:17:12.730
have Guantanamo bay attacked by Cuban friendlies that were going to give them

307
00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:17.250
guns, give them bombs, have them attack Americans. He's always like, well,

308
00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.140
it never was like implemented. I was like, this is, it doesn't matter.

309
00:17:20.141 --> 00:17:22.870
They signed it. Kennedy had a veto. Yes, but Kennedy vetoed it.

310
00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:25.090
That's why those checks and balances are in place. Like no, no, no.

311
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.220
The mindset behind the type of person that would want to blow up Americans

312
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.370
and blame it on the cube. And so we could justify it.

313
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.130
<v 5>The founding fathers knew that there would always be people within the</v>

314
00:17:36.131 --> 00:17:38.140
government that would do anything they could.

315
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:39.880
And so that's where the checks and balances.

316
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.540
<v 2>Course, they don't always go through perfectly that's. I mean, if,</v>

317
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.650
if PR if Nixon was Reagan or, I mean,

318
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:51.210
if it was rather, if Kennedy rather was Reagan or Kennedy was Nixon,

319
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.750
he might very well have let that slide, who knows. I mean,

320
00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:57.810
a different person in a different circumstance with a different view of the

321
00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:01.380
world could have let the joint chiefs of staff pull that through.

322
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.240
So that shows you the mindset, right?

323
00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:06.870
So the mindset's undeniable that people absolutely do conspire.

324
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.900
So when you're a guy who never believes in conspiracies,

325
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.650
you do just as much damage as a guy who always believes in kids.

326
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.240
<v 5>So Alexander Hamilton said that it's not just a king.</v>

327
00:18:17.241 --> 00:18:20.810
You have to worry about it's your actual government that's been elected.

328
00:18:20.811 --> 00:18:24.770
So just because you're parliament, he was using problem as an example,

329
00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.550
just because Prama was voted in doesn't mean that small group of people will not

330
00:18:28.551 --> 00:18:30.140
get power hungry and drunk.

331
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:33.260
So therefore you've got to have all these checks and balances.

332
00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:34.100
You've got to have courts,

333
00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:37.370
you've got all kinds of things and you have to have a Senate and a house of

334
00:18:37.371 --> 00:18:39.140
representatives. This is where these ideas came from.

335
00:18:39.141 --> 00:18:41.660
That's what the genius of those guys. Okay.
