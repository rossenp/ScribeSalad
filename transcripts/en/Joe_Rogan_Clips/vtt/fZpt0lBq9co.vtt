00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.940
I have them push an ice pick through my arm every night, which is like,

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:08.040
you don't want to hit a break you'll, you know,

4
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.240
anything or an artery or anything. So, but I,

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:15.750
and I let them choose a spot, by the way. I also brought the ice pick.

6
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:19.350
If you do, do want us. Cause I, I know that, you know, it's real, but I should.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.713
I believe it's real.

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.920
<v 1>You want to see it?</v>

9
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.060
I have to admit I haven't done my tour really itching to do it.

10
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.280
Is that what's going on here? What.

11
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.330
<v 0>I'd like you to do it? Just to see that it is like pretty straightforward. Oh,</v>

12
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.500
I believe it's straightforward,

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.870
but I brought one with me and I got the alcohol from.

14
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.870
<v 1>The leave that girl at the port.</v>

15
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.090
And so you're stitching your mouth shut. Yeah. But so see that.

16
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.600
<v 0>So what I was able to do with the state show is I bring people up on stage and I</v>

17
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:51.530
have the cameras at the big screen. So you see people reacting to this stuff.

18
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:54.380
So it's the magic plus the reaction. So you get that whole,

19
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.240
and this girl's really into it. Look at her.

20
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.990
<v 1>So you do this all the time, the stitching, the mouth shut.</v>

21
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:05.450
I would imagine you would accumulate some scar tissue. Now the I.

22
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.790
<v 0>That one's easy, but this one's legit. This one,</v>

23
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.740
I used to do it through the hand. This is the ice iceberg.

24
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.750
This one I used to do through the hand.

25
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:13.790
And I developed so much scar tissue that like,

26
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:16.180
when I moved my fingers a certain way, I get a shooting pain.

27
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.950
So I stopped doing the hands and I switched to here. Hmm.

28
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.790
<v 1>That makes sense. I would, I would imagine that would really your hands.</v>

29
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.980
<v 2>Up. Uh it's from the.</v>

30
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.990
<v 3>COVID test. So wait, but.</v>

31
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.380
<v 0>So I might have to sit next to yours. Do.</v>

32
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.730
<v 1>You want me to do this? To use this what's going on here?</v>

33
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.720
I can come over to your side. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right.

34
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.380
<v 0>Wait don't you need the, or you can put those on I'll just come walk over.</v>

35
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.260
Should I take the thing off you can, if you like.

36
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.380
<v 3>We'll both be basically talking to the same.</v>

37
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.760
<v 0>Mind, but we can do it sitting. Yeah. But can you put those on time? Yeah, sure.</v>

38
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.940
<v 3>Mike work. Okay. Jane, we'll turn this mic on. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.620
And I'll crank this thing over to here.

40
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.460
So you choose what you want the left or the right? Uh,

41
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.840
let's do the right since it's right next to me. Okay. Okay. Do you want.

42
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.270
<v 0>Them to commit and see it as well? No.</v>

43
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.700
<v 3>Okay. Good enough. Okay. So now.</v>

44
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.570
<v 0>This is not a new ice pick and usually I do it with new ones,</v>

45
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:23.420
which means this isn't as sharp as it needs to be.

46
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:26.570
Something means push is going to be a little difficult, I guess.

47
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.930
<v 4>Why do you like to do this? Are these ones.</v>

48
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.540
<v 0>That you give us these pure alcohol? Yes. Yes.</v>

49
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.160
<v 1>I mean, they're just the standard ones that you get.</v>

50
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.770
<v 3>That's fine. I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

51
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.290
<v 1>Well, you want to make sure there's no scent in it or anything?</v>

52
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.900
<v 0>No. I want to make sure that there's no bacteria.</v>

53
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.270
<v 1>In it. I mean, on the alcohol. Oh yeah.</v>

54
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.310
<v 3>Exactly. Yeah. Um, why.</v>

55
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.460
<v 1>Do you enjoy this? You seem you're. Well, first.</v>

56
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.040
<v 0>Of all, it's amazing that you can actually do something like this.</v>

57
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:59.030
Like it's nothing. So there's a guy named mirror in dyo. Can you pull up mirror?

58
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.630
Dyo you think? So mirroring the dial.

59
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.510
It's this guy and nobody believed he was doing it for real.

60
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:09.370
And he would take rapiers and he would have them push through right through

61
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.910
the middle of his body, through his lungs and everything.

62
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:15.910
He would show on all sides and then they would pull them out and he'd be

63
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.990
perfectly fine. He and every, every doctor and saying, oh, you can't do that.

64
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.070
But so remember when Steve Irwin died, do you know why he died? No.

65
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.230
Cause he pulled this thing, right thing out of his heart,

66
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.350
this thing stopped him and he pulled it out. Right? Crocodile.

67
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.010
He kept it in there. He would have lived right after that.

68
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.940
A 70 year old man was on his boat and a sting rate jumped up out of the water,

69
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.300
stung him in the heart and then staying where he was gone.

70
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.400
<v 3>But though I didn't even. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.240
<v 0>Oh yeah. Look at that. Isn't that crazy.</v>

72
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.990
But the fact that you can actually do this is what's crazy.

73
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:54.520
Like the body can you, with your mind, you can override. And then the thing is,

74
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:58.090
he got so cocky though, that he thought he could do anything.

75
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.480
And then he ate one of these things. He swallowed it and it killed him,

76
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.690
but I didn't turn away. He died. But see, he got really cocky with,

77
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.160
because he was like, I can do anything.

78
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.320
<v 4>That is insane. So he's is he going through his liver?</v>

79
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.750
<v 0>He can go through anything. And that's what I'm saying.</v>

80
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:16.500
So the seven year old guy that got the sting rate to it,

81
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:21.120
stabbed him in the heart instead of pulling it out, which it's like a cork stru.

82
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.500
He waited until they,

83
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.950
with doctors till it beat out the other side and he was fine.

84
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.290
You see? Wow.

85
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.130
<v 1>So instead of pulling it out, he waited until what.</v>

86
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.740
<v 0>Time? And the doc, the doctors waited and with the heart,</v>

87
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.310
they let it beat out the other side and they slowly let it come out and went

88
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.860
through his whole body. They could, if they would have pulled it,

89
00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:44.160
it's like a corkscrew. It would rip him apart. He would die.

90
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.230
<v 4>How long did it take for it to beat through it? I.</v>

91
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.620
<v 0>Don't know, but I know that the doctors, what they did is they let it go through</v>

92
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.720
how many times this guy gets stabbed. Love them. That one, by the way,

93
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:01.560
right there, that's a safe place. That's like not an issue,

94
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:05.880
but when you go through the lungs and stuff, it's crazy. Look, it's great.

95
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.550
But this is too much on show. It's too like too.

96
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.360
<v 4>Much sword, man. But that's what I'm saying. That one.</v>

97
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.280
<v 0>Listen, he's shut up.</v>

98
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.330
But so what happened was he started to get too cocky.

99
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.220
He started to think he was fine.

100
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.590
<v 4>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

101
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.020
<v 0>But, okay. So, but listen to the origin of this trick though.</v>

102
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.750
That's not a trick. No, but I know, but listen.

103
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:33.180
So the origin of this is as a kid,

104
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.210
there's that trick where they do needle through arm, I guess. Right.

105
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:37.650
And it's like the rubber, some, you know,

106
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.260
the stuff and it sticks your skin together. That looks perfect.

107
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.790
It looks like it's really through your arm.

108
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.320
And then they like squeeze blood out of the thing they put. So I saw that.

109
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.190
And then I was like, but maybe that's like actually doable.

110
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.360
Like maybe that trick could really be done. So like the same exact trick,

111
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:58.940
but for real. Right. So that's okay. Okay.

112
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.040
So you take that. Okay. Like I said,

113
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:04.850
it's going to be a little tricky to push through just because the it's usually

114
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.740
sharp and this time it's not as short.

115
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.220
<v 3>But how do you know where to do it? You weren't going to pick,</v>

116
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.660
there's no hidden art.

117
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.890
<v 1>How do I know I'm not going to hit an artery that.</v>

118
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.770
<v 3>Can kill you, but I want to figure if you die. So.</v>

119
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.350
<v 4>You want me to just write here anywhere? Sure.</v>

120
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.610
What's where do you prefer wherever you want? Like right there. Wow, sure.

121
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.650
<v 0>I don't know, but I yeah. Do it there where you want.</v>

122
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.780
<v 4>Do it where you, well, when you say where I was sure,</v>

123
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.120
like where do you like it to go through it? Well.

124
00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.780
<v 0>The bottom, no, I liked where you were going. Like you're you're I mean, that's,</v>

125
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.740
that's fine, but you're to have to go like through, well,

126
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:40.360
what do you want me to do? Yeah. You're going to push.

127
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.330
<v 3>Through. Okay. She'll hold onto you here. Yeah.</v>

128
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.590
<v 0>Keep like a straight path. Okay. No, it goes</v>

129
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.510
straight through. Yeah. Okay. Ready? Slowly and go slow.

130
00:06:55.630 --> 00:07:00.160
Yeah. Good lift.

131
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.990
See that? Yep. See.

132
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.700
So it's hard to believe that it's real. We keep pushing.

133
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.560
<v 5>Keep going. Keep going. Wait.</v>

134
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.390
Oh, hold on. Whoa.

135
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.040
What happened? I hit a nerve. Oh geez. Another spot. No.

136
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.090
<v 4>No, no, no, no. Come on man. You gotta throw a spot.</v>

137
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.330
You were hitting them nerves, but what if I your arm up man?

138
00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:31.120
And then you can't hang from the balloon and then YouTube is mad at me.

139
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.313
Okay.

140
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.700
<v 0>Okay. So by the way, honest to God, I never go in this direction.</v>

141
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.020
Which way to go. I always go this direction inside the out.

142
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.200
I'm just saying of like the, of the, all the times I did it.

143
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:51.910
I've always gone this direct. Do you want.

144
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.480
<v 4>Me to go that direction? I'm just telling I've never seen. Is that better? No.</v>

145
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:57.520
So what's the difference? I'm just saying I've never done it.

146
00:07:57.521 --> 00:07:59.270
This is the groundbreaking.

147
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.180
<v 0>No I'm saying it's nuts. It's definitely nuts. A whole nurse again. Okay, good.</v>

148
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.360
No, but from the bottom, like this like that. Yeah.

149
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.920
And then I'd go again and I would,

150
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.400
I would try to go like a straight path through like right there. No,

151
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.500
I would go like lower and, and like.

152
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.270
<v 3>Just look there. I'd go. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It'd be like that. And keep,</v>

153
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.133
hold on.

154
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.090
<v 5>Wait, wait, push.</v>

155
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:32.050
<v 0>Yeah. Like that, like that. That's good. Yep.</v>

156
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.850
We're on a clean path. We hit something, but it's fine. Now it was this, this,

157
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.740
I use the skin here and I push so you can see it come through. Push that's it.

158
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.983
Alrighty.

159
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.710
Super unnecessary. But uh,

160
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.380
does seem like a magic trick. Definitely. Doesn't seem like a magic trick now,

161
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.490
but hold on. There's blood vessels and everything. There's no blood. Well.

162
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.900
<v 1>It's a very small hole in comparison to now it's a good sign.</v>

163
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:07.170
There is blood on the other hole. Okay. Yeah. That's cause.

164
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.880
<v 0>It's, it's the, you hit something.</v>

165
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.580
<v 3>And your body's healthy. So it's clotting up pretty quickly. Okay. All right.</v>

166
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.830
Should I put it out? Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Hold it slow.

167
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.320
<v 5>Cool. Cool.</v>

168
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.650
And that's it. Okay.

169
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.650
So here, this is for you to keep.

170
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:44.270
<v 6>[Inaudible].</v>
