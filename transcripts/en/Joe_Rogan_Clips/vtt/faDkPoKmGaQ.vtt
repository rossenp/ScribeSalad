00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I don't know if you know this, but, uh, like you said,</v>

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.680
there was a time when the only way you could have a voice or certainly comment

3
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:15.650
on boxing or MMA or sports is if you got hired by a major network that

4
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:19.470
had a reach where people could see you, somebody has to die to get that job,

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.190
right. Larry March has to retire. Exactly.

6
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.050
But I came up in an age and the, uh, at the very beginning of YouTube,

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.940
I was training at wild card boxing gym, and I'm a teenager training there.

8
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.140
The gym is a fairly, fairly new. And I had,

9
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.760
it was still like mini DV days.

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.290
And I had a camera that I would use to shoot sparring sessions.

11
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.360
And because Freddy has a gym where there are world championship fighters,

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.850
preparing for title fights on television,

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.860
the class of fighter that's in there on any given day sparring or like main

14
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.350
event ticket selling marquee guys.

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.760
And I'm in there shooting their sparring session. Any, you know, any name,

16
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:07.530
anybody verse anybody, and I'm using the money. I'm making,

17
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:11.970
selling the sparring footage back to the fighters to pay my gym dues.

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.400
Wow. That's how I started.

19
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.840
And it's like in journalism. Yeah. But, okay.

20
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.910
It's an interesting story because I was doing

21
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.990
broadcasting since 10th grade. I was like at a performing arts high school.

22
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.440
We had a radio station in the basement. It's like a coming of age,

23
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:35.010
like eighties movie or something. like, yeah, exactly.

24
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.880
Blow the dust off the equipment, like ask the faculty. Can I do a show?

25
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.350
And so I'm covering like headline news and whatever a 10th grader thinks is

26
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:45.990
important and who won the football game and you know, this kind of.

27
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.740
But I always thought that, you know, I'm going to be a talk radio guy,

28
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.500
never sports though. I've been trained in boxes in fifth grade,

29
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.990
but never did I like did I think the two shall meet except that I'm now I've,

30
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.590
I've moved to LA right after high school. I'm in Freddy roaches, boxing,

31
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:03.690
gym I'm training camp barely afford dues.

32
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:05.010
I got to come up with a way to do that.

33
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.150
I started shooting sparring sessions and this, this is like, uh,

34
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.010
James Tony is still fighting. We're on the, we're going to sunset of his career,

35
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.100
but he's still the man. And there's a guy named Danny green,

36
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.030
who is a Australian fighter, wildly famous there,

37
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.900
but doesn't have like global audience. He wants to fight James Snow,

38
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.750
real money in it for James. But if you know James, Tony,

39
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.080
this is no shrinking violet. This man is like insane.

40
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:35.970
He was like Wilder turnt up to like to this day

41
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:39.570
was every day that was James Tony at wild boxing gym. Right?

42
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.820
So this guy flies from Australia,

43
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.040
walks into the gym and you know what a sacred place those are like if the main

44
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.120
fighter at any gym,

45
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:52.410
the guy who like is the representation of the toughest dude in

46
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.240
yeah. The top dog. You don't just walk into that. Guy's gym started talking.

47
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.730
Especially with James, Tony, especially with James,

48
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:04.720
no one talked more than jam Tony. Right? They talk in the middle of a round.

49
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.090
Right? Exactly. All throughout rounds. This guy comes to the James.

50
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.570
Jim starts talking, James, I get in the ring right now.

51
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.530
The last two rounds I'll fight you anywhere. You can get the fight he takes,

52
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.850
takes. The challenge gets in there,

53
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.050
gets the beat out of him for like eight rounds. Ah, it's pummeled.

54
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.730
I'm shooting. The thing want to say right here. Oh, whoa.

55
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.300
First of all, I'm wildly impressed that you came up with Jamie's the girl.

56
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.270
I don't know where to find it. Look how good he looks too. James looks good.

57
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.440
I'm shooting this. Oh my goodness. And this is James in his prime.

58
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.890
He looked like he was a heavyweight look at the size of them. Yeah.

59
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.310
Was James heavyweight at this point, I cruise away his cruiserweight.

60
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.550
He was still cruiserweight. God is huge. Right?

61
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.760
He's on all the Mexican supplements. Look at the size of him. Oh man.

62
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:52.870
That's so funny.

63
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.490
I ha I haven't seen this footage and I don't even know how many years dude,

64
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.890
James is him up. Okay.

65
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.000
But the point being that at this time,

66
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.710
there really wasn't any

67
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.290
boxing press to speak of. I mean like this is great.

68
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.940
ESPN might give you a highlight of de LA Hoya. You might get a mic Tyson,

69
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:19.720
knockout clip, but there's nobody sitting around talking boxing.

70
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.550
There's no place to see fighters training. There's no websites for fights.

71
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.470
And uh, after this thing got done, I'm like, Hey, you know,

72
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.810
Danny green doesn't want it. He just got the beat out of him. James,

73
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.100
Tony doesn't care about it at all.

74
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.730
So I'm just going to go home and record over it.

75
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.700
Yeah, because this is my, this is my side hustle I need listen, man. I,

76
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.320
you know, I'm a very young man at this time. I need every VHS tape I can use. I,

77
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.970
you need every mini DV I can use to keep the money in my pocket.

78
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:54.700
I can't just be stockpiling footage. Nobody wants,

79
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.280
but before I get a chance to tape over it,

80
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.550
I get a call from a site called max boxing.

81
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.900
And at that time they were like pretty much the only Boston website. Huh?

82
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.740
What year is this? I want to say,

83
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:12.940
this is probably close to 2000. Wow. Um,

84
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.960
yeah, 2000. And they said, Hey,

85
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:18.940
we heard daddy green came down a wild card.

86
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:20.800
And they had like this brutal sparring session. Like,

87
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.700
you know how much bigger James? Yeah. He's so much bigger.

88
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.530
They don't even look like they're nearly in the same way class James looks like

89
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:32.680
he's 20 pounds heavier than him. Yeah. Well of course it is. But you know,

90
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.180
I mean, by way in day, he'll get down. But this is how,

91
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.750
this is how James like rock everyday. Like,

92
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.320
he'd be just banging guys talking, beaten him up talking.

93
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.060
And uh, so this, even though now looking back,

94
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:51.280
of course it's like amazing footage,

95
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:55.300
but at the time this could be any given Wednesday. Right. You know what I mean?

96
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.530
Yeah. That happened there all the time. You know? Um,

97
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.170
he used to spar with Mickey Rourke. Yeah.

98
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.550
And that's one of the reasons why make your worse,

99
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.950
how to get his face worked on apparently. Yeah.

100
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.370
Mickey work used to come in a wild card and he used to spar James,

101
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.030
which is like, someone needed to talk to him. You're like,

102
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:14.150
what are you thinking? Come here, come here. Look at me. Look at me, look at me.

103
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.850
Oh, there's Mac a Foley. Jeez man.

104
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.073
Um,

105
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.210
so what ultimately happened was I got a little bidding war going for this

106
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.160
video and it was such like a hot piece. And I, uh,

107
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.060
got it up to like Danny's in pretty good shape. And James getting tired.

108
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.670
Was there moments in this where James looked really tired?

109
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.420
The thing about James Tony at this time, he always looked really tidy.

110
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.600
Always seemed like he was being lazy. He's always leaning on fighters.

111
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.280
But what you can't hear is the thud of those

112
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.520
shots. Like he's just turning over him. Jamie,

113
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.543
Come on, paper champ.

114
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.830
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

115
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.130
<v 0>You hear Freddie in the background talking to him.</v>

116
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.450
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

117
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.090
<v 0>So they went eight rounds like this. Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.650
And then what happened at the end of it still he's Danny green still seems like

119
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:41.630
he's kind of in it. No, I mean,

120
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.290
he looks like James was him up. Yeah.

121
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.320
I mean like daddy had spots where he's connecting,

122
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.320
but at no point during and mind you, his face is getting bloodier.

123
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.270
Like the shots that James were throwing are consistently heavier

124
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.970
and James is just having an easy time with them.

125
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.990
It's not like anything that Danny's doing is making an impression,

126
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:09.020
how did they end it? I was just over like Danny had enough, like,

127
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.030
oh, you know what I mean? Yeah.

128
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.060
And this became Jim wars.

129
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:19.310
What I did with this footage ultimately was I took it and went to an editor

130
00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.100
named Brian Hardy, who was an editor for max boxing at the time.

131
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.660
And he got Doug Fisher. Who's now the editor in chief of ring magazine.

132
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:32.120
And I to commentate that footage as though you're watching it on

133
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:35.890
HBO. Oh, wow. Right. So, uh, D uh,

134
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:38.510
Doug's doing the color. I'm calling the fight. Like,

135
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:43.160
like I'm the Lampley and he's the Calor man. And we showed the whole thing.

136
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.580
I talked about the context of what had happened. Like I told you,

137
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:50.720
and we're calling the fight in this show. Jim wars blew up.

138
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.510
It was like the first big boxing,

139
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.250
like thing on the internet at all.

140
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.970
And so I would go to around the different gyms and get fighters,

141
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.300
and they all started at wildcard. And then I would branch out,

142
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:06.060
get fighters to agree. Let me shoot the sessions and turn it into,

143
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.690
have a show called gym wars. And so this foot,

144
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:13.770
like the way these guys now get their phones and their cameras,

145
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.800
and they go interview fighters and all the. I started that,

146
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.890
that wasn't a thing before I started doing it.

147
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.710
I'm the one who created this,

148
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.910
like medium by which you now receive boxing news.

149
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.270
Wow. So, um,

150
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.700
my entire career and trajectory in life was changed

151
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.060
at a boxing gym and never to look back.

152
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:43.200
And when you a fighter at one point in time, never, never all buttons to train,

153
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.510
always train. Since since fifth grade always traded.

154
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.840
It's taking it incredibly seriously. I've heard you talk about this too,

155
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.610
and it's, it couldn't be more true. This was a way for me to release,

156
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.380
like all of those young man, [inaudible] all that frustration.

157
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.720
It's really my therapy. I could barely afford gym dues. You know,

158
00:10:00.721 --> 00:10:02.370
I can't afford therapy. Right.

159
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.990
Boxing was that it was like an integral part of my life.

160
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:10.380
I spent hours in the gym to where I had to figure out a way to make some money

161
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.990
there so I could continue to eat and pay for it.

162
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.870
And that was my way of doing it. Um,

163
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.860
and so B interviewing fighters is now like my claim to fame,

164
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.080
because everybody's thinks they're reinventing the wheel.

165
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:24.390
Now you can't shoot anybody sparring or anything like that.

166
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.740
So that show had to go away.

167
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.900
But the way that I relate to and understand fighters and what

168
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.750
it is like that's inside them, that's that they're experiencing,

169
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:37.590
that's driving them, I think is unique because although I would never,

170
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:41.820
ever classify myself as a fighter, that's such a, uh,

171
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.320
a unique and, and cherish like battery that you can really hold. It.

172
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:50.790
That's really what you do. I'm a warrior too. You know what I mean? Like I've,

173
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.820
I, I, in my own way, I forged a career.

174
00:10:53.821 --> 00:10:58.020
I created something that didn't exist and I had to fight every step along the

175
00:10:58.021 --> 00:10:59.430
way to make it a thing.
