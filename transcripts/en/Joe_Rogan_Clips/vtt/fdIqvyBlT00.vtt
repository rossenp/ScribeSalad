00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.640
<v 1>He's an animal, but, but those, those people and they,</v>

3
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.160
it expresses itself differently.

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.520
And all these different exceptional people like Jocko is different than Tim.

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.560
Yeah. Tim Kennedy, Tim Kennedy is different than Andy.

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.840
They they're all different, but also all incredibly exceptional,

7
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.280
but there's something that they give off.

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.590
<v 0>I like that though. When you talked about the exception among the.</v>

9
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.270
<v 1>Exceptional. Yeah. That's what, um, I think, um,</v>

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.750
he called it David Goggins called it uncommon amongst uncommon people.

11
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.430
That's.

12
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.670
<v 0>True. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, that is very, very true.</v>

13
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.630
<v 1>That's the Kobe Bryant, the killing people right there.</v>

14
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.740
They just, I mean, I read this thing about Kobe Bryant the other day.

15
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:49.140
I was just reading, uh, I don't know anything about basketball. Okay.

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.300
And I always refer to Jamie about.

17
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.500
<v 0>Anything sports. How, how half times is there in basketball? I have zero.</v>

18
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.460
<v 1>Idea. I don't know how long it takes. Could take.</v>

19
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.380
<v 0>A day. How many quarters? I have no.</v>

20
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.420
<v 1>Idea. I would imagine if you say quarters, I'd say this four of 'em.</v>

21
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.730
If you say how many periods, I don't know how many half times,

22
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530
but I was reading all the stuff about, uh,

23
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.930
his high school coach saying that they would,

24
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.530
they would get there and he would be shooting baskets in the dark,

25
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.090
cuz they hadn't even turned the lights on yet. He'd be there an hour,

26
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.730
two hours before everybody that he would show up at these practices,

27
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.530
everybody would be at breakfast.

28
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.040
He would show up with ice on his knees and he was fully sweated out.

29
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.440
Like he'd just done three hours of working out before anybody did anything.

30
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.560
There's there's people like that, man. And you can hate on them.

31
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.520
You can hate on them. You can decide that that's not worth it, but you gotta,

32
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.240
the best thing you can do is acknowledge.

33
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.110
They're doing something that makes you feel funny. Yep.

34
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.510
And that makes you feel funny is your sense of understanding who you are.

35
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.630
It's testing, it's testing how you feel about yourself.

36
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.550
It's testing how you feel about your place in the universe. It's testing it.

37
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.590
You don't wanna know that there's some crazy Kobe Bryant getting up at four in

38
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:02.950
the morning, you know, doing deadlifts like, I wanna sleep.

39
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.540
But I also wanna be number one, bro. Yep.

40
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.460
Former Lakers player and head coach.

41
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.740
Byron Scott said he once found an 18 year old Bryant shooting in a dark gym,

42
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.020
two hours before practice. I.

43
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.060
<v 0>Used to do that, but it was throwing footballs, throwing footballs into a,</v>

44
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.380
it was actually into the laundry bass.

45
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.610
<v 1>Skits. It's not uncommon, man. It's not uncommon if you, if you really want the.</v>

46
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.970
<v 0>Same with archery. I mean, you know, my sleeping hours are super,</v>

47
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.970
super irregular.

48
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.410
There's times where I feel like practicing or a lot of times you'll probably get

49
00:02:38.411 --> 00:02:40.210
up in the morning and I've already built your bow.

50
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.000
And I built it four or five in the morning because is to people

51
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.880
that are the exceptional among their field, they can't sleep.

52
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.720
If they know that they have to do something, what is, what are we looking at?

53
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.680
Cause as you guys are talking about this, he just Tores Achilles.

54
00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:59.480
This is probably one of those last things he did. He.

55
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.240
<v 2>Tores Achilles. But in order, this is like a rule in the game.</v>

56
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:06.120
He had to shoot his free throws. It it's a weird stipulation.

57
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.440
So he's walking back out with no Achilles and he did does this. It was pretty,

58
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:11.274
pretty impressive.

59
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.000
<v 1>Wow. He could barely walk, man. Holy. No.</v>

60
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.920
<v 2>Crying or nothing, but.</v>

61
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.470
<v 1>He's real. It up. That's how you have to be. If you wanna be a winner,</v>

62
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.710
there's just no way around it. Yep. Swish ho. That's why I get the money.

63
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.430
Ho look at my mansion. &lt;laugh&gt;.

64
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.910
<v 0>At that point, it's just subconscious taken over.</v>

65
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.230
<v 1>Anybody that doesn't think that someone like Kobe Bryant doesn't deserve mansion</v>

66
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.100
and all the money has just not, does not understand what he just did.

67
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.980
Two swishes in a row with no Achilles. Yeah. Just shut the up.

68
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.740
I don't know about basketball. I know that was amazing. I've been.

69
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.740
<v 0>Pretty &lt;laugh&gt; I've actually been pretty stuck on this subject in the last</v>

70
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.740
few weeks. Um, I hardly ever,

71
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.810
ever, ever look at negativity. I mean,

72
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.490
I really don't read it. Don't look at it. But um,

73
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.930
there was a really big archery tournament, uh, about a month ago.

74
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.810
And there was some other pros that had made some comments about me just saying,

75
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.823
you know,

76
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.520
how is John Dudley on a GRE podcast asked he's not even competing.

77
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.120
He's not even doing anything. And you know,

78
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:28.880
people wanted to know how I felt about that. And I said,

79
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.080
the reality is there's several archers out there that have 10 times

80
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.480
the talent of me. No question. I'm not saying that I have that.

81
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.750
But what really is about that situation is when someone has 10 times

82
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.470
more talent than me and they do a 10th as much

83
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.790
to me, that's a big problem.

84
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.190
<v 1>So you think there's a lot of people out there that are not realizing their full</v>

85
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:57.750
potential. So because of that,

86
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.990
they're critical of other people because maybe even they're looking at their own

87
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.380
himself and they, they feel like they're not, I don't knowing their time.

88
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.380
<v 0>I think, I think they're looking at the problem is cause.</v>

89
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.780
<v 1>The people do do that, right? Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:10.783
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

91
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.420
You limit yourself when you are not looking at

92
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:20.300
what you're doing when you're so occupied on what someone else is doing,

93
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.370
you limit what your true talent is. So is that my problem?

94
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.650
Is it my problem that you have 10 times the talent of me,

95
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.330
but I'm doing 10 times more with it. Is that, is.

96
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.850
<v 1>That my problem? Those are big numbers.</v>

97
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.090
<v 0>Okay. Let's say two times. Okay. Okay. Let's say,</v>

98
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.770
let's say you have twice a talent and you're natural.

99
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.800
<v 1>You have more, but you're doing less. Yeah. I know.</v>

100
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.680
<v 0>What you're saying. I just feel like there's.</v>

101
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.560
<v 1>A lot of people doing that, right?</v>

102
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.880
<v 0>Yeah. There's I think the, I actually think the majority,</v>

103
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.680
I think the people that are standouts are people that don't

104
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.200
have the natural true talent.

105
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.200
I think John Jones is a perfect example.

106
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.040
If he was able to literally a hundred percent maximize

107
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.680
his talent, how good could he be?

108
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.680
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the problem is he's the one that has 10 times the talent,

109
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.950
but he's screwing it up.

110
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.790
And there's guys that have half the talent that are bigger stars because

111
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.830
they're actually doing it the right way. And they're maximizing,

112
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.664
they're almost,

113
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.830
they're almost doubling their potential because they're working at it

114
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.340
in the right fashion versus someone that has the true talent.

115
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.820
Isn't really maximizing their talent.

116
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.980
<v 1>Mm I know what you're saying. Yeah. But I think here's a good sign.</v>

117
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.060
Here's a really good sign. This is an easy way to decipher it.

118
00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.180
When you see someone complaining about someone else's success,

119
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.413
anytime you see that,

120
00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.530
anytime you see someone complaining about someone else's success and possibly

121
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.410
equating it to like some injustice in the world,

122
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:07.490
cuz they don't have equal success. The person's making a mistake.

123
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.770
They're making a mistake in even the way they're thinking,

124
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.210
if you criticize something cuz you just think it's bad.

125
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.170
Well that's certainly your prerogative. Yeah. Right? I mean, if you just,

126
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.690
if it's, especially if it's an art form or if it's, uh, something,

127
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.440
some one created that's one thing.

128
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.240
But if you're upset that someone's success, that doesn't make any sense.

129
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; of course. Well they wanted to be successful.

130
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:31.440
They did the thing that it took to be successful. They became successful.

131
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.160
And what's your point? You don't have a point. Your point is going on me.

132
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.590
It's the little, little kid's version of what about me? What about me? Well, I,

133
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:44.230
it's not fair. It's not fair that some people are born billionaires.

134
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.213
It's not fair.

135
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.910
It's not fair that some people are born with birth defects where they don't have

136
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:52.430
feet. It's not fair that some people, they, their, their brain doesn't work.

137
00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.310
It's this well as yours, there's a lot of. That's not fair. Yep.

138
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.630
Look at what you got. Look at what you got. You're doing well.

139
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.940
And you're worried about someone else's doing better. Why not just look at them?

140
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.980
Why not just look at 'em and go, what is that guy doing? Different?

141
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:09.220
What is she doing different than me? How come she's so much more successful?

142
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.980
How did he figure out how to do that? And look at it that way. Don't look at it.

143
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:16.900
Like you're angry at those people. That is wasted. It doesn't do you any good?

144
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.050
It does zero. Good for anybody involved? Not you, not the person. You're person.

145
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:24.210
You're trying to figure out why. Well is this good? Good.

146
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.850
That is just bad for you. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's bad for everybody.

147
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.210
It's bad for the person thinking negatively. It's bad for everybody around them.

148
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.890
The best way to do is like, huh? Like even if you're not even hateful about it,

149
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:40.320
like, like here's a good example. Like if a movie is giant in the box off,

150
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.920
he's like, wow. I thought it sucked. Didn't like it or whatever.

151
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:50.280
But if you freak out, Ho's up movie Jumanji, are you? Me bro.

152
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.720
Jumanji. A piece of. You know, people get crazy. They get crazy.

153
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.160
That guy made 800 million for Jumanji.

154
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.720
Can't it's not good for you, man. Gotta let that go. Yep.

155
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.960
