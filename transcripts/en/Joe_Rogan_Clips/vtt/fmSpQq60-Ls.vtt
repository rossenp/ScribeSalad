00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. On that diamond princess cruise ship.</v>

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.840
Only 17% of people got it.

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.600
And those people are living together very close quarters, like a Petri dish.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.840
Yep. And they're, um, they're all breathing. Recrulated air. Yeah.

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:14.400
But only 17% of people. Got it crazy.

6
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.680
So it's that possible because I don't think it's as transmissible as we think,

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.990
bro. Imagine I don't think it is stuck on one of those cruise ships dude.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.390
People coughing in the, yeah. It's horrible. It's horrible. Without a pandemic.

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.350
Yeah. But I don't think, but be, imagine right now. Yeah. Cause I'm high.

10
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:32.510
So let me think. Yeah. If I'm in a boat right now, right. So I'm,

11
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.550
I'm in this metal thing, which is in the middle of the dark ocean.

12
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.750
Yeah. Especially at nighttime. Yeah. Right. Horrible.

13
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:42.580
You're in this thing floating around,

14
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.420
literally in the center of the ocean thats.

15
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.180
So some strange reason you've agreed. Yeah. To be on this &lt;laugh&gt; this metal.

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.060
Yes. Thing's a floating floats. Yeah. Yeah. Which doesn't make any sense.

17
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.540
It's gross. Gross metal floating makes gross zero sense. Yeah.

18
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.770
A giant metal thing floating and you there with all those people and you're the

19
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.010
worst people in the world. And if you fall off the side, you're dead.

20
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.130
Some people try to kill themselves. You know, what's really, this is true.

21
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.570
Some guy tried to kill himself on the boat. Woo. This is how sad this was.

22
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.490
They saw him and they caught him. They caught him and they,

23
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.130
they brought him back on the boat. Oh my God.

24
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:17.930
So like literally the buffet the next day. Everybody's like,

25
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:21.690
that's the guy that tried to kill him. Like how horrible is that?

26
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.160
You're back. You're back. Oh, you got,

27
00:01:26.161 --> 00:01:30.160
imagine being in a breakfast buffet after the LA you know, sorry guys.

28
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.520
I was having a rough night. One guy killed his wife on a cruise.

29
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:34.000
Cuz I went on the impractical jokers cruise.

30
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.800
I went on one cruise and it was just a perform. Right.

31
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.600
Me and a bunch of other comics went. And uh, and I,

32
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.480
we were talking to some of the cruise people and they said,

33
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:44.470
one guy pushed his wife off the side. Ooh. Yeah. And then he just,

34
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.790
he didn't care. He went to like eighties night. He was dancing. Oh my,

35
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.350
he just pushed his wife right off the side. Jesus Christ, dude.

36
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:53.830
Cruise people are sick. They're sick. People. Some people are sick.

37
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:57.390
Like some people could do that. Now here's the thing we're thinking about it.

38
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.910
Like it's the ocean. I want you to think about it. Like it's space. Okay.

39
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.380
Imagine if, if there was this ship that was going through space,

40
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.820
but space was just like,

41
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.980
it was almost like there was air around you where you could kick someone off the

42
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:12.780
side and they would just fall too forever. Right, right.

43
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.180
That's you're doing the same thing. Yeah. You just you're allow,

44
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.740
would you be terrified? Oh my God. Yeah. And if you heard someone cough,

45
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.210
would you heard someone cough? Oh my God. What would you do? Would you do?

46
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.130
If you were on a spaceship and you heard someone coughing and it would,

47
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.970
you gotta stay, you gotta take two weeks before you get back to the plan.

48
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.770
Like I think you gotta stay inifferent your little in your little cube.

49
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.090
Like you gotta stay in your little room.

50
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.810
Everyone on the grand princess was sequestered in their room. Honestly.

51
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.170
How is that different? You being on the spaceship in the middle of the sky.

52
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.320
Yeah. And you hear someone clocking. It's not that different.

53
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:49.000
Like we gotta get outta here. There's a sick person on his spaceship.

54
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.200
It's not that different. How much different is it? It's not that different. I,

55
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.880
I would say this, I would say less pig.

56
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.160
Trash people could afford to go to space for now,

57
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.920
for now back in the Titanic days,

58
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.280
it was a crazy thing to be able to get in a boat and,

59
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.000
and make your way across the country. Yeah. It's, it's true. You're a peasant.

60
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.400
That's that's choose to travel space cruises, which is disgusting.

61
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.400
Ugh. But, but the people, my point is,

62
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.790
it's not like the Uber wealthy people that are getting on these shows.

63
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.830
No it's animals. It's Savage animals. They're they're fat pick.

64
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.550
I could have been a personal trainer on the boat. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,

65
00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:28.830
people were looking at me. They're like, how do you do it? You know? No, it's a,

66
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.150
on a party. They're going have a good time. They're task. You know,

67
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.190
what's the funnies thing on that boat.

68
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.990
There was a little library and I walked in. I'm like,

69
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:36.910
has anyone checked out a book? And the guy goes, no, &lt;laugh&gt; I'm like,

70
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.660
has anyone ever checked out? Like who's trying out a book,

71
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.020
the library and the cruise ship. And it's not even good books.

72
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:45.540
It's trashy romance novels. But none of these people can read. I mean,

73
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.060
what is the drug policy on one of those cruise ships?

74
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.620
Can you bring weed on board? I think you can bring whatever you want. I mean,

75
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.020
it depends, right? It depends. If you dock at a co like,

76
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.900
but in international waters, what are the deals? I don't know.

77
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:58.020
They don't search. I don't know if they search your bags. I mean,

78
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:01.530
people were bringing food on board. That was disturbing. That's another thing,

79
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:04.610
right? Like you're not in America. No. You're in international waters.

80
00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:08.330
And then you dock like outside of this fake little town in Mexico where they

81
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:12.970
literally bought the beach front and it's a third world country and they drive

82
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:16.530
you past roosters and shoeless guys running around teamie what are you showing

83
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.930
me? This is a dougstan boo suit when he was getting, oh, that that's right.

84
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.160
He got on the cruise and he dude, he came on. I think he went on the,

85
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:26.120
he Chas boo to his body. Right. All over it. Like drugs. Yeah.

86
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.240
So what has he got it bladders of? Like ginin bladders,

87
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.120
&lt;laugh&gt; bladders and bottles. This is a good boo.

88
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.040
So he bought like those hiking bladders that you put in your backpack where he

89
00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:39.320
drank water out of. And he filled them with booze,

90
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.310
but he's on a cruise ship where they have all this booze. Yeah.

91
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:46.550
But he wants to real deal stuff. You know? They're gonna water it down. They do.

92
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.390
Yeah. They don't give you shots. Uh,

93
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.710
I think they do some that's even more outrageous.

94
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.470
I think he gotta let you booze it up. Yeah. Dude,

95
00:04:54.471 --> 00:04:56.070
if I'm on a boat I'm getting drunk. Well,

96
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.870
I'm sure there's different kinds of cruises, but the ones we're talking about,

97
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:01.820
like carnival, I know like, you know, like the ones,

98
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:04.300
if you were on those wouldn't you want to be hammered. Well there's people.

99
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.980
That's why dude. That's why people like, oh, why are people leaving your houses?

100
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:09.820
There are people that are like, if I can't go on a cruise and get up,

101
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.180
I don't wanna live. Why? If there are those people right now, they're like,

102
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:15.460
if I can't go to Applebe I don't wanna live. Yeah.

103
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:17.220
There's people that are not having a great time in America.

104
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.580
How many people are like weekend cruise people.

105
00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:21.420
Like every weekend they go on a cruise somewhere. I was on.

106
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.370
I tell you I did the practical joke. It was an old lady. And she goes, you know,

107
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.810
don't take carnival. It's very bad. We've taken it twice. It was horrible times.

108
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.210
Oh, they justs good. Yeah. They just, they just they're cruise people.

109
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.810
I mean just the lowest caliber of human being to have ever drawn a

110
00:05:36.811 --> 00:05:41.650
breath&lt;laugh&gt;. How much is, how much is the cruise cost?

111
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.600
Like if you want $60. I mean &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;

112
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.720
dude. It's like no money. It's the, it's the, okay.

113
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.080
Let's let's say if you're' going for people that just got outta prison,

114
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.520
let's say, if you're gonna leave Mexico and you, where would you go?

115
00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:00.080
Where would you go? Like south America, somewhere. You don't leave Mexico. You,

116
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.630
you leave,

117
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:04.120
like you just go out into the ocean and then you just come back to some fake

118
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.480
town. Like we went to Costa may look up cost of Maya, Mexico cost of Maya.

119
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:12.520
Mexico is a place. Its own the cruise ships just own this little beachfront.

120
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.320
Okay. So it's like a trip. Like you float around the water.

121
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:19.430
Then you come back and you come back and then they just have these little stands

122
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.790
on the beach. &lt;laugh&gt; wait a minute. This is crazy to do. Yeah.

123
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:26.150
Cruiseies to Mexico from $109 a person. Yeah. What did you think it was? How,

124
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.990
how many days? Like seven days. No. Yeah it did. Is that real? Of course.

125
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.950
Oh my God. Look at the big warning though. The COVID warning. Blow that up.

126
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.510
Yeah. What it say? They're like, you'll die if you do this,

127
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:40.980
people Don' care plenty. Oh, please be aware of any, uh,

128
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.580
coronavirus COVID 19 travel,

129
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.060
advisories and view updates from the world health organization due to

130
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.020
unprecedented volume of travel disruptions.

131
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.980
Refunds may take up to 30 days to process, which by that point you'll be dead.

132
00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:59.530
They'll be like 30 days. How to take cruises right now. Yeah.

133
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:02.210
They're just like lie about your symptoms to like, just look, look,

134
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.730
this is the next one they have available.

135
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.250
It seems like August 30th is the first one they have available. Yeah.

136
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.090
So they're banking on August 30th.

137
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.210
Did that boats already full people are going on that boat, bro. Dude,

138
00:07:13.211 --> 00:07:16.250
August 30th is gonna be a party &lt;laugh&gt; they don't give a.

139
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.400
They're gonna get on in high hospital gowns, right from the ER, they don't care.

140
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.161
You know what they're gonna do?

141
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:23.400
They're gonna do all the people that have survived. Yes.

142
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.480
Coronaonavirus it's gonna be survivor partysurvivor we beat it.

143
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.080
They also would have the bodies of course party.

144
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:32.200
They're all gonna have the bracelets. They'll be in hospital gowns on the beach.

145
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.760
But you know, there's gonna be one dude who lies about it.

146
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.120
Everybody's gonna come back because there's a girl. They gonna be thick.

147
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.110
She' hot. Yeah. He wants to her. So he told her, yeah, God,

148
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.030
and' worry and she's not hot, but she's a girl. She's hot enough. He's fine.

149
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.990
She's hot enough for him to cause genocide. Yes. So he's gonna come back.

150
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:50.830
&lt;laugh&gt; with this virus, he's gonna kill us all. He's gonna destroy,

151
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.350
kill us all because he wanted to this chick. And's gonna lie about having it.

152
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.310
And she's got a new advanced form that it doesn't do anything to people that

153
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.140
have already had it. Right. But as soon as it gets into a new person,

154
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:01.880
it kills them.

155
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.060
It makes so much sense that the virus it'll get rid of us as a planet,

156
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.140
come from a cruise. The most disgusting, unnecessary.

157
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.500
I mean, dude, this has nothing to do with the water.

158
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.300
I thought it'd be like tropical. Have something to do with the water.

159
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:16.140
It's nothing to do with the water. You don't nobody swims.

160
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:19.260
Like nobody gets to the island and swims kind of a dump people just go on and

161
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.690
buy jewelry. They buy fake jewelry. Dude. There's a TV in your room,

162
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:27.610
on a cruise. And when you turn it on, it's just commercials for. You can buy.

163
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:30.250
When you dock at the island. Oh my God. It'll be a guy. Who's like,

164
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:32.970
I've been in the cruise and jewelry industry for 20 years. It's like,

165
00:08:32.971 --> 00:08:36.210
that's not an industry, dude. The cruise is a hundred dollars. Yeah.

166
00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:39.810
It's a hundred dollars. And they buy garbage jewels. Cause it's tax free.

167
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.440
Cruise is Jamie. That was the three to five day section.

168
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.440
That was three to five days, hundred bucks, five days for a hundred bucks.

169
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.360
You can't even live. All. You can eat. 400 bucks are five days just for food.

170
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.600
All you can eat all you can eat. Yes. And probably all you can drink.

171
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:55.160
Everything's except for alcohol.

172
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.240
You gotta pay the craziest thing we've ever read on this show.

173
00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:01.600
That's why people are like all cruises going outta of business. I'm like,

174
00:09:01.601 --> 00:09:04.280
I'll tell you. They're not, they're not dollars.

175
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.960
That's a vacation for somebody who's. So, but wait a minute.

176
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.640
It's not all booze included. No, you gotta pay for boo.

177
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:14.040
That's where they make their money. That's why they's sneak.

178
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.230
Why they sneak it on? Oh, that's how they make their money. Yeah.

179
00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:21.550
So the 25 bucks a day is just to come on. We're friends.

180
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.390
Yeah. Four days. That's just 25 bucks a day. A hundred bucks.

181
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.670
That's just unlimited fried food to throwing you down your throat.

182
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.830
Three to five days for a hundred dollars, 109.

183
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.260
Imagine five days of food for $109.

184
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.900
They probably encourage you to get off the wagon.

185
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.460
Like what are you doing when you're drinking water? Yeah.

186
00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:42.140
Well I'm cleaning sober for 15 years now. They don't tolerate that.

187
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:44.900
What the are you? Doing's a party. They man're. It's a carnival.

188
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.660
Haven't you heard? Yeah. You don't need to see your kids get up.

189
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.660
Just get up and we'll give you I a game dude. You know the, in a cruise boat,

190
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:55.180
there's a little cruise jail. Swear to God. They have a cruise jail.

191
00:09:55.181 --> 00:09:57.090
They have cruise jail. If you do something,

192
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.850
sometimes you gotta go to the cruise jail until they can dock and have the

193
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.650
authorities come get you. So if you murder your wife,

194
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.410
you do something like that. You go to the cruise. Jailhrew his wife overboard.

195
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.370
He's throwing the cruise jail. He went to cruise jail.

196
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.770
Look at those water line. Look at these people. Hi. See this is in the eighties.

197
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.080
I guess what it made sense. When did they start these things? Dude?

198
00:10:17.081 --> 00:10:20.920
There's comics that perform on them. Oh yeah. Yeah. They live in hell. Yeah.

199
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.080
&lt;laugh&gt; there's um, when

200
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.480
there's something about it, it's just, it's so strange. And when I was in Italy,

201
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.760
yeah, three day cruises for 325 bucks. That was what it first started. Yeah. 85.

202
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.870
That was 1985. That's when it was. Yeah. It's probably like air travel.

203
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:39.350
It was when, when I was in Venice, they were,

204
00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:42.230
they were the people that there are locals there. First of all, I mean,

205
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.470
I'm an intruder. We're all intruders. There's too many, too many TRUS. Right.

206
00:10:45.471 --> 00:10:48.710
It's like, but they relied on it too. So it's real strange.

207
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.070
They gotster economy, but it's also, it used to be more quaint.

208
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.390
And then what happened is whenever a cruise ship would pull up,

209
00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.300
you would get what? Two, 3000 people yeah. Would come pouring out at once.

210
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.300
And so when we were there, two cruise ships docked, and it was crazy. Oh crazy.

211
00:11:05.301 --> 00:11:06.980
Then fantasy is this beautiful city.

212
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.300
And then you have this grotesque cruise ship with like paintings of dolphins on

213
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:15.460
the side. &lt;laugh&gt; it's so white trash, like America just,

214
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.570
and then showing up,

215
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.490
fill these river boats and they would get into the canal area. Oh.

216
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.650
And they would filled with people. Yeah.

217
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.770
And they would drive around staring and pointing at things. People'd like, wow,

218
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.730
this is nuts. Well, now that they're not around, you have like,

219
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:31.650
things are coming back into the Venice canals, like dolphins. I know, you know,

220
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:34.250
but I know all these idiots are like, oh, it's not nice. It's like, it's nice.

221
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.290
But the world economys collapsed. See, it's not a good trade off.

222
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.360
There's the people got addicted to people coming in the tourists. Yeah.

223
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:45.360
But if they only had like a limited number, it should be like a house party.

224
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.800
Like after a hundred people, you can't get cut it off. Yeah.

225
00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:50.480
You could cut it off. You can't have cruise ships. Yeah. Cause they,

226
00:11:50.481 --> 00:11:53.360
they kept hitting the docks too. No, but the docks like twice. Yeah,

227
00:11:53.361 --> 00:11:54.194
but you're gonna need.

228
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.680
<v 1>'Em they're coming back hard. &lt;laugh&gt; cruises are coming back so big.</v>

229
00:11:57.681 --> 00:12:01.880
After this I'm telling you, you think so people are gonna feel invous catchers,

230
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.560
sick country and people are all over the world.

231
00:12:04.561 --> 00:12:07.400
People are wild and people are gonna wanna go.

232
00:12:07.401 --> 00:12:10.320
There are people that love cruises. They think they've discovered a gold mine.

233
00:12:10.321 --> 00:12:14.350
They'll be like 109. People will tell you I took a, a cruise for $160.

234
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:18.310
It's so embarrassing that they would say it. But they say that. And you're like,

235
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.110
you're an animal. Well, if you're a non-drier though, it must be here's.

236
00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:22.791
It's so fun.

237
00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:25.830
There's a certain group of people in the world who've accepted their animals.

238
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.510
Right. And then it's just fun.

239
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.630
How many people are on cruises that are on a cruise every day?

240
00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.860
Cuz it's cheaper than being homeless. If you great point.

241
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.860
If you go to a cruise every day, if you're on a cruise every day,

242
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.980
you you're really only spending like a buck 50 a week. That's carnival,

243
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.900
you spend 150 bucks a week. You get a room and you get all the food you can eat.

244
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.780
That is a crazy deal. You imagine it's secure for homelessness.

245
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.180
Carnival cruises there. Yeah.

246
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.140
Do they have boost 24 hours a day or do they all cut off time? No.

247
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.210
It's like Vegas. Yeah, of course. Do what you want.

248
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.850
Imagine that the freedom of being on this boat,

249
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.010
this metal thing floating around the ocean. Yeah. That's where you live.

250
00:13:02.011 --> 00:13:03.690
Where do you live? I live on the carnival world cruise line.

251
00:13:03.691 --> 00:13:04.770
There are people that do that, Joe,

252
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:07.010
that literally live on a boat all year round. Why not?

253
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.690
You should be on a cruise. Well, why not? Cuz you're a person. &lt;laugh&gt;,

254
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:14.240
that's the why not it's cuz you're a person. But if you on,

255
00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.560
there are people that dude, the level of big on those boats,

256
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:21.760
those are big boys and girls like Disneyland four, 500 S yeah.

257
00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:22.920
When you see people on scooters,

258
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.680
I saw a scooter and they were going on the boat on the boat.

259
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:27.280
They were going up the ramp onto the boat.

260
00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:30.240
There's some up about being on a vehicle. Then somebody on another vehicle.

261
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:40.710
I.
