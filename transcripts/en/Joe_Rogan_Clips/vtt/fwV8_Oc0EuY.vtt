00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Have you tried the new ones?</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:08.010
Like Moxie and TX six or something? What new weed? No.

3
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:09.570
There's new types of like psychedelics.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.130
<v 1>I don't need that. The stuff that's real is good enough, please.</v>

5
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.230
People want to try something other than mushrooms?

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:18.960
Like what are you looking for? Assets? Not strong enough.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.020
<v 0>For you? I don't think there's one that you could turn off. Oh.</v>

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.670
<v 1>You turn it off. Yeah. Like with a switch?</v>

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.620
<v 0>No, like, you know, a couple you're drunk.</v>

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.870
You can kind of make yourself sober if you need to.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.380
So this is a psychedelic that you can switch off. Oh, what's it called?

12
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.460
Moxie hold Oxy. It's five MEO. Yeah. Am.

13
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.410
<v 1>I PC? What is it called?</v>

14
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.480
<v 0>And then two CBS. The other one. I've heard it two CB from the Kanye song.</v>

15
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.613
That was that from the Kanye.

16
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.320
<v 1>And a log of the more popular drug, five MEO,</v>

17
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.980
D I P T Foxy Mox. Foxy.

18
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.710
<v 0>Ms. Roxy. It's got an old timey name. I've never.</v>

19
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.680
<v 1>Had interesting Foxy methoxy is a great name. Hmm.</v>

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.580
<v 0>So it's like, I guess hipster mushrooms. You probably haven't heard of it.</v>

21
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.720
<v 1>They're always coming up with new things to avoid certain drug tests where they</v>

22
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.960
just alter a chemical slightly. And it doesn't.

23
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.060
That's where five MEO DMT was not qual classified.

24
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.670
As one of the bands psychedelics in the 1970s,

25
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.180
sweeping psychedelic act and N dimethyltryptamine was,

26
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.680
was labeled five. MEO is DMT with an oxygen molecule attached to it,

27
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:25.110
which eliminates some, I don't know exactly how it works,

28
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:27.390
but the visuals are very different. It looks very different.

29
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.330
It feels very different. It's way more potent. And it was legal forever.

30
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.600
Like you could order it in the year, two thousands.

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.770
We would get it from a chemical company where you ordered over the internet and

32
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:40.170
they would send you like an aspirin bottle of the.

33
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.000
And you could literally put the entire city on the moon with that astronaut,

34
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.870
that little aspirin bottle. That's amazing. It was so potent.

35
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.910
And it's this white pure powder that is like straight from this lab,

36
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.530
pharmaceutical grade, pharmaceutical grade, not for human consumption,

37
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.240
five methoxy dimethyltryptamine. And we, we took it.

38
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.610
It just puts you in the center of the universe.

39
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:10.470
You feel like you're a part of every cell and every atom and every neutron,

40
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.210
every everything you're, you're part of everything.

41
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.000
You're in the soup of it all. There's no detachment between you and things.

42
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.480
Everything just wall, you disappear for like 15 minutes.

43
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.750
You're sure you're dead. You're absolutely 100% sure you're dead.

44
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.750
And it probably is what happens when you die and then you come out of it.

45
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:25.770
You're like, what in the?

46
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.360
Like I just got that from a company that has order that with a visa card that

47
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:34.140
gets crazy. This is pre PayPal. This was, uh,

48
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.300
you you'd be able to just buy this stuff.

49
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.170
Like there was a host of these different things like, um,

50
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.030
do you remember a salvia?

51
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.060
<v 0>Oh, I was just talking about the days. That's the legal or not. I don't know.</v>

52
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.220
<v 1>It's a good question because it's kind of fallen out of favor.</v>

53
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.750
It's not something that people talk about a lot,

54
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:52.830
but when people found out that you could just get salvia from a head shop. Yeah.

55
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.030
Head shops is supposed to be, you can buy bongs, you can buy velvet posters,

56
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.160
but there's nothing there that can get you up.

57
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.930
But then they started selling salvia because he was somehow illegal.

58
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.110
And he was one of the most mind blowing,

59
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:09.580
psychedelics known demand for 10 minutes. Yeah. It's unbelievably powerful.

60
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:11.620
Ari Shaffir did some on a podcast.

61
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.750
And he lived in alternative life for three months. He had a family, he had jobs.

62
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.020
He had friends. And then all of a sudden he came back to reality.

63
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.400
<v 0>I love this book in an alternate reality. Our ship you're his friends.</v>

64
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.110
<v 1>Yes. He has friends in real life.</v>

65
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.690
I'm one of his friends that he had different friends that I didn't even know.

66
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.780
He just went into this place and lived another life.

67
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.680
I think he was under the ocean too. Yeah, there he is right there. Oh, wow.

68
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.010
He's gone. And he was getting red ban of course filmed it. And so he was,

69
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.450
and he got very violent when he woke up to like violent,

70
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.980
violent it's everybody was because it's disorienting.

71
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.900
<v 0>Yeah. He's confused. You're physically paralyzed.</v>

72
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.410
<v 1>Yeah. So he was, he's like, get off me. Get off of me, Sam.</v>

73
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.160
Tripoli's got his sunglasses on. It was chaos. Anyway, he, um,

74
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.970
he came out of it and he said that while he was out for 10 minutes,

75
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.030
he lived like three months in a different world. Jeez.

76
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.281
<v 0>All right.</v>

77
00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:05.260
And then you have to wonder if that's the real one and this is the fake one. Ah,

78
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.250
am I wrong?

79
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.260
<v 1>No, you're not wrong. That's what, apparently,</v>

80
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:11.830
when you would have the Catholic priest going down the aisle waving,

81
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.350
that would either be Sage, which is,

82
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.220
I think cleansing derivative of salvia.

83
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:22.420
Divinorum I think not a derivative, a cousin, maybe a close relative.

84
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.640
I think Sage and salvia divinorum are extremely close in terms of

85
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.410
like, uh, the genus.

86
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.740
<v 0>Genus genus. Gina said, what's the genus for Sage.</v>

87
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.110
<v 1>I think it's real close. I think it's,</v>

88
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.240
it's one of those things where they think that maybe people were burning that,

89
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.250
but, uh, they were probably also most definitely burning cannabis.

90
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.580
And so they were wafting through the aisles with cannabis smoke,

91
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.130
getting everybody secondhand high. Huh? Yeah.

92
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.370
And that's going to have that experience to take them into this

93
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.810
Catholic journey. You know, the guy's wearing a robe, just,

94
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.730
just go these stained glass windows everywhere. Like holy. And look at the,

95
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.080
the epic structure. Like you're looking at these gigantic beautiful artworks.

96
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.420
They're calling buildings, Sage or salvia.

97
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.350
<v 0>Okay. All.</v>

98
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.930
<v 1>Sages are salvia. Wow. Over time though,</v>

99
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:17.230
the term stage has been closely aligned with cooking or medicinal use.

100
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.070
And the term salvia has been given to more ornamental members of the genus

101
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.510
genus. Nevertheless,

102
00:05:22.511 --> 00:05:26.620
salvia is the Latin name or genus given to all these plants. Yeah.

103
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.270
So Sage is salvia.

104
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.950
So salvia divinorum this incredibly potent psychedelic is common

105
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:34.300
Sage. Wow.

106
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.520
<v 0>Or close in basic purposes.</v>

107
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.020
<v 1>Yeah. In the neighborhood of it.</v>

108
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.870
<v 0>And it's a, it's like a mix of acid in a week.</v>

109
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.790
<v 1>Those guys tripping balls.</v>

110
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.500
Sudden those guys are walking around with salvia blowing, salvia smoke.

111
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.600
That that's not a coincidence, man. They could have picked Cedar bark. Right.

112
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.590
They chose some super potent psychedelic and wafted through the

113
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.150
air as they're walking back and forth.

114
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 0>The theory that the Salem witch trials are because they're all eating our God.</v>

115
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.643
Yeah.

116
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.880
<v 1>Frost. Yeah. Early. Yeah. Early frost. Yeah. Th th that,</v>

117
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.300
that apparently is a really good one. Like they,

118
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:12.080
they really think that that really could have been. Yeah.

119
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.290
<v 0>Well, they also, there's a book called the Oracle about the Oracle at Delphi.</v>

120
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.771
Right.

121
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.830
And she had these visions and she would prophecy the future and they went there

122
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:22.760
and they found that they found her stool. She was sitting over, or her.

123
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.593
<v 1>Stool that she said.</v>

124
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.080
<v 0>It's got three legs to it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I thought like an animal cop cop.</v>

125
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.460
What's it called? Cop bro. What's the thing for dinosaur poo fossilized,

126
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.140
copper something. Oh, um, they, they, you can get those, um, dinosaur poo. Yeah.

127
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.410
Fossilized. Yeah. Um, she, so they found,

128
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:42.680
she was sitting over a crack with natural gas coming out.

129
00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:44.420
So she's getting high off of whatever that is.

130
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.920
<v 1>Oh, no.</v>

131
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.490
So there was natural gas leaking out to the ground where she was partying. Yeah.

132
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.180
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

133
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.030
So of course she's going to be speaking jibberish and having all these visions.

134
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.210
Cause she's getting, it's like pop it's like not like, like, um, like a,

135
00:06:56.211 --> 00:06:58.220
when you inhale.

136
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.410
<v 1>The laughing gas, when you go to the.</v>

137
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.890
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, nitrous opening.</v>

138
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.190
<v 1>It totally makes sense. Yeah. I think that's probably a lot of these cases.</v>

139
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.690
Of course, wacky things that people did. I mean,

140
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.600
it only makes sense. I mean, they,

141
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:17.900
they never did figure out what Soma is in the ancient Hindu.

142
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.300
Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. They,

143
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.360
they think it might've been some kind of psychedelic, but they don't know what,

144
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.070
like there's all this different speculation.

145
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.730
Like some people think it was accommodator story that it was, uh, it was like,

146
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.360
silicide been mixed with something else and Lotus flower,

147
00:07:32.361 --> 00:07:35.930
there's all these like different, different theories, but nobody really knows.

148
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:39.440
But Soma was obviously something that they were taking as a sacrament that would

149
00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:40.640
have these profound effects.

150
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.650
That's most likely the root of all of these crazy religious experiences.

151
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:49.340
These people were tripping their balls off and they weren't lying.

152
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.280
Like God did come to them real. Yeah. Yeah.

153
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.950
God did come to them out of the burning Bush and spoke to them.

154
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.990
And that's the other thing that the burning Bush,

155
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.120
they think that these scholars in Jerusalem think that the burning Bush is

156
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:06.080
probably the Acacia Bush, which is rich and DMT. Oh.

157
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:09.450
So that's probably why this is the, the metaphor, right? The,

158
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.140
the burning Bush and God spoke to them in the burning Bush.

159
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.230
That's probably what it really means. They were tripping.

160
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.530
They were smoking it tripping balls and they met God and he came back with it.

161
00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.910
This is the only way we're going to get along.

162
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.990
We've got to stop raping each other.

163
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.810
<v 0>And the other thing is a lot of these old mystery religions, right?</v>

164
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:24.980
You have to be initiated into them.

165
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.520
And if you're going to join this cult or whatever, for lack of a better term,

166
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.180
and they give you here, take this, you are going to experience something.

167
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:35.480
Not only that, no one ever that you've ever heard of, but like,

168
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.710
you don't even know how to handle it.

169
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.020
And it's it's will change your life permanently,

170
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:40.280
but there's no vocabulary for it there.

171
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:42.380
It's not like now where you know what acid is. You're like, holy,

172
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.760
this is religious. Right.

173
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.640
<v 1>You would think it's God, God. Yeah.</v>

174
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.230
<v 0>Unless it's bad. When you meet the devil.</v>

175
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.170
<v 1>That guy, uh, John Marco Allegro, do you know who he is?</v>

176
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.930
He's a guy who deciphered the dead sea scrolls. Oh, okay.

177
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.180
We've worked on the panel for 14 years. And he wrote a serious,

178
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.150
seriously controversial book. He was an ordained minister,

179
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.890
but he was the only one on the dead sea scroll translation group that they put

180
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:09.090
together. That was agnostic because he started studying while he was,

181
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.150
he was a ordained minister. But then he started studying theology and was like,

182
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:15.630
this is all crazy. Like, what is this? So he became agnostic.

183
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:20.580
And he wanted to look at the etymology of the words. And so he,

184
00:09:20.581 --> 00:09:24.690
it was his conclusion after 14 years that the entire Christian religion was a

185
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:26.130
gigantic misunderstanding.

186
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.140
And what it really was about was psychedelic mushroom experiences and

187
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:32.250
fertility rituals.

188
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.650
And he broke down the word Jesus to an ancient word that

189
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.320
an ancient Sumerian word,

190
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.140
that means a mushroom covered in God's seaman.

191
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.370
And the idea was that the rain,

192
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.510
which would make everything grow was God's comm. And that it wasn't a bad thing.

193
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:54.060
Like they didn't think of comm as bad. They wanted to live. Everybody wanted it.

194
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.890
They wanted to have children. They wanted to prosper.

195
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.990
And that when the rain would come,

196
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.620
mushrooms would appear almost instantaneously. Like, have you ever seen

197
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.920
[inaudible]? And when they would eat those, they would trip their balls off.

198
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.270
So they had decided that this was Jesus and that this, this,

199
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.440
this was what was God's.

200
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.690
<v 0>Son. God created this from his own seed.</v>

201
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.500
<v 1>Well, this is what Marco Legros. His research was pointing to.</v>

202
00:10:19.501 --> 00:10:23.460
He was trying to say that what was really going on was these people were trying

203
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:28.410
to hide a lot of what the psychedelic rituals are from the Romans and

204
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:31.370
from the people that captured them. So they hid them in stories and parables,

205
00:10:31.371 --> 00:10:34.290
and there was all sorts of problems in the translations. There's just like,

206
00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:36.510
you know, you're taking things from ancient Hebrew,

207
00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:40.740
and you breaking it down to Latin and you break it down to German and English.

208
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:41.490
And.

209
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.010
<v 0>I can't, I can't believe he got a positive reception for this.</v>

210
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.220
<v 1>If you're taking on didn't necessarily, he, uh,</v>

211
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.410
the book got bought out okay.

212
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:54.360
By the Catholic church and then recently reinstated and then got out

213
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.110
it, they bought it. They liked the, I think they took it off the market.

214
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.410
I think you used to be able to only get a,

215
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.970
a copy of it used to only be able to get a, um, like an,

216
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.420
a used copy. Okay. And then Jaan Irvin put it out.

217
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.770
He republished it like a few, I don't want to say maybe eight,

218
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:15.510
10 years ago. So now he can get ahold,

219
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:19.320
but he also published another book after they took that one back. When I think,

220
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.150
I don't know the total history of it,

221
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.620
but he published a second book and the second book was the dead sea scrolls and

222
00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:29.310
the Christian myth. And the first one was the sacred mushroom in the cross. Wow.

223
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.940
But it only makes sense if you think about people who lived back then,

224
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.390
and we know that psychedelic mushrooms aren't recent right. Existed forever.

225
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.210
Right. So these people found them and they most certainly did. Yes.

226
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:42.870
There's a lot of depictions of them. And there's also a lot of iconography,

227
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.630
a lot of, um, like, like you,

228
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:49.350
you see shapes that resemble mushrooms like all over the place and some of the

229
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:54.190
ancient artwork and even people that are dancing naked under the

230
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:55.240
influence of a mushroom.

231
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:57.850
So there's a translucent mushroom shape that surrounds them.

232
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.760
And these ancient paintings and these religious paintings,

233
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:04.750
these people are dancing. So most likely they were tripping balls. Well,

234
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.950
if you didn't know any better,

235
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:08.200
of course you would think that's God talking to you.

236
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.640
If you didn't know what psilocybin is,

237
00:12:09.641 --> 00:12:11.650
you didn't know what dimethyltryptamine is. You didn't know what.

238
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.580
<v 0>Well, you're also going to hear voice literal voices. So it's not even like,</v>

239
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:18.630
you're like, it's not a metaphor. You're going to hear a voice talking to you.

240
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.001
<v 1>Right.</v>

241
00:12:19.001 --> 00:12:22.750
So people that think that like these people who created religion were all liars,

242
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.540
they're probably more likely trippers.

243
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.880
Because if you look at all these religious stories,

244
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:30.880
they're all crazy and weird and fantastical and wonderful.

245
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:35.770
But most of them are like guides to live

246
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.760
life in a more virtuous or pious or

247
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:43.240
moral way. Right. That's what most sure.

248
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.300
The tenants of a lot of these religions, that's what you get when you trip,

249
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.860
when you, you trip, you get, you gotta be a better person. Yeah.

250
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:55.330
That's what you get. You get this like profound humility, a humbling,

251
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.171
shouldn't say humiliation,

252
00:12:56.171 --> 00:13:01.150
but humbling in the face of this Titanic expression and experience that

253
00:13:01.151 --> 00:13:04.240
you can't even describe with words. And then after it's over.

254
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:05.530
<v 0>Want to be a better person.</v>

255
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.110
And there's also a sense of comfort that it's going to be okay,

256
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.440
this is going to be, which is what religion traditionally gives a lot of people,

257
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:13.660
like a sense of reassurance that someone's looking out.

258
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.880
You're not going to accidentally, you know, go.

259
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.690
<v 1>So you get a feeling that even if it's not okay, it's okay. Right.</v>

260
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.450
Like when you die, it's okay. When you trip balls,

261
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.510
like one of the things that Larry Hagman say, remember Larry Hagman from Dallas.

262
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.620
<v 0>Yes. I will say Dallas is probably the greatest show of all time.</v>

263
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.880
Great show that is, and people confuse with dynasty, which was trashy garbage.

264
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:37.360
Dallas was one of the speech. I think it's literally the best show. All.

265
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.780
<v 1>What's his name Jr. What was this? What are you doing? That's right. Well,</v>

266
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.910
he tripped balls and talked about it on CNN and said that it was one of the best

267
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:48.760
experiences of his life because he no longer was afraid of death.

268
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.740
That before that he was afraid of death.

269
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:54.820
And the one thing that tripping and tripping hard apparently really did forms

270
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:56.430
that he no longer held that fear.

271
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.930
<v 0>He had stared death in the face. Cause it was alcoholism. You know,</v>

272
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.720
he had to have a liver transplant or whatever it was. So it was no joke.

273
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.310
He was a huge alcoholic.
