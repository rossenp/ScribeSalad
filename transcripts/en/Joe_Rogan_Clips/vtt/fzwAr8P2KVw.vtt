00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 1>Experience. Every time I go into Washington, DC,</v>

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.200
every time I go into the Wegmans, there's a big Washington football team.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.110
Uh, uh, Tostito's potato chips with the Washington football team name on there.

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:18.270
And, and, um, uh.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.080
<v 0>And is that a offensive word? Like me even saying that like right there,</v>

7
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:25.914
is that offensive?

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.930
<v 1>Yes. Yes. Um, not to everybody. Um,</v>

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.310
but the majority of, of native American groups tribes,

10
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.360
they've all let the team know that, that, uh,

11
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.030
that that name is offensive. Uh,

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.980
and they still won't change it. They don't, uh, they say it's honoring,

13
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.770
it's honoring native Americans. Uh,

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.730
that term is used. Um, uh,

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.560
and you see it in historic records, uh, to count, um,

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.360
Indian skins or scalps that have been, uh, taken from,

17
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.060
uh, Indian people. Um,

18
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.720
it's an offensive, it's not just derogatory or demeaning,

19
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.583
but it's.

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.140
<v 0>We'll be really clear what you're saying when you're saying skins and scallops.</v>

21
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.003
I mean, dead people.

22
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.010
<v 1>Yeah. Um, uh, yeah. And sorry, um.</v>

23
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.970
<v 0>Uh, this, this is the number one reason why I wanted to have you here.</v>

24
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.710
I want it, I want it from your perspective, because for us, we get, oh yeah,

25
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.920
that's an offensive word to her. That's offensive. I heard that's offensive,

26
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.930
but the majority of people are not talking to someone who's deeply ingrained in

27
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.270
native American issues and culture like you are.

28
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
So you get explained to us that, you know, I mean, it makes sense, right.

29
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:49.770
If we, if it was, it was, you know,

30
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.600
think about some derogatory term for someone somewhere. I mean,

31
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.420
even if it was like, kind of derogatory,

32
00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:01.770
like if they were called the Washington crowds and it was all based on Germans,

33
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.400
like a lot of German people would probably be really off at that. Like, Hey,

34
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
you know, that's kind of, like, why are you calling us that?

35
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.680
But it's the chiefs, Kansas city cheese,

36
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.370
what other native American names there's been a ton of them. Right. Yeah.

37
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.020
<v 1>But Braves there's a lot of.</v>

38
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.240
<v 0>Other Braves still around. Yeah. Yes. And they still have that name, so all.</v>

39
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.640
Has anybody gave given in and changed their name?

40
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.600
<v 1>Uh, um, I'm I, yes, there has.</v>

41
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:32.400
And there's been really a movement with high school colleges. Um,

42
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.110
and, uh, I don't know the status of any, um, uh,

43
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.070
you know, as far as NFL or, or national teams, um,

44
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.900
Syracuse, um, Syracuse university had, um,

45
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.670
a derogatory mascot that they changed, uh, some years back, um,

46
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.620
because of the tribes there. Um, they're now in the state of New York, um,

47
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.700
fought for that.

48
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.740
<v 0>Uh, what was that mascot? I.</v>

49
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.160
<v 1>Can't remember, but now they're there, there's some kind of like orange,</v>

50
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.260
it's an orange, super orange. Yeah. But,

51
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.210
um, that's not hurting anybody's feelings. Yes.

52
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.150
<v 2>March, same with like toroidal engines.</v>

53
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.860
There was a great engineer up in Lodi that was revisiting to Royals

54
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.940
and he had a, he had a Ford focus that would do his,

55
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.220
like his daughter's old car with a blown up motor.

56
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.290
He had his own toroidal motor that he had developed that could run from the

57
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:32.650
energy in the charge particles, in the air.

58
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.180
What this thing did like 15 miles an hour on a flat test track,

59
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.760
running on air.

60
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.000
<v 0>Charged particles in the air. Yes. Sonically.</v>

61
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.833
<v 2>Charged particles.</v>

62
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.050
<v 0>As the technology improved that 15 miles an hour.</v>

63
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:50.530
It could be a real speed. Yeah. Wow.

64
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.170
<v 2>Yeah. And then that same guy,</v>

65
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.550
I saw him once at a trade show and I was exhibiting at the show as well.

66
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:00.160
So I was there on setup day. I was bored out of my gourd. We were,

67
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.990
I was already set up in the Ford booth.

68
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.970
So I'm just walking around sort of sniffing around and see this trippy scientist

69
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.970
guy in his lab coat. And this little booth. It was like, you know,

70
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.950
six by 10 foot booth. And, you know,

71
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:16.480
at a show where people have like 200 by 60 foot boots and it's got this odd

72
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:20.350
little toroidal thing and then a bigger toroidal thing and literally like a

73
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.430
chalkboard. So I'm like, dude, what's going on? So I started talking about,

74
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.100
he starts explaining the technology and what he was doing,

75
00:04:27.101 --> 00:04:29.680
and like the smaller one at 300 foot pounds of torque,

76
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.210
the larger one had 2000 and he was looking to develop it for

77
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.220
rail cars, for semis, for cars, like, and on and on and on. And he's like, yeah,

78
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:42.010
the biggest problem is stopping it once it gets going,

79
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.320
because the toroidal structure meant that the compression cycle from 12 to two

80
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.100
of that first cylinder was such that when the combustion occurred and it

81
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:55.360
propelled the next piston into the next combustion cycle and kept going.

82
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.140
So getting that power out of the central crank was a challenge.

83
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.530
And then how to stop the thing was like the bigger challenge,

84
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.450
but they'd run on like horse,

85
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.350
ion charged particles, uh, diesel gas. I didn't even need spark plugs.

86
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.030
So I'm like blown away by this. I go back the next day, where do you go?

87
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.940
Boots gone, empty, done. And I have the guy's info line.

88
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.680
Try to reach out to him. Website gone website.

89
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:27.220
I looked at the night before gone got gobbled up

90
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.470
five years later.

91
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:33.940
I see him again at another trade show with another kick design. And man,

92
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:37.060
was he a bitter man? It's like, yeah, never again,

93
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.510
because they bought it and they shelved it. I'm never selling anything again.

94
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.100
them. I'm licensing to specific channels of applications and that's it,

95
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.510
his new product.

96
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.330
<v 0>So what do you think happened if you're a conspiracy theorist?</v>

97
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:51.160
Do you think someone bought them out and just.

98
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.920
<v 2>I'm a small, independent business owner, real realist in that hell yes.</v>

99
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.710
Someone didn't like.

100
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.530
<v 0>That and they shelved that. So they bought it and then just shelved it.</v>

101
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.140
<v 3>Uh, my wife is part of like something like it's called a mommy group.</v>

102
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.790
So it's like a connection of online of all these mommies and on like all over

103
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:14.990
LA. And what they do is they post people will post. They need.

104
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.400
So like one of the moms just had to get it. They don't have any wet wipes.

105
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.150
And so then all the other moms will be like, oh, we've got wet wipes.

106
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.670
And then right now they're just leaving them on the door.

107
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.710
So people come and get them. So it's like,

108
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.130
I think the community thing is exactly right.

109
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.140
But also people have to maybe transcend money for a second and figure out ways

110
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.220
to set up in their community. Like, what do you need?

111
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.230
What do I have? And then start some form of like trade or just giving people,

112
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.520
you know, there was someone who set up a toilet paper exchange in LA,

113
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.790
where he was just like, if you have extra toilet paper, bring it.

114
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.880
And then he had toilet paper and he was just giving it out to people who are,

115
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.020
you know, that's,

116
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.220
I think that's the sort of thing we're going to have to start doing if we can,

117
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.540
you know, it's like right now there's old people who they they're,

118
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:06.710
they can't do, man.

119
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.920
<v 0>Do anything they're terrified. They can't even get online. If you know them,</v>

120
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.000
you got to help them. And this is, uh, you know, this is a weird time for us,

121
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.930
but it's a time for us to reset. You know, it's not, it's not good.

122
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.610
I'm not saying it's good, but I'm saying there's a,

123
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.620
we can get a positive out of this.

124
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.380
The people that make through the people that make it through,

125
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.430
we can get a positive out of this. And the positive is community's important.

126
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.990
It's really important. And it,

127
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.650
it seemed like it was an important cause it seemed like we had everything set

128
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:36.830
up. So he didn't have to engage with people. It's not the right way to do it.

129
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.240
It's not good for anybody now that that kind of life is not good.

130
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.250
And the detachment that we have, I mean, that's why,

131
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.400
why do you think people have road rage on the highway? You know,

132
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:48.530
when they're locked in their little box,

133
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.850
separated from people in a way that they, they, they wouldn't have it in person.

134
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.380
If it was just, I mean,

135
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:58.460
it's only a thin piece of metal and glass separating from these people with

136
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:58.701
that.

137
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.090
There's the other added factor of the heightened senses because you're driving

138
00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:04.130
fast and you realize you might have to make quick movements.

139
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.580
So dumb things people do are elevated and they're even more dumb,

140
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.120
but it's also that you're detached. You're, you're in these boxes.

141
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.370
<v 3>Right? It's like a weird dream.</v>

142
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.840
<v 0>We've done weird to each other.</v>

143
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.060
<v 3>We're all gummed up. And that way it's like something it's like,</v>

144
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.080
it's like a fungus that grew on the circuitry of society and start,

145
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.560
or it's like, you know, when they talk about the, uh,

146
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.550
dolphins and the whales being up by the high-tech sonar,

147
00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:35.960
they're using and washing up on the beach because the sonar is messing up their

148
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:37.880
ability to communicate with each other. It's like,

149
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:43.100
there's this kind of technological sonar that has completely made

150
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:45.680
us disconnected from the earth.

151
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.060
Essentially like our earth connection has been replaced by a

152
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.210
technological connection. Now technology comes from the earth,

153
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:57.810
but we're talking about a secondary thing. Can compare it to,

154
00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:59.850
you know, your feet touching the ground,

155
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.130
being around another human and like recognizing them as having exactly the same

156
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.280
thing you have, which is they want to be happy, you know,

157
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.610
feeling the connection between people when you're with someone. I mean,

158
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.930
I don't know if you've ever done that,

159
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:17.310
but just like the next time you're around anybody that you're like buying from,

160
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.090
or that you don't normally just kind of go by feel that connect.

161
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:25.020
You could feel it. There's an energetic connection that you can feel there.

162
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:26.190
That's easy to overlook.

163
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.200
<v 4>Hell week is another good example.</v>

164
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:32.520
It starts Sunday in the evening and ends Friday in the afternoon and you get

165
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.200
about two hours of sleep on Wednesday.

166
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:38.040
That's it it's horrendous to go through.

167
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.400
And it's pretty entertaining as an instructor because you can just totally with

168
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:44.580
the students cause they're off their rocker by Tuesday afternoon.

169
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.140
But almost all of the attrition occurs from Sunday night until I'd say Tuesday

170
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:50.220
morning and beyond that,

171
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:52.740
you're probably gonna make it through because you've invested so much.

172
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.730
But the advice that I was given when I went through was don't look at how we as

173
00:09:56.731 --> 00:10:00.390
a five day pipeline, just make it to your next meal.

174
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.340
They have to feed you every six hours.

175
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.260
So if I can stack six hours on six hours on six hours and just focus

176
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:11.340
on getting to the next meal, it doesn't matter how much I'm in pain.

177
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.190
Doesn't matter how cold I am. If I can just get to the next meal,

178
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:16.530
I'll get a reprieve, a mental reset,

179
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.780
and I can continue on that's that in combination with some,

180
00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:22.950
you know,

181
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.870
the mental toughness is how you approach and set your goals and then resilience.

182
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.470
And my definition of resilience would be the ability to get bent and come back

183
00:10:31.471 --> 00:10:32.760
stronger than you were before.

184
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.730
And the way you do that is by bending yourself as often as possible,

185
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:39.120
which you do all the time by running sprint surgery. You know what I mean?

186
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.760
You're doing that stuff. You're mentally tough because of that.

187
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.910
And if you can apply that resilience to approaching,

188
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.720
setting and approaching your goals from digestible perspectives you can

189
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:52.890
accomplish in Santa amount. So that's really what I mean,

190
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.320
it's a physical test, but we're just testing the mind.

191
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:59.220
Can the individual ignore the big and focus on the small,

192
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:02.550
can you do the step that you need to do and not get overwhelmed regardless if

193
00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:06.090
you're tired, exhausted, hungry, cold. I mean, that's really all it is.

194
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.640
It's not a complex training program. There's the ocean, there's the beach.

195
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.650
There's some telephone poles, there's some boats.

196
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:17.910
And then later on we introduced scuba gear and towards the tail end of it,

197
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.700
you know, some demolition and pistol and rifle.
