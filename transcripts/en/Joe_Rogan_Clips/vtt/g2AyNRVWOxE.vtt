00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.300
<v 3>So what are you telling me? Jamie? There's a UFO yesterday. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.721
<v 2>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:10.170
NFL popular quarterback for the Cleveland Browns from random number one pick and

5
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:14.040
Heisman winner. I think he lives in Austin and the off season and he, uh,

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.080
saw a potential UFO last night.

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.970
<v 1>He says almost a hundred percent M and I just saw a UFO drop straight out of the</v>

8
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.950
sky on our way home from dinner,

9
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.570
we stopped and looked at each other and asked if either of us saw it very bright

10
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:31.560
ball of light going straight down out of the sky towards lake Travis

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.080
could have been the drone kind of in some kids. He's a football.

12
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.540
<v 0>Player. Yeah. Are we going to believe him? Because he's famous.</v>

13
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.440
<v 1>Yeah. That's the only reason I just got a lot of attention as well. He's famous.</v>

14
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:45.960
So you listen to his Twitter, I guess. I don't know.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.820
Have you ever seen anything crazy?

16
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.290
<v 0>No. No. I, I don't think crazy. Um,</v>

17
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.870
when I'm up in the mountains sometimes camping or whatever, I'll see.

18
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:59.370
I feel like some shooting stars and some stars, you know, fall,

19
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.010
which actually, now that I'm saying it might be a little bit crazy,

20
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:03.960
so maybe I have seen some. I don't know.

21
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.000
<v 1>I want to think I'm seeing some crazy, but I definitely have it.</v>

22
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.030
I thought I did when I was a kid, but now I think I was probably lying. Yeah,

23
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480
no. When I think about it, when I was a kid, I was probably full.

24
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.610
I probably wanted it. You know what I'm saying? Like,

25
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:19.830
I probably saw like a military jet and I thought,

26
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.080
and I wanted it to be something cool.

27
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.410
Like I remember the first time I ever saw stealth bomber were filming fear

28
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:29.040
factor and it was over Palm and Palmdale, which is near Edwards air force base.

29
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.810
If I didn't know what that was, I would 100% think that was from another planet.

30
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.560
You know, when you see the thing, black wing flying overhead,

31
00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:38.490
it's like it's pretty bad.

32
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.740
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I don't think I w you know,</v>

33
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.760
I think that my brain would just immediately be like, ask something.

34
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.220
Can explain that. Yeah.

35
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.260
<v 1>Well, that's the problem with anything like that. It's like,</v>

36
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.430
it's the idea that you're looking at something from another planet is so

37
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.570
it's so outside of what you see every day, you don't know where to put it.

38
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.250
<v 0>It's getting less outside though. Right? It's getting less outside,</v>

39
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:04.080
which is weird. What's up with the, uh,

40
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.570
because I remember you saying something about it on the podcast.

41
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.020
What's up with that bill that passed that said that the, yeah.

42
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:12.960
I have to release whatever information they have to release about.

43
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.890
<v 1>The COVID relief bill and inside the COVID relief bill they gave,</v>

44
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.510
I think that it was the CIA.

45
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.610
They gave the central intelligence agency 180 days or something like that to

46
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:27.090
release all the information that they have about UFO's.

47
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.840
<v 0>Where, where are we at on that? I don't know. That's a good question.</v>

48
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.620
What day are we?

49
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.590
<v 1>They're not, they don't have to really show. They're not saying, oh,</v>

50
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:37.710
this is what we got. We got a blurry picture. Get the out of my house.

51
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.040
<v 0>Yeah. We're not going to know anything. Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.430
<v 1>The idea that they're going to tell these senators and all these elected people,</v>

53
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.750
what they know, they're not telling them.

54
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.050
<v 0>The aliens told them that they have 180 days to tell everyone [inaudible].</v>

55
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.530
<v 1>Right now you're talking. If Trump didn't tell everybody,</v>

56
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.513
we're not going to know.

57
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.470
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. That's true. I, I.</v>

58
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.650
<v 1>Remember when Chris rock was talking about Obama and he was talking about bomb.</v>

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.950
People were disappointed in Obama's first administration. And he said,

60
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.380
you got to wait until the second term.

61
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.910
And that's when you do some really gangster.

62
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.700
And Obama didn't do any gangster in the secondary.

63
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.530
But if Trump got elected again in 2024,

64
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.040
because you can only do it twice. If he got elected again in 2024,

65
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.780
maybe he would tell us, you know, recount the votes, maybe he'll

66
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.920
get on TV. And that's the first he talks about right away. Here's what I say.

67
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.330
Here's what the, a, okay.

68
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.340
Include included as a committee comment on the intelligence authorization

69
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:39.671
act.

70
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:44.530
The committee directs the director of the national intelligence

71
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.850
in consult consultation with the secretary of defense and the heads of such

72
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.530
other agencies to submit a report within 180 days of the date of enactment of

73
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:58.300
the act to the congressional intelligence and armed services committees on

74
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.860
you, a piece,

75
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.730
why can't they just say UFO's unidentified aerial phenomenon.

76
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.790
What's the difference on identified flying objects.

77
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.640
They got tired of using that. So they changed it to UAP.

78
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.230
Why are they going to with us, man, UAP words change all the time.

79
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.550
