00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 1>Experience is the door to iron man. Totally closed. Cause I don't believe it is.</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.320
Oh, you guys can go through time. Now you can go, you know,

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.213
you already opened up.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.930
<v 0>Well, let me ask you the question.</v>

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.150
If I pick the Jersey back up and put it on wouldn't you feel a little bit like,

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.013
Ugh. No.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.420
<v 1>No. Oh, here's here's the right thing.</v>

9
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.160
They go through a few semi lackluster Avengers movies without you.

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.370
You ready for this? I'm ready. Here's the scene.

11
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.720
There's a moment where the world's fate is at stake and they realized they need

12
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.770
a super genius and then they figure out how to restart that time machine.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.030
<v 0>Great. Come on, man. Is.</v>

14
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.860
<v 1>That the audience sees you when you, when you step out of.</v>

15
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.880
<v 0>Is this your, and can we, do you want a little arc on it too?</v>

16
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.430
Because if this is your idea, then you got to show up for it too.

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.280
<v 1>I'll do it. I'll show up what I have to do. I don't know.</v>

18
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.070
<v 0>I'll do whatever I have to do. We all have to do whatever Kevin fight.</v>

19
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.210
<v 1>The whole thing is that, do they still have that clap?</v>

20
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.400
<v 0>They do. They did digital.</v>

21
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.570
<v 1>I'll hold that digital thing. I'll do it. But the, the,</v>

22
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:10.710
the way people would freak out, if you came back, come on, man.

23
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.870
Think about it. Take a few years off,

24
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.570
Dr. Doolittle's a couple more Sherlock Holmes.

25
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.260
<v 0>You know,</v>

26
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.150
it's interesting watching Eddie Murphy in this last little

27
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.800
period of time. And I was talking to Colin Joest last night,

28
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:30.750
who got to sit next to him at the golden Globes and who was there

29
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:31.584
and you know,

30
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.330
on the show and writing for him with him when he hosted recently and I go,

31
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.630
it's just incredible. Our culture

32
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.650
never encourages taking a break, never encourages saying, uh,

33
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.810
uh, don't chase that thing because you've got it in your hands. And, and,

34
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.800
and I love the idea that if you're, if you're good at what you do,

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.230
then it's not about time. It's about it.

36
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.520
Doesn't matter when

37
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.190
you decide to pick up the mantle again, it's just about, but it's scary.

38
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.200
Isn't it? Could you imagine? Like if they just said, Hey, Joe,

39
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:13.620
just don't do the show for four years and then come back and do it again.

40
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.630
You'd be like, that's a lifetime who knows? What's yeah.

41
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.540
<v 1>Well, with Eddie,</v>

42
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.220
what's interesting is he was arguably

43
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.410
the greatest of his era and just stopped to stop for 30 years.

44
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.500
And no one does that. No one is who's dat. Good. And then when you see him,

45
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.430
I don't know if you ever saw him. He received some award and he was on a panel,

46
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.430
you know, and I was sitting in front of podium rider rather,

47
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:41.180
and he was talking about bill Cosby and he was doing this routine about them

48
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:42.860
taking away bill Cosby's awards.

49
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.800
And it was brilliant and the timing was so good.

50
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.910
And all of us comics were just sitting there going, he could do it tomorrow.

51
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.020
He could just get up there tomorrow and he be murdering. Yes.

52
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.000
<v 0>And, but it would be.</v>

53
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.700
<v 1>Different. It'd be different. He's a different human. Yeah. You know,</v>

54
00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:00.310
this is one, the more interesting things about it.

55
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.790
It's him talking about some of the more homophobic stuff that he did in the

56
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.450
past. Now it makes him cringe and you just can't believe he was that person.

57
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:09.670
But he, you know, he was when he did delirious,

58
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.700
I think he was like 22 or something crazy like that,

59
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.820
which is just bonkers that he was that good.

60
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.530
<v 0>Anyway, I've been thinking about him lately in relation to a bunch of things,</v>

61
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.790
but also just that

62
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.120
particularly nowadays giving yourself permission to not have to

63
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.880
jump because, you know, strike the iron's hot, all that stuff.

64
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.500
And maybe it's just as a bit of an anxiety to the times, which I remember too,

65
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.150
speaking of past generations, I remember growing up 1974,

66
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.880
Nixon's black and white TV getting impeached.

67
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.020
My dad and his buddies are whooping it up, but they're still and I'm going like,

68
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.220
wow, it's, it's not worse or, or, or better.

69
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.770
It's different, but now it's on us.

70
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.180
So there's a bit of an urgency and that, that whole thing.

71
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:05.320
And just being able to say like, so to answer your question to me, uh,

72
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.270
starting up again, as off the table,

73
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:09.070
I feel I've done all I could with that character.

74
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.590
There'd have to be a super compelling argument and a series of

75
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.890
events that, that made it obvious to it.

76
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:19.330
But the other thing is I want to do that.

77
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.000
<v 1>Their stuff, right? Of course. Yeah, of course.</v>

78
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.690
You know what you're talking about about Nixon and people get it.

79
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.680
People can lose themselves in current events. And what I mean by that, like,

80
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.280
it doesn't necessarily completely your,

81
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:35.650
your life is more than what's going on in Washington. You know,

82
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.730
hunter Thompson talked about that when he was running for sheriff in Aspen,

83
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.530
he was talking about how local politics like your neighborhood, that's real,

84
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.190
but this actually can affect your life. Like what's going on in Washington.

85
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:51.940
How much does that affect your day to day existence? It's very little though.

86
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:56.470
For some people it becomes an enormous

87
00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:59.030
portion of the real estate of their mind. It, it,

88
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.090
it takes over most of their day to day consciousness where they're consumed

89
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:08.710
with it and it becomes a thing they're cheering for. They're rooting against.

90
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:10.780
And, and then, you know, your,

91
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.800
your life revolves on something that you have very little power over.

92
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.840
<v 0>Teams, turf wars, interests, uh,</v>

93
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.580
think globally act locally.

94
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.930
<v 1>Yes. I mean,</v>

95
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.710
it's a beautiful statement really is it's one of those cliches that you don't

96
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:27.544
even think about.

97
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.910
<v 0>I didn't know that was hunter in that picture out there,</v>

98
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.230
but to me it looked like Joe Walsh.

99
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.510
<v 1>Good as easily fit Joe Walsh. I mean, he moved to Colorado too. Oh,</v>

100
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:40.810
wow. Yeah. The Rocky mountain way. If he didn't.

101
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.010
<v 0>Yeah, he wants told me, I'll speak out of school. He said,</v>

102
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.720
now you should just watch TV for a year, bro.

103
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.460
I was like, thanks, Joe. And by the way, he was probably right.

104
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.740
Probably right. Look.

105
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.980
<v 1>If you just hung back and just did nothing, but watch TV for a year,</v>

106
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.920
the ideas you would have you'd have,

107
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.210
you would probably have a really rock solid idea of, of what's going on.

108
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.770
<v 0>His was more trying to have enough things going on that I wouldn't have any</v>

109
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.260
ideas for a year. And then I'd give myself a break for you.

110
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.080
<v 1>See, I've taken differently. I'm thinking like analyze the landscape.</v>

111
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.230
I think Joe Walsh is one of the most underrated guys ever,

112
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:27.410
because he changed the Eagles. The Eagles were one thing.

113
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.520
And then Joe Walls came around like victim of love. That's Joe Walsh. Yeah.

114
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.580
He came around and just all of a sudden there was a rock to it.

115
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.120
It's like they were kicking down doors and light and on fire. It was different.

116
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.040
There was an edge to it, you know, he's he added crazy.

117
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.350
He had a crazy to this beautiful harmony.

118
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.630
<v 0>I love it. When the guys that added crazy go up to the thin veil</v>

119
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.100
between dimensions and say, I think I'm going to stay put,

120
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.490
and then all of a sudden they represent

121
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.690
stability. They represent, uh, being okay,

122
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.550
hanging up your guns. Yeah. And just being, you know,

123
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.180
well that.

124
00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.840
<v 1>That's everything. Everyone has to accept that at some point in time. Right?</v>

125
00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:17.580
I mean, maybe that's you and your glasses. Right?

126
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.160
Cause everyone has to accept that at one point in time,

127
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.390
you're going to have to get off the ride.

128
00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:23.790
But when you're doing great and you're kicking it,

129
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:28.080
like boxers are a perfect example. They always last too long.

130
00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.040
There's only been a small handful. Like Andre ward recently marvelous,

131
00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:35.460
Marvin Hagler in his prime, they just go, that's it I'm done.

132
00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:39.150
And they actually are done almost every one of them comes back and almost every

133
00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:40.530
one of them chases that dragon.

134
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.710
<v 0>Here's why I love you. You're making an argument for,</v>

135
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.100
and also the argument against me coming back and doing another morning.

136
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:50.040
<v 1>Listen, I'm not married to anything except my wife,</v>

137
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.030
but I'm not married to any ideas. All the ideas that I have are just like, Hmm.

138
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.980
Maybe that idea sucks. I love you as iron man. So I would, I would,

139
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:03.000
if you, if they open up this time machine and you popped out,

140
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.290
I just imagine the moment where everybody goes crazy. It would be amazing.

141
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:10.470
That'd be great. I would love that, but I would also love you hanging it up.

142
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.660
<v 0>Yeah. It's look, it's just, first of all, it's 2020,</v>

143
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.340
and I'm not an OCD guy, but I keep thinking, see, clearly,

144
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.890
see clearly even if your vision is going and it's difficult because

145
00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:26.580
by,

146
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:31.530
I feel like we all just get buffeted by feelings and

147
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.230
ego or fears or little, you know,

148
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.900
chips of resentments or intuitions that are tied to something maybe higher,

149
00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:44.730
but you think is out of your reach or whatever. So it was a perfect time.

150
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:49.470
And I got to go have dinner with a bunch of the Marvel folks last night

151
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.770
and kind of have just a little bit of extra closure. Cause you know,

152
00:08:52.771 --> 00:08:57.510
the movie came out and it was bananas and the directors are sending me

153
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.320
pictures of like people flipping out in theaters when Tony snaps.

154
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:05.280
And I was like, whoa, this was kind of like a really big cultural thing.

155
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.630
But then like, uh, Victoria Alonzo, who's the head of VFX for all these movies,

156
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.550
literal super genius or Kevin Figgy or Fabro or

157
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.260
uh, Scarlett or some people that I've just been there with it for a long time.

158
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:20.340
We, we,

159
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.500
we were there experiencing it all when it came out and then we'd see each other

160
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.260
on a red carpet and it's not intimate. And then we kind of,

161
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:32.790
hadn't really had a chance just to do nothing, just hang out and you know,

162
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.250
have some crudity and kind of talk.

163
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.640
So it was really interesting being here today.

164
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.270
Cause yesterday was this kind of last night, was this kind of real like,

165
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:44.100
felt like closing the circle on things a bit.

166
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.140
<v 1>That's gotta be bittersweet. Yeah. But I liked that.</v>

167
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.340
I liked that you want to move on and I liked that you them and I liked that

168
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:56.670
you're doing something like Dr. Doolittle, cause that's like,

169
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.680
you've done a lot of wild in your life. You've got a lot of wild in your career,

170
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:06.240
but you sort of embody every new chapter

171
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.370
with the same kind of energy.

172
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.800
Although there's a different result in different piece of art,

173
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.600
it's all the same. You,

174
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.620
and that's one of the more interesting things about people and particular

175
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.100
actors, because actors get to be a bunch of different things.

176
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.480
And it's one of the weirder things about that craft. Like when you see a,

177
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.980
you know, a guy who's, uh,

178
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.760
like Daniel Day Lewis who like embodies these different humans,

179
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.290
like literally becomes different humans it's but it's always Daniel Day Lewis.

180
00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.130
You know what I mean? Like even though he plays these, these, you know,

181
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.390
there will be blood guy and all these different psychopaths and various

182
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.720
fascinating characters, it's always the N like you're,

183
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.990
you're pumped to see him do it. Right. And I think that's,

184
00:10:48.991 --> 00:10:51.780
I feel the same way with you. It's like, I know there's,

185
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.200
you're an interesting guy. There's a lot of going on in your head.

186
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.410
So when you dive into something, whatever it is,

187
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:02.520
whether it's your character from Tropic thunder or whatever it is like, you're,

188
00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.090
you're gonna, it's going to be Robert Downey Jr. Diving into stuff.

189
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.540
So I would imagine it would be kind of annoying,

190
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.110
even though you are brilliant at iron man to stay iron man.
