00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>Well, the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 1>I want to bring it back to the initial question. So you're working for the NSA.</v>

3
00:00:06.361 --> 00:00:09.030
When do you realize there's a huge issue?

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.770
And when do you feel this responsibility to let the American people know about

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:15.090
this issue? Like when,

6
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:19.020
when do you contact these journalists and what was the thought process regarding

7
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:19.980
this? Like what,

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.180
what steps did you go through once you realize that this was in violation of the

9
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.900
constitution and that even with the laws of the Patriot act and the Patriot act,

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.090
two things had changed so radically that you knew this was wrong and

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.110
you had to do something about it where you felt a responsibility to speak out.

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.850
<v 2>Okay. So since we gave so much historical preamble,</v>

13
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:44.810
let me just give the cliff notes version to get us up to that. Um,

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.180
so after September 11th, I'm a little bit lost. I'm doing my technical stuff,

15
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:53.210
but it doesn't really feel like it matters anymore. Like I'm making more money,

16
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:57.290
I'm becoming more accomplished, but the world's on fire, right?

17
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.180
You remember there was a crazy mood of patriotism in the country because we were

18
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:04.490
all trying to come together to get through it. You remember,

19
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:08.030
like people were sticking Dixie cups in the top of every chain link fence on

20
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:12.350
every overpass. It was like, stand together, you know, never forget, um,

21
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:16.520
United we stand flags on every car. Exactly. And you know,

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.840
it was a young, a young guy who is not especially political. Right.

23
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.390
Um, and I come from military background, federal family, all that stuff.

24
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
And so that means I'm very vulnerable to this kind of stuff.

25
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:34.310
I see it on the news and, uh, Bush and all his sort of cronies are going look,

26
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.540
uh, it's Qaeda, it's terrorism, terrorist organization.

27
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:42.170
They have all these international connections. Uh, there's Iraq, you know,

28
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.830
dictators weapons of mass destruction. They're holding the world at ransom.

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.960
You got Colin Powell at the UN dangling little vials of like fake anthrax.

30
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.110
Um, and so I felt an obligation to do my part.

31
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.190
And so I volunteered to join the army. Uh, you, you probably can't tell from,

32
00:01:58.191 --> 00:01:59.960
from looking at me, but I'm not going to be a,

33
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.460
at the top of the MMA circuit anytime soon. Uh,

34
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.050
so it, it didn't work out. I,

35
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.320
I joined a special program that was called the 18 x-ray program,

36
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:11.780
where they take you in off the street and they actually give you a shot at

37
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:16.520
becoming a special forces soldier. Uh, so you train harder and special platoons.

38
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:19.820
You go further. And I ended up breaking my legs, uh, basically.

39
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:23.150
So they put me out on the legs discharge, uh, yeah,

40
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.600
it was basically what it was. They were shin splints, uh,

41
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:30.950
that I was too dumb to get off of. Right. And so I kept marching underweight,

42
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:35.570
and I'm a pretty light guy to begin with. I had a 24 inch waist, uh, when I, uh,

43
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.510
when I joined the army, girls are jealous. Um, I w yeah,

44
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.120
I think I weighed like 128 pounds. Uh, I got,

45
00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:46.130
I was in great shape, you know, in bootcamp.

46
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.710
Cause I came up really quick because it was, uh, you know,

47
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.450
all I could do is gain. Um, but, uh, it was,

48
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:58.340
it was just too much on my frame because I wasn't that active. Um, and so, uh,

49
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.210
when keep running on a stress injury, right.

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.730
And you're running underweight with like rucksacks and things like that,

51
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.370
you're running in like boots. Um,

52
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.550
and then you're doing a exercise in the army is like a whole chapter in the

53
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.980
book. Uh, you, you got your battle buddy, right?

54
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.390
Cause they never allow you to be alone.

55
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.320
You always got to have somebody watching you. Uh,

56
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.830
they thought it was funny to put me the smallest guy in the platoon that the

57
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:22.300
drill sergeants did, uh,

58
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.960
with the biggest dude in the platoon who was like an amateur bodybuilders, like,

59
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:30.310
you know, 230 or 260, something like that. He was a big fellow. Uh,

60
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.700
and so, you know, he would, uh, when we're off in the woods doing these,

61
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:34.960
these marches and things like that,

62
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.930
and we have to practice buddy carries like the Fireman's carry and things like

63
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:40.510
that. He throws me around his neck, you know,

64
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:43.150
I'm like a towel he's just skipping down. Like it's nothing.

65
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.560
And then I gotta put him on me and I'm just like, oh God dying. And it was,

66
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.810
it was, it, it was weirdly fun. I enjoyed it. Uh,

67
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.450
but it was no good for my body. And so in a land navigation movement,

68
00:03:55.451 --> 00:04:00.190
I stepped off a log. Uh, cause I was on point and on the other side of the log,

69
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:03.610
because it's the woods and George on it, sand hill, um,

70
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.670
I see a snake. Uh, and so in my, my memory, you know,

71
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.440
it's like time slows down because in North Carolina, you know where I grew up,

72
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.900
you think all snakes are poisonous. Okay. That's fine. Sorry. There's an issue.

73
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.570
No, we're good. We're good. It's completely fine. No, we're.

74
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.830
<v 1>Fine. I just, there was something that happened on the screen.</v>

75
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.480
I wanted to make sure it was okay now that's just joining the chat.

76
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.990
That's what I was worried about. There's a second image opened up here.

77
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 2>Yeah. So anyway, I try to take a much longer step in air.</v>

78
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:40.230
I land badly. Um, and it's,

79
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:44.490
it's just one leg is like fire. I'm limping, I'm limping and flipping. Uh,

80
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.580
but you know, everybody says, don't go to sick call cause you go to sick call,

81
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.260
you'll lose your slot. You'll end up general infantry or regular infantry. Uh,

82
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.520
and so I go back, um, I just tough it out. Uh,

83
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.570
I get my rack in the next morning when I get out of the rack, which is the,

84
00:04:59.571 --> 00:05:03.630
the top bunk bed. Right. Um, I jumped up and my legs,

85
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.270
they just give out underneath me. Uh,

86
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.460
and I try to get up in and I just can't get up.

87
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.300
And so I go to sick call and I ended up going to the hospital and they ended up

88
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.820
x-ray on me. And they also x-ray my battle buddy,

89
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:18.660
because I got to go there with somebody else. And he has a broken hip, uh,

90
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.660
where they had to bring him to surgery. And it's in the book. Uh,

91
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.710
there's a lot more detail about it as kind of a dramatic moment. Um, but for me,

92
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:29.550
they just said I had bilateral tibial fractures, right. All the way up my legs.

93
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.510
Uh, they said I had spiderwebs and the next, uh,

94
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.680
free phase of the training was jump school. Right. Uh,

95
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.220
whereas you gotta jump out of a plane and the doctor, you know, is like,

96
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.360
son, if you jump on those legs,

97
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.240
they're going to turn into powder and he's like, I can hold you back. Um,

98
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.590
you know, we can put you for like six months, you stay off them.

99
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.830
Then you can go back through, uh, through the cycle,

100
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.170
Ryan start basic from scratch. Uh,

101
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.370
but you'll lose your slot in the special forces pipeline. Um,

102
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.070
and because of the way these things are scheduled and everything like that,

103
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.170
and then you'll basically be reassigned to the needs of the army or, um,

104
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.660
which probably meant I was going back to it,

105
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:19.270
which was what I joined the army to kind of escape. Um, uh,

106
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.660
or you can go out on this special kind of discharge,

107
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:24.670
that's called an administrative discharge, right.

108
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.390
Normally got a honorable discharge, dishonorable discharge, things like that.

109
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.370
This is something for people who've been in for,

110
00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:35.170
I think less than six months where it's like a knowing a marriage uh it's

111
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.350
as if it never happened it's as if you never joined. Um,

112
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.520
and at the time I was like, well, you know, that's very kind of him, uh,

113
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.380
to do that. Uh, and I took it, you know, they, they sent me to sit call, uh,

114
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:49.360
or sort of the sick bay, uh,

115
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.030
where you're in like the medical platoon and you do nothing for,

116
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.450
uh, it was, I think, about a month. Um, and then,

117
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.410
then they let you out once the paperwork all finishes. Uh, but in hindsight, uh,

118
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:06.190
I realized that if you take it administrative discharge, uh,

119
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.570
it exempts the army for liability for your injuries.

120
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.870
So actually what I thought was a kindness, uh, was just, you know,

121
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:16.770
now if I had future problems with my legs, uh, they,

122
00:07:16.771 --> 00:07:19.270
they wouldn't have to cover it or health insurance and any of those things.

123
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.850
And it was, it was just a funny thing, but anyway, I get yeah.

124
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.170
Out of the army and here, uh, yeah,

125
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.150
I'm on crutches for a long time and just sort of trying to figure out all

126
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.140
right, well, what's next in life. Um,

127
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.630
because gotten, uh, basic security clearance, uh, just for going through,

128
00:07:39.631 --> 00:07:42.030
signing up for the military process, uh,

129
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.870
I applied for a security guard position, uh,

130
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.730
the university of Maryland,

131
00:07:47.731 --> 00:07:50.070
because it said you had to get a top secret clearance,

132
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:54.150
which has put a higher clearance than I had at the time. Um, and I went, well,

133
00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:57.900
that sounds good. Cause I knew if I combine my it skills, uh,

134
00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:01.680
which for now suddenly much more relevant again to my future with a top secret

135
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:04.260
security clearance because of the way it works. Uh,

136
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.930
if you have a top secret security clearance and tech skills,

137
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:10.680
you get paid a ridiculous amount of money for doing very little work.

138
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.540
So it was like, all right, well, you know,

139
00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:16.680
I can basically make twice what I would be making in the private sector, uh,

140
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:18.690
working for government at this level, at this space,

141
00:08:18.691 --> 00:08:22.830
because what we talked about earlier with September 11th and how the

142
00:08:22.831 --> 00:08:24.690
intelligence community change, uh,

143
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.740
they no longer cared that I hadn't graduated from college. Right.

144
00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:31.560
And I had gotten a GED just by going in and taking a test.

145
00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:35.700
So for government purposes, it was the same as if I was a high school graduate.

146
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.260
Um, so now suddenly it was like these, these doors are open. Uh,

147
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:42.600
now this university of Maryland, uh,

148
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.430
facility turned out to be an NSA, uh, facility.

149
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.710
Uh, it was called a castle, the center for the advanced study of language, uh,

150
00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.980
at the university of Maryland college park. Um,

151
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.180
and all I was was literally a security guy walking around with,

152
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:03.540
with a walkie-talkie making sure nobody breaks in at night, uh,

153
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.380
managing the electronic alarm system and things like that. Uh,

154
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.860
but once I had my foot in the door there,

155
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:15.710
I could start climbing ladder step by step. Um, and, uh,

156
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.000
I applied four or I went to a job fair actually,

157
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.200
that was only for people who had security clearances. Uh,

158
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.080
and I ended up going to the table for one of the technical companies.

159
00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:30.800
It was a little tiny subcontractor nobody's ever heard of it. Um,

160
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.340
and they said, uh, you know, we,

161
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.820
I've got tons of positions for somebody like you, uh, are you comfortable, uh,

162
00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:39.620
working nights? And I was like, yeah, you know,

163
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:44.450
I wake up in the middle of the day anyway. Um, that's fine. Yeah. With me. Uh,

164
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.880
and suddenly I've gone from,

165
00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:51.740
from working for the NSA through a university in a weird

166
00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:53.570
way where it's like the NSA holds the clearance,

167
00:09:53.571 --> 00:09:57.620
but I'm formally an employee of the state of Maryland at the college.

168
00:09:57.621 --> 00:09:58.550
And this is government man.

169
00:09:58.551 --> 00:10:02.600
It's all these weird Dodges and boondoggles for how people are employed there.

170
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.770
Now, suddenly I'm working at CIA headquarters, right?

171
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.120
The place where all the movies show you swoop over the marble seal and

172
00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:14.210
everything like that. Uh, I'm the king of the castle, right?

173
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.210
I'm there at the middle of the night when no one else is there. Uh,

174
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.080
the lights are on motion sensors. It's the creepiest thing in the world.

175
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.360
There's like flags on the wall that are just like gently billowing in the air

176
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:31.010
conditioning, like ghosts, uh, the hallway lights up as you walk alongside it,

177
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.900
cause it's like a green building and they disappear behind you. Uh, and there's,

178
00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:36.621
there's no one there.

179
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:41.030
I can go down to the gym at like two o'clock in the morning at the CIA.

180
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:41.690
Uh,

181
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:44.900
and it's like not see a soul on the other side of the building and then go all

182
00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:49.100
the way back. Um, and this kind of thing was,

183
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:52.400
was my end because they were like, look, it's the night shift. Uh,

184
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.010
nothing that bad is gonna happen. Um,

185
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.940
but it was on a very senior technical team, um,

186
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.890
that was basically handling systems administration for everybody in, uh,

187
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.010
the Washington metropolitan area. Right? So every, um,

188
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.970
basically CIA server, uh,

189
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.290
this is a computer system that like data is stored on the reporting is stored on

190
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.860
the, uh, traffic has moved on all of this. Uh,

191
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.750
suddenly me,

192
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:27.080
this is a circa 2005, I think. Um,

193
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.200
I'm in charge of, uh, and it's just me and one other guy on the night shift.

194
00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:37.490
And if you're interested in the book, there's a lot of detail on this. Uh,

195
00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.300
but I get sort of scouted from this position because they realize I actually

196
00:11:41.301 --> 00:11:42.650
know a lot about technology.

197
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:47.540
They were expecting me just to basically make sure the building doesn't burn

198
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:50.480
down all these systems. Uh don't uh,

199
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.180
go down overnight and then never come back up. Um, but they go, well,

200
00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.040
are you willing to go overseas? And to a young man at that age,

201
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:02.260
that's actually like, Hey, that sounds kind of exciting, you know,

202
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:05.950
who doesn't want to go work overseas for the CIA. Um,

203
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.810
and there's a lot of people, uh, listening to the podcast who are like, uh,

204
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.840
not me. Um, um, was there like, wait, the CIA's the bad guys,

205
00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:17.160
right? Yeah, exactly. They're like,

206
00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:18.840
what are you going to go overthrow the government somewhere?

207
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.610
But you have to understand that I'm still very much a true believer of the

208
00:12:23.611 --> 00:12:28.140
government is like the living compressed embodiment of truth and goodness and

209
00:12:28.141 --> 00:12:30.390
light, you know, the shining city on the hill.

210
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.620
So I want to do my part to spread that to the world. Um,

211
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.600
I didn't have skepticism is really what I'm trying to establish here.

212
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.160
Uh, and so I sign up and I go through this special training school,

213
00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:47.280
like people hear in movies about the farm, uh,

214
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.320
which is down at camp Pirie in Virginia. Uh,

215
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.850
I'm sent to this actually much more secret facility, um,

216
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.740
called the hill, uh, which isn't more int in Virginia. Um, and,

217
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.470
uh, this is, uh, Ben covered a few times in open source media. Uh,

218
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.860
but I think this is one of the few, uh, book-length, uh,

219
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.400
discussions of what happens there and, uh, permanent record.

220
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.590
Um, but, uh, yeah, so I go through training and then I get assigned, uh,

221
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:20.460
overseas and I ended up in Geneva, Switzerland, undercover as a diplomat. Right.

222
00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:22.620
I think, um, uh, uh, my,

223
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:26.070
my formal title for the embassy is like something super bland,

224
00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.980
like diplomatic attache. Um,

225
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.440
and what I am is I'm a forward deployed tech guy.

226
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.360
They send you through the school to make you into kind of a MacGyver, right? Uh,

227
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:40.980
yes, you can handle all the computers, uh, but you can also handle, um,

228
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:45.870
the connections, uh, for the embassies power systems, right? Uh, the actual, uh,

229
00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:49.980
electric grid connections. You can handle the HVAC systems, right?

230
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.750
You can handle, uh, locks and alarms and security systems, uh,

231
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.750
basically anything that's got an on button on it, uh,

232
00:13:57.751 --> 00:14:02.700
at the embassy that's secure now, you're responsible for, and I traveled from,

233
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.080
uh, Geneva to other countries, uh, in, in Europe, um,

234
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.950
for sort of assignments. And it was like, it was an exciting time. Um,

235
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.430
I actually still enjoyed it,

236
00:14:14.431 --> 00:14:19.320
but this was where I first working with intelligence, uh, started to get doubts.

237
00:14:19.321 --> 00:14:22.600
And the story's been told many times, so I, I won't go over in, in,

238
00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:24.840
in full detail here. Um,

239
00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.050
but the CIA does primarily, and it's not the only thing they do.

240
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.560
Uh, what's called human intelligence. Um,

241
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.310
now there are many different types of intelligence. Uh,

242
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.640
the intelligence community is responsible for, um,

243
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:46.500
the primary ones are human intelligence and signals intelligence.

244
00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:51.060
You want to think of signals intelligence, right? As tapping lines,

245
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.210
hacking computers, um,

246
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:57.080
all of these sort of things that provide electronic information,

247
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:01.160
anything that's a digital or analog signal, uh, that can be intercepted,

248
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.580
then turned into information. Human intelligence is, you know,

249
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:08.030
all that fun stuff. We've heard that the CIA doing for, for, uh,

250
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.080
decades and decades, uh, which is where they try to turn people. Um,

251
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.040
basically they say, look, we'll give you money if you sell out your country, um,

252
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:20.210
they don't, it's not even your country. A lot of times it's your, uh,

253
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.260
like organization.

254
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:24.490
These guys could be working for a telecommunications provider, um,

255
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:26.900
and they want to sell customer records or they work at a bank,

256
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.770
which was the thing that I saw and we wanted records on the bank's customers.

257
00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:34.540
So we wanted a guy on the inside. Um, but anyway, uh,

258
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.220
that that's sort of how it works.

259
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.390
And what I saw was they were way more aggressive, uh,

260
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:45.070
for the lowest stakes than was reasonable or

261
00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:49.540
responsible. They were totally willing to destroy somebody's life. Uh,

262
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.980
just on the off of chance,

263
00:15:50.981 --> 00:15:54.460
they would get some information that it wouldn't even be a tremendously

264
00:15:54.461 --> 00:15:58.240
valuable. And so, you know, ethically that, that struck me,

265
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.700
um, as a bit off, but I let it pass, um,

266
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.350
because what I, what I've learned over my life, um,

267
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.590
short though, it's, and, you know, uh,

268
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.150
it's is that skepticism is something that needs to build up over time.

269
00:16:16.151 --> 00:16:18.850
It's a skill, uh, something that needs to be practiced,

270
00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:22.720
or you can think of it as, uh, something that you developed through exposure,

271
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.320
right? Kind of like, uh, uh, radiation poisoning, but in a positive way.

272
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.420
Uh it's when you start to realize inconsistencies,

273
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.760
uh, or hypocrisy, uh, ward lies, um,

274
00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.310
and you notice them and, you know,

275
00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:42.790
you give somebody the better for the doubt or a you trust them,

276
00:16:42.791 --> 00:16:45.850
or you think it's all right, but then over time you see it,

277
00:16:45.851 --> 00:16:48.640
it's not an isolated instance. It's a pattern behavior.

278
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.470
And over time that exposure to inconsistency builds and builds and

279
00:16:53.471 --> 00:16:58.030
builds until it's something that you can no longer ignore. Now, after the CIA,

280
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.400
I went to the NSA in Japan, where I was working there in Tokyo.

281
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.020
And then from there a couple of years later, I went to, um,

282
00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:13.510
the CIA again. Uh, now I was working as private employee for Dell, uh,

283
00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:18.040
but I was the senior technical official on, uh, Dell's sales accounts, the CIA,

284
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.310
you know, people, these big companies, they have sales accounts to the CIA.

285
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.140
And so this means I'm going in,

286
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:26.200
and now it's crazy because I'm still a very young man,

287
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.670
but I'm sitting across the table from chiefs of these enormous CIA divisions.

288
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:35.560
I'm sitting across from their chief technology officer for the entire agency or

289
00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:39.700
the chief intelligence or a chief information officer for the entire CIA.

290
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:44.020
Um, and these guys are going, look, here's a problem. Here's what we want to do.

291
00:17:44.021 --> 00:17:47.950
And it's my job to pitch them a system, right. And I've got,

292
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.330
I'm paired up with the guy. And the whole thing is just go,

293
00:17:51.331 --> 00:17:55.800
how much money can we get out of the government? Right? That's the whole goal.

294
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.460
And we'll build them. What we were pitching was a private cloud system, right?

295
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:02.070
Everybody knows about, uh, cloud computing. Now.

296
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:05.070
It's like why your g-mail account is available wherever you go.

297
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:09.870
It's why Facebook has this massive system of records for everyone everywhere.

298
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:11.640
Uh, the government wanted to have this,

299
00:18:11.641 --> 00:18:16.500
these kinds of capabilities to Dell ended up getting beat out by Amazon people.

300
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.930
Some people aren't familiar with as many of them are,

301
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:22.770
but Amazon runs a secret cloud, uh,

302
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.090
system for the government. I forget what they've rebranded it now,

303
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.040
but this is just the,

304
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.030
there's this massive connection between industry and government and the

305
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:36.510
classified space that just goes deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper. Uh,

306
00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.660
but at this point, uh, I, I was already,

307
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:44.250
I had misgivings because of what I'd seen in Japan about government,

308
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:47.610
but I was just trying to get by.

309
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.850
I was trying to ignore, uh, the conflicts.

310
00:18:50.851 --> 00:18:53.790
I was trying to ignore the inconsistencies.

311
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.540
And I think this is a state that a lot of people, uh,

312
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.550
in these large institutions, uh, not just in our country, but around the world,

313
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.760
uh, struggle with every day, right? They got a job they're going to family,

314
00:19:05.761 --> 00:19:09.120
they got bills that they're just trying to get by.

315
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:13.050
And they know that some of the things they're doing are not good things.

316
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.870
They know some of the things they're doing are actively wrong,

317
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.650
but they know what happens to people who rock the boat

318
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.150
eventually. Um, I changed my mind

319
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:33.810
and when I had gone to Hawaii, which was the final position,

320
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.080
uh, in my career with the intelligence community, um,

321
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.270
I was because of an accident of history here.

322
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.560
I wasn't supposed to be in this position at all. Um, I was supposed to be at a,

323
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:52.880
a group called the national threat operations center and talk,

324
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.200
uh, but because of the way contracting works, and again,

325
00:19:57.201 --> 00:20:00.110
this is covered in the book. Um,

326
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:07.100
I ended up being reassigned to this little rinky dink office, uh,

327
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:12.020
that nobody's ever heard of in Hawaii called the office of information sharing.

328
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.790
And I'm replacing, uh, this old timer. Who's, who's about to retire really,

329
00:20:16.791 --> 00:20:18.830
really nice guy. Um,

330
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.540
but he spent most of his days just reading novels and doing nothing and

331
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:27.680
letting people be content to the fact or letting people forget that his office

332
00:20:27.681 --> 00:20:31.370
existed because he was the only one in it. Uh, there's,

333
00:20:31.371 --> 00:20:35.150
there's a manager who's like over him, but it's actually over a larger group.

334
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.310
And he just looks over him as a sort of a favor.

335
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.440
So now I come in and now I'm the sole employee of the office of information

336
00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:45.440
sharing, but I'm not close enough to retirement, uh,

337
00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:48.610
that I'm okay with just nothing at all.

338
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.400
So I get ambitious and I come up with this idea for a new system called the

339
00:20:54.401 --> 00:20:59.290
heartbeat. And what the heartbeat is going to do is,

340
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:00.573
uh,

341
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.170
connect to basically every information repository

342
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.410
in the intelligence community, both at the NSA and across at work boundaries,

343
00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:12.000
which you normally can't cross,

344
00:21:12.001 --> 00:21:14.700
but because I've worked at both the CIA and the NSA,

345
00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:16.770
I knew the network well enough,

346
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.520
both sides of its sides that a normal orcas at the NSA would never have seen

347
00:21:20.521 --> 00:21:21.870
because you have to be in one or the other.

348
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:23.880
I can actually connect these together.

349
00:21:23.881 --> 00:21:27.600
I could build bridges across this kind of, uh, networks,

350
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:33.030
um, and then draw all of these, uh, uh,

351
00:21:33.031 --> 00:21:36.540
records into a new kind of system, uh,

352
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.130
that was supposed to look at your digital ID. Uh, basically your,

353
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.800
uh, your sort of ID card that says, this is who I am. I work for this agency.

354
00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:50.880
I work in this office. Uh, these are my assignments. These are my, uh,

355
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.770
group affiliations. And because of that, the system would be able to, uh,

356
00:21:55.830 --> 00:22:00.450
eventually aggregate records that were relevant to your job, uh,

357
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.610
that were related to, and then it could provide them.

358
00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:05.130
And basically you could hit this site. It would be, uh,

359
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:09.810
an update of what we used to call rewards, uh, which were manually, uh,

360
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.300
created. There we go, look, uh,

361
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.020
you work in a network defense, right?

362
00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:19.020
These are all the things that are happening on network defense. You work on,

363
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:22.620
I don't know, economic takeovers in Guatemala. You know,

364
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.490
if this is what's going on for you. Uh,

365
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.530
but in my off time, um, I helped the team that sat next to me,

366
00:22:31.531 --> 00:22:34.710
which was a systems administration team for four windows networks,

367
00:22:34.711 --> 00:22:38.400
because I had been a Microsoft certified systems engineer, uh,

368
00:22:38.401 --> 00:22:43.260
which means basically I knew how to take care of windows networks. Um,

369
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.640
and this was all those guys did. And they always had way too much work way,

370
00:22:47.641 --> 00:22:51.750
too much work. And I had basically no work that I needed to do at all.

371
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:56.850
Um, because, uh, all I was supposed to do was share information, uh,

372
00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.020
which was not, uh, something that was particularly, um,

373
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.270
in demand, uh,

374
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.910
because most people already knew what they wanted or what they needed.

375
00:23:05.911 --> 00:23:09.870
So it was basically my job was to sit there and collect a paycheck unless I

376
00:23:09.871 --> 00:23:10.860
wanted to get him vicious.

377
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.210
And so I did some side gigs for these other guys,

378
00:23:15.211 --> 00:23:19.890
and one of them was running what were called dirty ones, word searches. Uh,

379
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.500
now dirty word searches are, well, let me,

380
00:23:25.501 --> 00:23:28.380
let me dial this back. Cause I know we're, uh, sort of,

381
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.050
this is hard to track

382
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:37.020
everything that the NSA does, uh,

383
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.660
in large part is classified.

384
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.090
Everything the CIA does in large part is classified. Um,

385
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.990
if I made lunch plans with other people in my office, it was classified.

386
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.760
That was the policy it's dumb. Uh,

387
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:58.070
this over classification problem is one of the central flaws in government

388
00:23:58.071 --> 00:24:00.290
right now. And this is the reason we don't understand what they're doing.

389
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:01.970
This is why they can get a long way.

390
00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.140
This is why they can get away with breaking the law or violating our rights for

391
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:10.310
so long, you know, five years, 10 years, 15, 50 years, uh,

392
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:13.130
before they see before we see what they were doing.

393
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.120
And it's because of this routine classification, right?

394
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:22.360
But every system computer system has a limit, uh,

395
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:26.380
on what level of classified information is supposed to be stored on it.

396
00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:31.330
And we've got all these complicated systems for codewords and caveats,

397
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.090
uh, that established a system of what's called compartmentation.

398
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.060
And this is the idea when you work at the CIA, when you work at the NSA,

399
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:45.100
you're not supposed to know what's happening in the office next to you, right.

400
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Um, because you don't have need to know right, again, that thing from the,

401
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:51.130
the movie. Um,

402
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:55.270
and then the reason they have this is they don't want one person to be able to

403
00:24:55.271 --> 00:24:59.560
go and know everything right. And tell everybody everything. Um,

404
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.690
they don't want anybody to know too much,

405
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.850
particularly when they're doing lots of bad things,

406
00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.870
because then there's the risk that you realize they're doing so many bad things

407
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.440
that it's past the point that we can justify, right.

408
00:25:11.441 --> 00:25:14.980
And they might develop sort of an ideological objection to that.

409
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.510
Well, well in the office of information sharing, uh,

410
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.270
and actually in basically every part of my career,

411
00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:26.260
before that I had access to everything. Um,

412
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:32.080
I had a, what was called a special caveat on my accesses, uh,

413
00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:33.190
called [inaudible], which means privileged access. Uh,

414
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
 what this means is you're

415
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
 kind of super user, you know, most people have all of these controls and the 

416
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
kind of information that

417
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
 can access, but I'm in charge of the system, right? People who need information, they have to get it from somewhere. They don't know even the director of the CIA right 

418
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
now

419
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
. He says, I need to know everything about this. Well, he doesn't know where to get it. He's just a manager. Somebody has to be able to actually cross these thresholds 

420
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
and get those things. That guy was me. And so dirty word searches are these 

421
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.190
kinds

422
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.023
 of automated queries that I would set up to go across the whole network and look at all of the different levels of classification and compartmentation and exceptionally controlled information.

423
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.830
That's kind of, you can think of it as above top secret, uh,

424
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.630
in these special compartments, right.

425
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:22.750
Where you're not even supposed to know what these compartments are for.

426
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.530
You only know the code word, uh, unless you work in them,

427
00:26:26.531 --> 00:26:30.550
unless you have access to them. Unless you're read into them one day,

428
00:26:30.551 --> 00:26:35.410
I got a hit on the dirty word search for a program that I'd never

429
00:26:35.411 --> 00:26:40.060
heard of called stellar wind. Uh, it came back, uh,

430
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.740
because the, um, the,

431
00:26:43.741 --> 00:26:48.540
a little caveat for there they're called handling caveats, which is like,

432
00:26:48.541 --> 00:26:52.170
you know, you can think of like burn after reading or for your eyes only. Uh,

433
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.680
but this one's called S T L w which means stellar wind. And unless, you know,

434
00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:57.390
what stellar wind is, you don't know how to handle it.

435
00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.540
All I knew was it wasn't supposed to be on my system. Anyway,

436
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:04.290
this is a little bit unusual and it turned out, uh,

437
00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.160
this document was placed on the system because one of the employees who had

438
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:11.520
worked on this program years before had come to Hawaii,

439
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.660
and this person was a lawyer, uh, I believe, uh,

440
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:18.570
and they had worked in the inspector General's office and they had compiled a

441
00:27:18.571 --> 00:27:22.320
report part of the inspector General's report,

442
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:26.490
which is when the government is investigating itself, um,

443
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.190
into, uh, the operations and activities of this program.

444
00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.001
Well,

445
00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:37.260
this was the domestic mass surveillance program that I talked about in the very

446
00:27:37.261 --> 00:27:41.370
beginning of our conversation that started under the Bush white house. Um,

447
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.600
stellar wind, uh, was no longer supposed to be really an operation.

448
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.940
Um, it had been, uh,

449
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:53.130
unveiled and a big scandal in December, 2005 and the New York times,

450
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.540
uh, by journalist James Ryzen. Uh, and I, I,

451
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.520
I'm not going to name them because I don't want to get wrong.

452
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.610
Another journalist. You can look at the byline now,

453
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:06.720
if you want to see their involvement. But, uh, and there's,

454
00:28:06.721 --> 00:28:11.220
there's a lot of history here too. But, um, what they had found was, uh,

455
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.270
of course, uh,

456
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.530
the Bush white house had constructed a warrantless wiretapping program.

457
00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:18.840
If you remember the warrantless wiretapping scandal, uh,

458
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:22.740
there was affecting everyone in the United States. Um, well,

459
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:27.000
the Bush white house, uh, was

460
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.530
really put in a difficult position by the scandal. Um,

461
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.340
they would have lost the election over this scandal because the New York times

462
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:38.640
actually had, uh, this story, uh,

463
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.150
in October, 2004, uh, which was the election year. They were,

464
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:45.690
they were ready to go, um, with it. Uh,

465
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.320
but at the specific request of the white house, uh,

466
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:53.610
talking to the publisher of the New York times, uh, Sulzberger and, um,

467
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:57.120
bill Keller, then the executive editor of the New York times, uh,

468
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:02.040
the New York times said we won't run the story because,

469
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.870
uh, the president just said, if you run this story a month before the election,

470
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:11.400
that's very tight margin. If you recall, um, you'll have blood on your hands.

471
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.870
And it was so close in 2001, uh, the New York times just went, you know what,

472
00:29:15.871 --> 00:29:19.740
fine Americans don't need to know, uh,

473
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:23.100
that the constitution is being violated. They don't need to know, uh,

474
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:28.710
that the fourth amendment doesn't mean what they think it means. Uh,

475
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.390
if the government says it's all right,

476
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:33.960
and it's a secret and you shouldn't know about it, that's fine. Now,

477
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.270
December, 2005, why did that change?

478
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.030
Why did the New York times suddenly run this story? Well,

479
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:41.290
it's because James Ryzen, uh,

480
00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:46.120
the reporter who found this story had written a book and he was about to publish

481
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:46.840
this book.

482
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.320
And the New York times was about to be in a very uncomfortable position of

483
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:55.270
having to explain why they didn't run this story and how they got

484
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:58.180
scooped by their own journalists. And so they finally did it,

485
00:29:58.181 --> 00:29:59.800
but it was too late. Bush had been reelected,

486
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:03.700
and now it was sweeping up the broken glass, uh, of our last rights.

487
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.980
So Congress, uh, the Bush white house was very effective in,

488
00:30:08.981 --> 00:30:10.000
as I said before,

489
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.410
telling a very few select members of Congress that this program existed.

490
00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.880
And they told them this program existed in ways that they wouldn't object to,

491
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:24.190
but made them culpable for hiding the existence from the program, uh,

492
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.230
the existence of the program from the American people.

493
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:28.810
And this is why someone like Nancy Pelosi, uh,

494
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.440
who you wouldn't exactly think would be buddy buddy with George Bush was

495
00:30:32.441 --> 00:30:36.250
completely okay in defending this kind of program. In fact, and you know,

496
00:30:36.251 --> 00:30:37.390
later she said, oh, well,

497
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:41.020
she had objections to the program that she wrote in a letter to the white house,

498
00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:43.690
but she never showed us the letter. She went, oh, well, that was,

499
00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.330
that was classified. Right. Um,

500
00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:49.360
and this is not to bag on her individually. It's just,

501
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:52.300
she's a great example in here. And no named example,

502
00:30:52.301 --> 00:30:54.700
everyone knows of how this process works.

503
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.210
The white house will implicate certain,

504
00:30:58.211 --> 00:31:01.480
very powerful members of Congress in their own criminal activity.

505
00:31:01.481 --> 00:31:04.810
And so when the, when then when the white house gets in trouble for it,

506
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:08.590
the Congress has to uncover for the white house. Uh,

507
00:31:08.591 --> 00:31:13.300
and so what happened was Congress passed an emergency law

508
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.310
in, uh, 2007 called the protect America act,

509
00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.100
which should have been our first indication.

510
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:24.850
This is a very bad thing because they never name a law, something like that,

511
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:26.110
unless it's something terrible.

512
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:31.240
And what it did was it retroactively immunized

513
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:36.420
all of the phone companies in the United States that had been breaking the

514
00:31:36.421 --> 00:31:40.620
law millions times a day, uh,

515
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.860
by handing your records over to the government,

516
00:31:43.861 --> 00:31:45.870
which they weren't allowed to do, uh,

517
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:50.220
simply on the basis of a letter from the president saying, please do this. Uh,

518
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.620
and these companies went, look,

519
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:55.920
now that we've been uncovered now that we've been shown that we're breaking,

520
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.780
or now that, uh,

521
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.910
these journalists have shown that we've broken the law and violated the rights

522
00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:07.470
of Americans and a staggering scale that could bankrupt our companies,

523
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.150
because we can be sued for this.

524
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.550
We will no longer cooperate with you unless you pass a law that says

525
00:32:14.551 --> 00:32:18.930
people can't Sue us for having done this. And so we get the protect America act,

526
00:32:18.931 --> 00:32:23.160
which says, you know, it was an emergency. Yeah, this is all public history too.

527
00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:28.320
You can look this up on Wikipedia, you know? Um, and so then, uh,

528
00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.360
uh, they, um, they go, it's an emergency law.

529
00:32:33.361 --> 00:32:34.440
We have to pass this.

530
00:32:34.441 --> 00:32:38.250
Now we have to keep this program active Bush is going to end the warrantless

531
00:32:38.251 --> 00:32:42.200
wiretapping program and continue it under this new authority where it's going to

532
00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:46.550
have some special level of oversight and these kinds of things eventually.

533
00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:51.080
But for now, we just have to make sure people are safe. Again, they go to fear.

534
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.190
They say, if we don't have this program, terrorist attacks, uh, will continue.

535
00:32:55.191 --> 00:32:58.130
You know, people will die, uh, blood on your hands, blood on your hands,

536
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.270
bloating, your hands thinks the children protect America,

537
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:05.600
act passes. Uh, the companies get off the hook.

538
00:33:05.601 --> 00:33:08.180
The Bush white house gets off the hook, the Congress, uh,

539
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:11.660
that was then sharing in, uh, criminal culpability for, uh,

540
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:16.130
authorizing or rather letting these things go by without stopping them,

541
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:19.370
uh, then passes in 2008. Uh,

542
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:24.170
the foreign intelligence surveillance act amendments of

543
00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:27.920
2008. Uh, this is called the, the, uh, FAA, uh,

544
00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:29.630
Pfizer amendments act of 2008.

545
00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.570
And rather than stopping all of the unlawful and, uh,

546
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:40.250
sort of, uh, unconstitutional activities that the intelligence agency was doing,

547
00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.400
they continued it in different ways simply by creating a few

548
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:51.080
legal hump hoops for them to jump through. Uh, now this is not as good as say,

549
00:33:51.081 --> 00:33:52.850
you know, these things aren't helpful at all.

550
00:33:52.851 --> 00:33:55.040
It's not to say they're not useful at all. Uh,

551
00:33:55.430 --> 00:34:00.020
but it's important to understand when the government's response to any scandal

552
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:04.250
and this applies to any country is not to, uh,

553
00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.910
make the activities of the person who was caught breaking the law,

554
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:09.260
comply with the law,

555
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.600
but instead make the activities of the person who is breaking the law, uh,

556
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.740
legal, right?

557
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:20.660
They make the law comply with what the agencies want to do rather than make the

558
00:34:20.661 --> 00:34:25.370
agencies comply with the law. That's a problem. And that's what happened here.

559
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.990
Now. Uh,

560
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:31.760
the intelligence community's powers actually grew in response to this

561
00:34:31.761 --> 00:34:33.350
scandal in 2008,

562
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:36.350
because Congress was on the hook and they just wanted to move on and get this

563
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.780
over with. There were objections.

564
00:34:38.781 --> 00:34:41.660
There were people who knew this was a bad idea, but it didn't passed on.

565
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:46.430
Now what the public took away from this, because a part of these laws, uh,

566
00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.540
was a requirement that the inspector general, uh,

567
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:54.350
of all of these different intelligence community elements and the director of

568
00:34:54.351 --> 00:34:59.090
national intelligence submit a report saying, uh,

569
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.190
this is what happened under that warrantless wiretapping program. Uh,

570
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:08.240
this is how it complied with the law or how it didn't comply with the law. Uh,

571
00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:12.830
and basically look back at how this program was

572
00:35:12.831 --> 00:35:17.810
constituted, what it did, what the impacts and effects were, uh,

573
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:22.520
and that was supposed to be sort of the truth and reconciliation council right

574
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.650
now. Why am I talking about all this ancient history? Well,

575
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.250
I'm sitting here in 2012, uh,

576
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:35.810
with a classified inspector General's report draft report from the NSA, uh,

577
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:40.350
that names, uh, that says, uh, Dick Cheney,

578
00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:41.490
this is David Addington.

579
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:43.860
This is Nancy Pelosi that says all of these people who are involved in the

580
00:35:43.861 --> 00:35:48.570
program, the tech talk of how it happens. It says the director of the NSA,

581
00:35:48.571 --> 00:35:50.470
that guy who was evacuating the building, uh,

582
00:35:50.471 --> 00:35:54.660
at the beginning of our podcast here, um,

583
00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.220
that guy was asked by the president of the United States,

584
00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.330
if he would continue this program after being told

585
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.660
by the white house and the department of justice, uh,

586
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.900
that these programs were not lawful, that they were not constitutional.

587
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.490
And the president said,

588
00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:16.590
would you continue this program on my say

589
00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:20.880
so alone, uh, knowing that it's risky, uh, knowing that it's unlawful.

590
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.640
And he said, yes, sir, I will, if you think that's,

591
00:36:23.641 --> 00:36:28.380
what's necessary to keep the country safe. Uh, and at that moment, I realize

592
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.440
these guys don't care about the law.

593
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.120
These guys don't care about the constitution.

594
00:36:33.121 --> 00:36:34.770
These guys don't care about the American people.

595
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.250
They care about the continuity of government. They care about the state, right?

596
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.170
And this is something that people have lost. Uh,

597
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.490
we hear this phrase over and over again, national security, national security,

598
00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:48.990
national security, and we're meant to interpret that to mean public safety,

599
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.770
but national security is a very different thing from public safety.

600
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:56.940
National security is a thing that in previous generations we refer to as state

601
00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:57.803
security,

602
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:02.280
national security was a kind of term that came out of the Bush administration,

603
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:08.400
um, to run cover for the fact that we were elevating a new kind of secret police

604
00:37:08.401 --> 00:37:10.380
across the country. Um,

605
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:15.840
and what does it mean? Uh, when, uh, again,

606
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.450
in a democracy in the United States,

607
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.750
the public is not partner to government. Uh,

608
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.330
the public does not hold the leash of government anymore,

609
00:37:24.331 --> 00:37:26.550
but we are subject to government, right? Uh,

610
00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:31.440
we are subordinate to government and we're not even allowed to know that it

611
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:34.380
happened now. Now in, in the book,

612
00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.390
I tell the fact that I had access to the unclassified version

613
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:41.370
of this report back in Japan.

614
00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.570
And what's interesting is the unclassified version of a report.

615
00:37:45.571 --> 00:37:49.290
And we've all seen this today with things like the Mueller report and all of the

616
00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:52.350
intelligence reporting has happened in the last several years when the

617
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:55.890
government, uh, provides a classified report to the public,

618
00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.750
it's normally the same document,

619
00:37:57.751 --> 00:38:00.870
the unclassified version of the classified version of the same thing,

620
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.400
just the unclassified version has things blacked out or redacted that they say,

621
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.190
oh, you're not allowed to know this sentence or this paragraph or this page or

622
00:38:08.191 --> 00:38:09.024
whatever.

623
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:14.340
The document that the public had been given about the

624
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:16.950
warrantless wiretapping program, um,

625
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.160
was a completely different document.

626
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:25.590
It was a document tailor made to deceive and mislead the

627
00:38:25.591 --> 00:38:29.700
Congress and the public of the United States. Uh,

628
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.810
and it was effective in doing that. And in 2012, what I realized was

629
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.960
this is what real world conspiracies look like. Right? Um,

630
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.420
it doesn't have to be, uh, smoking men behind closed doors,

631
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:49.540
right? It's lawyers and politicians,

632
00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.940
it's ordinary people from the working level to the management level, uh, who go,

633
00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.440
if we don't explain this in a certain way,

634
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.190
we're all gonna lose our jobs, uh,

635
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.240
or the other way they go, we're, we're going to get something out of this.

636
00:39:07.241 --> 00:39:08.290
If we all work together,

637
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.110
civilization is the history of conspiracy, right? What is civilization,

638
00:39:14.111 --> 00:39:18.310
but a conspiracy for all, all of us to do better by working together. Right.

639
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:24.010
Um, but it's this kind of thing, uh, that I think too often,

640
00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:28.150
we forget because it's boring as hell. I want all your listeners, right.

641
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.450
Not to go to the Washington post because this document that I discovered that

642
00:39:31.451 --> 00:39:35.710
that really changed me, uh, has been published courtesy of the Washington post.

643
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.330
Uh, it's called the inspector General's report on stellar wind. Um,

644
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:44.620
and you can look at the actual document that I saw that was, uh, unredacted,

645
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:47.860
right. I had no blacked out pages on mine. Um,

646
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.010
and what I believe it shows, uh,

647
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.250
is that some of the most senior officials in the United States elected and

648
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:58.990
unelected, uh,

649
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:04.420
worked together to actively undermine the rights of the American

650
00:40:04.421 --> 00:40:09.160
people, uh, to give themselves, uh, expanded powers,

651
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.490
uh, now in their defense, uh,

652
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.600
they said they were seeking these powers for good and just a noble cause. Right?

653
00:40:16.601 --> 00:40:21.250
They say they were trying to keep us safe, but that's what they always say.

654
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:22.570
That's what every government says.

655
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:25.390
That's no different than what the Chinese government says or the Russian

656
00:40:25.391 --> 00:40:29.680
government says. Um, and the question is,

657
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.230
if they are truly keeping us safe,

658
00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.450
why wouldn't they simply just tell us that, well,

659
00:40:36.451 --> 00:40:38.830
why wouldn't they have that debate in Congress?

660
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.430
Why wouldn't they put that to a vote? Because if they were,

661
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.160
and they could convince us that they were, um,

662
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.050
they'd win the vote. Uh, and particularly we all know,

663
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:53.590
like the Patriot act passed one of the worst pieces of legislation in modern

664
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:55.930
history past, um,

665
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.950
why didn't we get a vote? And I think if you read the report,

666
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.400
the answer would be clear. So I'm, I'm sorry, Joe. I went on.

667
00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.430
<v 1>No, it was amazing. It's act don't, don't apologize at all.</v>

668
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:11.840
It's just completely fascinating that the continuation of this

669
00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.250
policy came down to one man, and the president having this discussion.

670
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.310
That is so.

671
00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.830
<v 2>It's, it's much, it's much, much.</v>

672
00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:26.180
<v 1>More, much more, but right, right. Literally the president at the heart of it.</v>

673
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:26.720
Yes.
