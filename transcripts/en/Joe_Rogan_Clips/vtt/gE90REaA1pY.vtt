<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.300
Been in some hairy situation on cliffs where storms rolled in blacked out and

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.210
just had to hunker down in like a cave. Right. And just wait it out.

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:13.320
But nothing, nothing horrible. Um, your kidney stone was bad,

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.600
but really like some of the things you'd think that would happen.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.450
If I die back there, it's probably going to be from a bear and pregnant,

7
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.250
fall off a cliff. Like that's the one thing.

8
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.790
<v 1>That I would, I would guess what happened. Yeah. That's how, uh,</v>

9
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.420
Cam's buddy Roy died. Yeah. What's she hunt areas.

10
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.240
<v 0>That's uh, that, that one, there is probably worse than any,</v>

11
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.850
the chances of having a bury you is so slim,

12
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:36.110
but lightening and cliffs are probably the worst ones. Yeah.

13
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.790
<v 1>Lightening is another scary one. Huh. But that's a normal experience out there.</v>

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.020
There's lightning storms.

15
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.680
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.370
And in that one area that soccer to Christos is a mountain range and it's, uh,

17
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.150
like scientifically worse there because of the heat from the ground and the cold

18
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:52.670
from above the lightning storms there.

19
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.770
When we go down there and just to photograph, what.

20
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.650
<v 1>Do you do if you're in a lightning storm, do you get near trees?</v>

21
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.750
Because if you get near trees, what if the trees get hit?

22
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.830
<v 0>I'm going to give you horrible advice. I don't do. I just get my tent. And my.</v>

23
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.780
<v 1>So when there's a lightning storm,</v>

24
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:07.730
you just lay in your tent and hope it doesn't hit you.

25
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.320
<v 0>Oh wow. The reality of it is, is as they blow over,</v>

26
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.610
you may be causing, and I'm not an expert at this. It's just, I have the,

27
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.320
if it's my time, it's my time.

28
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:22.070
So I just get in and I listened to an audio book and pretend it's not there.

29
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.020
And that, that is probably horrible advice. But the reality is my, my buddy. Um.

30
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.150
<v 1>What audio book would you listen to when you're almost dying from a lightning</v>

31
00:01:32.151 --> 00:01:36.470
storm? The Crow killer, Jeremiah Johnson. Um, you getting serious mountain man.

32
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.770
Yeah.

33
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.130
<v 0>Yeah. I'd listed that one helps me go to sleep. That dude, uh, voice, uh,</v>

34
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.540
is what helps me go to sleep. So, but my buddy, um, what's that,

35
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.170
I don't know if I can say his name, he's on an OTA team. Him and his buddy,

36
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.980
this guys get hit with lightning in,

37
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.760
in a spot where we killed a bull and he texts me and he said something about

38
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:59.510
this reminded me of, I think he got hit with an RPG or something. And I'm like,

39
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:01.820
well, dude, are you good? Like,

40
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.700
that's a hell of a buildup to a story with no finish. Right?

41
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.620
He's got scars where the lightning came out of it's. Oh no,

42
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.570
it that's where it entered.

43
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:12.310
And then it blew the front of his or his buddy's shoe out. What's,

44
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.423
they hiked out.

45
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.550
<v 1>Hit him in the back and blew his buddy's shoe off.</v>

46
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.150
<v 0>Cause they hit them both at the same time.</v>

47
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.500
And so I would guess they were probably more trained than I was and whatever

48
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.210
they did didn't work so anymore.

49
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.080
Frank and I just hunker down and I listened to an audio book. Remi.

50
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.900
<v 1>Warren got hit with lightning in high school if I remember correctly.</v>

51
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.790
And I think he lost a sense of smell. No. Yeah. Something wacky like that.

52
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.120
I remember.

53
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.360
<v 0>That movie with, uh, what was it that big? The big dude,</v>

54
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.110
the actor where the guy gets hit lightening. He's like six times. And he's like,

55
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.670
oh, you've been hit with lightning six times.

56
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.500
<v 2>He's like, no 66 times. You remember that, John candy. Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.150
Yeah. The great outdoors.

58
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.910
<v 1>Well, there's a guy that has been hit like a record number of times is one.</v>

59
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.460
See if you find that there's one, dude, that for whatever reason,

60
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.250
they don't know. They don't, they don't understand it,

61
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:02.170
but he's been hit by lightning multiple times.

62
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.330
It's not because he's looking for it. Like he's, uh,

63
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.020
he's particularly attractive to lightning for some strange reason.

64
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.000
I think I'm particularly attracted how many times? Seven times. Good guy.

65
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.480
Ranger park ranger. Yeah. Come up man.

66
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.970
So Roy Cleveland Sullivan,

67
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.590
he died in 1983 United States park ranger in Shenandoah national park in

68
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:23.951
Virginia,

69
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.840
between 1942 and 1977 Sullivan was hit by lightning on seven different

70
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.600
occasions and survived all of them. I would,

71
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.250
I would go home and talk to my wife. See if she puts, that reminds me of that.

72
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.880
<v 0>Saying I have, if it was raining, you get hit the head with a Dick.</v>

73
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.130
That guy is bad. Yeah. That is.

74
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.380
<v 1>Often times. It's crazy. That doesn't even make sense.</v>

75
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.040
<v 0>Yeah. I just, I don't, uh, I just don't worry about it though anymore.</v>

76
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.720
We'll just say Jamie, this one.

77
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.140
<v 3>Says 10 times tat OD.</v>

78
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.480
<v 1>And then the guys I'll show you 10 times put a metal hat on.</v>

79
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.100
Yeah. I.

80
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.190
<v 0>Think though you get desensitized to different things.</v>

81
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:06.000
And lightening is definitely one where I just kind of hang out in a tent and.

82
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.570
<v 1>It cooks see from the inside out, like being in a microwave, he says, man,</v>

83
00:04:09.571 --> 00:04:12.120
61 survives being struck by lightning 10 times,

84
00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:17.070
Melvin Roberts made headlines in 2011 for being hit six times in one year,

85
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.500
wife said he's been struck another four times,

86
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:23.040
South Carolina man suffered memory loss, headaches, speech problems.

87
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.920
And as nerve damage in his hands and leg. Like I don't, I don't,

88
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.480
I'm so confused. I don't understand why it keeps hitting him.

89
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.150
Let me see what that guy looks like. No,

90
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.570
it looks like you guys have been hit by lightning 10 times.

91
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.770
<v 0>Yeah, because usually it'll blow the, into your toes off. Really? Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.963
It where it exits.

93
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.770
<v 1>Little lightning strike is made up of several 100 million volts.</v>

94
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.230
What the man?

95
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.940
<v 0>Yeah. We've been on, uh, enlightening strikes where they hit trees close by.</v>

96
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.150
It just blows them up into pit shrapnel. It's pretty wild.

97
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.600
<v 1>How's it not kill people. Yeah. That's where it exited the toe.</v>

98
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.490
Oh Jesus Christ nerve damage in his leg and foot as a result of the lightning

99
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.324
strikes.

100
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.390
<v 0>Hmm. That might change your uh.</v>

101
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.280
<v 1>Because Roy Sullivan is the current world record holder and then he, uh,</v>

102
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.200
he was hit seven times together. We're talking about,

103
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.390
he died in 1983 by his own hand. Oh no, that's not good. Yeah.

104
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.990
You gotta wonder like what's left after you've been hit seven times.

105
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.270
Like your must be scrambled.

106
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.900
<v 0>I don't know man. But those are the things that'll probably get you, you know,</v>

107
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.370
like talking about, you know,

108
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.520
bears is like the last thing I worry about light lightening. So it's a,

109
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.630
that's a real problem.

110
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.890
<v 1>W w is there a way to get it to hit something else?</v>

111
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.310
Like if you're in your tent, would it hit the 10 and not you?

112
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:45.600
Or would it just go right through the tent?

113
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.750
<v 0>I think he'd go through the tent and I saw it hit an old growth tree once and</v>

114
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:51.570
blow 180 foot tall tree into pieces. And I'm like, oh,

115
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.720
that did not look appealing. You know, it happened. Yeah.

116
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:58.350
And that's not uncommon either. Um, when you, when you, cause you get,

117
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.070
if you have service, you can see where it's going. Right. Like the,

118
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:03.480
the one that passed two years ago, I knew Frank was flocking.

119
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.610
Cause he was going by me,

120
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.420
literally 400 yards and I'm watching cloud to ground and I'm like, wow,

121
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.690
texting Frank. I'm like, dude, buckle your up. It's coming.

122
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.950
And it went right in front of me and over Frank and you know, Frank so funny,

123
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.930
he literally called me. He was like, I'm okay, sir.

124
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.680
<v 2>And I'm like, how'd it go? He was like, that was not cool. And.</v>

125
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.710
<v 0>He had video of it striking, you know, all around him. But the thing,</v>

126
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.740
like he said is where's he going to go? Cause he's just running into a storm.

127
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:29.140
Right. You're not going to outrun. What.

128
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.450
<v 1>Do you do? What are you supposed to do? Are you supposed.</v>

129
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.270
<v 0>To go mostly getting into depression and hunker down.</v>

130
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.600
<v 1>Is what you're supposed to like some sort of a valley. Yeah.</v>

131
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:38.290
I was reading through.

132
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:39.760
<v 3>A Roy Sullivan's Wikipedia.</v>

133
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.030
It says he got struck two other times once when he was a kid,

134
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.700
but it didn't hurt him. So he didn't claim it.

135
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.170
And then another time his wife got struck while he was helping her with the

136
00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:52.690
clothes, but he didn't get hurt at that time either.

137
00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:54.190
So I guess he didn't claim that time.

138
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.670
<v 1>Well, is he a alien? Like why,</v>

139
00:06:56.671 --> 00:06:59.290
why would one guy get hit so many times read what.

140
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.250
<v 3>It, why it says,</v>

141
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:02.860
but like it does there's no reasoning why or anything like that.

142
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.680
<v 1>Weird. Like what,</v>

143
00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:08.410
what about a person's biological makeup would be so different that lightening

144
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:10.360
would be attracted to them? I don't.

145
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.950
<v 0>Know. He's got some serious static electricity. The thing is like with, um,</v>

146
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.880
you know, the more you're out there, epic happens. Well,

147
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.170
I guess you might not consider it epic, but I mean the more he's a park ranger.

148
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.720
Right? That's what I mean. Like you're out there and then you, you know,

149
00:07:25.721 --> 00:07:27.640
you think about how much time I'm out there. Crazy.

150
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.070
going to happen if you're in the woods a lot. I mean there's no.

151
00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:34.300
Well the Wolverine, it's a one in a billion chance for that to happen. I mean,

152
00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:37.510
that's literally, but the more you're out there it's going to happen.

153
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.100
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
