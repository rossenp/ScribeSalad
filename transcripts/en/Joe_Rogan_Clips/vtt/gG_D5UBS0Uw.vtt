00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.880
<v 1>Yeah. Just say yes. Make me feel good. Yeah, I wouldn't, yeah.</v>

3
00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:07.714
I can't recall anyone.

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.200
<v 2>Definitely the first with a purple and blue.</v>

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.360
<v 1>Oh, well it' a full rainbow man. Oh, oh.</v>

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.080
<v 2>Yeah. It's right. All the way down the back. Oh, very, very nice. Absolutely.</v>

7
00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.680
Very nice. Now I, first of all, I love your handle.

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.150
&lt;laugh&gt; world strong was gay. That's me. That that's hilarious. Does,

9
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.630
is there in that community? Is there acceptance? Is there open?

10
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.070
Is it just about like,

11
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.750
they don't give a just as long as you're a real strongman.

12
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.350
<v 1>Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, no. It's um, yeah, when I came out it was super cool. Uh,</v>

13
00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:39.390
nobody really gave me any. Um, that's the best part about strongman, you know,

14
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:43.300
I know you had Rob OB in here. Yeah. Not too long ago. And he even mentioned,

15
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.420
yeah know, he's something, but &lt;laugh&gt;, I love him. Um, you know,

16
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:49.580
he mentioned just like the community of, of strong men,

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.540
so is awesome because like,

18
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:53.820
we all realize what we have to do to get to this level of sport.

19
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.340
And we all have to be a little bit of, you know,

20
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:58.580
sick and twisted in the head to look at a truck and get excited to pull it

21
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.610
&lt;laugh&gt;. Um, so yeah, when I came out, like nobody really gave a.

22
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.690
They were just like, all right. As long as you can still lift weights,

23
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:06.090
we don't care. Yeah. That's.

24
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.170
<v 2>Uh, it mirrors the comedy community in that way. For sure.</v>

25
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.810
Like stand up comedy community. Nobody gives a. No.

26
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.930
<v 1>As long as you're funny and you're doing your job,</v>

27
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.730
like that's all they really matters. And.

28
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.970
<v 2>We know some that are in the closet and we're like, come on, man.</v>

29
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.320
Just no one cares come out. No one, no one gives a. It'll.

30
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.440
<v 1>Probably be funnier. Right.</v>

31
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.320
<v 2>It's the more subject matter for.</v>

32
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.320
<v 1>Sure. You know, not holding onto as much. It's easier to talk. Like, you know,</v>

33
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:34.160
when I came out, just like, you know, the, you know,

34
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.880
weight off my shoulders was, uh, was unbelievable.

35
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.840
<v 2>What, how long ago was this? Uh.</v>

36
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.480
<v 1>That was 2014. So I was 22 years old. Oh, okay. Yeah. So I am,</v>

37
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.350
I was a late bloomer in the gay world. Was it.

38
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.190
<v 2>Like when you were in high school and like when, first of all, when,</v>

39
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.070
when do you know?

40
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.950
<v 1>You know, I don't know that I, like, I don't remember,</v>

41
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:57.710
like I never had like an aha moment per se. Um,

42
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.150
for me it was going through high school.

43
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.270
Like I was involved in a bunch of stuff, you know,

44
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:06.020
it was a cheer or actually also played football, um,

45
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.340
was doing the weightlifting thing, like was class president.

46
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.220
So had my hands in a bunch of different pots, college,

47
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.580
super into everything as well. Um,

48
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.700
and really just focused on school and actually dated a girl for like a year and

49
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:22.020
a half in college. In college. Yeah. Um, did.

50
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.330
<v 2>You ever date a boy? No. So, but did you like, oh. I wish she was a boy.</v>

51
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.450
I mean, she's cool, but &lt;laugh&gt;.

52
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.490
<v 1>It was, yeah, pretty much, you know, it was, uh, it was,</v>

53
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.570
it was more like a friendship than a relationship, I guess is the way to put it.

54
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.530
No, you know, like we were cool and everything and everything was going well,

55
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.130
but like nothing else was really going on when.

56
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.040
<v 2>You came out, was she like, aha.</v>

57
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.440
<v 1>Uh, that I, that was the reason I broke up with her. Oh, you came out because,</v>

58
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:51.120
you know, meanwhile, you know, I'm dating this girl,

59
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:54.440
but I'm watching gay porn when she's not around. I'm like, uh, this isn't right.

60
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.560
There's something else going on here. So.

61
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.680
<v 2>Did you like, was it gay porn, like finding gay porn? You're like,</v>

62
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.840
that's what I like.

63
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.240
<v 1>Pretty much really. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

64
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.320
<v 2>Gay porn is thought of very differently than straight porn because like straight</v>

65
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.920
porn there, here's the rub in the straight community. You look at straight porn.

66
00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:18.830
You're like, ah, especially someone like me who has daughters see.

67
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.790
Somebody probably did something awful to those girls when they were young.

68
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.270
Like that's like nine out of 10 times. Yeah. Like,

69
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.310
and that's why they turned to porn. But when you see gay porn, it's like, ah,

70
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.550
a couple dudes like to. &lt;laugh&gt; pretty.

71
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.390
<v 1>Much &lt;laugh&gt;. It's.</v>

72
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.110
<v 2>Like, even like I' had Dan Savage on and you know,</v>

73
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:38.950
we were talking about gay porn. He is like, it',

74
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.980
they don't think of it the same way. No, not at all.

75
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.820
<v 1>No. Um, yeah, so I, I ended up breaking up with that girl. Um, and I told her,</v>

76
00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:50.300
I was like, yeah, like, I think I'm gay and I need to like, figure this out.

77
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.780
You know, I'm 22. I wanna at least enjoy my twenties. You know,

78
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:57.300
trying to figure out if I, if I like dudes or not, was she.

79
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.260
<v 2>Like, I turned Rob gay. Uh.</v>

80
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.250
<v 1>She was not very nice about it. &lt;laugh&gt; well, she won. She freak out. Really?</v>

81
00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:08.610
Yeah. It didn't, it went downhill pretty quickly after. Oh really? So, oh yeah.

82
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.490
Like we were living together at the time. Like we were,

83
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.730
cause we were in college, so like, um,

84
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.810
like kind of living together and then like I got kicked out and

85
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.920
was like living in my car for a little while. So it was yeah. Kind of a show.

86
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.400
<v 2>Wow. She kicked you out. Yeah. Wow. She didn't even &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

87
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.033
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

88
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.760
<v 2>Did you stay in contact with her? No, not even.</v>

89
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.360
<v 1>A little bit. Wow. Uh, yeah. Then like, you know,</v>

90
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.160
like six months later she's like blowing up my phone saying I gave her

91
00:04:37.161 --> 00:04:41.590
chlamydia. I was like, uh it's doesn't not on me months. Not on me.

92
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:46.510
That's it's been longer than that too, since we were doing anything. So, oh,

93
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:47.344
that's hilarious.

94
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.470
<v 2>Yeah. I don't think you keep chlamydia in your system dormant. Right? I wouldn'.</v>

95
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.030
When you get.

96
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.990
<v 1>It, you get it&lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

97
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.310
<v 2>I think so. I've, I've dodged that bullet luckily,</v>

98
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.550
but that seems like one that I think you just get it and then it's bad.

99
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.940
<v 1>Yeah. It doesn't seem to pleasant.</v>

100
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.460
<v 2>I mean, I don't think it, and.</v>

101
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.200
<v 1>That was awkward too.</v>

102
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.700
Cuz like all those like calls and everything were coming through when I was with

103
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.740
my now husband, Joey.

104
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.020
So like we were dating at that time and now my exgirlfriend is blowing to my

105
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.260
phone saying I gave her the clap, but was he laughing

106
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.650
at first? He was what the is going on?

107
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.250
Cause like we literally had been dating for two months. Oh.

108
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.570
So it was like super new. So he is like, what the did I get myself into? Right.

109
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.490
<v 2>Because you were a new to the whole new world. Totally. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

110
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:36.130
So that's crazy. So you, you become, you decide, okay. I,

111
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.650
I gotta deal with reality. I'm gay. Yep. You meet that one guy. Yeah.

112
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:41.970
And then you're still with him.

113
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.400
<v 1>Still married. Yeah. With him. We just got married this past March.</v>

114
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.000
That almost been a year. That's.

115
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.680
<v 2>Kind of crazy. Yeah. Like you didn't even play the field just.</v>

116
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.120
<v 1>No, no, I got real, you know, it's funny. Like I joke about this all the time.</v>

117
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.480
Cuz like we met in like the typical millennial gay way on Grindr &lt;laugh&gt; um,

118
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.640
and you know, I was, I wasn't even out actually before we met.

119
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.480
So like on Grindr, I was like that shirtless torso pick. Oh. Cause I was still,

120
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:11.440
you know, good move. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously. And he was sure goods &lt;laugh&gt; no,

121
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:16.440
they not that good. But he thought they were so, um, so we, he, like he knows,

122
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.710
saw me pop up in the area and was like, oh who's this messaged me.

123
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.150
And I thought he was catfishing me.

124
00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:25.190
Cause I thought he was way too hot for me thought he was outta my league. Um,

125
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.870
so I kind of just like got really lucky with the first guy that came my way.

126
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.230
<v 2>That's um, that's gotta be weird for her, right? Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.133
Like God,

128
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.740
imagine a girl you're with a guy &lt;laugh&gt; and you're like, man,

129
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:42.540
something is wrong with our relationship.

130
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.860
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I mean, it's literally like the most like,</v>

131
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.780
like it's there's no more other like it's me it's you or no it's it's not you

132
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:52.100
it's me. Right? Um.

133
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.340
<v 2>No that, that is the, it's not.</v>

134
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.220
<v 1>You. I don't think there's anywhere to go, you know, higher than.</v>

135
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 2>That. Well, unless you want to go pray the gay away that doesn't work.</v>

136
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.770
No. But is it, that is like a way that some people try to fix it,

137
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:11.650
you know, particularly like Uber, religious folks. Yeah. It is hilarious, man.

138
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.250
<v 1>I think it's fricking funny. I mean, you know, like, and I, I get a lot of,</v>

139
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.320
I mean obviously like with an Instagram handle world, strongest gay,

140
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.160
I get more on a daily basis on social media than I can even count. Um,

141
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.080
and most of it's from like religious people really? Oh yeah.

142
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.520
Like they're sending me like VI Bible verses and like telling me like I need to

143
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:31.920
convert to Christianity and.

144
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.120
<v 2>Probably the way they're probably jerking off while they're doing it.</v>

145
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.040
Probably probably thinking about you, my, you need to, you need to stop it,

146
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.150
stop being so okay. And delicious.

147
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.990
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; my, uh, my go-to response is, you know, Hey man, I don't read fiction.</v>

148
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.510
So you keep doing that. Um, but I just always think it's funny because you know,

149
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.630
they're like, you know, gay PE like,

150
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.950
obviously I'm very open about my sexuality on social media and you know,

151
00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:57.870
world strongest man has been super supportive of it.

152
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.500
They had roll strongest man in June during pride month this year and did a

153
00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:04.940
whole, like little expose about me, which was awesome. And uh,

154
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.260
the comments on the world, strongest man, they're like,

155
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.820
you're pushing the gay agenda, like all this. And I'm like, listen,

156
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.180
man' like the only agenda we're pushing is like,

157
00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:16.060
I just wanna be treated like everybody else. And like get the same that you do.

158
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.290
You know, I've never once like tried to make someone, you know, like,

159
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:24.850
meanwhile Christians are in my DM saying like, you need to convert. I'm like,

160
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.530
Hey, you need to suck a Dick. Like, ah, that's.

161
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.850
<v 2>The gay agenda is a hilarious phrase, but there's an agenda.</v>

162
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:34.730
<v 1>I still don't even know what it is. So whoever's listening.</v>

163
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.210
If you could like hit me up and let me know, I'd love to learn about it. Yeah.

164
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.760
<v 2>You need to get in a tighterknit club. I guess I do.</v>

165
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.920
<v 1>The gay agenda. I guess the rainbow mahawk doesn't make me that gay.</v>

166
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:44.880
If I i'unno know.

167
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.680
<v 2>What is, what a hilarious thing that like, you're gonna,</v>

168
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.640
it's not like you're trying to get someone to be a Mormon. No,

169
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.520
you're the gay or you're not gay. Exactly. Yeah. Why do,

170
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.800
but why does someone think that's like,

171
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.640
that's the weirdest kind of homophobiaic to me, like I,

172
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.200
I had a bit in one of my, uh, specials in the past. What?

173
00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:04.640
Like there's two types of people that are afraid of gay marriage is that people

174
00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:09.080
that are really dumb or they're secretly worri that are delicious. And I.

175
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.480
<v 1>I share that &lt;laugh&gt; all the time on my social media, just so you know,</v>

176
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.880
I think it's amazing.

177
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.190
<v 2>But that's what it is like worried about the gay agenda.</v>

178
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.150
Like they're gonna come get me. No,

179
00:09:19.151 --> 00:09:22.270
they're gonna get me to suck those delicious. &lt;laugh&gt; that's what it's like.

180
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.270
It's like, they're afraid. It's unbelievable.

181
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.190
<v 1>I think it's hysterical to, to be honest, it is hysterical.</v>

182
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.270
<v 2>But, well, I was real lucky when I was a kid.</v>

183
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:34.710
I was exposed to gay people real young when I was, uh, seven years old,

184
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:36.660
we moved to San Francisco super. Oh yeah. Super. Yeah.

185
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:38.340
In the 19 supernineteen seventies, it was gay as.

186
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.020
And so I was around 'em all the time.

187
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.900
Like my next door neighbor was this gay couple and my aunt used to go next door

188
00:09:43.901 --> 00:09:47.460
and they would get, they would get naked smoke pot and play bongos together.

189
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.380
Sick. Yeah. It was pretty crazy. &lt;laugh&gt; so for me that was normal life.

190
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.540
I was just like gay. I was around gay people.

191
00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:00.610
I didn't even hear the term until I was 11. And we moved to Florida.

192
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.770
I remember hearing that when I was 11, like, oh wow. Like I had a, my friend,

193
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.250
um, his name was, um,

194
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.890
candy candiddido he's a Cuban kid. And his dad was real mad.

195
00:10:11.891 --> 00:10:13.890
Cause gay people getting married, he was reading this newspaper.

196
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.240
Can't believe this throws his new paper down. And he was a grown man.

197
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.280
I remember being 11 goes, why is he giving a? Like how weird literally.

198
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.040
<v 1>Doesn't affect him at all at all. But he.</v>

199
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.280
<v 2>Was so upset. Yeah. But it's a, but, but it was important for me to see,</v>

200
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.920
because I didn't know people like that.

201
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.440
So to be around my friend's dad and see him freak out like that, I was like, oh,

202
00:10:34.441 --> 00:10:37.430
what a weird thing to waste your time thinking about for sure.

203
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.310
<v 1>I mean that's and you were super lucky to have that kind of upbringing. Yeah.</v>

204
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:44.670
You not see that ugly part of, you know, the world. Cause I mean,

205
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:45.504
the thing is with me, you know,

206
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.430
I'm fortunate enough where like not many people like talk to me in person.

207
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.990
Right. You know, like I'm, I'm an average size strong man.

208
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:52.430
Like I'm not really that big of a dude.

209
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.870
<v 2>What's the average size drama. You like 300 pounds. And I'm.</v>

210
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.790
<v 1>The smallest guy that I.</v>

211
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.660
<v 2>How, how much do you weigh?</v>

212
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.620
<v 1>Uh, I'm like 2 85 right now. Yeah.</v>

213
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.420
<v 2>That's not average size bro. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

214
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.140
<v 1>Well, I mean, I just competed this weekend against Brian Shaw. The four 20.</v>

215
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.940
Yeah. That's you know, and six foot eight I'm five 10, like, Hey man. Cool. Um,

216
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.340
you know, so like I'm fortunate. Like most people don't talk to me personally.

217
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:16.340
It's like all on social media,

218
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.770
but it did happen one time in Texas of all places I had just finished a truck

219
00:11:20.771 --> 00:11:23.850
pull event. Uh, and this guy was like, call me a from the stands,

220
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.410
like all this stuff. And like, I just stopped to look and I was like, dude,

221
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.330
I suck Dick. And I'm stronger than you. Ah,

222
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.450
and the whole crowd just kind of like went quiet and then he walked away.

223
00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:33.284
They just went quiet.

224
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.120
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

225
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.970
<v 1>They didn't like, you know, I, I think like in that situation, like I,</v>

226
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.120
I feel like people feel like they're invincible.

227
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.320
Like they feel like they have the power because they're in the crowd. Yeah.

228
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:43.761
And like,

229
00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:47.400
they don't expect like somebody like who's competing to like say something back

230
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:50.120
to 'em. Right. But like, I'm not gonna ha like need to take that.

231
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.560
<v 2>It's amazing. It's only when one guy though, yeah.</v>

232
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.440
That shows you how the times are changing for sure.

233
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:00.280
<v 1>No, and I, yeah, it's in, you know, luckily like, you know,</v>

234
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:03.160
I was dubbed like the unofficial fan favorite at world's strongest man this

235
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:05.760
year. So it's really cool to see the support throughout the entire community.

236
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.200
How.

237
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.080
<v 2>Do you get dubbed the unofficial fan favorite? Really? Who I.</v>

238
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.000
<v 1>Was getting like the loudest applause whenever my night name got announced.</v>

239
00:12:12.001 --> 00:12:15.070
And really, so the announcers just kind of were calling me the fan favorite.

240
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.003
That's cool.

241
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:20.950
<v 2>It, I I'm happy with the way things are going with acceptance.</v>

242
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.630
Totally.

243
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.030
<v 1>It's changing. Right. It's getting a lot better. Um, you know,</v>

244
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.550
we're super fortunate and that's kind of like when I came out, like I'm,

245
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.510
I'm lucky because I had this, like,

246
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.380
I really don't give a mental when I came out. Um,

247
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.380
I didn't care what people thought. I didn't care who thought, you know,

248
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.180
if they didn't like me, they didn't like me. I would just cut 'em out. Um,

249
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.700
you know, fortunately I didn't have to do that. How, how.

250
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.060
<v 2>Did that transpire? Was it because the weight of it was so it was, it,</v>

251
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.660
it gave you so much relief that you felt like who gives a now, now I'm free.

252
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.220
Was it like that? There was, there was.

253
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.050
<v 1>A lot that went into it. Um, so I like, in my mind,</v>

254
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.050
I didn't like want to come out until I, I, it seems dumb now.

255
00:13:00.051 --> 00:13:03.210
Like until I knew I was really gay. Um, and I guess, you know,

256
00:13:03.211 --> 00:13:06.330
dating my now husband for six weeks, that was kind of the tipping point.

257
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.610
And at that point in our relationship, we had kind of realized like, all right,

258
00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:12.810
this wasn't just gonna be like a fling and just having fun.

259
00:13:12.811 --> 00:13:14.560
Like we were actually, you know,

260
00:13:14.561 --> 00:13:17.600
taking the steps to kind of be committed and see what was gonna happen here.

261
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.480
Not expecting marriage, but, um, so

262
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.880
I came out mainly because of him because he had,

263
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.240
he had been out since he was 17.

264
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.720
And at this point we were 22 and I didn't feel like it was fair for him to be in

265
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:34.360
a relationship with somebody that was still in the closet. Mm. Uh,

266
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.510
and that was like my biggest motivator for it.

267
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.030
<v 2>And once you, so you, so you were already happy,</v>

268
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.110
so you're in this happy relationship. So if people were upset at you,

269
00:13:45.111 --> 00:13:49.030
you're like, I don't give a. I have what I want. I'm in a better place. Yeah.

270
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:52.070
And you also, I mean, it must feel I'm putting words in your mouth,

271
00:13:52.071 --> 00:13:56.340
but it must feel like when you do become out or you do come out,

272
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.220
it must feel like a, the, not just a relief, but

273
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.860
like you're, you, you you've solidified, you're fine. You're free, you're you?

274
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.540
Yeah.

275
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.820
<v 1>I mean, it's, it's exhausting, like waking up every day,</v>

276
00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:11.660
pretending to be somebody you're not. Yeah. You know,

277
00:14:11.661 --> 00:14:14.900
like you literally have to act different than you want to. Did you.

278
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.410
<v 2>Have to talk to a, about girls to guys, like when you were around? Yeah.</v>

279
00:14:18.411 --> 00:14:20.450
Look at her boy couldn. I.

280
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.730
<v 1>I was always just like, I, the funny thing is like, after I came out,</v>

281
00:14:23.731 --> 00:14:25.930
like nobody was surprised. &lt;laugh&gt; um,

282
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:30.090
&lt;laugh&gt; so I feel like I was the guy that was just kinda like in the back around

283
00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:33.090
like awkwardly laughing when guys were talking about girls, I'm like, huh? Yeah,

284
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.520
totally. But I was just looking at the guys in bulges, like, you know,

285
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:38.200
right behind them. That's.

286
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.840
<v 2>Hilarious. Do you remember a year, like when you were young, when you were like,</v>

287
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.520
Hey, something might be different? Um.

288
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.320
<v 1>You know, I think like, I think back to like middle school, um,</v>

289
00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.880
and you know, I think it's just like the stereotypical, like I was into theater,

290
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.880
I was into music. I played sports, but wasn't really that good at them. Um,

291
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.840
and actually was a cheerleader in middle school too. Like I was, I did,

292
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.240
I joined my first cheerleading team in seventh grade. And you know,

293
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:09.440
the funny thing is, is, you know,

294
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:13.790
there was tryouts in every thing and I got the fourth highest score out of all

295
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:17.030
the girls. So I figured that was, you know,

296
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:20.350
a little telltale sign as that was sign. Yeah. Yeah.
