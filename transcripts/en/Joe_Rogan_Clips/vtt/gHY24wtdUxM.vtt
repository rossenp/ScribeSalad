00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Within sex research in particular,</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:07.980
I feel like sex research was the, the Kerry in the coal mine,

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:10.950
because we saw this coming decades ago in that one,

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.770
professor Michael Bailey at Northwestern university,

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.540
there's been a long history.

6
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:19.650
That's ugly between sex researchers and transgender activists and Michael Bailey

7
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:24.600
wrote a book. Uh, I think it was 2003 that really enraged some activist.

8
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.470
And I have to say, trans activists don't speak for all transgender people.

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:29.490
I haven't many trans people.

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.430
Who've reached out to me over the years telling me that they actually agree with

11
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:36.300
me, but I feel activists tend to be the most vocal.

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:38.190
They tend to be the most aggressive.

13
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.990
And so after researchers saw what happened to Mike, I mean, I, in the book,

14
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:45.120
I talk about the things that they did to him.

15
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:46.710
Some of them were very unethical and really,

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.960
they really tried to ruin him professionally and,

17
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.160
and his personal reputation as well. And so after that people said, well,

18
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.890
you know, I'm not touching the subject because it's just not worth it.

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
And so anyone who has tried to counter trans activist since then also face

20
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.710
really serious repercussions. So I think that's been part of it.

21
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:08.610
And I think also with a lot more broadly with this ideology that students are

22
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.370
being taught this and they graduate. They go out into the real world,

23
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.000
they get jobs. And a lot of people, even five years ago,

24
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.120
I would say dismissed a lot of this ideology, especially around gender.

25
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.160
They would say that's only an academia.

26
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.240
That is not something that's actually going to affect me in my real life.

27
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.990
But here it is now, it's it affects everybody. There's no way that you,

28
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.160
this is not affecting you.

29
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.610
I think it's just a question of how much do you pay attention to it? You know,

30
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.360
people send me messages. They tell me about when they have training at work.

31
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.360
They tell me about their kids' education. When I get the book,

32
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:41.160
I don't just talk about transitioning children.

33
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.000
I talk about the idea that gender is not a social construct.

34
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.210
It is not a spectrum. I talk about how it,

35
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.820
there is a relation between gender identity and sexual orientation,

36
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:53.700
which you're also supposed to not say apparently, um,

37
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.310
I talk about sex differences and these are all things that are considered taboo.

38
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.100
And I don't understand why I don't understand why we can't just have a

39
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.270
fact-based conversation.

40
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.930
And we're not saying that this information justifies discrimination against

41
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:10.610
people. In fact, I'm always very clear to say that it doesn't. Well.

42
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.250
<v 1>I think this is one of the reasons why you're so important because you're</v>

43
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:16.970
obviously a very intelligent kind person and you're not a hateful person.

44
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.541
And you're, you're,

45
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:22.100
you're not in any way discriminating your looking at this as a

46
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:22.701
scientist.

47
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:26.600
And you looking at this as a person who is very frustrated by the fact that you

48
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:27.740
can't discuss science,

49
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.390
particularly when it comes to really critical aspects of people's lives,

50
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.800
which is sex and gender.

51
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.050
I would love to talk to you about what you just had though,

52
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.590
when you said that there's no, not a spectrum. When it comes to gender,

53
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.500
that's a common narrative. So what do you, what do you mean by that? Like,

54
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:43.520
there's not a spectrum.

55
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.740
<v 0>So there are two genders. And so gender for 99% of us,</v>

56
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.450
our biological sex is our gender. Biological sex is determined by gametes,

57
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.680
which are either eggs or sperm. So there are no intermediate gametes.

58
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.700
So gender is either male or female. So th this,

59
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.650
I do not think invalidates the existence of intersex people or transgender

60
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:09.760
people. I think we can advocate for equal rights for those communities.

61
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:13.720
We don't have to reconceptualize what gender or sex are. And,

62
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.820
and also for intersex people in particular,

63
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:17.980
most of them want to live within the binary.

64
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.710
They want to live as either male or female. They don't want,

65
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.460
they don't want gender or sex to be collapsed into, uh,

66
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.640
a kaleidoscope or a galaxy or whatever else. I mean,

67
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.380
this is what's being published in scientific papers.

68
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:33.730
Now they refer to gender as quite literally a galaxy. So, I mean,

69
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.160
it's ridiculous.

70
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.050
<v 1>Pretty crazy, not just a spectrum,</v>

71
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:41.910
but a galaxy 250 billion types. Is that what it's like?

72
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.260
Like all the stars. That's crazy. Um, when you, when you say there's,

73
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.460
there's just two genders, first of all, that's getting enraged people, right?

74
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.400
But second of all, you will,

75
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:56.970
you can see that there are very feminine men and very masculine women.

76
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.600
And if though, if that is true, what, what accounts for that?

77
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.890
<v 0>It goes back to the prenatal environment.</v>

78
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:08.460
So I definitely don't deny that they're gender atypical people. I, as a woman,

79
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:10.980
I look very feminine, but I'm actually very gender atypical.

80
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:13.530
I've always felt more masculine. And even to this day,

81
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:17.220
I feel much more masculine than feminine, but hold on. So you feel masculine,

82
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.990
that's crazy. You would never know, oh my.

83
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.720
<v 1>God, you don't even seem remotely masculine. Like what,</v>

84
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:26.850
what determines that you are masculine?

85
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.740
<v 0>I would say, well, from a young age, I'd always been more like boys.</v>

86
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:33.810
I looked like a boy when I was younger. I've always just,

87
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:37.080
my friends were always boys and guys, and I've always felt,

88
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.860
I've just always felt more like a man. Just like you feel like a man, right?

89
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.630
I it's it's gender is one of those things in terms of how we describe it is so

90
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:46.231
personal.

91
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:49.800
And that's why I feel it's so important to focus on the evidence because without

92
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.410
that, what do you really have? So it, what, it really,

93
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.360
what it comes down to testosterone exposure in the womb. Right. But how are you,

94
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.590
how are you like a man,

95
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.560
if you see, well, how can I say this?

96
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.310
It's hard for me to not go in and digging into personal examples. Right.

97
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.740
But I would just say, I've always been more like boys,

98
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:12.540
if you look at how boys behave and how girls behave,

99
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:14.370
I've always been more like the boys.

100
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.760
<v 1>Like in like your interests. And.</v>

101
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.930
<v 0>You're in my behavior. I'm into fighting. Right.</v>

102
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:24.990
I run the martial artist when I was young, especially.

103
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.990
So I always get into fist fights with the boys and I would actually win.

104
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.600
<v 1>That's hilarious. Cause you seem very feminine to me. That's very odd.</v>

105
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.420
<v 0>They will always say that to me. Yeah, for sure.</v>

106
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.230
<v 1>So this spectrum that does exist,</v>

107
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.110
even though there are two genders, in your opinion,

108
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:44.760
a male gender and a female gender.

109
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.060
<v 0>Well, it's not, in my opinion. It's not in my opinion. It is.</v>

110
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.520
<v 1>Okay. But that, okay, scientifically, right. There's two genders,</v>

111
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.190
but this is obviously a hot button subject, right? If just there's two genders,

112
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.113
we'll get you canceled.

113
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 0>Oh, I know. I know we can talk about the nonbinary movement.</v>

114
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.100
Cause I'm actually very concerned in terms of what that movement is about.

115
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.760
And I am all for listening. I'll use whatever pronoun someone wants me to use.

116
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:11.690
I'll be respectful.

117
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.170
My issue is when people again say that this is backed by science when it isn't

118
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.080
and when we're also not talking about what it's actually about.

119
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:20.480
So for a lot of people who are identifying as non-binary,

120
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.430
I think it's coming from a place of sexism in society or homophobia.

121
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.320
So a lot of people who identify as non binary,

122
00:06:27.321 --> 00:06:29.840
especially among people who are born male,

123
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.790
they will normally come out as gay as a gay man and then decide to be non binary

124
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.350
or for people who were born female. Many of them don't,

125
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.270
they feel a lot of discomfort around their bodies,

126
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:43.700
the changes they experience being a woman.

127
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.590
They don't like the attention that they're getting.

128
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.400
They don't want to be sexualized for some of them. They get,

129
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.080
they have exposure to pornography at a young age. And they,

130
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.440
they think that that is actually what sex is going to be like.

131
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:58.880
And they think I don't want that. So how do I avoid that? Well, if I be,

132
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.690
if I become something other than a woman, I will not have to experience this.

133
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:04.940
And no one is saying to them, you know, number one pornography,

134
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:06.260
I'm definitely not. Anti-porn, you know,

135
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:10.190
I used to write for a very prominent men's magazine. So I, uh,

136
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:11.421
have no issue with that.

137
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:15.860
I just think we have to be able to have a

138
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:18.290
conversation saying, you know, if you feel different,

139
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:22.280
that doesn't mean you shouldn't be a woman or with regards to pornography it's

140
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.240
it's entertainment.

141
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:27.320
So that's not what sex is going to be like when you get there.
