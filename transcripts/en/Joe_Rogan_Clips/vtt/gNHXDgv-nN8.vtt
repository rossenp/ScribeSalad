00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 2>Well, one of the things that they say, people that have been abduct,</v>

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.440
like had Travis Walton, this guy I've seen, I've.

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.360
<v 0>Seen I've, I've watched.</v>

5
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.760
<v 1>It, his bobblehead. Yeah. I've watch it.</v>

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.640
He's very compelling in his descriptions of his, uh, encounter with these, uh,

7
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.320
beings. But one of the things that he was saying was they were talking to him,

8
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.270
but it wasn't with words. Like they, they,

9
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.790
they were communicating with him and he understood what they were saying,

10
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.910
but it wasn't, he wa they weren't saying things in a like,

11
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.030
Hey Travis, why don't you relax? Cuz we're here from planet whatever it is.

12
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.070
<v 0>The information was flowing faster because it was like, boom, right away.</v>

13
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.150
What I think you get is yes.

14
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.940
<v 1>They were, were explaining things to him in some sort of a telepathic way. Wow.</v>

15
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.620
And it was mind blowing to him.

16
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.420
And I think that that's probably the future of communication.

17
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.460
Just like you can transmit information from phone to phone.

18
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.900
Right. You can call people they're nowhere near you, but you can talk to them.

19
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.890
You can send a video to someone it's going through the air. It's just data.

20
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.730
Right. It's just information. Do.

21
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.330
<v 0>Do you think Travis and Lazar and all these guys that have</v>

22
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.850
extraordinary claim believe what

23
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.930
they are telling you? I, I don't know if, what they believe is true,

24
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:22.840
but what do you think they believe what they are telling you in a way that

25
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:25.280
they're not lying. They're telling the truth of what.

26
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.280
<v 1>They're believing. I can't tell for certain, but I believe Bobar.</v>

27
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.880
I believe what he's saying is true. I believe he's telling me now, Bob,

28
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.880
he had one moment where he was passing by a window and he said he saw

29
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:43.630
something that was small and these people were standing over it and he doesn't

30
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:45.750
know. He didn't know if it was, uh,

31
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.670
an alien or whether it was a, uh, like a, uh,

32
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.910
a, you know, some sort of a,

33
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.750
a form that they were trying like a,

34
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.550
a doll or something that's supposed to represent the size of an alien or some

35
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.140
sort of a model of an in. But he remembers,

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.580
he looked briefly through a window and he saw something small.

37
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.500
He didn't see it move around. He didn't see it talk.

38
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.820
So he doesn't know what he saw. Yeah. Because in his world, as he explained it,

39
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.380
when he was working at area area 51 site four,

40
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.260
that's where he worked. He said that it was very compartmentalized.

41
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.330
And these thing is one of the problems with them trying to figure out.

42
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.770
Now this is assuming he's telling the truth. Yeah, of course. One of the,

43
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.410
the problems they were trying to figure out was how to back engineer

44
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.010
these devices, these, these ships.

45
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.850
But the problem was they weren't allowed to communicate with other people

46
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.800
outside this very limited group of people that had access to these,

47
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.280
these vehicles and the people that were involved in the metallurgy were not

48
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:55.560
allowed to communicate with the people that were involved in, um, the, uh,

49
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.920
whatever the propulsion system was. They didn't understand what the prop,

50
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.720
they were trying to decipher these things, but he said,

51
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.200
and if you listen to the podcast that I did with him, that it didn't,

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.200
it didn't work because the scientific method requires multiple people to

53
00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:13.480
communicate and share ideas and explain, and they didn't do that.

54
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.150
You can't improve.

55
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 0>Like that. Right. You need to share idea.</v>

56
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.870
You can't do something and com everything. But.

57
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.110
<v 1>My communication with him, I, I, again,</v>

58
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.230
I don't know if he was telling me the truth, but he didn't seem deceptive.

59
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.390
And he's a brilliant guy when you, yeah.

60
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.150
<v 0>It's clear. He's clearly like borderline genius. You hear him speak.</v>

61
00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:34.070
He's very educated.

62
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.030
<v 1>And the thing, some of the things that he talked about came to fruition,</v>

63
00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:38.864
like one of the things,

64
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.460
there was a concept of this thing called element 1 15, 1 15,

65
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.060
right now that was not really proven until the two thousands or somewhere in the

66
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.300
two thousands. They,

67
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.420
they used a particle Collider and created this thing where it was a very

68
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.020
unstable, very shortlived particle.

69
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.810
But he was saying that wherever of these beings are from,

70
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.930
they have figured out a way to utilize a stable version of this element one

71
00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:08.610
15. And that's how they propel themselves.

72
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.210
The th the things that he was describing were also exactly the same

73
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:16.770
things that were experienced by commander David Frager,

74
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.850
who was a guy who was a jet pilot. I saw. Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.600
And so he experienced this thing move in that same direction, that same way,

76
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.960
where there was no visible propulsion system,

77
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.160
but they tracked this thing going from 80,000 feet above sea level to one in

78
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.160
one second. So that's the amount of time that it takes radar to, to,

79
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.320
to track this. So it might have been less than a second. Yeah.

80
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.190
This thing traveled from 80,000 feet to 1000, no time.

81
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.270
<v 0>For, to one feet. It's, it's made a thing in the, with the hand, he says,</v>

82
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.590
you measure the, the, the distance between the bone and the, you know, like, uh,

83
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.790
when you get in, you know,

84
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.030
you put your hand in it and measure the distance between your bone and the,

85
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.830
and the.

86
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.830
<v 1>Scanner. Yeah. Yes. The.</v>

87
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.940
<v 0>Scanner, there is a lot of things like this and know, like Zacharia,</v>

88
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.620
Sitchin was, you know, like there's a lot of stuff that you,

89
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.300
you can think of that,

90
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.260
how could they know that at the time, but it's man.

91
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.220
<v 1>It's well, the Zacharia HIIN stuff is interesting. Right? That's all the,</v>

92
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.380
the Sumari text. Sumari text is some fascinating stuff,

93
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:23.490
because it's all from sixth, the thousand years ago. And by the way,

94
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.450
Zacharias Hitchen, he's very controversial. There's a,

95
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.730
he's even a website called sitin is wrong, is wrong. Yeah. Dot com.

96
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.850
And it's basically scholars of, uh,

97
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:36.410
ancient Sumerian who say that his translations are completely off,

98
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.330
but even if his translations are off,

99
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:42.360
there's still a lot of really confusing stuff about ancient sum air.

100
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.600
And one of the things is their depictions of the solar system.

101
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.720
They had a depiction of the solar system 6,000 years ago

102
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.440
that shows the sun in the center.

103
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.560
And it shows all of the known planets in the outside. And they're, you know,

104
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.560
they're, they're relatively accurate in terms of.

105
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.520
<v 0>The size. Yeah. And how about the formation of the, her Tia,</v>

106
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.840
Mar Mar I don't remember which one is what, but I, the, you know,

107
00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:14.840
that's formation of the, Earth's the model that the, we, we use today.

108
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.030
Well, the scientist, the belt, like that's the, the model that, that we,

109
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.710
we used today, how did he knew that.

110
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.910
<v 1>At that time? That's, I don't know how they knew that when,</v>

111
00:06:23.911 --> 00:06:25.950
when you're saying it's earth one and earth two,

112
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.670
and what that means is that there was an,

113
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.190
an original version of earth and then earth was hit by another planet. Mm-hmm,

114
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.470
&lt;affirmative&gt; at some point in the distant, distant pass,

115
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.940
and that's what created the moon. And that's all what created the.

116
00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.700
<v 0>Asteroid belt that goes on the different direction than the rest of the, the,</v>

117
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.700
the planet. Like they, they knew that too well. There's.

118
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.660
<v 1>Also a thing called BS law and BS law measures the distance between planets</v>

119
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.540
and it's based on the mass of the planet.

120
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.700
And they figure out because the mass of the planet,

121
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.090
how far these planets are from, for on each other.

122
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.610
And one of the things that that up is the asteroid belt. I think the,

123
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.410
what I might be wrong about this, but the,

124
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.650
the distance between Mars and Jupiter is, uh,

125
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:10.170
one of the things that screws that up.

126
00:07:10.171 --> 00:07:15.170
And they think that's explained by the asteroid belt that some collision created

127
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.280
this asteroid belt and created, uh, all of the, I mean,

128
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:23.720
there's something like 900,000 known near earth objects

129
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.360
that're created by the impact of these planets.

130
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.480
<v 0>One thing I believe, and I'm sure you the same,</v>

131
00:07:30.481 --> 00:07:35.200
because you had a lot of these guys on your podcast, Graham, Randall,

132
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.950
Carson, um, John West, like it's,

133
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.470
there is clearly knowledge that we've lost. Yes. In the past,

134
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.510
like, this is for sure. Like,

135
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.430
just think about the Alex library of Alexandria. Yes, man.

136
00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:56.590
Imagine the knowledge that it wasn't there before it burned. I know. Imagine.

137
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.983
<v 1>Oh man. Imagine.</v>

138
00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.020
<v 0>That people, the, we lost like 1 million,</v>

139
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.780
like just when it burns that of knowledge, you know,

140
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.180
medicine and bot me science. It's just crazy to think of.

141
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.620
So some very often, sometime when crazy stuff happen like that,

142
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:18.940
like I just think that perhaps they have knowledge that that

143
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.050
knowledge that we lost, like, just think about the Greek fire.

144
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.010
It's a weapon that was used in the Naval battle. And it's, it's, it's really,

145
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:29.570
really known about historian. You can research.

146
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.530
They still don't know exactly how it works, but it was so destructive.

147
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.490
It was like, at that time it was like a secret weapon.

148
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.930
Like they didn't wanna share.

149
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.880
And it was known to be very efficient and Naval battle.

150
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.840
<v 1>I don't know what that is. I don't know about Greek.</v>

151
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.880
<v 0>Fire. Great fire. If you go Greek fire, you'll get it. Boom. It, it used to,</v>

152
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.280
it was used in Naval battle. So we used to troll,

153
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.040
they used to troll fire flames.

154
00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.880
And you used to people that got that, that are burning,

155
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:05.080
they still burn in the water. So they think it was made with some kinds of,

156
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:09.880
or, or, or they still don't know. They don't, they cannot recreate it.

157
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.320
And it's clearly something that a lot of historian have talked about.

158
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.950
It's called a Greek fire. It's just an example that it's clear that it's it's,

159
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.590
uh, technology that we have lost. Well.

160
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.910
<v 1>If you just look at the pyramids,</v>

161
00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.910
the pyramids are a perfect example of technology loss.

162
00:09:25.911 --> 00:09:30.070
It's almost like the best example, like the, the, those ancient civilizations,

163
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.350
almost letting everyone know, Hey,

164
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.820
there is information that we have the at so above and beyond,

165
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.380
what's expected of people from this era. Yeah.

166
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:43.060
Because if you think about people that lived 2,500 BC,

167
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.740
you don't think about someone that had the kind of proficiency to create

168
00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:50.180
something that when people don't understand,

169
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.220
it's not just that the pyramids were big,

170
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.610
but they were so perfectly designed when they put all the stones,

171
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.930
they reached the top.

172
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.730
Like if anyone was off by even a half an inch at the bottom,

173
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.010
as time went on an inch here, an inch there, by the time they got to the top,

174
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:09.010
it would be all up course. It wouldn't be perfect,

175
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.090
but the pyramids were so amazingly perfect.

176
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.370
And they were originally covered in smooth limestone,

177
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.480
a smooth polished limestone. That would probably be insane to look at.

178
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.880
If you were staring at it from a distance like this immense structure of 2

179
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.840
million, 300,000 stones, some of them cut from quarries, hundreds of miles away,

180
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.480
all perfectly aligned and put together by these people that lived

181
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.430
thousands and thousands of years ago, you.

182
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:42.870
<v 0>Know, the most color would say that they use a ramp. But if you think about it,</v>

183
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.390
like there's other scholars that would counter that by saying the,

184
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.750
the construction of that ramp need to be in an angle that it could be

185
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.510
so difficult to do that. It will challenge the constriction of the pyramid.

186
00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:57.550
You know.

187
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.300
<v 1>Again, it's like maybe they use a ramp. I don't know what they used. They have,</v>

188
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.820
we don't know. Yeah. But what,

189
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:07.060
whatever they used it's so amazingly precise.

190
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.180
Yeah. That they were able to make this 2 million,

191
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:15.340
300,000 stone structure. This still to this day, I haven't been,

192
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.330
but I have friends that have gone, like, uh, my friend,

193
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:21.570
Andrew Schultz just went, uh, Danica, Patrick, the race car driver.

194
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.610
She told me she just went people that I know that have been my friend,

195
00:11:24.611 --> 00:11:27.570
Eddie Bravo, when he went, he is like, like, you get to you're like, what the?

196
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.250
It's so big. Apparently that.

197
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.090
<v 0>It's like an awakening. Yes. That.</v>

198
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.530
<v 1>Our, our idea of what it is when you see it in a photograph looks incredible.</v>

199
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:41.280
But I guess I need to, cause I guess when you see it in person, it's just a,

200
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:46.440
like a complete reset. Like you, it recalibrates what people are capable of.

201
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.720
Cause you have to think like, man, this is, this is 4,500 years old.

202
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:52.240
Think.

203
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.880
<v 0>About Dar KU you go back. Yes.</v>

204
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.920
<v 1>Man. It's it's, Jeff's that thing.</v>

205
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.320
<v 0>Thousand years older, right? Yeah. It's like 12, 12,000 years old, you know,</v>

206
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.280
at like, like at least like how can you, how do you conceive that?

207
00:12:07.281 --> 00:12:10.640
And sometime what happened is it get, uh, you know,

208
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.440
and infected by it.

209
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.990
I priv by other civilization that passed there after that, that construction.

210
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.990
So they think they are the one that built it. I think it's is it, um,

211
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.670
PON the one that there's clearly two different technology, you see the,

212
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.590
the stone are perfectly aligned with like perfectly cut. Yeah.

213
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.180
Then you have other stone that are just on top. Like it's like a,

214
00:12:34.181 --> 00:12:35.980
but butcher's job, you know,

215
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.700
and it's clearly not the same technology,

216
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.700
the same people that built these two layers, you know, so, well.

217
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:48.540
<v 1>That was also John Anthony West concept of Egypt that there's multiple eras</v>

218
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.940
and that the, if you go deeper,

219
00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:53.340
like some of the stuff that they found when they dig deeper in the sand

220
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.050
different construction method, it looked different, different designs. And,

221
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.250
but still equally complex and fascinating. It's like,

222
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.410
there's probably many errors of human civilization and there's probably

223
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.010
been whatever it is,

224
00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:11.970
whether it's disease or some sort of a natural disaster or

225
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:16.480
something that happened as Royal impact was John Anthony war was, uh,

226
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:20.080
Randall Carson's and Graham Hancocks. Yeah. That's their theory.

227
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.760
<v 0>Is that 12,000 years ago at the end of the place, the scene era. Yes.</v>

228
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:28.640
But you almost APN is date to 3000, 3000 years old.

229
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.400
Uh, you know, for, so imagine that how many, 3000? No, no,

230
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.470
ho SAP almost almost is 3000.

231
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.230
<v 1>I think it's older than that. I think it's several hundred thousand three.</v>

232
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:42.470
<v 0>Three, 300,000, sorry. Oh yes, yes. Three, 300,000. Sorry, my English. Yeah. Oh,</v>

233
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.230
almost Sapian is 300,000 in Morocco. It just, I'm a hundred percent sure.

234
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:49.870
That's why I, I read about, uh, this kind of.

235
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.790
<v 1>Stuff. I think they think it's somewhere in that neighborhood. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

236
00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.740
<v 0>But, but, so if you take that 300, 300,000, sorry,</v>

237
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.820
300,000 time to, for an evolution, right?

238
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.060
Why would it be only in the last 12, 10,000 years that.

239
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.220
<v 1>We would, you know, invent such yeah. Invent structures.</v>

240
00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.940
<v 0>It's kind of strange. It doesn't make sense to me.</v>

241
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.380
<v 1>Well, it's also, we're so different from all the other animals.</v>

242
00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:15.060
Like we're the only animal that wear shoes.

243
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.770
We're the only animal that wears clothes.

244
00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:20.250
We're the only animal that really manipulates its environment the way we do.

245
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.450
I mean, other animals think, you know, bees make beehives and like that,

246
00:14:23.451 --> 00:14:28.370
but they don't do anything remotely interesting in comparison to what we're

247
00:14:28.371 --> 00:14:31.330
capable of doing and what we have done for thousands and thousands of years.

248
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.810
And why, you know,

249
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:37.800
one of the things that Bob Lazar said that he was when he was at area, uh,

250
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.320
S four at area 51 S four,

251
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.160
was that one of the things that they were telling him was that human beings are

252
00:14:45.161 --> 00:14:46.800
the product of accelerated evolution.

253
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:52.160
And that these creatures occasionally come back to check upon our progress and

254
00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:54.800
yeah, which is crazy. Wow. But,

255
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.960
but that might be how it works throughout the universe is that these beings that

256
00:14:58.961 --> 00:15:00.360
are very far advanced,

257
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.240
they come back and they see these creatures that are pretty close and they give

258
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.560
'em a little boost. They push,

259
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.800
push 'em ahead a little bit because otherwise it would take so long.

260
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.110
And maybe we don't have them amount of time because of the fact that we're in

261
00:15:13.111 --> 00:15:15.670
this shooting gallery of asteroids,

262
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:20.030
that these things come down and whatever progress you make is wiped out by

263
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:22.430
impacts or by super volcanoes. It.

264
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.070
<v 0>It it's crazy, but it's not that crazy.</v>

265
00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:28.630
If you look at the belief of human being to evolution, you know,

266
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.340
like in ancient Greek, they believe in different. They,

267
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:35.780
they were believing in different gods, like in, in yeah. Different times,

268
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:37.820
different civilization at different belief.

269
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.220
Now some people believe Jesus walk on water, you know, which is fine too.

270
00:15:41.221 --> 00:15:46.100
That's their belief. You know, if you believe that human was, you know, the,

271
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.460
the, the result of, and like alien being, you know, it's another belief,

272
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.050
you know, like it's not everybody believe in different things. You know,

273
00:15:55.051 --> 00:15:55.970
it's not that crazy. If.

274
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.970
<v 1>You think about what we doing, it's not catch new episodes.</v>
