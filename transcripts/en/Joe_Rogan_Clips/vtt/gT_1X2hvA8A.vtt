00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You can make anything taste pretty good. That's.</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.840
<v 1>What, Jen, she cooked something up in bear camp this year. It was bear.</v>

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.240
I think it was lo maybe. I, I don't know,

4
00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:16.960
but it anyway cooked it for 12 or 20 hours. Something crazy.

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.910
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; God, it was so good. No far, no, it was a back maybe.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.390
<v 0>Oh yeah. That's right. I remember that. Yeah. She was talking about that,</v>

7
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:26.750
but it was so good. Yeah, she, yeah, she marinated it, right? Yeah. People.

8
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.470
<v 1>Say spices. I'd like to see people who say, well, do you eat? Bear, have a,</v>

9
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.470
a plate of, of gene rivets, bear meat. My God. That's.

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.990
<v 0>All they want. Know what? Um, Ronella was talking about on his podcast.</v>

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.590
And when the pioneers came out west,

12
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:43.500
they were shooting deers for their and bears for the meat. Really? Yeah. Oh,

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.460
I didn't know that. Yeah. They were shooting bears for meat, black bears. That,

14
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:50.860
that they preferred black bears for their meat. It's a delicious animal people.

15
00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:53.100
Oh, is don't know. No, it is. Don't know.

16
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.300
And they think you're lying for some reason. Then you can eat bear.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.340
You don't want to eat bear. Like you don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.010
If Jen rivet cooks you some bear. I, I defy you. I defy you.

19
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:07.810
If you like to eat meat, her stir fry you'd have be a, you have bear stir fry.

20
00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:08.930
Yeah. That is fantastic.

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.770
<v 1>You'd have to be a pathological liar to say it. Wasn't good.</v>

22
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.770
<v 0>If you don't like meat, maybe you won't like it. But if you do like meat,</v>

23
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:18.730
you'd be like, wow, this is good. I, I say it tastes like, like a,

24
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.360
it's almost like a up deer.

25
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's like a combination of like venison kind.

26
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.720
<v 1>Yeah. And beef. Yeah. It's yeah. I mean, the way she cooks it is, you know,</v>

27
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.440
I think there's a typical taste of bear. Or like people always say who,

28
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.520
who have a hat like that? They say it's greasy.

29
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.520
Cuz it's more like pish mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; kind of, yeah.

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.870
I there's some add in it. It's like, it's just different.

31
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.390
But the way she does it in the tray or stir fry, it's.

32
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.590
<v 0>Incredible. It's incredible. Yeah. Yeah. It's a really delicious animal.</v>

33
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.590
<v 1>That speaking of that hunt, that's what I,</v>

34
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.910
I want to get Goggins on his first hunt.

35
00:01:57.911 --> 00:01:59.710
Just like I took you on your first bow hunt.

36
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.790
<v 0>So that's that's that's we can take him to John Jen's place. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.500
That'd be perfect. Try to get a bear.

38
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.940
<v 1>Yeah. Good, good. First bow kill. Has he shot a bow at all? Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:11.420
I got him a bow. Has he been shooting? Uh, I don't know if he ha he shot.

40
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:13.060
When he came and worked out with me.

41
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.460
<v 0>He's got the best Instagram stories ever. Those my God, those videos. I know.</v>

42
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.820
I love nothing ever gets done, but being a &lt;laugh&gt; he? I was,

43
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.130
I was reading one of his text messages. He sent me yesterday.

44
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.890
He just sends the most ridiculous.

45
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.250
<v 1>You showed me the one you showed me one like not too long ago.</v>

46
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.570
<v 0>Every couple months I get a new one. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.603
<v 1>I love it.</v>

48
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.610
<v 0>I love it. They wake you up too, man. I love, they wake me up.</v>

49
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.250
I start doing chin-ups as soon as I get.

50
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.930
<v 1>Those messages, I love his attitude. There's a few people who, um,</v>

51
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.760
I love the most people. Like, you know, just good people. Just hardworking,

52
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.040
but I'm in love with their spirit. Yes. It's like his spirit Jacque spirit.

53
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.480
Yeah. Courtney's spirit, their spirit.

54
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.680
It's like it it's it's amazing. Yeah.

55
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.560
It's it's and he's like one of those guys that it's never gonna

56
00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:03.520
waiver. Right. You know what? You're gonna get.

57
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.600
<v 0>You get inspiration from it. I, I do. I get fuel from it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.680
<v 1>I just, uh, even having the chance to train with him, it's like, man,</v>

59
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.800
just feel lucky to,

60
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.710
to see him in action and see him change from David to

61
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:21.950
Goggins. Right. And, and.

62
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.790
<v 0>It happened like, like becomes the.</v>

63
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.110
<v 1>Hulk. Oh my God. It hap I watched it and it's like, I thought, well,</v>

64
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.590
maybe this is just kind of like a, whatever, maybe just a thing.

65
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.110
But it was real &lt;laugh&gt; it's like, when, when got hard,

66
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.460
he got into this different zone and it was like better.

67
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.940
He got better. Got tougher. Really? Yeah. He did. It was like.

68
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.740
<v 0>So what'd you guys, do you ran like 30 miles? Yeah. 35.</v>

69
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.793
<v 1>35 Miles.</v>

70
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.380
<v 0>Yeah. And then you went back and lifted.</v>

71
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.140
<v 1>Yep. And, and we shot bows too, but uh, all that same day.</v>

72
00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.290
But during that race, it was kind of cold and, and snowy,

73
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.570
I think it was spit and snow, but rainy. It was soaking wet.

74
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.450
And uh, he, I remember like a mile 22, he,

75
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.730
something was happening with his feet and he had to take his shoes off

76
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.930
and untie his shoes. And it's like, normally that's not a good sign.

77
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.160
&lt;affirmative&gt;. I mean, if people are messing with their shoes, 22 miles into 30,

78
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.080
it's like, God, this is not, you know, cuz you know,

79
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:29.600
your feet are gonna get torn up. Right. Right.

80
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.200
So it's like you just kind of your feet, they could be bleeding,

81
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.880
torn ups. Like yeah, this is what happens and he's done a lot. So, so I'm like,

82
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.030
man, I don't know. I said, well, I said, I'm just gonna kind of keep,

83
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.870
keep chugging along and you know, get it figured out and,

84
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.030
and catch up and we'll go from there. And I thought, man,

85
00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:54.910
there's a chance that maybe I won't see him again, but no sure.

86
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.670
As here he comes, he catches back up. Me and my brother were up there and he,

87
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.980
he went from 22, he got in this different groove.

88
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.980
And then I actually,

89
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.940
my calf on this race kind of locked up and it's like going up this last

90
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.140
grade with do one more summit and I couldn't run it. And I'm like,

91
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.620
he took off, I was just kind of power hiking it.

92
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.290
And I get up there and had a cameraman up there. And uh, David was like,

93
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.170
he was in his Goins mode. By that time, this was towards the end of the race.

94
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:30.490
We had like two miles left. It's like 33 miles in. And he,

95
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.210
I asked a cameraman up there. I'm like, Hey, I said, how did Goggins look?

96
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.170
And he's like, uh, will he had his shirt off?

97
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.480
And he was, and it was colding. He's had his shirt off. And he was saying,

98
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.360
they don't know me. I'm like, who is he? He is like, they don't,

99
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.920
they don't know me son and doing, saying all this stuff. I said,

100
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.800
who is he saying that to? And he's like, there's nobody up here. &lt;laugh&gt;.

101
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.800
<v 0>So, so he has like imaginary enemies. Yeah. That.</v>

102
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.000
<v 1>He is fighting against and that's, but that's, that's real.</v>

103
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.240
And so he did and he got better and he freaking just crushed the,

104
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.720
the second half of that race and same thing happened, lifting.

105
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.560
He like the more reps we did, the better he got.

106
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.600
And like at the end,

107
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.150
when we had so many reps and like we did this one last thing of doing,

108
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.030
yeah, we did like 95 reps of, or no,

109
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.550
a hundred reps of right there on the incline. Um, bench is only 95 pounds,

110
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:33.790
but we had done 600 reps before he ended up on the last set

111
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.940
did more than he did on the first set. That's insane. Yeah.

112
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.980
And that's when he's saying he starts yelling right here somewhere and it makes

113
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:42.814
get some volume.

114
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.900
<v 2>15. Shut that muscle down. 16. Come on, get it.</v>

115
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.780
17 y'all know me, son, get it 18. Me son.

116
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.100
Get it son. Yeah, you.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.970
Good. 22. Who's gonna carry the boats and the Lords.

119
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.690
That's you buddy on 23 on what?

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.000
The one more to carry the boats. You're gonna do,

122
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:30.160
<v 1>This is at international fitness, just a regular gym. And people were like,</v>

123
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.000
what the hell? What is this guy? But, and he,

124
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:38.480
he got into the, that zone and it's like, so,

125
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.710
so whatever he says abouts David,

126
00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:43.870
that he was Goggins when he gets to Goggins dude,

127
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.270
look out it's it's like a whole, it's a different person. That's unstoppable.

128
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.550
It's Real's real. Yeah. It's real. It's real. I saw it. And he's like,

129
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.950

130
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.070
<v 0>How he broke the world. Chinup record. Yeah. I mean,</v>

131
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.020

132
00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.933
a day.

133
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.700
<v 1>And then so we went,</v>

134
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.580
we went after that and we went and watched UFC got pizza

135
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.620
and uh, and it was getting late by that time. So we'd run 35 miles.

We shot bows. We lifted weights pretty full day. Ate pizza,

137
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.970

00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:17.270
you never know of what you see is what you get. It's he's amazing.

152
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.510
<v 0>Yeah. He's real. There's no way he could be doing it.</v>

153
00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:23.390
As long as he is doing it without someone would expose him. Yeah.

154
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.470
Or he would expose himself. Yeah.

155
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.870
Well that's the real deal and that's why it's so special.

156
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.110
That's why it's so inspirational. Yeah.

157
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.350
Is because like that's all mental strength and he's all super honest about how

158
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:37.020
he used to be. He's like my brain was soft. I was.

159
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.820
<v 1>Soft. Yeah. It's helped me because I've thought that I'm like, when I get tired,</v>

160
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.180
I mean, I, I take inspiration from a lot of people, but it's like,

161
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:51.100
I I'm like, God, I need to have that little piece of GOs, you know, to beat,

162
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.380
to get in that it's, it's gotta be mental. It's like,

163
00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:59.130
it's he just puts himself there and he struggles,

164
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:04.050
but then gets to this next level. And it's like, how it's just,

165
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.930
he just makes himself go.

166
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.850
<v 0>There. He also has figured out now how to maintain his body,</v>

167
00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.810
which is very important. Yeah. You know, he,

168
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:13.250
that's why he's into that stretching.

169
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.480
&lt;affirmative&gt; he's had some like pretty significant mu issues in the past is so

170
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.200
OS muscle. Yeah. Right. Like locked up on him. Yeah. But now he realizes like,

171
00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:24.120
there's, you know, there's a maintenance involved too. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

172
00:10:24.121 --> 00:10:26.240
you gotta treat that thing like a vehicle, you know,

173
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:28.120
you gotta take care of that vehicle. Yeah.

174
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.480
<v 1>He does. And he's, I mean, it was like,</v>
