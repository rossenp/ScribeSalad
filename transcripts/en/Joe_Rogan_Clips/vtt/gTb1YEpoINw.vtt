00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.570
<v 2>Does a big issue with, uh, perceptions of people who don't hunt. Right?</v>

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.040
Non-hunters perceptions are a lot of times based on grip and grins.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.250
There are a lot of times based on maybe you were flipping through the channels

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:15.530
and you'd get on the outdoor channel.

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.540
Some guy shoots a big buck and they're hooting and hollering and high-fiving

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:22.230
each other. And people find it distasteful. They,

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.760
they see it and they don't understand why everyone's so excited and so happy i

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.600
t's because they don't see how difficult it is to get to that position.

10
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:35.250
How much anxiety is involved in shot placement and

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.310
squeezing the trigger, or make sure you don't flinch. And it's,

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.970
it's hard like any kind of hunting and taking an animal's life is very

13
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.830
difficult. So when you see that, that success celebration,

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.150
people think it's like a celebration of, of death, of killing, right?

15
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.800
But it's a celebration of success and of overcoming anxiety and nervousness and,

16
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.570
and the, the, the fear of failure and this, the moment itself,

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.130
which is so enormous,

18
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:06.270
the moment when you're squeezing a trigger or drawn back a bow on an animal,

19
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.770
it's a heavy moment. And there's so much, so much going on in the mind,

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.680
somewhat, so much anxiety that you have to battle.

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.180
<v 0>Well, and I think too, that it's, it's a snippet of time.</v>

22
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:23.040
That's taken completely out of context and you don't see the

23
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.770
lifestyle potentially that the,

24
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.270
and there's all gradients in scale inside of hunters. You know, some,

25
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.180
some people that truly is a lifestyle they've dedicated their life to it.

26
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:35.640
Others, you know, do it less time, whatever.

27
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.700
But like when I see a Griffin grand photo,

28
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.010
I see a lifestyle,

29
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.310
I see somebody that's probably dedicated a big part of their life.

30
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.170
That's not even connected directly to hunting that has

31
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.220
informed their ability to be efficient hunters.

32
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.140
That's kind of what the stories that I'm telling. And even in the future,

33
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:59.730
some of the stuff I'm planning in the future,

34
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.760
what I'm trying to tell the story of is,

35
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.800
is people who live their lives close to the land and the other things that

36
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.270
happen. So you always hear some flavor of hunting.

37
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.130
And most of my podcasts now, many of them are not about hunting at all,

38
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.350
but you'll, you'll see a small window, but you'll see this life. For instance,

39
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.940
there's a podcast that's coming out soon in, in a interview,

40
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.610
this old guy that really is a legendary hunter.

41
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:30.750
I'm not going to tell you where he's from.

42
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.600
I don't want to forecast what the podcast is about, but he,

43
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.510
the whole podcast is about his life. Very little of it's about hunting,

44
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.730
but it puts it in context. And it goes, nah, that's not just a, oh,

45
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.500
hillbilly out shooting stuff.

46
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.890
This guy has dedicated his life to this.

47
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.420
This is a very thoughtful process. This, this guy, not, not just his life,

48
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.980
his dad's life and his dad's life before him was dedicated. I mean,

49
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.020
these guys made a decision. This is going to be a big part of our life boys.

50
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.060
We're going to be hunters and it affected their careers.

51
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.480
It affected their families. It affected how many kids, they, I mean, you know,

52
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.220
just like the implications of choosing a lifestyle is so big.

53
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.380
And that's what I think is so profound about hunting.

54
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.560
And that's what I'm interested in is because I love to hunt.

55
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:23.860
Like I cannot erase that for me. Like, I do love to hunt,

56
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.620
but I am very interested in where like how hunting has

57
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:33.940
actually affected my life, how it impacts the character of my children,

58
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.190
how it impacts the, the, the sanctity of my marriage.

59
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.300
Yeah. I mean, I, um, I'm kinda going out there, but I'm being serious.

60
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.660
Like I think that what we choose to dedicate our life,

61
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:51.400
to has the opportunity to make us better and impact our character.

62
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.050
And it's just a big story, man.

63
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.230
It's a big story in a grip and grand doesn't tell that story,

64
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.280
but it's so hard because it's hard to tell me, clay,

65
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.820
don't post a picture of yourself with a dead deer and you smiling, right?

66
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.440
And it's like, bro,

67
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.580
you want me to accommodate my entire life for you?

68
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.440
I will do that. Like I spend much of my life doing that,

69
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:16.900
trying to interpret for people hunting,

70
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.540
but we're kind of asking for some, for some empathy too,

71
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:24.330
from the other side in, in the,

72
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.470
and we've got to do a better job at telling our story.

73
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.873
<v 1>I think there's that.</v>

74
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.200
And there's also that we're connected to what you would call what the general

75
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:36.550
population would call trophy hunters. It's like that. And that's there in lies.

76
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:41.410
The rub with bears is that many people don't understand that bears

77
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.460
are food and that it's not just food. It's actually a delicious food.

78
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.800
And from a conservation standpoint,

79
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.810
it's actually important to control the population.

80
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.500
But when you see someone posing with an animal,

81
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.780
unfortunately it will go to like elephants or giraffes or

82
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.320
some, some unpleasant animal, a lion,

83
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.210
or you see someone posing with a line.

84
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:09.040
And then you think about some canned hunt in Africa where some obese man is

85
00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:12.880
standing there with a, with a rifle over this majestic animal.

86
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.910
And it's very distasteful and it infuriates people.

87
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.620
And rightly so because the image they're getting out of that as some cruel

88
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:24.190
sociopath, who's just trying to check off boxes, right?
