00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.543
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.700
The amount of medical testing we have to go through before a contest is crazy.

4
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.400
I would imagine part the pack,

5
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.700
the medical packet that we have to get filled out by our primary cares for

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.050
world's strongest man is like 48 pages long, but yeah,

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.950
it's wild.

8
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.950
<v 0>Dude. So getting you in for an exam, how long does that take?</v>

9
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.350
<v 1>We have to get it done on our own. So they send,</v>

10
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.970
after the invites are done and after the,

11
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:28.530
the lineup is set for world's strongest, man, you get the email that it's like,

12
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:32.220
here's the medical packet you need done by this date. Um,

13
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.820
and you pretty much have to make an appointment with your primary care and get

14
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:36.240
it all done.

15
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.050
<v 0>So what does your doctor say when you come to him with that 48 page packet?</v>

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.840
<v 1>Well, luckily I've gone to her a few times with it,</v>

17
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.740
so she knows to block off some times she knows what's up. Yeah. You know,

18
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.910
and it's, um, but it's, it's smart because like we have to get an EKG,

19
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.690
we have to do stress testing. We have to get a full blood panel done. Um,

20
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.540
they have to look at everything because they don't want somebody dropping dead

21
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.420
on TV. That makes them look pretty bad.

22
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.350
<v 0>Yeah. They would have to make sure that you're not already over-trained too.</v>

23
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:05.184
Right. Like.

24
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.090
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So they look at everything. I mean, it's a full blood panel. They,</v>

25
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.940
like I said, they do the EKG, they look at the heart, they do. Um,

26
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.640
and then it's, you know, obviously a full medical history as well,

27
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:18.540
just to everything from parents to pass diseases, to what runs in the family,

28
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:19.374
everything.

29
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.190
<v 0>And now you guys aren't insured by these competitions are, you know,</v>

30
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.990
so if you tear your hamstring off, it's all on you. man.

31
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.850
God, that seems.

32
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.950
<v 1>Crazy. It's ballsy. Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.190
<v 0>It's, it's risky. Yeah. Real, real risky. I mean,</v>

34
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:38.250
that seems kind of crazy that during the competition itself, you're not,

35
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.683
you're not covered.

36
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.500
<v 1>It's all on us. Even those medical packets, like they say like all, all,</v>

37
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.310
all fees associated with this are up to the athletes expense.

38
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.590
<v 0>And they don't pay that. Well, no.</v>

39
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.540
<v 1>You. When you make decent money, I mean, it's not a lot, you know,</v>

40
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:57.780
like to win world's strongest, man. You make like 50 grand really.

41
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.770
<v 0>That's it for.</v>

42
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.570
<v 1>The strongest, the strongest man in the world.</v>

43
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.670
<v 0>That'd be worth a million bucks. I think.</v>

44
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.290
<v 1>So that's the number. I mean, but look at it.</v>

45
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.410
So like Worldstar has been around since the seventies, I need to CC.

46
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.250
<v 0>Zero's going to win the strongest man on the girls. That's what I'm.</v>

47
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.990
<v 1>Talking about. Come on, we need you in the sport is.</v>

48
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.330
<v 0>We only up the money.</v>

49
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.670
It seems like somebody should be able to pony up a million bucks.

50
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.790
<v 1>I would love somebody, I will say. So like, you know,</v>

51
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.130
we talk about world's strongest man and giants live and that whole series,

52
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:24.630
but then we also have the Arnold circuit.

53
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:28.770
So there's like two big pro circuits for strong men to choose from. Um,

54
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800
the Arnold circuit. They've definitely elevated the game. Right?

55
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:36.480
So the Arnold strongman classic in Ohio is like kind of seen as

56
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.070
the most elite competition in the world because only 10 guys qualify for that

57
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.150
contest. World's strongest, man,

58
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:47.010
you get 25 and then the prize money in Ohio is better than

59
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:51.720
world's strongest, man. It it's almost double actually. Yeah. For Arnold.

60
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.613
So at the Arnold,

61
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.610
so each of the Arnold international shows it's standard prize money.

62
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.040
So the Arndell international shows there, one here in Santa Monica,

63
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:04.600
this weekend, there's Australia, south America, South Africa, Europe, Canada.

64
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.910
Um, I think that's it.

65
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.810
But we all know the prize money going into each show because it's the same at

66
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.680
every one. So it's like 10 grand for first 8, 6, 4, 2, 1.

67
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.830
So they pay out top six, but they also pay all of our travel there.

68
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.030
So it's not too bad. No.

69
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.840
But then the big motivation is to get to Ohio, right?

70
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.100
Where first place is 85 grand and they pay out all 10 athletes,

71
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.460
but like third place at, I think it's second,

72
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.580
second or third place at Ohio makes just as much as the world's strongest man.

73
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.870
<v 0>So this is probably why you have to compete 40 times a year. I mean,</v>

74
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.943
it's kind of.

75
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.260
<v 1>I think it was like to be honest, like I didn't really do that.</v>

76
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.740
Well this past weekend in Santa Monica, so I didn't make any money. Oh really?

77
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.700
<v 0>Yeah. Oh.</v>

78
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.380
<v 1>No. Which is a bummer, but like, I wasn't like this weekend, like the contest,</v>

79
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:56.560
like for me, it was more like a, a gauging.

80
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.930
I was trying to gauge where I was at going into Columbus.

81
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.030
The events were really similar.

82
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.811
<v 0>So do you do that?</v>

83
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:06.100
Like you have to be careful to not go too crazy in one of these events.

84
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.000
<v 1>I definitely like held back this weekend. You know,</v>

85
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:12.190
I think I could have hit another gear if I needed to,

86
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.870
but already having my qualification to the big show. I like mentally, I,

87
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.180
I don't think I would've been able to like turn it on. Like I need to in Ohio.

88
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.350
<v 0>And when is Ohio?</v>

89
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.580
<v 1>What day? First week of March. So, uh, the contest is the fifth and sixth,</v>

90
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:25.630
I think, or the sixth and seventh.

91
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.190
<v 0>Nothing between right now, which is January 20th and March.</v>

92
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.730
So how do you ramp up? Like what,

93
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.530
what is your schedule like to prepare for something like that?

94
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.680
<v 1>So the biggest thing, so we look at the events, right? So, you know,</v>

95
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:43.420
I mentioned we have the max deadlift. So my goal is that a thousand pounds,

96
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.830
which would be,

97
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.340
which would make me the first person under 300 pounds body weight to do that in

98
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.720
history. Whoa. Yeah. How close are you? I pulled nine 70 in July.

99
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.333
<v 0>Christ.</v>

100
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.320
<v 1>So God. That's a lot of weight. So we're close, we're close.</v>

101
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.570
Um, and you're only 28. Yeah.

102
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.840
<v 0>Yeah. You're going to get stronger. Exactly. So if you don't get to 300 pounds,</v>

103
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:07.330
if you don't gain too much weight, you can nail. I don't want to, like.

104
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.070
<v 1>I, I was, I was almost 300.</v>

105
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:12.430
I was like 2 98 at world's strongest man in 2018 and I was a fat.

106
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.690
It was gross. Like I looked at my husband. I was like, why did you want it?

107
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:20.950
Like lay next to me. Like I had neck rolls on my neck, rolls on like,

108
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.130
I was gross.

109
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.760
<v 0>Like some dudes like bears. They're like, I'm big and hairy.</v>

110
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.920
<v 1>He does like, and I totally am a bear,</v>

111
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.160
but like I was an ugly bear dude.

112
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.160
<v 0>Like a bear just going into ironies. Oh.</v>

113
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.300
<v 1>Man. I look at picture snap. My head looked like a blueberry. I was like</v>

114
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.990
thinking. Um,

115
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.070
but like honestly like 2 85 is I kind of my sweet spot because I'm still getting

116
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.190
stronger. We're getting a little bit leaner and getting better at the sport.

117
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:51.100
So like I don't see a reason to get any bigger. Right. Um,

118
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.340
but I honestly do think a thousand pounds is doable right now.

119
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.770
<v 0>Well, it seems like if you're 30, 30 pounds away,</v>

120
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.330
if you're doing that much weight 906,

121
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.540
I mean look 30 pounds to a deadlift for a regular person.

122
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:04.490
That's an extra 30 pounds. That's a lot,

123
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.110
but not when you're already doing 970 pounds.

124
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.440
<v 1>Yeah. And like to go back to like the prep and like the ramp up to this contest,</v>

125
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.690
you know, like before, like this weekend we had, um,

126
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.950
the deadlift was a 7 75 for reps in a minute and I pulled six,

127
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.230
which is okay. Like I probably could have pulled seven or eight if I needed to.

128
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.340
The winning number was nine. Um, and everybody that, ironically,

129
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.950
everybody that finished ahead of me in that event has already dead lifted over a

130
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:34.520
thousand pounds. So that made me feel pretty good. Um,

131
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.880
but like leading up into these next few weeks,

132
00:06:37.881 --> 00:06:40.460
like I'm going to start working like my heaviest dental failure before this

133
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:42.110
contest was eight 50 for one,

134
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.400
I'm going to start working up into that low to mid nines, um,

135
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.790
in the next couple of weeks and probably have my last heavy, heavy deadlift,

136
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.390
probably three weeks before the contest two and a half weeks before the contest.

137
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.210
<v 0>And then do dead lifts at all before leading.</v>

138
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.900
<v 1>Up to the contest. If I do, it'll be light. I say like relative, you know,</v>

139
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:01.010
it's a relative term. Sorry.

140
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.890
<v 0>Yeah. So you're just trying to let your body recover.</v>

141
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.190
<v 1>That's what a lot of people think, like people forget,</v>

142
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:11.570
like when we're training this hard, like we're beat to. And like,

143
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.770
we're like we get stronger when we, when we rest and recover.

144
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.240
So I really don't exercise or lift like the week of a contest.

145
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.850
Like I'll do my recovery workouts that I've talked about before, where like,

146
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:25.100
I'm just kind of swimming, hot tub, sauna that stuff,

147
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.880
but I won't lift any weights. Um, and that's cause like my body,

148
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:30.080
like my central nervous system,

149
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:33.920
like everything just needs a break and you get stronger over that period of

150
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.510
time. For sure. It's amazing.

151
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:40.070
<v 0>Does it make you feel like you maybe are over-training and in other ways,</v>

152
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.570
because if you get that much stronger, when you take a week off,

153
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.670
almost seems like you should do that more often.

154
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.421
<v 1>No,</v>

155
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:50.330
because I think you need to get to that point where you need to get beat down,

156
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.630
you know, like there are some shrink coaches out there that like, you know,

157
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:57.590
we call it a de-load right. So it's like where you're ramping up, ramping up,

158
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:59.960
going super heavy, then you back off for a little bit. Right.

159
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.140
And so that's what we call a de-load and there's some coaches that give that

160
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.630
every fourth week of their program regardless.

161
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.830
And I don't agree with that because I don't think anybody can work that hard for

162
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:10.700
three weeks to beat,

163
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.030
to beat down their body enough where they need it every single fourth week,

164
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.810
normal people don't train hard enough to need regular. Deloads.

165
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.870
<v 0>The deloads loads. The guys who practiced that way,</v>

166
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:24.530
are they winning or are they not elite? No.

167
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.440
<v 1>Um, most of it, like I say that and like, most of that's like in,</v>

168
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:30.890
like I see a lot of the powerlifting community where it's just like squat bench

169
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.340
deadlift. Um, but like in all honesty, like I don't feel people, like,

170
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:38.240
I feel like you have to earn your de-load. And that's like,

171
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:39.440
what my coach does with me.

172
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.550
Like I went almost six months without a de-load leading into this contest.

173
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:46.370
Jesus. And that happened about a month and a half ago.

174
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.750
And I knew I needed it because I was tired every day,

175
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.790
regardless of how much sleep I got,

176
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.900
I didn't want to go to the gym every time I'd get to the gym. I was miserable.

177
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.480
I just wanted to leave. I didn't want to look at anything.

178
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:03.360
I don't want to talk to anybody. And I texted my coach. I was like,

179
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.540
I need a break. And he was like, all right, cool.

180
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.470
I was waiting for you to get to that point, but it's a good, but you know,

181
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:13.500
it's like, it's like, I feel like it's something you have to earn. Right.

182
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:16.890
Because people like, people think they work hard,

183
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.910
but they don't really know what that means until they're like actually pushed to

184
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:24.840
do something. Right. And that's where, where I got to that point. Um,

185
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.230
and that's why like these next five weeks are going to be like super crucial in

186
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.570
my training to this contest because I'm going to have to,

187
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.740
I'm going to beat my body to over these next five weeks. Um, you know,

188
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:37.380
and my husband will probably get off at me cause I'll be a prick one or two

189
00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:40.530
times at least. Um, but it's like, you know,

190
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.230
this is the biggest competition in the world and I know what I need to sacrifice

191
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:46.170
to get to that point. And that's going to mean long training sessions,

192
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:48.780
really hard training sessions. And um, you know, just like I said,

193
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:50.820
I'm just going to beat my body down, um,

194
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.950
just to reap those rewards at the end of it. Yeah.

195
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:57.420
That's gotta leave you super exhausted. It hurts and cranky and just like.
