<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 2>They show them the new missile they've developed and, uh,</v>

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.450
but it has kind of a round, round head and he says, uh,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.640
you need to make it more pointy to his engineers.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.910
And, uh, actually that's what I also said to the same thing. Um, you know,

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.230
stop it. We need to make a more pointy.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.880
<v 0>Did you say that because of the movie? Yeah, really? Yeah. Hold on.</v>

8
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.100
I just have the main camera on. Okay. Okay.

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.160
That's you literally told them to make the star ship more pointy because of the

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.293
movie dictator.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.610
<v 1>Yup. Um, and they know it too.</v>

12
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.660
It's not like they don't like the heaven unaware of it.

13
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.730
I thought it would be funny if we made the rocket at point. So we did.

14
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.580
<v 0>Did it have any effects on the aerodynamics? No.</v>

15
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.340
<v 1>Nothing. Now we can make it way blunter and be fine.</v>

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.460
<v 0>But it was, is it better to be pointing here or like if it wasn't for the.</v>

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.590
<v 1>Really worse, like.</v>

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.940
<v 0>But more fun for you? It looks cooler. Uh, well, okay. It does look cool. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.883
Yeah.

20
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.910
<v 1>How.</v>

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.650
<v 0>Long do you think it will be before you good Jimmy? What's up?</v>

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.190
<v 1>Uh, it's my, my head maybe. Yeah, exactly. You good?</v>

23
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.600
<v 0>Yeah. How.</v>

24
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.070
<v 1>Long my head is sticking out. Is that where it's oh,</v>

25
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.050
is that supposed to be okay? You're good. All right.

26
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.850
<v 0>How long do you think it's going to be before you have like regular flights with</v>

27
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:30.684
that?

28
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.860
Where you can take off and land and like an airplane where it would be very.

29
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.630
<v 1>Consistent with our extra pointy rocket.</v>

30
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.740
<v 0>You will, your extra pointing a rocket.</v>

31
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.650
<v 1>Do you mean earth, earth transport or, or,</v>

32
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.203
or anywhere?

33
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.580
<v 0>Anytime where you could just do it with people and have them have it land all</v>

34
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:54.414
the time?

35
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.930
<v 1>Um, I think it would probably years away. Two years.</v>

36
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.550
<v 0>Away. Yeah. That's, that's, that's really nice. Two years is pretty cool.</v>

37
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.240
<v 1>GRS or people will we'll, we'll have a lot of flights between now and then.</v>

38
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.120
<v 0>That's crazy. That's 20, 23 is not that far away.</v>

39
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.190
That'll be there before you know it. Yeah.

40
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.070
<v 1>Wow. 20, 23 time flies.</v>

41
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.680
<v 0>How many times have you had explosions with?</v>

42
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.960
<v 1>Um, I don't know, like a, quite a few six,</v>

43
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.913
maybe five or six.

44
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.821
<v 0>What are those? Like,</v>

45
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.080
what is it like when you watch it explode when it's supposed to land and it

46
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:28.914
just.

47
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.530
<v 1>Now this, this is a test program we expect you to S to, to explore.</v>

48
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.190
Um, it it's weird if it doesn't explode, frankly. Really? Yeah. Um,

49
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.970
cause we're, you know, we're trying to develop advanced rockets, uh, at a high,

50
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.720
at a high speed and, uh, if you want to get paid at all, but, uh, you,

51
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.650
you have to run things close to the edge. And, um,

52
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.940
the whole rocket is warming the engines, the structure, avionics, the software,

53
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.820
the ground systems, all evolving simultaneously. So,

54
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.960
and the whole production system,

55
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.020
which is actually hotter than the rocket design by far. So the rock,

56
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.490
the rocket and engine and avionics production system is, and the,

57
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.350
and the launch system, uh, is a thousand percent hotter than the initial design.

58
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.633
I at least.

59
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.950
<v 0>Really? Yeah. So.</v>

60
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.330
<v 1>When a card is like 10000%, it's easy to do a car prototype.</v>

61
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.230
It's hard to do production.

62
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.040
<v 0>Um, so when you're looking at your scaling towards the future,</v>

63
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.030
and you're looking at mistakes or corrections improvements

64
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.320
and all of these different things,

65
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.950
that's how you come up with this figure of approximately two years.

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.930
<v 1>If current trends continue, if we excited, w w you know, if you,</v>

67
00:03:44.931 --> 00:03:46.780
if you plot the points on the curve of progress,

68
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.170
and then we should be doing regular, uh,

69
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.670
orbital flights with a high probability of a safe landing in

70
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.420
two years. So we're getting to over it this year,

71
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.950
our goal is to get to over this year. So,

72
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.110
and I'd actually be able to totally are saying like,

73
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.390
Starship is the largest flying object ever made.

74
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.880
Uh, this thing will be about, oh, over 5,000 tons, uh,

75
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.530
weight on liftoff is going to go straight up five with 5,000 tons. Well, um,

76
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.890
this is much heavier than any aircraft by far.

77
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.270
There's no aircraft even comes close to this, uh, weight. Um,

78
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.000
and it's going straight up, but aircraft can't go straight up. So it's like the,

79
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.433
it has got more than twice.

80
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.100
It will have more than twice the thrust of us that in five, really? Yeah. Yeah.

81
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.480
It's like a big rocket.

82
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.250
<v 0>Why does it need that much thrust? Oh, we try. Cause you want to go to Mars.</v>

83
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.803
There's this.

84
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.900
<v 1>W w we're trying to, uh, make life multi-planetary,</v>

85
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.330
you know, uh, extended life beyond earth. And in order to do that,

86
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:51.580
you have to have high tonnage to Mars.

87
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.920
And that means you need a big rocket and you got to fly a lot.

88
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.350
<v 0>So the reason why it has twice,</v>

89
00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:01.270
the thrust of the Saturn five is to plan for these interstellar trips,

90
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.920
uh, inter planetary trips. So when you, when you're doing this in your, you,

91
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.880
you're,

92
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.710
you're developing these systems thinking about regular trips to other

93
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.780
planets, but you're, you're not,

94
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.790
you're not just trying to get into orbit right now.

95
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.490
You're trying to get into orbit with something that eventually gets scale up.

96
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.390
<v 1>Yeah. We know how to get to orbit. We've done that a lot. So the,</v>

97
00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:28.300
the really hard thing is we need to have a fully

98
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:30.310
and rapidly reusable rocket where the,

99
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.990
where all elements of the rocket are re-used and they are reused quickly like an

100
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:37.480
aircraft. Um, and this has never been done.

101
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.640
This is the holy grail of rocketry is,

102
00:05:39.641 --> 00:05:44.500
is a to have a fully reusable rocket. Then you need to go one step further.

103
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.610
It needs to be fully and rapidly reusable. You know, it's like, like a plane.

104
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.320
Yeah. Like plane lands, you, uh, you know, refuel it and take off a game.

105
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.430
How do you have.

106
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.160
<v 0>Time? This,</v>

107
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.990
I I've never understand you in regards to the way you run

108
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.820
multiple businesses simultaneously.

109
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.960
I would think that something like this would require so much concentration,

110
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.880
it would require this. I would think this would be your whole being,

111
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.830
trying to figure out how to work this.

112
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.190
<v 1>Um, yeah. Well, I do work a lot.</v>

113
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.490
<v 0>It's crazy. Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.660
<v 1>And I applied just for a reason. I was late as I looked like coming from, from,</v>

115
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.390
uh, you know, some critical meetings just doing,

116
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.650
normally I'd be meeting until I work until like one or two in the morning.

117
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.713
<v 0>Every night.</v>

118
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.770
<v 1>Not, I mean, Saturday and Sunday, usually not,</v>

119
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:41.450
but sometimes how much do you sleep? About six hours. Oh, that's pretty good.

120
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.680
Yeah. Not that crazy.

121
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.920
<v 0>For you. That's I mean, for someone does as much as you that's actually,</v>

122
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.830
that's impressive that you can squeeze that in.

123
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.690
<v 1>Yeah. I try. I've tried sleeping less, but then total, uh,</v>

124
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.130
productivity decreases.

125
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.100
<v 0>Yeah. So you feel like six is the number where it's.</v>

126
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.450
<v 1>Six, six, uh, six, four seconds. I can, um,</v>

127
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.720
I, I don't find myself needing, wanting more sleep than six.

128
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.910
<v 0>So when, like,</v>

129
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:11.870
with the Saturn five and the space shuttles and all these other rockets,

130
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.910
they would, they would have these parts that would do it,

131
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.850
get the ship up into space,

132
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.170
but they would descend down to earth and crash into the ocean and they would

133
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:26.870
never use them again. That's right. How do you avoid that? Like,

134
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:29.300
what is the difference between the way that these things are structured?

135
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.010
Like the, it, the,

136
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:34.910
the whole thing goes together and then it lands together?

137
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.010
<v 1>Um, well, we're on the wrong planet for a single stage to orbit, right? Um,</v>

138
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.760
I think one thing to appreciate is like space. Getting just space is easy.

139
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:44.870
Getting to orbit is hard.

140
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.870
So you only need maybe one or 2% of the energy to get to a

141
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:54.350
space where the atmosphere is thin compared to what you need to get to orbit.

142
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.580
And if you get to orbit,

143
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.340
now you've got to burn off all that energy and you're coming in like a media.

144
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.900
So you need a powerful heat shield.

145
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.700
So it's like super difficult to get to orbit and at all.

146
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.660
Um, and then if you get to orbit at all, then making those,

147
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.910
the stages reusable means they've got to come back in tact. Uh, and then the,

148
00:08:13.911 --> 00:08:17.120
the opera stage is especially difficult because it's got so much energy,

149
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.980
all the energy you put into it, you have to take out. Um, so it's, uh,

150
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.320
you know, you're literally coming in like a flaming meteor, uh, and,

151
00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:31.040
and most things would just Melton vapor melt or vaporize. So,

152
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.290
um, like if you as human trying to come in from all, but you just be pink mist.

153
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:37.663
Yeah.

154
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.450
<v 0>That's a funny way to put it. Yeah.</v>
