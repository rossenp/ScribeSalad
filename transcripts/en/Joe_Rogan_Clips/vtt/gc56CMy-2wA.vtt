00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>The general can experience this vision board, this ultimate vision board,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.520
the ultimate thing is a show and movies and stuff like that.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.630
Is there anything that you have made manifest that's actually happened because

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.513
of this vision board?

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.470
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. My house, one of my first major vision board things,</v>

6
00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:23.090
I put that when I didn't have a house living in my apartment and, uh,

7
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:26.270
what it does for me is just kind of, it focuses me.

8
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:29.960
It gives me a direction instead of this being this guy who doesn't have his

9
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:34.370
hands on the rudder or the, or whatever, the thing that steers the boat. Um,

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.560
and so like, I was like, oh, I want to get this house.

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.790
And so in order to get the house,

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:42.170
I had to stop just like not paying attention to my money.

13
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:46.040
I had to stop just buying random sneakers every week I had to start being like,

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.390
okay, I need to build my credit.

15
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.230
I have to pay these old bills from when I was 20 and didn't pay those off

16
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.910
because I didn't think I'd ever had money.

17
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.400
So who cares if I skip out on this rent, you know,

18
00:00:55.401 --> 00:01:00.170
I have to go back and undo all these things so that I could get to that ultimate

19
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:03.310
vision of getting the house. And then we ended up, I had,

20
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:07.430
I had my house for two years now. I love it. I put that I wanted to be on Reno,

21
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.880
nine 11 and there. And I taped that. I don't know if I got cut out or not.

22
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.700
Cause it's, you know, six minute quippy thing. But, um,

23
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.180
a lot of things I put on my vision board ended up happening. That's.

24
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.750
<v 0>Interesting.</v>

25
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.670
You say that you had to go and like redo things that you up.

26
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.330
Like what made you, what brought you to that decision? Well, it's just.

27
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.080
<v 1>That, um, if I wanted to move a lot of ways in my life,</v>

28
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.220
the same with my like, dealing with, with my ex-wife and things like that,

29
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:41.110
I had to go to therapy. I had to start, I wasn't trusting anyone. I was like,

30
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:42.520
anyone who wants to hang out with me,

31
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.980
it's just because I have a little bit of money or because I've been on a couple

32
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:47.770
of shows or done that. And which is so ridiculous. Like no,

33
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:50.140
most people don't even know me, you know? So,

34
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.920
but then some people did and then sometimes that would happen.

35
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:57.400
People will be hanging out with me just because they thought I could introduce

36
00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:00.880
them to a fun party or someone else cooler than me.

37
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.070
And I had to stop looking for that and being so worried about

38
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:09.430
that. And I had to go undo just a mindset.

39
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:12.940
I think this rapper, I also really like Waka Flocka, flame,

40
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:13.930
many people talk about this.

41
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:18.640
I just changed my mindset from a survival mindset to a thrive mindset of like,

42
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.170
oh, I am okay. I am fine. So I can go ahead and just take care of this business.

43
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.270
I'm going to get more work.

44
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.720
I'm going to get more jobs because I've proven myself. It's not a fluke.

45
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.030
You know, it's not a one, it's not a mistake that they made in hiring me.

46
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.300
They, you know, I'm, I'm going to be here. What.

47
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.220
<v 0>Made you, like, what, where did,</v>

48
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.330
what did you come up with this idea to sort of correct your mindset?

49
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.930
Was it just like realizing personally that the way you were looking at things

50
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:49.300
was wrong or did you read something or.

51
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.510
<v 1>It's mostly the things in my life were getting better,</v>

52
00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:56.170
but I wasn't getting happier. Uh, I had more money.

53
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.730
I hadn't anything I could buy video game wise, all that stuff.

54
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:05.290
I was having a bunch of sex, but I wasn't happier. I was still lonely.

55
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.150
I was still like,

56
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.260
I'm not doing all the things I wanted to do. I was,

57
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.860
I was chasing things just for money, you know? Um,

58
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.910
and so I had to just kind of take a step back and go like, okay,

59
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.480
like don't just chase every single thing. You see,

60
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.920
figure out what you really go back to. Like when you started stand up, I'm like,

61
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:27.790
what do you want?

62
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.480
And all I wanted when I started stand up was to be able to pay my bills and do

63
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:36.040
the things I want to do. And that hasn't changed. Was this a gradual process?

64
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.710
Yeah, for sure. For sure. Probably a couple of years.

65
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.760
<v 0>So you just realized, was it like you were sitting in,</v>

66
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.320
this was not from reading,

67
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.620
anything's just from you recognizing that something was wrong.

68
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.770
<v 1>I mean, where can I,</v>

69
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.080
something was wrong in me and me watching the people around me,

70
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.110
me watching, um, people with more success than me, me watching,

71
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.770
just seeing that like, oh, like, okay, I feel this way.

72
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:03.990
And I have this little bit of money with it, but maybe if I get more money,

73
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.650
I won't. But then meeting people with millions of dollars and being like, oh,

74
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.670
holy. Like some people still don't have their together,

75
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:13.140
no matter how much money they have.

76
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.150
And some people know who exactly who they are and they know what they

77
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:22.590
want there, they are happy within themselves.

78
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.300
And I want it to be that.

79
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.680
<v 0>That's very interesting that you recognize it and made the adjustment. You know,</v>

80
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:34.500
that's a sign of a strong mind. You, you were,

81
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:38.250
you were able to recognize that the current patterns that you were operating

82
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:41.070
under were weren't, they weren't fulfilling your needs.

83
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.110
So you had to like assess, but then also move forward and make a change.

84
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.270
Does very difficult thing to do.

85
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.820
<v 2>Yeah. It's difficult. But coincide with weight loss. Um,</v>

86
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:54.420
it was probably a little.

87
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.650
<v 1>Bit after the weight loss,</v>

88
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.340
but that's the weight loss kind of gives me the motivation for it. You know?

89
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:03.720
Like my whole life has been motivation for every other step I take, you know,

90
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.550
like I came from just being a college dropout with son who was when I was 20,

91
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.330
he was diagnosed with autism. I was 23. I didn't have any money.

92
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:15.960
My ex-wife was more of a albatross around our thing. Like, you know,

93
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.490
I have full custody of my son. So it was just like,

94
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.680
I got to figure this out.

95
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:25.770
And once that we had a little apartment and everything, I was like, okay,

96
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:29.880
well I figure this out. I get my health together. And that was a big one.

97
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.010
Cause my, my doctor even told me, she was like, you know,

98
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:36.600
there's so many people I tell all the time, just diet, exercise, diet, exercise,

99
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.240
you need to lose weight. You need to get better. You're going to die.

100
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.000
I tell this to people all the time and you go, you know how many,

101
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.440
my patients have done anything about it. And then she says,

102
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.270
you that's it. You're the only one that I know that I've talked to about this.

103
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.530
Who's just done it through diet and exercise. So you ever, she was just like,

104
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:59.780
you have a strong mind. So I took that to heart and I was like, well.

105
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.030
If I can do that, if I can lose 140 pounds throwing,

106
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:09.470
you know, I would workout throw up in my, you know, again this morning,

107
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.830
my trainer, he was just like, all right, you throw up let's can you breathe?

108
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.660
All right, let's get back at it. You know,

109
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.270
you know where a lot of times people would throw up and they'd be like, okay,

110
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:20.930
well that was enough for today. You know, he, he would never push.

111
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.990
He told me day one, he was like, you're, you're a very strong man.

112
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.550
And we're going to just unlock what you've been covering up with bad decisions.

113
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.920
<v 0>That's uh, it's so true what your doctor said. And it's so interesting.</v>

114
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.870
When you think about the goals that people have, like one of the major goals,

115
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.740
if you asked Americans, like, what do you want to do besides be successful,

116
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:44.530
have a family have a career. They want to lose weight.

117
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.960
But what I said at the beginning of this podcast,

118
00:06:46.961 --> 00:06:49.750
you've done one of the most difficult things a person could do.

119
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.410
Cause you didn't just lose weight. He lost a load of weight and he kept it off.

120
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.840
And that to me is so it's such

121
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.950
a, it's the craziest thing is, cause it's like, it's not like gaining weight,

122
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.220
right? Like gaining weight requires you've got to eat all that food.

123
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.710
Like you gotta, like, you gotta really get after it.

124
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.370
Like if you really want to gain weight, man, you gotta put on that. You know,

125
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.220
you got to be there to eat. You got to get it done.

126
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.730
People have no problem with that. You know? But the not eating,

127
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.180
you're literally asking someone to not do something,

128
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.980
just don't do something and it's harder to do than to do something.

129
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.700
Yeah.

130
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.350
And then the exercise is maybe even harder to do than to not eat.

131
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.670
Those are two really difficult things to do that you need to do both of them in

132
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:39.610
order to really get your health in order, in order to really lose weight.

133
00:07:39.611 --> 00:07:42.970
And everybody knows it. Everybody knows it, but nobody does it. Yeah.

134
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.430
<v 1>And then they always want to know what's the trick. What's the trick.</v>

135
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.120
What's the trick.

136
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.120
<v 0>No trick pro there's no trick because the.</v>

137
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.270
<v 1>Walk through that door, especially with exercise, it is just like a door. Like,</v>

138
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.680
and that's what my wife said to me. She goes like, oh, you went from she's like,

139
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:58.330
you were a guy who didn't exercise.

140
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.220
And now you're a guy that exercises she's like,

141
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:03.700
there's no part of you that gives up and goes, oh, this is hard.

142
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:04.750
Why am I doing this? She's like,

143
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.790
this is what you do because this is what you do.

144
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.840
And the hardest part is making that transition because you go through that first

145
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.070
three weeks and you're just like, I hate this. Why the am I doing it?

146
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.290
You're looking at us. You know, back when we could go to gyms,

147
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:18.220
you're looking at other people going, oh,

148
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.610
well they're attractive and this and that. And I'm like, yeah.

149
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:25.750
And I'll never be like that, you know? And you just got to get rid of all that.

150
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:29.140
I hate that. I hate it when I see that in comedy, because I just mostly,

151
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:31.180
because I'm used to, I go, I know where it comes from.

152
00:08:31.181 --> 00:08:34.960
And I had that in myself when people were like, I don't exercise. I don't know.

153
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.650
And they're so proud of it. You know? I'm just like, well, okay, well,

154
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.310
I'll see you in 10 years when you've changed your mind and are you just aren't

155
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:44.650
successful. So, you know, that's your thing.

156
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.300
That's the only thing I would tell young me and like everything I've done,

157
00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:52.660
I'm like, well, that's my process. And I'm glad everything.

158
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:56.100
I wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I would have done told young,

159
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.630
maybe like, Hey, if you want to be successful, you just gotta be healthy.

160
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.970
So just get good at it. Yeah.
