00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.000
<v 1>Yeah, grow up.</v>

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.840
We were talking on the last podcast about Epstein and we watched,

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.280
we looked at some of the autopsy photos and looked at some of the, the,

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.760
the accounts, especially particularly Dr. Michael.

6
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.160
Badden the guy from the HBO autopsy show. He's like that guy got murdered.

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.990
<v 0>I, I got a question. Why is there no per walk photos?</v>

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.830
Why is there no photos of him in court?

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.470
Why is there no photos of him getting off the plane? What do you think?

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.070
I have no answer, but isn't that weird? It is weird.

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.430
Every other person who's arrested. You.

12
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.350
<v 1>See the perp walk? Yeah. Including, uh, El Chapo, including.</v>

13
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.830
<v 0>El Chapo, including Harvey Weinstein. Literally everybody you've got footage.</v>

14
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.140
The, the media knows where to wait. Right? Why is there no footage of him?

15
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.420
What the? I don't have an answer, but it's.

16
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.580
And the thing is to even say this doesn't, this is weird conspiracy theory. No,

17
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:51.740
literally tell me what I'm missing. Well, here's where it gets.

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.260
<v 1>Even weirder. You know, that he was like visited while he was in jail by women.</v>

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.820
And like, he'd have his assistant come to visit him in jail.

20
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.370
<v 0>I did not know this. Oh yeah. 16.</v>

21
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.890
<v 2>Hours a day. He'd get to hang out in the, uh, like wow. Lawyer room,</v>

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.330
their special room, where they would buy out all of the, uh, pot machines and,

23
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.690
uh, snacks, all of them. And he'd just get to sit in there and hang out. Wow.

24
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.130
<v 1>16 Hours a day.</v>

25
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.770
<v 0>And, and so.</v>

26
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.250
<v 1>They were, they were somehow another,</v>

27
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:23.200
either negotiating with him or they were placating him or they were

28
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:25.640
trying to resolve this issue peacefully.

29
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.080
They were trying to figure out a way like this guy knew too many people and

30
00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:31.320
wasn't talking. And while he wasn't talking,

31
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.200
they were trying to like desperately get to him. I would assume.

32
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.520
And stop him from potentially talking.

33
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.080
And then while the prosecutors closing in,

34
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.840
and while they're making this airtight case,

35
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.670
and the only way for him to make end anything more lenient is to start

36
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.670
saying maybe LA LA LA LA jail cell

37
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:52.510
night, LA LA, LA, LA LA. Remember.

38
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.910
<v 0>Remember, supposedly remember all those files that he had with all the people.</v>

39
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.430
Where'd they go? No, one's asking. Um, Jamie's gone.

40
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.603
<v 1>You got 'em. No, I mean.</v>

41
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.740
<v 2>The someone FBI York PD.</v>

42
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.140
<v 0>But why have we're not hearing anything about it? He's got names of many people.</v>

43
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.620
Not.

44
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.900
<v 1>Just names, but videotapes. Yeah. Of dudes, kids.</v>

45
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.290
It's just, this is classic conspiracy theory. Proven.

46
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.490
True. It's.

47
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.370
<v 0>A classic because we all saw it coming. But.</v>

48
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.920
<v 1>This is a classic conspiracy theory that there's a guy who were a certain</v>

49
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:27.880
intelligence agency who compromises wealthy and famous and,

50
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:29.160
and even intellectuals,

51
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.000
famous people and then takes these people and brings 'em to an island where he

52
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:37.480
brings in a bunch of girls that are underage and they all. And then he films.

53
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:40.440
It he'd be like, what are you even talking about? Right. But this.

54
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.360
<v 0>Is, think that's real. What about his, the fact that he's number two.</v>

55
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:46.030
She's like in Israel or something. Since she she's not been arrested.

56
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:49.390
She's in Brazil, Brazil. Okay. Yeah. She's not arrested. How's that happening?

57
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.110
How is prince Philip not arrested? Yeah.

58
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.270
<v 1>How was she? Um, wandering around? Yeah. Like how they not whacked her. Right.</v>

59
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.950
Well, they.

60
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.110
<v 2>Had, I it's not right.</v>

61
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.880
But that part of the deal he made the first time was that he had,

62
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:05.360
I think at least four, if not more co-conspirators that are not allowed to be,

63
00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:07.160
or that's part of the deal is that they can't be arrested.

64
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.880
<v 0>How is he in a position to make deals? I'm not arguing with you.</v>

65
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:12.160
It doesn't make sense. Doesn't mean like, what leverage do you have?

66
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.200
You're like the one, the, the world's biggest pedophile ring. And it's like,

67
00:03:15.201 --> 00:03:19.630
all right, you can't arrest my people though. Oh, okay. That's fair MYM, sir.

68
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.190
We promise not to kill you in jail.

69
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.030
<v 1>I think maybe there's a concern that if maybe she listen,</v>

70
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.870
if I was gonna be the guy who writes the script,

71
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.870
I would say there's a dead switch. Yes.

72
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.870
And then if she dies, this gets out and she says,

73
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.180
listen, the moment I die, all this gets published. Epstein Powell.

74
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.014
She's under guard.

75
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.260
<v 0>They're protecting.</v>

76
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.540
<v 1>Her ex special forces guard. Why is that pictures of Michael Jackson?</v>

77
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.100
Is that like a pedophiles? Probably leaving Neverland. I think it's a different,

78
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.380
oh, is a different, they're putting that story.

79
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.213
<v 0>There. Oh,</v>

80
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.250
they're thinking the person watching this is a PDO really in the pedophilia must

81
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.103
be.

82
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.330
<v 1>Very strange. Dude.</v>

83
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.770
&lt;laugh&gt; Maxwell faces credible death threats and is being guarded by former U us

84
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.410
Navy seals and safe houses in the American Midwest. American pitches in Ohio.

85
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.570
Yeah. And shake shack. &lt;laugh&gt;.

86
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.650
<v 0>Like Sonic, if she's lucky. Good Lord.</v>

87
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.720
<v 1>I mean, all she has to do is dye her hair. People, Midwest don't even read.</v>

88
00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:24.360
They have no idea that she's there. Did you? Right. Am I right?

89
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.720
<v 2>They're not paying attention.</v>

90
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.400
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; did you see the, the prince Philip interview?</v>

91
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.840
<v 1>Yes. Oh my God.</v>

92
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.860
<v 0>So strange.</v>

93
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.600
<v 1>Oh, I loved it so much. So strange. He seems a little spec. Me, am I wrong?</v>

94
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.120
<v 0>Something's not right there. Something's wrong. Right.</v>

95
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:40.790
Because you're watching this and youre and he's like, oh yeah. I,

96
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.630
I cut off contact with him. They're like, well, there was a dinner in August.

97
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.470
Well, I was talking by then. You were the guest of honor. Oh,

98
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.950
well &lt;laugh&gt;. It was like, what the dude?

99
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.510
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.510
He seems like he's a little detached from reality in some sort of strange way.

101
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.100
Yeah.

102
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.790
<v 0>Well, your, your prince for that long,</v>

103
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:01.740
you're not gonna be able to begin in with, right.

104
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.260
<v 1>There's no way, like he's,</v>

105
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.260
you can't develop without trials and tribulations and become and come out

106
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:12.260
normal, especially when you're not just a famous person, but you're a Royal.

107
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.420
Yeah. Like when they asked him about hugging the girls, I'm a Royal, we don't,

108
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.660
uh, as it were hug,

109
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.010
we don't hug the best through a hole in the bar through.

110
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.690
<v 0>The best part. What if it, what do you wanna say?</v>

111
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.530
<v 2>That the Kevin Spacey stuff going on doesn't seem directly related,</v>

112
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.410
but it doesn't seem unrelated in any way.

113
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.570
<v 1>Kill him with Kyle. No.</v>

114
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.450
<v 0>It is somewhat related because this is one of those things where things are open</v>

115
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.730
secrets in, in Hollywood. And like, everyone kind of knows.

116
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.210
<v 1>Everyone knew that Kevin Spacey was a Dick grabber. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.760
<v 0>And it's kind of, then it's like, oh, you conspiracy theories.</v>

118
00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.520
Like you guys are comfortable with this. You.

119
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.400
<v 1>Well, that's a weird one, right? Because that's like, uh,</v>

120
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.200
we always heard of the, the wild artists that were doing things that were up,

121
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.720
but we kind of let them get away with it because they were really talented and

122
00:05:58.721 --> 00:06:02.400
there was no real proof. And what happened? God ad blocker.

123
00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:04.960
You Jesus. Uh,

124
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.960
financial financeer Jeffrey Epstein once flew bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to

125
00:06:09.961 --> 00:06:11.320
Africa. Oh Jesus.

126
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.760
<v 0>They Clinton really likes re let he want to the aids monkey. He's like, I try.</v>

127
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.870
I wanna to pay. I think I could.

128
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.070
<v 1>Fix it. I got that super Arkansas come.</v>

129
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.630
I could shoot it inside. That monkey start all over.

130
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.470
<v 0>Again. And I make mushrooms grow. What? I just on the floor.</v>

131
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.990
<v 1>Dude. He went with that guy at least 26,</v>

132
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.630
as many as 28 times in his plane, but say, Hey, I just flew a couple times.

133
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.540
My friend Jeffrey. Yeah. We're friends.

134
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.860
<v 0>I, I had one either Roderick on my show,</v>

135
00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:43.540
the one who had a rape accusation against him.

136
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.940
And I went in there hoping that she was lying. He raped her in the morning.

137
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.900
And it was like half an hour. Like she,

138
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:52.380
he went with her to her hotel room in Arkansas and it was,

139
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:54.540
I thought it was like gonna be like nine o'clock. They had a few drinks. No,

140
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.810
she was supposed to meeting with him about something it's horrible at these

141
00:06:57.811 --> 00:07:00.130
people get away with. And I think Americans. So you think.

142
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 1>He physically like held her down? Yes. Raped.</v>

143
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.250
<v 0>Her. And then he, no, he bit her lip, just like a cat to keep her from yelling.</v>

144
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.570
And then when he left, the last thing he says there,

145
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:12.370
you better put some mice on that. And another woman who accused him really of,

146
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.730
I think it was Kathleen, Willie who accused him of forcing herself on him.

147
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.930
He bit her lip too.

148
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.560
And the would never knew each other before they independently had the same, uh,

149
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.080
um, thing that he does. He bites their.

150
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.040
<v 1>Lips. So they don't scream.</v>

151
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.960
<v 0>Or he just bites their lips cuz it's hot to get, you know, whatever,</v>

152
00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.520
that's his thing. Oh jeez Christ. The thing that Americans don't get,

153
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.840
which they are increasingly starting to get is that people in power are often

154
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:41.310
really depraved and they use their power in sadistic ways and they get

155
00:07:41.311 --> 00:07:44.110
off on not having consequences. It's not just being corrupt. Like, oh,

156
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:47.750
I'm getting a kickback for hiring my cousin. It's so much worse than that.

157
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.470
And they're starting to see it now with like the Amy Roach thing. Who's that?

158
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.430
She's that ABC news reporter, the footage leaked where she's just like,

159
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.950
we had the whole Epstein story. We had prince Philip,

160
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:00.740
we had bill Clinton and the lawyers killed it. And she was just,

161
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.620
and she was like that she didn't get the scoop, but it's, and she's like,

162
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:07.300
I a hundred percent think he was killed. And it's like, yeah,

163
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:09.460
this is what they're like when the cameras are off. Right.

164
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.260
<v 1>Um, the, the Clinton thing is so weird, right?</v>

165
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:15.460
Because you have Hillary,

166
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.420
who was this woman who was going to be the first woman, president,

167
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:20.883
everyone was behind her.

168
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.570
And we're all thinking that she represents hope and change and all the wonderful

169
00:08:24.571 --> 00:08:28.010
things that the progressives want. Sure. But then she's got this husband, right?

170
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:33.210
She got this husband a lot of weird accusations. Right. And when,

171
00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:35.890
when they had that debate and Trump brought those women yep.

172
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:39.930
To sit out in front, I was like, I know he did. Oh yeah. Oh no. He,

173
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.180
yeah.

174
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.360
<v 0>And Melania was wearing a bow. Was she? Yeah. It's a certain type of K notch.</v>

175
00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:46.194
She had a. Bow.

176
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.120
<v 1>Is a special kind of knot called a bow. Yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

177
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.280
<v 0>Whoa. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So there's, there's a lot of up in Jeff Jeffrey.</v>

178
00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:55.680
Every I.

179
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.640
<v 1>We're, he was a good guy. He sported science.</v>

180
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.400
Believe them dancing it up.

181
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.450
There's Jaine how you say it. Is that her? Is that Melania Jalan? Yeah.

182
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.730
Or I don't know. Jalan Herlan is that Melania? Yeah.

183
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.730
<v 0>That's Melania think I'm pretty sure. Oh, and who's that in the back, right?</v>

184
00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:14.570
That looks like lady da.

185
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.640
<v 1>Something. This lady die came back as a photographer. &lt;laugh&gt; she's not dead.</v>

186
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.440
She's hiding with Elvis. She's.

187
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.440
<v 0>Hiding with Epstein in, in Brazil or over he is God just awful, awful people.</v>

188
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.120
<v 1>It's just amazing that you could still whack somebody as high profile as Epstein</v>

189
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.680
publicly in this day and age that you could say, oh, the cameras didn't work.

190
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:34.720
Well, the guards, oh, they went around. We didn't.

191
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.790
<v 0>Hear anything. SW Soleimani. That's different. It in, in a way,</v>

192
00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:41.630
it is in a way it's not. Cause people will do it. Whatever they need to,

193
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:42.390
to maintain us.

194
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.990
<v 1>Power. We think that these people are in control. Like when we're,</v>

195
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:47.630
we're watching this, we see you're.

196
00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:50.230
We think that the guards are in control and the prison's in control and they've

197
00:09:50.231 --> 00:09:52.270
got this captive and they're gonna bring him to the justice system.

198
00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:54.870
Cause the justice system wants to hear his case. Sure. They want him to testify.

199
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.420
There's law. Lot of other moving pieces, a lot of players we're very interested.

200
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.700
See what kind of horrible crimes are committed by these elites that, you know,

201
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.620
and then all of a sudden he gets killed.

202
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.220
But so they do it right out in front of everybody's nose. What.

203
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.260
<v 0>Happened with Jack Ruby?</v>

204
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.260
<v 1>Oh, same thing. It's just.</v>

205
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.140
<v 0>Like how this is the most important person on earth right now to keep safe and</v>

206
00:10:14.141 --> 00:10:14.980
you're not doing it right.

207
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.010
<v 1>Jack Ruby just run up and shoots him in the gut. Yeah. Bang.</v>

208
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.090

209
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.370
E even if all the conspiracy theories are wrong,

210
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.890
how are you up so bad that this is allowed to happen?
