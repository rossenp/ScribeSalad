<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 2>Garrett Vanden Bush said,</v>

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.840
this is going to become a pandemic of variants and he talked about immune escape

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.240
and that has been very controversial, but they're explaining it to people.

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.080
Sure. What he argued. And let's just say,

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
could you explain who he is to sure. He is a, uh,

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.890
immuno biologist. He is training is veterinary. Um,

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.720
he has training in the relevant area, uh, of vaccination technology.

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.180
He was a guest on dark horse. People can look up my discussion with him. Uh,

10
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:43.800
it is, um, many people regard it as a very good way, uh,

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.540
to understand what he's saying, because often he speaks, uh,

12
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.930
about matters that are quite technical. And anyway,

13
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:53.430
I did my best in that podcast to make it non-technical so that people could

14
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:55.410
understand it in any case.

15
00:00:55.411 --> 00:01:00.150
What he argued was that the

16
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.160
fact of these vaccines being very narrowly targeted, right?

17
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.760
<v 0>These vaccines contain a single sub unit of a single protein.</v>

18
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.540
And they're being deployed in a way that is unusual.

19
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:16.080
They're being deployed into an active pandemic, right?

20
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.750
When we immunized against something like measles,

21
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.530
the expectation is you will develop your full immunity with almost no chance of

22
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:24.810
encountering measles, right?

23
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.980
In this case that we have our vaccines that are leaky in which they do not

24
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:33.630
provide full sterilizing immunity, they are narrow. And,

25
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.180
um, we are effectively creating an intense evolutionary pressure to cause the

26
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:43.830
spike protein of which this one sub unit is what is contained the

27
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:45.690
information for it is contained in the vaccines.

28
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.890
We are putting intense evolutionary pressure on it to change so that the

29
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.360
antibodies and other immune cell recognition mechanisms that

30
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.130
are trained by the vaccines are incapable of finding the pathogen.

31
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.350
When it gets in,

32
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.380
this is what causes a breakthrough cases that the immunity that's been created

33
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.450
is evaded by the pathogen. And if the pathogen changes, um, that is more likely.

34
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.800
And so what he said was,

35
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.330
if you vaccinate into an active pandemic with vaccines like this,

36
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.130
what you will get is a evolutionary pressure for a

37
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:24.720
radiation of variants and evolutionary radiation of, um,

38
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.120
different molecular signatures changes in the spike protein that will then

39
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.990
cause the vaccines to be less and less effective at producing immunity,

40
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.140
which is exactly what we see. So he predicted this. Absolutely.

41
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.590
He did predict accurately accurate, accurately predicted it.

42
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.950
Now is every component of his model, correct?

43
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.690
That's a much harder question to answer,

44
00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:50.160
but what I would say is any time somebody succeeds in predicting

45
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:54.510
better than the so-called experts, you want to know how they did it.

46
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.950
And he was making absolute evolutionary sense, right?

47
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.640
His concerns were very well honed and he was making sense.

48
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.980
And then the world that he predicted emerged,

49
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.740
and it is now incumbent on us to say, okay,

50
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.130
have we learned anything from this? Right?

51
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.900
Do the vaccines need to be modified such that they don't produce this effect?

52
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.170
There are conceivable ways you could do that. Right? But if we don't do it,

53
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.350
if we just say, well, more of the same, have a booster of the same thing,

54
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.040
it's not going to solve the problem. So in effect,

55
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.210
what I would say is these vaccines are a

56
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.290
spectacular achievement, but they are a prototype, right?

57
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.600
They have achieved something that had never been done before.

58
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.710
Technologically that's remarkable, but they were not ready for prime time.

59
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.380
And they have failed to produce lasting immunity.

60
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.390
They have produced very narrow immunity.

61
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.650
It does not compare to the natural immunity that people get from having had and

62
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.840
beaten the disease. And what's more,

63
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.490
we have learned an awful lot about how the disease can be managed.

64
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.980
So it's much less lethal, right?

65
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.360
That combination suggests that we need a rethinking of our approach.

66
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.930
And you know, it is impossible to prove,

67
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.700
but based on what people who have successfully treated the disease and have

68
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.260
successfully predicted events like the proliferation of variants are telling us,

69
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.180
it does seem that we now have the tools at our disposal to manage this crisis

70
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.320
and do away with it, which I don't know why we don't do that,

71
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.300
but it is at least worth noting that we're we to successfully manage

72
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:35.920
it. It would interrupt a huge flow of revenue

73
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.580
into this brand new pharma market.

74
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.050
Is that the reason that we don't do it? I don't know, but we,

75
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.880
the public need to recognize our interests are not being served by

76
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.440
the public health apparatus. It is making errors that it doesn't need to make.

77
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.060
And that, that, um,

78
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.700
has implications for all of our individual health and our collective wellbeing

79
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.490
that, uh, require a rethink Watson.
