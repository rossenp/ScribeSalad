00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.800
So you made a movie about the story that you told on the podcast about a guy

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.840
who pretended that he was from Yale and you,

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.200
and then you found out later in your relationship that he was not,

5
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.200
and he was completely full. Yeah. I told.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.240
<v 1>That story on your podcast couple years ago.</v>

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.360
And I was trying to think if that was the first time I'd ever been on your

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.750
podcast in this iteration, like as the huge Joe Rogan experience podcast.

9
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.510
And I couldn't remember if I'd been on it before, prior.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.470
<v 0>To that. I think you had. I.</v>

11
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.550
<v 1>Think so too, but I think I was like,</v>

12
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.150
that would be the perfect book end to this story.

13
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.390
Cuz the first time I told it in its totality was here and then

14
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.420
here I am and I've made this movie.

15
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.100
<v 0>It's such a crazy story. Yeah. The fact that the guy that,</v>

16
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:48.620
that really was what he was doing, he was just completely lying. Yeah.

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.020
About his background and who he was. And, but it worked for a little while.

18
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.140
<v 1>Well, you know, sorry.</v>

19
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.380
I remember when I told the story and of course the feedback's all like you're.

20
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.780
<v 0>A dumb. Roy,</v>

21
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.690
is there a woman don't about anything &lt;laugh&gt;.

22
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.250
<v 1>And so I was just like, okay,</v>

23
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:09.450
I gotta be careful in the way that I parse out this narrative. And my answer is,

24
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.250
you know, there's red flags that we're taught to think about. You know,

25
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.730
you're walking down the street in New York city and someone gives you a look,

26
00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:20.450
you got red flags, right. You're at a, um, you're doing a business deal.

27
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:24.240
There's red flags in a, you know, because of music and TV,

28
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.760
we're all thought to think about cheating. Right. And lying in that way.

29
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.760
I meet you randomly. And in the first five minutes, I'm like,

30
00:01:30.761 --> 00:01:33.680
where'd you go to school? What do you do? I wouldn't,

31
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.800
I don't wanna be the kind of person that has a radar up because these weren't

32
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.280
lies. Like I'm the king of Spain. I have a fleet of yachts at my disposal.

33
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.950
It was like, I went to Yale, just like my cousin did. And I do hedge funds,

34
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.110
like okay. Normal, normal.

35
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.430
And that's how these kind of people get by. And so.

36
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.110
<v 0>These weren't, you.</v>

37
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.790
<v 1>Met this guy on a plane, right? An airplane,</v>

38
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.110
an airplane as if there's a different just grassy plane,

39
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.470
specifically an airplane.

40
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.580
<v 0>Not a into, he was sitting next to you. I was.</v>

41
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.060
<v 1>Coming over Thanksgiving. Oh. I was just on my family.</v>

42
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.700
Some of them are on the east coast and I, my big thing as a con,

43
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:13.780
like I always my whole career, I spend the money on the travel.

44
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.060
Like that's a great investment.

45
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.100
Like buy that first class ticket when you travel so much, I'm like,

46
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:18.934
that's where the money goes.

47
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.860
And you're usually sitting next to someone who looks like your dad in first

48
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:27.610
class. It's I seldom that I, and this was, I was probably 29 at the time,

49
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.370
28, 29, seldom. You're sitting next to someone around your age, you know?

50
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.530
And here's a guy.

51
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.370
And so we just start talking cuz we're this around the same age. Um, and that,

52
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.770
and we just got along super. He was funny. He was dorky, but smart,

53
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:43.610
like just a cool guy. And I,

54
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.680
he had a girlfriend and I had a boy picking me up at the airport and I think we

55
00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:49.480
exchanged like Twitter handles mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like this,

56
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:53.000
wasn't like a salacious, like give me your details. Mm. And I was like,

57
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.560
if you and your girlfriend ever wanna come to a show, you know, you're a comic,

58
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:58.480
you get it. Like comedy store. I get paid the same way either way.

59
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.920
So come on down to the store, but we became friends.

60
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.320
And what made it easy was when you're comic, you keep such odd hours.

61
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.080
Like how many times have you eaten dinner at like one in the morning?

62
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.400
And you're like a duo for protein.

63
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.960
<v 0>Late at night. I usually don't eat at night. All right, cool.</v>

64
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 1>I intermittent fast too. That that's what I do.</v>

65
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.093
<v 0>On it.</v>

66
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.313
<v 1>Uh.</v>

67
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.470
<v 0>But okay. You do my voice on it.</v>

68
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.630
<v 1>I think it's just my generic beefy guy. That could be you. That could be me,</v>

69
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:28.590
bro. What you don't understand is that it's just a structure within a democracy,

70
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.710
which is a manmade construct. Whoa.

71
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.070
<v 0>Is that good? It's not bad. It's not bad. It's not bad. I'd have to,</v>

72
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.430
I'd have to. It's a pro talk. That's like bro, bro.

73
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.340
Paul pro grow intelligent talk. Yeah. So what did this guy actually do?

74
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:45.740
What was his actual job? He.

75
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.260
<v 1>Worked at a hedge fund. Um,</v>

76
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.540
and I mean, who checks? That would a person who works at a hedge fund,

77
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.340
know the difference between a club headliner and a theater headline,

78
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.770
like there's level. Like why? Okay.

79
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:05.930
That sounds really boring and whatever I get that that's with numbers and.

80
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.850
<v 0>And money. But he went to a college. You went to.</v>

81
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.730
<v 1>A college, just not that one just.</v>

82
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.450
<v 0>Lied about Yale, right? Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.570
<v 1>That's what I found out way later.</v>

84
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.450
<v 0>Work at a hedge fund. Yeah. But.</v>

85
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.010
<v 1>I think it was like super low level. Like he made it like, oh,</v>

86
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:22.840
I'm starting my own. And you know, you're 29 years old.

87
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:26.360
You're sitting in a first class seat and you're dressed like a dork and you're

88
00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:28.000
talking, why wouldn't I believe you.

89
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.560
I have plenty of friends who are successful at things. Yeah.

90
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.880
Other than stand up and most, you know, so.

91
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.280
<v 0>But my, my point was that if he just was himself yes. And he just said,</v>

92
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.150
I'm working at a hedge fund and was the same guy, just as thousand people.

93
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.110
<v 1>Like that is the you completely keyed in on it.</v>

94
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.990
The whole takeaway from the movie is all the things that he didn't lie about

95
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.590
were the things that I actually valued the most. He was,

96
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.150
you cannot fake intelligence. You cannot fake sense of humor. Right?

97
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:58.510
You cannot fake wit. Right.

98
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.750
<v 0>And he had those, he had those things.</v>

99
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.700
<v 1>He was unattractive,</v>

100
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.740
which is probably a big source of his insecurity and whatever else society put

101
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:07.021
on him.

102
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:12.020
But that was the sad part was I wasn't that impressed by going to a good

103
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:14.980
school and having a job I've never heard of. Right. Hey, you just said, like,

104
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.380
I went to this regular school and I do this.

105
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.620
I still would've said come to the comedy store. I still would've had drinks.

106
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.250
So the that's a, it's not a shame cuz I,

107
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.490
I really am into my husband &lt;laugh&gt; and the way that that worked out.

108
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.170
But that's the weird,

109
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.650
the sad part is that we put rather than just be good at something,

110
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.850
someone just like lied and built a whole world around it.

111
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.090
<v 0>Have you kept in, in touch with that guy?</v>

112
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.770
<v 1>Oh yeah. We hang out all the time. No. Oh my God.</v>

113
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.480
<v 0>No, but I mean, so gross. No, I mean he's never reached out and said, Hey,</v>

114
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:47.280
I heard that story. No, nothing.

115
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.833
<v 1>I uh.</v>

116
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.640
<v 0>No. How long did you date him? For.</v>

117
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.040
<v 1>Only three months. We were friends for a full year,</v>

118
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:59.680
which is why it kind, it, you don't question your friends as much.

119
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.960
Right. And here's someone that always showed up the dudes in my group.

120
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:05.640
Like all the comics that you know, that I'm friends, like they've all met him.

121
00:06:05.641 --> 00:06:09.480
Like we go out drinking and my schedule is so weird. So I'd be like,

122
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:12.080
I need to get dinner at like 11. He'd be down for it. I was like, great.

123
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.360
This got a mallable schedule. And we were friends for that year.

124
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.870
I have best friends in LA and I've been to their apartment twice right.

125
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.950
In 15 years. So you're not, um,

126
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.070
checking on things because I just take it.

127
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.030
It's normal at face value where you live and stuff like that. And to be honest,

128
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.950
the, the closer he became his friends, the more he like, he was like, look,

129
00:06:31.951 --> 00:06:34.910
I really like you. And we would always, you know, you're in your twenties.

130
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:38.540
So you're going out drinking. I never wanted to go to his house.

131
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.100
Like he would meet me at my condo and we would go,

132
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.460
or my friends would come over because I was like,

133
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:47.900
there's no reason if you know that if I know you like me and I don't like you,

134
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.820
there's no reason for me to go to your house.

135
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.580
Like you wanna very wise of you on neutral territory. It's not,

136
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.540
I'm not afraid of my physical safety, but in terms of messaging,

137
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.290
I think that's a little, I don't like you,

138
00:06:58.291 --> 00:07:00.330
but I'll get drunk and hang out in your room.

139
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.250
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; we're not doing that. I got a house smart. It was a bar.

140
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:05.770
Right, right. And I was very honest the whole time. I'm like,

141
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.770
I'm just not there yet. And I do go on dates. I like how you said yet.

142
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.010
<v 0>Though. It's like, oh, so you're saying there's a chance &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

143
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.770
<v 1>Uh, that was,</v>

144
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.560
I think I was just until you're saying there's a chance &lt;laugh&gt; which how guys

145
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:22.640
think. Yeah. But I was very honest, very honest in, in being like, look I,

146
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.120
so there was.

147
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.320
<v 0>A chance cuz you wound up getting together with him.</v>

148
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.600
<v 1>Yeah. But I didn't see it that way. That's like.</v>

149
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.760
<v 0>Ah, but you.</v>

150
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.880
<v 1>Get it. I mean, that's,</v>

151
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:35.280
you're talking about an eventuality that no one could foresee because I was

152
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:39.510
dating other people. Right, right. Consistency was key. I but actually.

153
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.390
<v 0>Why dudes will hang out in that friend zone. I.</v>

154
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.870
<v 1>Hear that. And I would always say, I'm not into you.</v>

155
00:07:45.871 --> 00:07:48.390
In fact I'm going on a date tonight. But by the way, if you,

156
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.630
if you can't handle that and you don't wanna be my friend, that's okay.

157
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.350
I would give him these outs. Right. And the truth is I wasn't into him.

158
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.380
We were very closest friends. And then he told me his mom had cancer.

159
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.420
<v 0>Oh, I remember this.</v>

160
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.500
<v 1>Part. Right. So as a human and as a woman, you know,</v>

161
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:11.540
like there's a vulnerability that he cried probably thinking about.

162
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.860
He's probably crying about what a good liar he is. But like his.

163
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.700
<v 0>Mom didn't really have cancer. No. Yeah. That's, what's up. I remember this and.</v>

164
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.090
<v 1>I forgot that part of it. I met her. We had just so like, you know,</v>

165
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.090
my heart opened up and you can't, as a woman, you can become,

166
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.370
this is my big thing.

167
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.890
You can become attracted to a man who are physically not attracted to because of

168
00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:34.930
personality men. It doesn't work. Joe.

169
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.050
You've never been like that girl is a warthog,

170
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.730
but it turns out she's really funny. So I do want to put my mouth on hers.

171
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.680
Like you've never in your life been like, but you got a great personality,

172
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.680
but girls do. It's just, we are cerebral mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know,

173
00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:53.440
and men are very visual. And so it was all the kindness. How smart,

174
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.880
how funny all this stuff, mom got cancer. I'm like, oh my God, I,

175
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.680
I need to be there for this person. Who's been nothing,

176
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:03.600
but kind to me as a human and my heart opened up whatever.

177
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:08.520
And uh, I met her. It was around the holidays. And so we, uh, yeah,

178
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:10.240
because we met in November and this was,

179
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.440
I remember I was going like Christmas craft shopping. And uh, we met at,

180
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.350
at like a craft store and she was there and I'd never,

181
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.710
you know, she has cancer. And he said, she's very sick.

182
00:09:21.711 --> 00:09:25.190
So I didn't wanna be indelicate. I didn't wanna be like, how'd you cancer,

183
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.430
Susan? You know? So I remember asking her like, how are you feeling?

184
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.150
And of course this woman's like feeling fine.

185
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.830
Mm-hmm why have you heard otherwise?

186
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.120
<v 0>Oh.</v>

187
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.180
<v 1>God. And we only talked for like a half hour, you know?</v>

188
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:40.020
And I remember at the time thinking like, oh, this is a guy that I really like,

189
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:43.940
and I, if she's gonna die, I want her to know that her, her son is with someone.

190
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:46.820
Who's kind. I remember thinking that, wow.

191
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.480
<v 0>Because.</v>

192
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.180
<v 1>That's so heavy. &lt;laugh&gt;, it's so heavy.</v>

193
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.740
And I didn't find out that she didn't have the cancer until after I realized all

194
00:09:54.741 --> 00:09:56.570
the lies and I broken it off. Oh my God.

195
00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.650
I ran into some mutual friends and I was like, I just, you know, he's a loser.

196
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:01.050
I can, he.

197
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.970
<v 0>Must be in literally insane. That's an insane person.</v>

198
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.970
<v 1>He's an insane person. But also the story is so insane.</v>

199
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.970
And you so have to tread lightly as a woman because people find fault,

200
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.490
no matter what you do. Like, I remember someone saying like, well,

201
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.040
you are a gold Digger. And I was like, how's that? Now?

202
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.760
Like I've made a bunch of my own money since I was like 25.

203
00:10:21.761 --> 00:10:22.920
You can't pay attention to that. No,

204
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.840
but it opened my eyes up to the perception just of when you tell a story,

205
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.360
that's so honest, the feedback that you get and you're like, okay,

206
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.000
let me control this narrative. So that's why in the movie,

207
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.390
she's not some struggle. I put her as like a,

208
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.310
mostly successful to show like this doesn't like she needed anything. Right.

209
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.990
A lot of articles were like, she was so strong. It's like, no, no,

210
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:49.950
she just didn't wake up and.

211
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.110
<v 0>Die. I wonder what other lies that guy.</v>

212
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.190
Cuz that's not a guy who's done that for the first time.

213
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.540
Like if someone's lying about their having cancer. Oh my God.

214
00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.460
It's such a crazy lie. Such.

215
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.500
<v 1>Bad karma. What.</v>

216
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.500
<v 0>What a, what bad energy to go through life like that?</v>

217
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:08.540
It's like the momentum of all those lies must be like inescapable.

218
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:13.300
Like how does one stop and become an honest person when you are lying about that

219
00:11:13.301 --> 00:11:16.380
many things and intimate things like your mother. Yes.

220
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.410
The person who gave life to you,

221
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.890
you're lying and saying that she has cancer so that a girl will like you more.

222
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.090
Yeah. It's really insane. Super beta and it's well, it's, it's a pattern.

223
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:32.330
That's a strange pattern because like what makes people lie? You know,

224
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.560
uh.

225
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.450
<v 1>Feeling insufficient. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,</v>

226
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:39.960
feeling that you and this is for better or for worse,

227
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.040
we hold men to a certain standard in our society.

228
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.120
I'm not excusing this behavior. I'm just saying, you know,

229
00:11:46.121 --> 00:11:49.600
men who don't want to be sensitive or don't wanna cry or are afraid to show

230
00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:52.200
vulnerability because we have this like macho archetype,

231
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.480
most women don't actually expect that.

232
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.480
And they want you to be yourself and open up. And, but we do just,

233
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.480
as we put things on women,

234
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.240
we do put things on men and we don't have conversations about that.

235
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.200
The difference is men don't realize like, all you gotta do is go out.

236
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.960
I talk about this on stage and like, just be good at something.

237
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.310
And there will be a girl who will like ride or die with you in your Toyota

238
00:12:13.311 --> 00:12:16.470
passenger seat. Like that's my baby. He's the best mustache grower.

239
00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:21.670
Like be all these comics that we're talking about. They all funny guys.

240
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.950
So you could be funny. You don't have to be attractive. You could just be kind.

241
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.470
You could just be good at like magic the gathering. There's a girl.

242
00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:33.980
That's cool that, but some people just think if I P posture and I lie,

243
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.020
I'll get the kind of girl I deserve.

244
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.380
<v 0>Don't you think it's also that kind of like financial world,</v>

245
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.900
like the financial world is very much about field a sociopath.

246
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:45.380
There's a lot of that. Sure.

247
00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.780
But it's all about like what kind of car do you drive?

248
00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:51.780
What kind of watch do you have? Where's your, where's your house? You know,

249
00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:55.250
what, how much money are you making much? Did you make last year? What's your,

250
00:12:55.251 --> 00:12:56.930
what's your end goal? So those.

251
00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.970
<v 1>Archetypes like that patina of a person, right?</v>

252
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:03.290
Like you have to be the what's his name in American. Psycho. Yeah.

253
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.090
Patrick Bateman, Patrick Bateman.

254
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.970
Having to be that and in the whole movies about that expectation.

255
00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:11.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, the business card, things like that. I mean,

256
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.760
I didn't include, he told me he was in skull and bones.

257
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.600
Oh Christ. And I remember thinking like, I don't know, that's a pretty,

258
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:24.280
that's a pretty big secret &lt;laugh&gt; people. And he invited me. He's like,

259
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:27.440
I'm going to London for like a reunion, like an event. Do you wanna come?

260
00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.400
And I was like, sort of, but I do need my own room.

261
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.280
Like I'm not gonna share a room with you.

262
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.190
And then of course he ended up not going, of course,

263
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.270
but there are things where they're so outta my room,

264
00:13:39.271 --> 00:13:42.590
like I am not in Scullin bones and it seems so foreign.

265
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.910
So you fit the bill, I guess you could be.

266
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.590
<v 0>I think wouldn't you think you'd be more successful if you in S SCO bones,</v>

267
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.230
isn't that one of those things where you're connected to all those? Uh, well,

268
00:13:53.231 --> 00:13:53.610
how do you gauge.

269
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.900
<v 1>How successful someone is by their car? Because he drove a really nice car.</v>

270
00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:00.260
Did he? And I never saw his house and he dressed well and he spoke.

271
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.220
<v 0>Like, oh, okay. So you thought he was very successful?</v>

272
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.220
<v 1>I just, he presented as a kid that I went to school with, but.</v>

273
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.060
<v 0>He obviously was kind of doing well, if he did work for a hedge fund, right.</v>

274
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.620
<v 1>Anyone, they will let almost anyone sign a lease. Yeah.</v>

275
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.810
<v 0>Nice car. What kind of car was? It was like.</v>

276
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.290
<v 1>An Audi. I couldn't tell you what kind mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; was a nice car.</v>

277
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.490
It's an yeah. Huh.

278
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.450
<v 0>So doing pretty good. I guess.</v>

279
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.210
<v 1>So. But I also like, wasn't so impressed. Like I had.</v>

280
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.090
<v 0>My own condo. You don't give a. Anyway. If a guy had a Porsche and he lived in.</v>

281
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:30.270
<v 1>Amazing,</v>

282
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:35.210
my husband drives a Mazda and I drive a Honda civic hybrid that I tell people

283
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.680
I wanna land comic standing. You still have that.

284
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:38.840
<v 0>That's. How reflect you.</v>

285
