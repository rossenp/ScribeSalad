00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.030
How long do you think until Trump comes on this podcast, he's not going to,

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.660
you're not going to.

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.040
<v 1>Happen. Don't think so. I don't think so.</v>

5
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.660
<v 0>Even a couple months, maybe though.</v>

6
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.270
<v 1>Hmm. Y I, you know, he's, he's going to try to run again. I think. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:17.040
I think he's going to do that Patriot party thing.

8
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.650
That's what I think he's going to do something.

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.120
You're going to come up with some name for it,

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
but Patriot party seems right up his alley. Yeah.

11
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990
Like that seems like the kind of party that a guy was a gold toilet would come

12
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:31.470
up with. That's the name I go to imagine he has a gold toilet.

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.590
He calls it the Patriot party. It's probably going to do a,

14
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.130
do his first press conference on American flag tie.

15
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.350
<v 0>I'm going to do well if he does,</v>

16
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.690
but I don't think it's going to go to as well as it did last time.

17
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.400
<v 1>It would have done much better if it wasn't for the Capitol hill attack,</v>

18
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.210
the Capitol hill attacks sunk his battleship.

19
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.460
I think that's a wrap. Yeah.

20
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.260
I think that's a wrap for him and his aspirations there.

21
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.420
First of all, they're never going to let that die.

22
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.130
They have this thing that he did that is this real, it's a real thing.

23
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.390
He really did say, we need to show strength March towards the Capitol.

24
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.610
He really did incite these people to do this.

25
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.560
And a lot of the people that did do it,

26
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.040
they're using him saying that as their legal defense,

27
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.410
the people that got arrested, they say Trump told us to.

28
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.390
<v 0>It's, bro. And now he's immune to all these lawsuits.</v>

29
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.130
I bet he's just going to have piles of work.

30
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
<v 1>He's not immune to lawsuits. Yeah. Yeah. He's yeah. He's well,</v>

31
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:35.520
he's also in trouble because whatever lawsuits he, like, he can never part,

32
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.910
he could have never pardoned himself from the lawsuits, from the state.

33
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.400
So the state, like all the criminal charges, the state was filing against him.

34
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.500
We're always going to be possible.

35
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.400
And New York state apparently is filing a bunch of against him.

36
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.400
They're not going to let them go, man. It's going to be rough. Right?

37
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.960
You want to be a rough time. Probably jail time.

38
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.740
I imagine he should have pardoned. Snowden should have pardoned, Snowden and.

39
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.670
Pardon? Julian Assange. They mean they're coming after him. Anyway.

40
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.151
He should have,

41
00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:06.870
at least he would have got the support of a lot of people on the left.

42
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.110
At least he would have got the support of a lot of people that,

43
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.540
that could have at least acknowledged the positive things that he

44
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.890
did. Like the fact, oh yeah. The economy was kicking before COVID oh yeah.

45
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.390
Unemployment was down. Oh yeah. Deregulation does have some benefits, but yeah,

46
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:29.190
he did bad things. But, but, but this is, you know, this is real, but no,

47
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.740
one's even gonna talk about those things now. Like that's, you you'll,

48
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:34.080
you'll hear it from some Republicans. That'll bring up.

49
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.990
What about the good things that Trump did and they'll have like some Fox news

50
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:39.510
segments or the disgusting and you know,

51
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.430
OAN that network and Newsmax they'll, they'll try to beat it down.

52
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.420
But at the end of the day, that Capitol hill thing, that's, that's a wrap.

53
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.480
<v 0>I'm surprised he didn't do tiger king man. Like, you know,</v>

54
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.640
like that guy was trying so hard.

55
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.170
<v 1>I think he said that Trump said that he thought Trump, well,</v>

56
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:01.080
he thought the Trump felt like he was too gay to pardon
