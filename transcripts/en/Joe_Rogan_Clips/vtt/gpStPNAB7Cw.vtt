00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.020
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's,</v>

2
00:00:03.021 --> 00:00:05.790
it's interesting to me that that's the thing that we look forward to the most,

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.370
to the average person, if they thinks about, they think about space,

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.590
they think about intelligent life that is far more interesting to them than the

5
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:17.400
fact that there's black holes out there that are powering planets.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.980
They're sucking stars into its event,

7
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:24.690
horizon this infinite point of density that we can't even really begin to

8
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.740
imagine with our own little.

9
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.440
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And, uh,</v>

10
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.450
and the fact that all of this arose without a guiding intelligence, you know,

11
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:36.200
that there are black holes and there are active galactic nuclei,

12
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.820
and there are black holes slamming into each other creating gravitational waves

13
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:42.440
that we can actually detect. I mean,

14
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.690
it is a wonderfully rich reality that we are fortunate to be

15
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:48.230
part.

16
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.650
<v 0>Of. Do you experience much pushback or a much, uh,</v>

17
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.260
conflict from religious people who don't like the fact that you describe things

18
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:01.550
in that way that they didn't need an intelligent force or intelligent creator

19
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.900
to, that's.

20
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.610
<v 1>An interesting question because, um, the biological community,</v>

21
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.950
people like Richard Dawkins and the like,

22
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.900
I think have really borne the brunt of the religious pushback

23
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.050
because they're dealing directly with the phenomena of life.

24
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.060
And that's the precious commodity that somehow we want to be sacred and

25
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:26.450
therefore our religious sensibility will push back on it,

26
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:29.750
just being the mindless laws of physics and evolution yielding, you know,

27
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:30.770
life on planet earth.

28
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.500
They haven't pushed as hard on the quantum physicists and the cosmologists

29
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.260
as they have on the biologist. But I have had conversations. Many of them are,

30
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:46.220
are, are, are respectful as opposed to antagonistic where the view

31
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:50.960
is that I am wrong, headed that I am missing the point.

32
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.000
And some of these religious folks are fantastically accomplished

33
00:01:56.001 --> 00:02:00.230
scientists. That's weird. Yeah. I mean, I went to a gathering,

34
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.780
I think it can talk about now it was closed door gathering.

35
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.600
You weren't meant to describe you don't get two or three of them really opened

36
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:10.460
myself up. And, um, and uh, I thought it was, it was signed.

37
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.320
It was called science and the spiritual quest.

38
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.100
And it was a bunch of scientists that were being brought together.

39
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.020
And I thought it was going to be an interesting,

40
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:20.180
but ultimately one note meeting,

41
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.160
I thought everybody's going to basically say the same thing.

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.620
There could be a God, there's no evidence for a God.

43
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:27.920
We've got the laws of physics and we're going to just press forward under the

44
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:32.000
assumption that physics is all there is until the clouds part and God reveals

45
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:35.120
him or herself or itself to us. And at that point we may change our tune.

46
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.920
It was not one note.

47
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.480
I was the only person who had that perspective in the room.

48
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.610
Everybody else was coming out religion from a very different way of

49
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.260
thinking about the world. In fact,

50
00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:53.000
there's one Nobel Laureate in the room who got up and sang Psalms as

51
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.730
part of his presentation. And I was sitting there and I was like,

52
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.090
what is happening here? This is so unexpected to me.

53
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:05.920
And what it really meant was I was so closed-minded into the varieties of

54
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:10.510
religious engagement that happened in the world and it opened my eyes.

55
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.990
And this one Nobel Laureate in particular, I did say to him at the end, I said,

56
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.320
when you look at me and you hear my view, what do you think?

57
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.300
And he kind of put his arm around me in an avuncular way and said, you know,

58
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:26.950
you're, you're a real smart guy and you don't understand the true

59
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.840
reality. And, um,

60
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.250
I think ultimately you will cause you're open-minded and you're on a journey.

61
00:03:33.251 --> 00:03:36.460
And I hope that your journey will finally take you to the place where I have

62
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.930
been for for many years,

63
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.120
that was so unexpected that this Nobel Laureate who I respected for his,

64
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.650
his concrete mathematical and experimental work saw the world

65
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.460
completely.

66
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.510
<v 2>Differently. Now what's the spectrum of belief. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

67
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.630
<v 1>Absolutely. But I was the one who was far.</v>

68
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.820
<v 3>Out, I was the one who was untethered. Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.440
<v 1>I mean, I came in there. I was like, whoa. You know, and, and, and, and, and,</v>

70
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.250
and clearly they arranged the meeting to have a spectrum of perspectives.

71
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.461
I mean,

72
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:10.870
this is not something that was randomly designed and it just so happened. Uh,

73
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.190
but it was an eye-opener. And I, and from that, I rent to read, do you know,

74
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:17.740
William James, his book, uh, varieties of religious experience.

75
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.090
So it's a book that William James great psychologist wrote in 1902.

76
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.380
And it was based on a series of lectures. I think he gave in Scotland. Um,

77
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.720
and it is the most heartfelt and rational approach

78
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.900
to religion and science that I think has ever been written. And yet,

79
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:39.640
most people don't know much about it because what he does is he goes

80
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:43.720
through and he documents through his own research and through reading

81
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:45.940
biographies and interviewing individuals,

82
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.280
the vastly different ways that people think about religion and why they

83
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:56.170
think about religion and the value that religion has in their lives. And, and,

84
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.560
and when you read that book, it doesn't convert me.

85
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.970
I haven't changed my views on whether or not there is a God,

86
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.830
but it has changed my views on the value of a religious sensibility,

87
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.480
the role that it plays in people's lives. Now, look, it can be, you know,

88
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.490
you talk to people like Sam Harris and, and, and, you know, it's,

89
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.400
it's a destructive force in the world,

90
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:22.660
and it has been a destructive force in some ways, but that's not the full story.

91
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.050
The full story is that for some individuals,

92
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.710
it gives a connection to a historical lineage.

93
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.140
That's deeply valued for some individuals.

94
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.000
It puts their life in a larger setting that allows them to be in the world in a

95
00:05:37.001 --> 00:05:38.470
more productive way.

96
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.120
So there are a whole range of roles that religious engagement can play.

97
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.420
The problem is when you start to pit it against scientific insight,

98
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.670
then you run into trouble,

99
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.620
but religion was never developed to give us factual information about the world.

100
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.370
Religion will never give us the electron magnetic moment to nine decimal

101
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.280
places. That's the purview of scientific investigation.

102
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.130
And if you can keep these straight in your mind,

103
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.260
there's a definite and powerful role for a religious sensibility

104
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:10.660
in the world. Yeah.

105
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.860
<v 0>I've, I feel like it gives people in a lot of ways of scaffolding for ethics and</v>

106
00:06:14.861 --> 00:06:19.380
morality and allows them some alleviation of anxiety. Exactly.

107
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.240
A feeling of purpose is, but like you said,

108
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.960
as long as it's not conflicting with rigid scientific reality,

109
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.110
like scientific provable scientific reality.

110
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.440
<v 1>Yeah. And I got to tell you, it's a funny thing, you know, Richard Dawkins,</v>

111
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:34.380
I don't know. Have you had him on the program? Yeah, so, so,

112
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.090
so you know that his, um,

113
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.900
his Mo in the world is very anti-religious.

114
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.490
I think he would agree with me on that.

115
00:06:42.491 --> 00:06:45.640
I don't want to put words into his mouth. Um, but, um,

116
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.140
I did a event with him in New York. Uh, the beacon theater, I don't know,

117
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.700
maybe a year ago or something like that.

118
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.690
And it was very interesting because in a one-on-one conversation,

119
00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:01.180
his views were very similar to mine. I tell him, look,

120
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:04.870
we don't agree with in totality, but I was saying to him,

121
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.800
there are times I go around the world and I will do things that are utterly

122
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:11.920
irrational. I'll knock on wood for good luck.

123
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.760
I'll speak to my dead father. I know that he's not really there.

124
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.720
I'll pray to God on occasion. If I think that I could use that backup,

125
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.840
not because I think there's some bearded individual in the sky.

126
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.400
It's just a behavioral tendency that I find to be

127
00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:32.260
comforting and useful. And I said this to Richard and he said, I totally get it.

128
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.080
I was like, what? He was like, I totally get it. He said, he said, in fact,

129
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.740
he said,

130
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.610
I don't like to sleep in a house that has a reputation as being haunted.

131
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.790
<v 2>You know, you know, and, and.</v>

132
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:44.890
<v 1>For me, it was such a beautiful human moment.</v>

133
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.090
It was such a beautiful human moment where we were just like being human beings.

134
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.270
And then they said, we're both centers. And I agree,

135
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.810
we are both centers in that sense, because we know how the world works.

136
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:59.470
We know this doesn't make any sense. And yes, it's still part of somehow, uh,

137
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.640
how we behave in the world.

138
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.230
And I think there's a value to recognizing that that is what it means to be

139
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:05.621
human.

140
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:10.150
You will engage in the world in ways that are not necessarily strictly adhering

141
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:14.200
to some rational perspective of how the scientific world operates.

142
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.320
<v 0>I would love to see Richard Dawkins outside of a hundred. Yeah.</v>

143
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.620
<v 2>Exactly, exactly. You know?</v>

144
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.020
Uh, yeah. So, so, you know, um.

145
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.060
<v 1>It's all just to say, yeah,</v>

146
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.070
that I kind of feel like there are many pathways toward insight in

147
00:08:33.071 --> 00:08:34.930
the world. There are many ways to live a life.

148
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.400
There are many ways to come to terms with our own impermanence,

149
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.090
and it's not as though something is right or something is wrong.

150
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:45.640
It's a question of, is it useful to you?

151
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.260
And I think that we have to be very open-minded in the kinds of

152
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:52.780
behaviors that, um, uh,

153
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.790
that we allow to happen in the world, you know, um, you know,

154
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.800
even romp that it's nutty stuff.

155
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.140
But if some of those individuals who go there find that it allows them to

156
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.720
live in the world in a more productive way,

157
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.800
alleviating anxiety feeling like they're on a spiritual quest.

158
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.090
So be it. Yeah. That's the thing that.

159
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.440
<v 0>Sucks. I mean, it's hard for people to understand if you're not in that space,</v>

160
00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:21.710
that head space that are, you don't need this structure,

161
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:26.210
but for some people even Scientology or something along those lines,

162
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:31.160
it seems loopy on paper can provide them with legitimate structure

163
00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:34.820
and benefit their lives in a tangible way that they could describe to you. Yeah,

164
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.750
exactly.

165
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.580
<v 1>And my feeling is that, um, if there was an, I don't know that to be the case,</v>

166
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.140
and maybe some biologists will push back on this, but if there was a, a race of,

167
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.390
for want of a better word, you know,

168
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.970
Vulcan like individuals who approach the world in a completely rational

169
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.740
manner, evaluating the data, figuring out the most sensible course of action,

170
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.180
competing against a crazy group of individuals like us,

171
00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:06.710
who will come up with wild, fictional ideas gods in the heavens,

172
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:09.530
you know, demons haunting the world.

173
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.900
I think it's the latter group that ultimately would triumph because with

174
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:19.040
that kind of freedom of thought, you get novelty,

175
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.950
you get ingenuity, you get creativity.

176
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.840
And so I feel as though this is part and parcel of who we are and why we have

177
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:30.620
survived and to sort of come at the world with, uh,

178
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.600
a scientific club that's meant to smash away anything that

179
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:39.900
disagrees with the scientific worldview is an unfortunate way of,

180
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:41.120
of looking at the world.

181
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:41.691
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

182
00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:46.280
There's something about creativity that it doesn't necessarily have to abide by

183
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:49.340
any laws of logic and it could still be beneficial. Yeah.

184
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.910
<v 1>And, and, and, and that's why, yeah, stunning,</v>

185
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.540
when somebody comes up with something it's like, where did that come from?

186
00:10:56.541 --> 00:11:01.400
It didn't come from a rational approach to working out, you know,

187
00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:02.780
Brahms third symphony.

188
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.790
It emerged from the churning emotions of an individual who

189
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:11.840
happens to be made up of trillions of particles guided by physical law,

190
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.790
responding to the environment,

191
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:18.560
which is impinging his senses with an incredible array of influences.

192
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.630
And through that world emerges this spectacular piece of

193
00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:27.830
music. Mm that's. Breathtaking. Yeah. Utterly breathtaking.

194
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.450
<v 0>Yeah. And it's amazing what that music can inspire as it reaches out to,</v>

195
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:37.130
you know, X amount of people and then causes different thoughts in their mind.

196
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.010
And then that causes in turn another branch of creativity, another,

197
00:11:42.011 --> 00:11:46.880
another new line of thinking that they might've ever never pursued.

198
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:47.450
Yeah.

199
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:47.991
<v 1>And that, to me,</v>

200
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:52.880
establishes that the notion that language is the only

201
00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:56.440
way we can know about the world know Vichtenstein had this perspective,

202
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.600
that the limits of my language limits of my world,

203
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.080
that seems to me utterly wrong. I mean,

204
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.920
the experience of music or the experience of

205
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.200
cogitating about the world, but not trying to overlay a narrative upon it,

206
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:16.030
just feeling your way in to reality reveals things

207
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:20.160
about the world that I think are, are beyond linguist. You can.

208
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.060
<v 0>Talk religion with a really intelligent person who's objective,</v>

209
00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:25.860
who has a belief. It's,

210
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.190
it's such an interesting subject because it's,

211
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.870
it requires suspension of disbelief in order to

212
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.310
absorb some of the stories.

213
00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:40.260
But there's clearly a history behind this of thousands of

214
00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:43.470
years of translations and trying to get to the,

215
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:47.670
what did they mean when they wrote this down and how much did they know and what

216
00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:48.540
were they trying to do?

217
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.290
Were they just trying to get everybody to calm down and stay in, right? Or were.

218
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:57.150
<v 1>They trying to find some means of gluing the group together by a</v>

219
00:12:57.151 --> 00:12:59.130
shared beliefs or, you know,

220
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.900
they're folks who basically say that there are qualities of the human brain that

221
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:07.710
naturally leave it open to a religious sensibility? I mean, for instance,

222
00:13:07.711 --> 00:13:12.510
we have agency detection systems in our brain where we look around the world and

223
00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:16.500
we tend to assign agency to things that happen that's useful. Right. Because,

224
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.210
you know, if you mistake a windblown branch for a Jaguar, yeah, it's fine.

225
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.420
You thought it was Jaguar, but as just a branch. But if the reverse happens,

226
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.020
you think it was a Jaguar and you think it's wind blown, Brent,

227
00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:31.770
you're going to get eaten. So we tend to over and out agency into the world.

228
00:13:31.771 --> 00:13:35.460
There is evolutionary value to that. So when the wind blows,

229
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.360
we tend to think there's a mind up there when the river gurgles,

230
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:41.610
we tend to think that there's a mind in there.

231
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.890
And this is sort of the seed for the kinds of perspectives that you'll find in

232
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:49.320
many of the world's religions. So there's,

233
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.430
there's natural course of events that can lead to, uh,

234
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.160
the arising of the institution,

235
00:13:56.161 --> 00:14:00.770
or at least the ideas behind the institution of religion and for

236
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.430
students that have never encountered that idea before it can really shake

237
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:09.810
things up. And I think in a, in a very valuable way, you know, so, uh,

238
00:14:09.811 --> 00:14:11.040
so I think you're absolutely right.

239
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:15.900
Having a conversation with somebody who has a religious perspective is

240
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.790
deeply interesting to understand where that mind came

241
00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:25.050
to the place that it got to. And from a personal sensibility, I give you,

242
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:28.530
you know, I just give you one little anecdote. You know, my dad died.

243
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.290
I was 23 years old and, uh,

244
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:33.860
unexpectedly I'd been visiting home.

245
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.350
I was at Harvard at the time I was visiting from Cambridge and we had a nice

246
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:40.540
weekend. And by the time I got back to Cambridge on the bus, my mom called me,

247
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.400
said, dad's dead. It was so, so shocking. It was like,

248
00:14:43.401 --> 00:14:45.150
so sudden it was so complete.

249
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.600
And I remember I went back home and my dad was not a religious man,

250
00:14:48.601 --> 00:14:53.000
but we knew that he would want to have a ceremony. And we,

251
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.710
and we did it. And we had, you know,

252
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:59.210
a minion of Jews coming to the house to recite the, the cottage prayer.

253
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.880
Cause we weren't religious. We didn't know what we were doing, you know,

254
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.330
and I had no idea what these men were saying,

255
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.270
but it was deeply comforting. In fact,

256
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.850
I didn't want to know what they were saying to me.

257
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:12.950
It was just a collection of ancient sounds,

258
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.810
but this sounds connected me across the generations to a

259
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:22.760
culture that had been extended back 5,000 years and in a moment of crisis,

260
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.990
that was a very comforting and useful connection to have.

261
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.743
Yeah.

262
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:29.030
<v 0>That, that,</v>

263
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.970
that is where I find people get the most out of religion in,

264
00:15:33.971 --> 00:15:38.920
in the fact that it brings communities together in this

265
00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:42.940
sort of cohesive ritual, where everybody acts together and everybody,

266
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.110
you feel like there's completion to it. Like you're putting someone,

267
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.760
you know,

268
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.460
putting someone into perspective and you're doing so with this religious

269
00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:52.340
ceremony and.

270
00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.070
<v 1>And when large groups of people get together and engage in a</v>

271
00:15:57.071 --> 00:16:02.020
ritual behavior, something magical happens. You know,

272
00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:06.280
I've spoken to evolutionary psychologists like Steve Pinker. Who's a,

273
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.160
is a wonderful thinker in here too. Yeah. Okay. And, and, you know,

274
00:16:09.161 --> 00:16:13.810
Steve is skeptical that this kind of ritual

275
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.790
behavior can yield the kind of cohesive bonding that some

276
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:23.350
people suggest that it does, but you know, you probably have the,

277
00:16:23.351 --> 00:16:26.620
I have the on occasion engaged in these ritual behaviors, you know,

278
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.700
mass drumming and movement, you know, and, and I got to tell you,

279
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.800
you are quickly,

280
00:16:32.801 --> 00:16:37.540
I find transported to a place where you are now part of a collective

281
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.770
and you feel yourself melting into the group and you are one.

282
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:43.930
And if you've never had that experience,

283
00:16:43.931 --> 00:16:45.430
I think is something that you should have,

284
00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:47.650
because I think it's a vital part of our heritage.

285
00:16:47.651 --> 00:16:49.540
It is part of how we got to be who we are.

286
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:55.150
<v 0>Yeah. There's something about group acceptance and a group of people</v>

287
00:16:55.151 --> 00:17:00.010
acting and doing something together that does create this very strange bond.

288
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.540
It doesn't necessarily exist amongst individuals. It's, it's a weird bond.

289
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.500
<v 1>Is a very weird bond because it has nothing to do with the individuals,</v>

290
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.780
nothing to do with the personality of Jim or merits.

291
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.430
It's irrelevant at that point.

292
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.710
It's somehow joining you together into this massive humanity.

293
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:19.870
That's all engaged in the same practice.

294
00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:24.070
And somehow you feel as though your identity melts into the larger whole,

295
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.660
I don't know why it happens negative aspects to that sort of thing or that mob

296
00:17:28.661 --> 00:17:29.260
mentality.

297
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:29.710
<v 0>Of course,</v>

298
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.360
I give you ever been in a situation where things got chaotic and you really had

299
00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:35.710
this feeling like anything can happen.

300
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.360
<v 3>I've seen it happen. I've never been part of it, but weird,</v>

301
00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:42.280
but I have a sort of feeling in the air. Yeah. I have an analogous.

302
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.510
<v 1>One, which is, you know, my brother is a Hari Krishna. Whoa. You know,</v>

303
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:51.430
and so, you know, he is 13 years older than me and, and left, uh,

304
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.630
college in the sixties, which was a tumultuous time and,

305
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.790
and went to Europe and ultimately joined into what many people think

306
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:04.650
of as some kind of cultish activity. And so, uh, but,

307
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.270
but he's not a cult thinker, he's an original thinker, he's a brilliant thinker.

308
00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.720
And yet within this group mentality,

309
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:17.100
you can imagine a certain kind of group think can take over these people,

310
00:18:17.101 --> 00:18:19.020
imagine that this happens. So yes,

311
00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:23.250
it has positive aspects and it can have negative aspects. Uh, but in the end,

312
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:27.630
I think there is a long lineage in which those of our

313
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:32.610
forebears who survive were the ones who could join together into these more

314
00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.710
potent, these more powerful groups.

315
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.800
And that way we're able to triumph over other groups, you know,

316
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:39.600
in the ancestral environment, you know,

317
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.090
there there's different readings of the archeological record,

318
00:18:42.091 --> 00:18:46.590
whether it was a dangerous place in the hunter gatherer past or a sort of Placid

319
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.860
place. But one reading says it was a very dangerous place.

320
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.670
And therefore those groups that survived were the ones who were able to

321
00:18:53.671 --> 00:18:56.160
establish this kind of allegiance to the whole.

322
00:18:56.880 --> 00:19:01.080
And certainly I think this kind of ritual behavior may have been part of that.

323
00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.100
<v 0>Bond together through shared experiences. Yeah.</v>

324
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.110
<v 1>And, and belief. Yeah.</v>

325
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.990
And if you're all believing in the same supernatural entity,

326
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:12.260
that's a powerful in principle, powerful glue.

327
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.140
<v 0>Do, do you find that there's, uh, I mean,</v>

328
00:19:15.141 --> 00:19:18.830
I don't want to say an arrogance in some academics that maybe it's not the right

329
00:19:18.831 --> 00:19:19.071
word,

330
00:19:19.071 --> 00:19:23.900
but this being too quick to dismiss any positive

331
00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:26.450
benefit at all about religion. Yes.

332
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.760
<v 1>Um, it's the knee-jerk reaction among a certain group of</v>

333
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.730
academics and, um,

334
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:37.340
it feels deeply unfortunate to me,

335
00:19:37.341 --> 00:19:41.840
it almost feels like a religion of its own sort when it's just the

336
00:19:41.841 --> 00:19:45.200
response, as opposed to a careful, thoughtful,

337
00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:47.210
heartfelt analysis of the situation.

338
00:19:47.211 --> 00:19:50.690
I frankly wish that more people would read William James, his book,

339
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.890
because I do think that it's the kind of, because here's a psycho, a scientist,

340
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.460
right. Of deeply thoughtful scientist,

341
00:19:58.461 --> 00:20:00.710
who knows how to analyze data,

342
00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.240
knows how to rationally engage with the world who was plumbing,

343
00:20:05.241 --> 00:20:08.780
the depths of religion in a very, very meaningful,

344
00:20:08.781 --> 00:20:12.260
insensitive way. You know? And by the end of these lectures though,

345
00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:16.580
I think was lecture number 20 or something. He describes religion as this, um,

346
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.850
as, as something that helps the journey toward the,

347
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.200
the terror and the beauty of phenomenon, he describes it as the,

348
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.320
the voice of the thunder, the gentleness of the summer rain.

349
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.770
He described it in terms of the sublimating of the stars and this kind of

350
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.070
transcendent approach to the religious experience,

351
00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:38.510
I think brings it out of the academic guys that is

352
00:20:38.511 --> 00:20:43.310
often thrown upon it, which is something that is contravening.

353
00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:47.920
Everything we know about the world it's causing to think in

354
00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:51.580
ways that are irrational. I mean, this whole trope that you hear,

355
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.330
it's not that there isn't some truth to that, but it's an incomplete truth.

356
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:59.590
And if you're willing to approach religion in a way where you discard the pieces

357
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:03.580
that offend you, throw away the parts that you think are utter nonsense,

358
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.530
only keep those aspects that are useful to you in your

359
00:21:08.531 --> 00:21:10.870
life. Then there is a place for it.

360
00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.920
<v 0>I think therein lies the problem with a lot of people they're not willing to do</v>

361
00:21:13.921 --> 00:21:17.310
that. This need for suspension of disbelief,

362
00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.310
troubles them so much that they feel like fools. If they buy into something.

363
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.790
And we're also dealing with all religions,

364
00:21:23.791 --> 00:21:25.620
except the ones that are super questionable,

365
00:21:25.621 --> 00:21:28.830
like Scientology or Mormonism that are very old.

366
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:33.960
And the idea of maybe it would be better if we came

367
00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:36.600
up with something that we could all agree on in 2020,

368
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.510
maybe it would be wonderful if we have something that,

369
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.000
that maybe has science in it,

370
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:47.160
maybe something that has a genuine understanding of how human beings react and

371
00:21:47.161 --> 00:21:52.110
what the benefits of community and having these in environments

372
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.363
where loving,

373
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.630
conscious people communicate with each other in a very positive way that this

374
00:21:57.631 --> 00:22:02.100
could be a new form of this thing that we seem to desire so greatly.

375
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.210
<v 1>Yeah. And I agree,</v>

376
00:22:03.211 --> 00:22:07.740
and I have just had to make this point in the book because the point that I make

377
00:22:07.741 --> 00:22:10.680
there is that to truly engage with the world,

378
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.720
you have to use a variety of stories. We're fundamentally storytellers.

379
00:22:15.721 --> 00:22:17.850
That's what human beings are. Now.

380
00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:21.780
There's the reductionist story that physicists are well-equipped to talk about

381
00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:24.450
with particles and laws of physics. On top of that,

382
00:22:24.451 --> 00:22:26.970
you've got the chemist story, the complex molecules,

383
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.240
you've got the biologist story that begins to talk about cells in life.

384
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.070
You got the psychological story,

385
00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:35.550
the neurophysiological story that brings a minding consciousness.

386
00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:36.751
And within that,

387
00:22:36.751 --> 00:22:40.350
you then have all of the activities that conscious beings undertake,

388
00:22:40.351 --> 00:22:44.070
which includes religion and includes telling other kinds of stories and includes

389
00:22:44.071 --> 00:22:46.470
creative expression. You need them all.

390
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.300
And to sort of say that the scientific account is the only account by which

391
00:22:51.301 --> 00:22:55.290
you're ever going to gain. True qualities of the world is a very, in my view,

392
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.560
limited description of what truth is.

393
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.340
There is objective truth in the world that we can measure that we can describe

394
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.930
to the equations of self-worth,

395
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.250
but there's also internal true spiritual truth that you get to by

396
00:23:08.251 --> 00:23:09.690
self-examination,

397
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:15.090
it's real in the sense that you're understanding how you respond to the world.

398
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.990
And that is something which is deeply personal, but utterly real.

399
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.080
And whether it's through psychedelics, whether it's through Iowasca,

400
00:23:22.081 --> 00:23:25.950
whether through a spiritual journey, whether it's through religion, regardless,

401
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:30.600
all of this adds color to the story of what it means to be a human being.
