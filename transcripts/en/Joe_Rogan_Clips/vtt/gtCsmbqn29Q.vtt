00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. When you see that academy award speech,</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.670
thank you. Compilation, where all the people go up,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.810
all the various people that eventually talk about them. Go up and praise.

4
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:17.580
Harvey Weinstein. I never saw it. Oh my God. It's so bizarre. It's so strange.

5
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.710
<v 1>Because they were intimidated that he had that much power over people's careers</v>

6
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:24.500
and they didn't feel like their voice would be heard or that people would,

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.440
you know, take them seriously. He would find a way to,

8
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.870
to you basically you.

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.810
<v 2>Up. He wouldn't know me. He wouldn't know me. Uh,</v>

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.000
every three or four times,

11
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.930
like I run into him in Madison square garden and there's a restaurant Tribeca

12
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:39.291
grill,

13
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:44.090
which he had owned a piece of at one point and give you a half-ass

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.860
hello? Maybe he was way above. I was beneath him. He never got punched.

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.870
<v 0>In the face. Is that what it is? I.</v>

16
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.010
<v 2>Heard Jason priestly punched him in the face at a party. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.370
I heard that he got out of line and Jason Priestley punched him in the face.

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.240
I think nobody beat the out of Harvey Weinstein and it wouldn't be that

19
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:04.640
difficult. He could hardly breathe.

20
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.280
He smoke smoking chain smoke and he wasn't a tough guy.

21
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.340
He was tough with assistance. You know, beats.

22
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.300
<v 0>Us like when w if you thought about a character in a film,</v>

23
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.370
Harvey Weinstein is almost too on the head. Almost unbelievable. Yeah.

24
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.950
<v 2>Nobody would. Nobody would do. They would never get away</v>

25
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.560
with it for so long. Don't do it in 20 something years. Nobody would do that.

26
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.470
<v 1>Yeah. And like, to be more right. They've got.</v>

27
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.020
<v 0>More cases. Yeah. There's way more cases.</v>

28
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:35.330
This is just what he's been convicted for. Right? I mean,

29
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:40.280
he apparently was behaving like that for decades telling me nobody knew they

30
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:44.030
knew. They all knew that's what's crazy is it's worked into his contract.

31
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.110
His contract had, if you get this amount, this amount of sec,

32
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.810
like per sexual harassment case,

33
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.770
they had it that he would have to pay this much. If it was two,

34
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.720
he'd have to pay that much. If it was three-headed.

35
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.330
Imagine if you're signing up for a place and like, Steve,

36
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:02.000
I know you're a piece of. So this is what we're going to work into the contract,

37
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.650
all your piece of behavior.

38
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.700
We're going to write it down and you're going to be penalized per piece of in

39
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.420
here.

40
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.090
<v 2>Oh yeah. It's amazing. It's fun. You know what all complicit.</v>

41
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.740
This is something that I, I don't understand. These assistants,

42
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.260
the people in his office,

43
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.340
people that knew this stuff that saw the stuff that set them off,

44
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:26.450
that he was meeting the girl in the lobby. But then she comes down and says, oh,

45
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:31.250
Harvey needs to meet you up in his room. She was part of it.

46
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.750
Or he, or whatever the assistants were. It was like, I mean,

47
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.800
I would never do that.

48
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.030
<v 0>I ain't never played dumb. Agree to that. No, of course not.</v>

49
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.460
But you also, you don't have to.

50
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.010
And when you think of an assistant in particular,

51
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:48.140
you're thinking about someone who has virtually no power.

52
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.720
And there's a thing called diffusion of responsibility,

53
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.540
where there's too many people involved. You don't feel like you're responsible.

54
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.860
You don't feel like you, you know,

55
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.670
that's when they say it's easier to assault someone in front of a hundred people

56
00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:00.640
than it to assault someone in front of one person,

57
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.740
because one person might step in and stop it.

58
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.700
But a hundred people will sit around and go, someone's got to stop this. Gotcha.

59
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.910
You know? And that's, I think that when you're an assistant,

60
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.260
you probably work in check to check. You got this guy who,

61
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.500
the king of Hollywood, he's a, he's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

62
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.720
<v 3>Intimidating. Yeah. I understand the guy yells at people.</v>

63
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.280
<v 2>He yells. That's what he did. You know,</v>

64
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:26.370
what's amazing to me is people still haven't come forward.

65
00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:30.720
People that worked with him, uh, actors, whatever actresses,

66
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.610
I think they're still afraid.

67
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:36.000
Somehow he's going to come back like in a horror film, keep signing.

68
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.790
<v 3>People. Don't he's not done.</v>

69
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.690
<v 1>To deal with that publicly. You know, it's, it's a hard thing to talk about.</v>

70
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.820
I don't want to, they don't want everybody to know. I mean,

71
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:46.320
I think you're right. And I think also that.

72
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.300
<v 2>I don't mean people that he assaulted,</v>

73
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:52.380
just people that were around him that were aware. I don't know who.

74
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.720
<v 0>That is. They don't want to talk about it publicly.</v>

75
00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:56.880
I think you're right about that. I think it's, they've already,

76
00:03:56.881 --> 00:04:00.540
he's already been caught. It's over. They got him. He's in jail.

77
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:04.680
He'd be in jail forever. He's up. His body's falling apart. He can't even walk.

78
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.963
I mean, it's.

79
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.820
<v 2>Funny for me, what a fall from grace spectacular.</v>

80
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.120
<v 0>Fall. And just a few years, if you go back seven years ago,</v>

81
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.470
there's not a whisper of this. Right. So seven years later, the guy's in jail.

82
00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:19.800
Can't walk, you know, his, his body's falling apart.

83
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.390
<v 2>That's the way he just got to get somebody to give him the Sinai pills. it.</v>

84
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.840
<v 0>Have done that. And had to know where this was going when he was free.</v>

85
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.850
I don't.

86
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:30.660
<v 1>Think he did. No.</v>

87
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.320
I think he thought he was going to get off and he was planning a comeback.

88
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:35.154
And you know, he was.

89
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.980
<v 2>You know, I know one of his attorneys, uh,</v>

90
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.170
that was there early on and he fired him.

91
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:44.610
And I ran into him right before he got sentenced a few weeks before.

92
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:49.590
And I said, this Harvey's going to get off. And he said, nah, nah, nah,

93
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.060
you see, he won't get off here. If he would have kept me. He said, he said,

94
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.750
if he would've kept me, I would've got him off. He said he have gotten them off.

95
00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.460
I didn't go. You know, I mean,

96
00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:03.780
I know the guy acquaintance from the knick games and sure enough, he got,

97
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.980
why 23 years.

98
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.460
<v 0>It seems like things happen in the court of public opinion on guys like that.</v>

99
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.600
<v 2>Most certainly did here. I would have just, there's no way I would want to be.</v>

100
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:13.350
What kind of life is.

101
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.390
<v 0>Us character. I mean,</v>

102
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:19.920
just with his disgusting face and his body and like everything about it.

103
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.350
And you had some dealings with them. Yeah.

104
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.740
<v 1>I did a couple of jobs with them. I did it. I wrote a script for him.</v>

105
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.890
I had to work with him kind of closely. Did he try to grab, you.

106
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.380
<v 4>Know, trying to grab.</v>

107
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.480
<v 5>Me? What was he like?</v>

108
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.850
<v 2>You know, he was okay with me. Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.560
<v 1>No, he had opinions. Um, uh, he was all right. I mean,</v>

110
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:42.870
it was just work. There was nothing. I mean,

111
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:45.230
obviously he didn't go to dinner with them or nothing. No, no.

112
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.630
It was only in his office and stuff. I did. And I did a job for his brother.

113
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.590
Another, a job.

114
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.380
<v 2>For his brother. I think his brother was a nicer guy. Right. He.</v>

115
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.580
<v 1>Was okay. I think he was very intimidated by Harvey. I think Harvey was bullied.</v>

116
00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:59.140
It was brother big time. It's.

117
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.400
<v 0>Just fascinating story because it's incredible.</v>

118
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.990
And it's the wife and the three kids and a beautiful, it's sort of crazy.

119
00:06:04.991 --> 00:06:07.120
It's like, how, how the does that even happen?

120
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.920
And it's one of those things that if it's, if it's in a film, it just,

121
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:15.610
it's almost like he's too much of a villain. Yeah.

122
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.640
<v 2>You're right. That would never happen. The details when you put it all.</v>

123
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.920
<v 3>Together, you're like, no, really in Hollywood.</v>

124
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.070
<v 1>Where he's famous and then he's dealing with the most famous people in the</v>

125
00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:25.420
world. Right. And everybody keeps.

126
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.600
<v 0>Her mouth shut and he a list stars and then puts them in Philly.</v>

127
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.410
<v 2>Do you think, uh, uh, do you think that some of the, the,</v>

128
00:06:34.411 --> 00:06:38.890
the women that have denied having sex with them had sex with them? Yes. You do.

129
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.783
Yes. Yeah.

130
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.690
<v 3>Yeah. I wanted to buy with probably, I don't know. I don't want to them. No,</v>

131
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:46.870
I wouldn't have talked about it if I, yeah, exactly. I don't know.

132
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.000
<v 2>Do you want to talk about that? That's hard,</v>

133
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.570
but the thing about Harvey Weinstein and people like that, they would have had,

134
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.790
if, if, if he would've said, listen, I'm a fat, disgusting bastard,

135
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.230
but if you're bagging me, I'll put you in the next movie.

136
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.680
They wouldn't line up. There would be people lined up around the corner.

137
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.050
I think that his party part of what he did. No. No, I think I,

138
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:16.550
I don't know if that's true, you know, from what I understand,

139
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:19.510
I don't think he needed to do this. I think it's his ego.

140
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:22.330
And I think that's too, like bill Cosby was the same thing.

141
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.700
<v 0>Yeah. Yes, yes. It's becomes a pathology.</v>

142
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:27.370
And I think there's also a thing about power. You know, it's a,

143
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:31.330
it's a power thing that to have power over people and also to have power over

144
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:34.750
these beautiful actresses that everybody else was lusting over. You know,

145
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:36.820
you put some actress in a film and you know,

146
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:39.580
she's the center of everyone's attention and she's got a, you know,

147
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:42.690
a small dress on, she walks into a room and the, you know, the,

148
00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:47.170
the whole place lights up and she's sucking Harvey's Dick. You.

149
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.020
<v 3>Know that it's the yeah. Tons of.</v>

150
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.260
<v 2>Tons of women, tons of women, you know.</v>

151
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.090
<v 0>The addiction thing too. I think if you, you know, there's,</v>

152
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.690
there was a recording of this one girl that he had groped, and then, you know,

153
00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:04.270
she wanted a movie role and he's grabbing her and he's like,

154
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.720
just come back to my place. Come on, come on, just come on. Like,

155
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.680
you're hearing it like a guy asking for heroin. Yeah. Yeah.

156
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.860
<v 3>It's almost sniffling like begging her. It was weird. Like, he'd go.</v>

157
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.980
<v 1>From being really intimidating to almost begging like Pitt pity.</v>

158
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.390
<v 3>Me. I need you please. Don't don't embarrass me. You know? It was very weird.</v>

159
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.370
<v 0>Yeah. I think it's an addiction thing.</v>

160
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.350
I think there was so much going on with that guy.

161
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.100
<v 2>I mean, he had two young, I don't know if their daughters,</v>

162
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.890
she has two young daughters. I think he has older kids,

163
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:36.410
younger kids and his wife. And they were just gone. Right.

164
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.830
Maybe unless he just said, that's a rough trip,

165
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.220
unless he just should have gone away. I mean, I don't know if they visit them.

166
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:49.150
<v 0>It's all crazy. It's a, it's a, it's a Shakespearian story. Epic.</v>

167
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.310
It is epic proportion, horror.

168
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.710
<v 2>Story for everyone involved, horror story.</v>

169
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.150
<v 0>Casting couch in Hollywood. If you stop and think about it, right.</v>

170
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:00.630
You've got all these women that want to be in films. They want to be stars.

171
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:03.780
Then you got these guys that can actually help them make them stars,

172
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.680
but they want something.

173
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.090
And then you set up this dynamic that's existed since you know, the twenties.

174
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.430
Imagine what it was like back then. Oh my God. Well,

175
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.210
you know the fatty Arbuckle store. Yeah. Did you read the.

176
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:18.320
<v 1>Book? I Fadi that, um, Jerry stall wrote no, it's fantastic.</v>

177
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.490
It's kind of a, almost like a fake memoir written from his.

178
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.930
<v 3>Point of view. It's brilliant. Well, is he was like, he was the biggest.</v>

179
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:31.490
<v 1>Star of his day. He was world known all over the world. Yeah. I mean.</v>

180
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:36.080
<v 0>He was basically like the, he was a comedy star, a huge star.</v>

181
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.670
And he did something with a woman where he stuck like a bottle of bourbon. Well,

182
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.550
that, that this.

183
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.910
<v 1>Goes into it. Apparently there's theories that he didn't really do that,</v>

184
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:48.920
that it was set up. Cause that that guy was jealous of him. Like a studio guy.

185
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.860
Yeah. It goes into that. It's a really good book.

186
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.950
Jerry Staller wrote permanent midnight, you know? Oh, okay.

187
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:55.783
<v 0>Got it. Yeah.</v>

188
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.220
Is there real evidence that points to the fact Jesus Christ.

189
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.790
That was the end of his career. Oh yeah. Done toast done.

190
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:06.920
The girl died.

191
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.670
<v 2>Oh, okay. Yeah. It's often. Yeah. There's different theories.</v>

192
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.850
<v 1>That he was set up by somebody and that he w that he, that all,</v>

193
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:18.830
that was just they. Oh. Yeah. I imagine that that's crazy. I can.

194
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.220
<v 2>Tell you, the world is a better place. Harvey Weinstein off the streets,</v>

195
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:23.661
honestly,

196
00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:27.980
what he did to what he did to run these actresses and women and assistants

197
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.960
just horrible and not sexually, but he destroyed guys too. You know,

198
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.780
directors, just a horrible human and,

199
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.300
and Jesus while he was getting.

200
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.370
<v 0>Away with it, right. For the longest time,</v>

201
00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:43.730
for the longest time behavior that was reinforced by the people around him.

202
00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:46.190
And then he got away with it. And what's also interesting is like,

203
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.230
if you help someone murder somebody, you would get an accessory.

204
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.860
You, you, you would get, you would get prison time. You would,

205
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:56.300
there would be charges,

206
00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:59.870
but there's no charges against any of the people that absolutely knew what he

207
00:10:59.871 --> 00:11:02.360
was doing. But that's sort of saying, I have two daughters aiding.

208
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.220
<v 3>And abetting there's that doesn't apply to that.</v>

209
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:09.350
<v 2>Two daughters in their twenties. I don't think my daughters in a million years,</v>

210
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:13.940
no matter how much they wanted to be in the business would be an accomplished to

211
00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:18.220
that and tell the girl and say, well, Harvey's going to be up in the room or,

212
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.330
or whatever. It's crazy things. Go get Javi's medicine to.

213
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.940
<v 0>Stick or something. Right? Yeah. Come on. Do you know what he had? This is,</v>

214
00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:32.360
I was going this text thread with a bunch of comics.

215
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:37.370
He had a type of gang green that you get from diabetes.

216
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.170
It's bacterial on his Dick.

217
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.270
And his Dick was horribly malformed. So I had this,

218
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.970
we were talking about this and then I Googled it.

219
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:50.720
And then I said to my friends do not Google this. And then they're like,

220
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.670
why not? So that I send them a photo of it, of what it looks like, oh my God.

221
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:58.540
It's like your, your genitals just right away.

222
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.270
Like all the skin around it rotted away.

223
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:04.750
And that was one of the things that one of the actresses it said is that she

224
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:09.610
thought that he was maybe intersex or transgender or that he

225
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:14.110
had a vagina because he was so scarred up. Oh my God. So it's like,

226
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.850
it's, it's again, it's almost two on the head. It's like, as a,

227
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:21.820
as a movie character, he's almost too.

228
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.310
<v 2>Disgusting. He is she playing him in this movie?</v>

229
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.780
<v 0>Hmm. That'd be a good question. Who could pull it off Christian bale.</v>

230
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.700
<v 5>Okay. And the way I hope they don't make the movie,</v>

231
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.860
how's that I don't want to see that movie.

232
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.770
<v 2>If nothing else, lifetime, they're going to make the movie a lifetime.</v>
