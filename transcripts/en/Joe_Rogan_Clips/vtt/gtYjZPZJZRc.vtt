<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 1>Experience. We're going to get, we'll get into this stuff.</v>

3
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm sure you're not just voting for the person you're voting for.

4
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:10.530
Who are they likely to have working for them, right.

5
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.280
Is likely to happen in courts, what is likely to happen.

6
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.050
Regulation-wise and so of course you want to think about who it is

7
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:20.520
that the person is,

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.780
but you also want to think about who do they bring with them. And for me,

9
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:27.510
that's a lot of how I see boating in November.

10
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.680
<v 0>This point. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.100
Most people have made that concession and it's an interesting concession, right?

12
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.320
Because it's not a concession we had to make,

13
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.410
if it was a Tulsa Gabard or Bernie Sanders or Amy Klobuchar or Pete

14
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:41.970
Buddha judge, or, you know, go down the line. There's a,

15
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:45.840
a lot of very credible candidates that would have made like interest.

16
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.960
Like maybe this person could be the next great president.

17
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.460
Maybe this person could be a great leader,

18
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
but now we're in this position where like, oh God, okay. So listen,

19
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.610
we're voting for the cabinet. It was like,

20
00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:01.080
Biden is so he's whether or not he's having

21
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.800
moments that are related to cognitive decline,

22
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.760
which you could speculate or whether or not this is just his reaction to the

23
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.880
most extreme amount of pressure he's ever faced in his life.

24
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.730
And that does happen with people. We know people lock up.

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.720
I would imagine that a guy has been in the spotlight as long as he has for so

26
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:22.200
long, probably would, would be able to handle stuff.

27
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.860
But I think running for president is a whole different ball game.

28
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.730
I think everything gets turned up by 10 and I think it gets turned up in this

29
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:31.590
society that we're experiencing today.

30
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.370
It gets turned up even more so because of social media, like no president,

31
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:36.960
other than Trump has,

32
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.490
had really had to deal with this kind of wave of social viral

33
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.070
feedback online with Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and all this stuff that

34
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.250
we're experiencing right now, they didn't Obama.

35
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.200
Didn't have to deal with that really in his first term,

36
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.660
maybe a little bit in his second term, but then Trump,

37
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.460
the first guy to tackle it head on.

38
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.650
And he's in a lot of ways he's showing you what can come

39
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:02.484
at you.

40
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.380
And I think that when Biden is running through these steps to

41
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.520
try to become president,

42
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.840
he's experiencing a wave of attention and scrutiny that he's never experienced

43
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:16.130
before. And that could also exacerbate, what am I a doctor here?

44
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.120
I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with his head,

45
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.830
but that could also exactly.

46
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.590
<v 1>Um, are you, have you taken a position on the Biden cognitive stuff? That's.</v>

47
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.690
<v 0>Something's wrong? Something's wrong? If he was my friend and he was fighting,</v>

48
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:32.100
I'd asked him to retire. I mean, if I'm looking at it that way, I have friends,

49
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.530
um, that I've seen their cognitive decline from fighting. Um,

50
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.500
I'm not saying the Biden's the same, cause I don't really know him from,

51
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.470
you know, I don't know him over a long period of time. I don't,

52
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.590
I don't know him at all personally, but something's wrong the way.

53
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.460
<v 1>Any of your friends that are they close to 80? Any of them?</v>

54
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.630
<v 0>No. No. The guys who are experiencing cognitive decline are younger guys.</v>

55
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.530
Who've been hit in the head. Um, when you, when you get to 80, uh,

56
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.520
I have known people that have had problems and it's, it's very unfortunate. Um,

57
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.420
I don't think he's there where, you know, cause he could still talk to them.

58
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.990
Like if, if that was just a guy that you knew and he was like,

59
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.400
and he said something like, we've all been endowed by a, you know,

60
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:20.170
the thing that one famous, you wouldn't say, oh Jesus,

61
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:22.930
what's going on with Ray, you would say, oh, he had a, he locked up,

62
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.660
he had a brain fart, it, a mental lapse,

63
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.100
which I've had doing podcasts all the time. It can happen.

64
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.670
But in that moment in front of those people to do it that way,

65
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.180
while he's running for president and why had a few of those before he could be

66
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:40.090
dealing with anxiety too, there's probably a lot of going on,

67
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.440
but I would be concerned.

68
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.920
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, listen. So I, I don't have any, I don't.</v>

69
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.390
My view is just based on actual professionals that I've talked to and people

70
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:51.100
that have been in a room with him. Cause I've, I've,

71
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.980
I'm not a professional and I've not been in the room with Biden.

72
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.790
So Andrew Yang was on with Sam Harris recently. I don't know if you saw it.

73
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.050
And this topic came up and Andrew Yang basically said, listen,

74
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.440
he he's 78 years old. If you compare a video of Biden,

75
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.310
debating Paul Ryan in 2012 to Biden a month ago,

76
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.600
obviously it's different.

77
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.580
And to some degree you that's normal when someone's 78 years old.

78
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.080
But Andrew Yang's perspective was that he didn't see anything that he would call

79
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.580
dementia or cognitive decline beyond that. So that's like one,

80
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.610
it's just one data point. It doesn't tell us anything definitively, you know,

81
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.420
the other thing is I've interviewed a few people and I think you and I maybe

82
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:35.740
have even messaged about some of them, uh, uh, neuroscience and your, uh,

83
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.430
neurologists and mental health professionals who were very concerned about

84
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:43.990
Trump, like the oranges of an investigation, the, where he has,

85
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:48.010
he seems to sort of like lock up when his shoulders sort of, you know,

86
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:51.280
this thing that he does where it's shoulders kind of a mock up in a weird way.

87
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.550
There's a few of those. Yeah. I got video of that. You know, he walks off.

88
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.830
<v 0>The plane. You think it's a neurological thing?</v>

89
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.210
<v 1>I don't know. That's the thing. So it could be neurological mental health,</v>

90
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.460
side effect of medication. There's a whole bunch of stuff. It could be, could.

91
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.380
<v 0>Also be an injury.</v>

92
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.300
<v 1>Maybe. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.480
<v 0>Maybe. I mean, if he's doing some of this back or shoulder.</v>

94
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.840
<v 1>Well, it's weird because he, when it happens,</v>

95
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.330
he has a verbal mistake that he makes and it coincides

96
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:20.500
with this shoulder thing.

97
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:23.860
And then it's almost like there's a half second gap and then someone hits the

98
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:27.580
reset button and he'll get back on the teleprompter or whatever. It's weird.

99
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:28.450
There's like 10 or so ago.

100
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.930
<v 0>I need to see this. I need, I need to see this while I'm talking to you. Um,</v>

101
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.320
so Jamie's going to search for one. So what would he search for?

102
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.440
<v 1>Um, I think if you,</v>

103
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.310
if you want to like search.twitter.com and just searched in videos,

104
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:45.430
the way you can do, and you put like Trump brain glitch,

105
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.380
I'm guessing that some of these would, uh, come up. But the, the,

106
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.580
the gist of what I was getting to was some of these same neurologist and mental

107
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:58.790
health folks, when I asked them privately about Biden and say, do you,

108
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.600
are you seeing like the same type of thing? They all say no. So again,

109
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:03.434
it's like, it's not.

110
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.150
<v 0>They're hardcore.</v>

111
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.500
<v 1>Democrats. I don't know if that's.</v>

112
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.170
<v 0>Yeah. He's had these moments where for sure something doesn't look good. Right.</v>

113
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.060
<v 1>I agree. Totally agree. So why.</v>

114
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.220
<v 0>Would they say any differently? They've gotta be Democrats.</v>

115
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.810
They gotta be hardcore party loyalists.

116
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.580
<v 1>I, I think that to assume that absent any evidence is may be unfair.</v>

117
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.450
<v 0>Yeah, it is. But I'm an unfair guy in some, some respects.</v>

118
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.140
<v 1>But here's my thought on this right now. So like what,</v>

119
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.770
let let's imagine that Biden's having a real problem, right?

120
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.330
Let's imagine it's absolutely for real, I'm still voting for him over Trump,

121
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.030
right? I mean like, so I think last time we talked,

122
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:43.040
you mentioned you were pro choice. Do I remember that? Right?

123
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.790
<v 0>Yeah. So I am, but I feel like it's a,</v>

124
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.160
it's a controversial subject for a reason.

125
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.110
<v 1>Bear. If Donald Trump gets to pick the next Supreme court justice,</v>

126
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.910
it will be someone who would love to overturn Roe V. Wade. I mean,

127
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.970
there's not even a chance that he he's, he said it, right. This is.

128
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.631
<v 0>We'll try.</v>

129
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:07.520
And Trump has said that he is that he's pro-life and that he would pick

130
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.610
someone that would, or it was just by virtue of picking conservative.

131
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.610
<v 1>There's a, there it's, it's actually, it's, there's two parts to it.</v>

132
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:16.610
One is Donald Trump was pro choice. Almost his entire life.

133
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.720
He became pro-life when he was, I think 68, because he met a kid he liked.

134
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.200
And he imagined if that kid wasn't born, no, I'm serious.

135
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.650
<v 0>I believe you. It's just hilarious. It's crazy.</v>

136
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.570
It's like an ABC after school special.

137
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.700
<v 1>Let's imagine that that's true.</v>

138
00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:34.940
That he had an awakening at age 68 after being pro-life his whole life.

139
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.400
He said he would pick justices that were recommended to him by

140
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:43.340
I forget which conservative group you're only going to get, you know,

141
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.320
pro so-called pro-life justices from these groups. On the other hand,

142
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.070
Joe Biden will absolutely pick a pro-choice justice. So if,

143
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.440
if I was pro-choice like you are,

144
00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:00.020
how do I justify voting for the guy who's going to replace potentially Ruth

145
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:03.560
Bader Ginsburg with someone who would want Roe V. Wade overturned.

146
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:05.210
Like I couldn't do it in good conscience.

147
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.730
<v 0>That's a good point. And I'm going to get into it in a second,</v>

148
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:11.960
but Jamie just pulled up this video of Trump and I'm going to get to watch him

149
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.530
have this weird Twitch for the first time. Okay. It hit me with a Jamie.

150
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.950
Okay. So he's talking,

151
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.870
I'm watching it. Is that it, that little move that he made, oh, this is,

152
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.370
this is hilarious and silly.

153
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.460
Trump neurologically malfunctions with a full spasm.

154
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.150
Now he's talking and he just went like this. People do that. That's silly.

155
00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.313
Maybe it's just.

156
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.620
<v 1>Maybe find it there's a dozen of it. Yeah. I don't know. I couldn't hear that.</v>

157
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.040
<v 0>A better thing is something that you showed me on your show.</v>

158
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.900
A better example when there was real problems with him, enunciating words.

159
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.040
And w you know, there was like, was he falling? So was he sick? Was there,

160
00:08:58.041 --> 00:09:01.800
was he on a sedative? Was, was something, something going wrong?

161
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.240
It almost seemed like his tongue wasn't working correctly. Right?

162
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.790
Like, like he was wrestling with, with a paralyzed tongue, like.

163
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.780
<v 1>Perspective matches mine. But I think I really, for me, it's like this stuff.</v>

164
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.840
We're not probably ever going to really get an answer to this.

165
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.090
And I don't know that it's imperative to know the answers for

166
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:26.460
me to know who it is I'm going to vote for,

167
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:27.780
I guess is the point I'm trying to make.
