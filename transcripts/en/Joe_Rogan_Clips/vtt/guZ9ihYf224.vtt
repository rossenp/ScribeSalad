00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 1>Um, listen,</v>

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.500
we claim to be the greatest nation on the face of this earth.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.480
I have a problem with that and don't get me wrong. I'm a Patriot.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.750
I love my country, but I do have a problem with that statement.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.490
And I'll say that perhaps we are the greatest nation on the face of this earth.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.520
Technologically, after all,

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.670
we put a man on the moon,

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.070
we invented the technology to carry that man to the moon safely

10
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.280
and allow him to walk around, get back in his, uh,

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.140
lunar module and come back to earth safely. We invented that technology.

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.140
Not only that when he was, when,

13
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:50.250
when Neil Armstrong was up there and walking around and made that famous, um,

14
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.180
one small step for man one giant leap for mankind quote,

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
we were able to talk with him, live all the way from earth,

16
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.200
NASA headquarters, all the way to the,

17
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:04.890
to the moon live via satellite radio phone.

18
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.780
We invented that technology Americans, everybody, you know,

19
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.850
has a cell phone. Everybody, you know,

20
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:15.330
has email hit a few words that a few numbers hit send.

21
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.780
You're talking to people next door in Nevada, or over in Africa,

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.810
China, Australia, wherever you want to talk anyone on the face of this earth,

23
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.060
we invented that technology.

24
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.030
So how is it that we as Americans can talk to people

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.980
as far away as the moon or anywhere on the face of this earth yet?

26
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.780
So many of us have difficulty talking to the American

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.520
who lives right next door, because he or she is a different color,

28
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.120
a different religion, a different ethnicity, a different persuasion,

29
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.350
a different whatever.

30
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.510
It seems to me that before we can call ourselves the greatest,

31
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.950
our ideology needs to catch up to our technology.

32
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.130
And when we get ourselves up there, both of them up there,

33
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.890
then we can truly brag about how great we are,

34
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.980
because we are living in the 21st century.

35
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.010
We are living in space age times yet.

36
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.220
There are still so many of us thinking we're stone-age minds.

37
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.540
What is this doing in the 21st century? What was it doing in any century?

38
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.240
But yet in the 21st century, you gotta be kidding me.

39
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.350
<v 0>Well,</v>

40
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.090
it brings me back to what you were saying earlier that the problem is education.

41
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.520
The problem is ignorance, right? And the,

42
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:35.160
the solution to education is ignorance.

43
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.040
And this is sort of the same thing when it comes to radicalizing young

44
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:42.270
people online, right? The,

45
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.600
one of the reasons why that works at all is because he's young.

46
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.340
People are susceptible to other ideas because their intelligence immune

47
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.700
system is very low. They don't have a lot of data.

48
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.530
They don't have a lot of education.

49
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:59.100
They don't have a lot of information and they don't have a lot of perspective,

50
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.560
so they can be sticky, could be tricked. They can be roped in.

51
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.670
And this is, this is the same with everything.

52
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.760
This is the same with what you were talking about with not trusting your

53
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.210
neighbors,

54
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.020
because there are different nationality or different color and not communicating

55
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.260
with people that are any different than you. And then being toxically, tribal.

56
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.000
It's all kind of the same thing. It's like,

57
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.110
there's a lack of understanding of what the consequences of that are globally

58
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.090
and in personally to your own life.

59
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.280
<v 1>Well, again, you know, uh, back back to minds,</v>

60
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.290
minds is going to help those young kids get, get those perspectives.

61
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.520
W we'll have people on there who,

62
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.700
who were the experts and sucking those kids into, into these, uh, things. Um,

63
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.640
I know a former, um, uh, Jihadi,

64
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.860
a recruiter for ISIS who used to recruit kids to put them in

65
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:54.190
ISIS here in the states. Okay. Get him, uh,

66
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.520
Jeff scoop the guy from, from, uh, the NSM.

67
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.600
He knew what to do in order to lure people into his movement. What's the NSM,

68
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.660
a national socialist movement and Nazis. Um, yeah,

69
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.220
so these people are willing to help on minds and help,

70
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.320
um, point out these different things,

71
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.000
the little telltale signs as to what to look for, you know, you know,

72
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.490
so parents can see, can spot what, oh no, this doesn't sound right. You blah,

73
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.100
blah, blah, right. To get my kid off of here and give kids.

74
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.120
<v 0>A better perspectives, Mayans, have a video component to it, or it will.</v>

75
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.090
<v 1>It will absolutely my working on that.</v>

76
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.410
<v 0>Now see that that is a, for better. I mean, whether it's correct or not,</v>

77
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.210
that's a,

78
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.980
apparently the people that are really worried about people being radicalized

79
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.000
online, they're more concerned with that than anything else with video,

80
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.060
there's something about the compelling videos.

81
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.140
<v 1>And you find the music and the video and they can guess, oh yeah, kids grabbed,</v>

82
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:51.160
you know, cause they play video games all day. It lures them in. But uh,

83
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.560
you know, back to what I was saying before and that until I finish it,

84
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.610
what's happening, that, that we, we don't see in the media a lot is this,

85
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.810
when I was a kid, um,

86
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.010
the black population in this country was 12%,

87
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.380
11.9, 12%

88
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.010
native Americans, just under 1%, uh, Hispanic people,

89
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:19.720
Latino people, two and 3% Asians, 4%, um,

90
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.700
white people, 84, 80 6%.

91
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.470
So white people have the supremacist type mindset,

92
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.180
their biggest, their biggest nemesis. Of course, we're black people at 12%,

93
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.100
whoa, that's way too much. You know,

94
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.930
they didn't care anything about native Americans.

95
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.140
Their attitude was that's just 1%, stick them on a reservation,

96
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:43.090
forget about them. Right. Um, and that's where these negative terms come from.

97
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.280
You know, that a lot of people don't realize are, are, are insulting terms.

98
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.640
You know, when you say somebody has gone off the reservation, uh,

99
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.040
you've heard that term before, right? Yeah.

100
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.350
<v 0>I never even thought of that.</v>

101
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.680
<v 1>Just now. Exactly. Yeah. Wow. You see what I'm saying? You don't realize it's a,</v>

102
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.880
it's a, it's a negative term.

103
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.880
Or when somebody says that's not your cotton picking business.

104
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.520
Uh okay. Who picked cotton, right, right. Okay.

105
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.370
<v 0>I thought it was a nice way of saying you know,</v>

106
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.140
like you wouldn't like people say freaking,

107
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.630
it's none of your kind of pick and biz, but yeah.

108
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.960
<v 1>Yeah. Or, or when somebody comes from the wrong side of the tracks.</v>

109
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.520
<v 0>Uh, yeah. That.</v>

110
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.430
<v 1>One's obvious the railroad track divided blacks on one side whites on the other.</v>

111
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.620
Yeah. The wrong side. Of course it was the black side. Um, but anyway,

112
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.380
so the biggest nemesis,

113
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.710
if they were of that supremacist mindset were black people, 12%.

114
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.800
It's too much right now today,

115
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.560
black people, we remain at 12%. We've not grown 12.6.

116
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.310
If you look at 2017 census, we have not grown.

117
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.480
12% native Americans are still at 1%. Um, uh,

118
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.380
Asians are at 6%. Hispanics have surpassed us.

119
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.680
They're like at 13% or something just above 13%.

120
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.130
So let's just take 12% black,

121
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.660
13% Hispanic, let alone 6% Asian or whatever.

122
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.340
That's 25% non white. This is happening.

123
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.620
Okay. And it's well predicted by 2042,

124
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.470
which is 22 years from now,

125
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.750
this country for the first time in history will be 50% white and

126
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:31.520
50% non-white downtown.

127
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.590
Right? So the story you're seeing is true now,

128
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.960
um,

129
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.850
that is a very hard pill to swallow for people of

130
00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:51.350
that mindset. They're becoming unhinged and disconcerted.

131
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.880
You know, when you use.

132
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.740
<v 0>The day will not replace us. Right.</v>

133
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.420
<v 1>Precisely exactly. Now you're getting it. Exactly. And,</v>

134
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.170
um,

135
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.940
that's what they call the Browning of America and the white genocide.

136
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.360
And see what they're doing as these groups are stepping up their recruitment

137
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:12.470
efforts now, because one of the, one of the main problems in this,

138
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.100
in this country, or one of the main concerns is illegal immigration.

139
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.890
So these groups are saying, Hey, you know,

140
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.040
we're against illegal immigration to come, come join us. You know,

141
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.140
they're getting on, on a legitimate bandwagon.

142
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.140
But when they say illegal immigration, it's a code word.

143
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:32.180
It's a code word for people from south America, Mexico, west Africa.

144
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.811
Okay.

145
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:36.050
Because there are plenty of people here in this country right now who are here

146
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:37.040
from Canada. Nobody.

147
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.750
<v 0>Gives a about Canadians coming in here.</v>

148
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.160
<v 1>Exactly Canadians or, or people from, um,</v>

149
00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.600
the UK or Eastern Europe, because they look and.

150
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.650
<v 0>Speak perfect English. They slide.</v>

151
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.590
<v 1>Right in. And it doesn't even matter if they speak perfect English or not.</v>

152
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.620
If you're, you know, the, these Nazis and clamp, it will tell Darrell,

153
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.580
I don't want my grandkids to be brown. Well, you know, if, if they're,

154
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.890
if they're a kid were to marry somebody from Canada,

155
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.790
the grandkids going to be white, or the UK of Eastern Europe there'll be white.

156
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.500
But if they let their grandkids marry somebody from El Salvador or Guatemala or

157
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:15.300
Nigeria, oh, heaven forbid, right. Oh, is the trouble?

158
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.840
So what happens is this? They said, come join us. You know,

159
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.360
we're going to take our country back. We're going to build that wall, blah,

160
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:25.920
blah, blah. So people, you know, people see the landscape changing, you know?

161
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:29.580
And so they go and join these groups and the group doesn't do anything.

162
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.290
So then what happens is say, you know, what, if the clan can't do it at the NSM,

163
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:38.100
can't do it. I'll do it myself. And that's when they walk into a synagogue,

164
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.000
boom, boom, boom, or into a black church, boom or El Paso, blah, blah, blah,

165
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:45.120
boom. Okay. These are called lone wolves.

166
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:50.970
Now we have intelligence agencies or whatever that can infiltrate

167
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.930
some of these groups and get in there and get all the stuff and foil those

168
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:57.330
plots, you know, gather intelligence,

169
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.550
but you cannot infiltrate a lone Wolf. There's only one person, right?

170
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.580
And as we get closer and closer to 2042,

171
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.260
unfortunately we're going to see more and more of these lone wolves.

172
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.080
And that's what we have to watch out for.

173
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.590
So you notice that every time one of these white supremacist types gets busted

174
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:17.850
and they go and raid his home,

175
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.200
where do they find a whole cache of automatic weapons and all that kind of

176
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:23.790
stuff. That's for the race war.
