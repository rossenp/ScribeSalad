00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. These things. When did you guys start on this?</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.390
About four years ago.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.150
So it's been four years of steady work to make something like that.

4
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.900
<v 1>And nine days we're going to like give it to the world. Yes. I'm like,</v>

5
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.020
I'm shaking. Oh my God. I'm so nervous. It's just.

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.880
<v 0>Canceled. [inaudible] yes.</v>

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.013
<v 1>Everyone's.</v>

8
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.943
<v 0>Scared of the.</v>

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.880
<v 1>Coronavirus.</v>

10
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.690
I know my wife says I'm going to be in quarantine at the house for two weeks.

11
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:28.530
When I come home, come here.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.120
<v 0>I don't think it needs to be two weeks.</v>

13
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.120
I think it's four days you started showing, look, you're sniffling already.

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.760
I'm just never psychosomatic. Um,

15
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.090
they say that it's four days and you start exhibiting symptoms. So, okay.

16
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.750
<v 1>I coughed at the airport and people looked at me like I've it was,</v>

17
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.310
I felt almost wanting to apologize.

18
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:46.140
I was just clearing my throat and I didn't cover my mouth.

19
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:48.840
And everybody was like, yeah, it was everybody's on edge.

20
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.690
<v 0>Yeah. Meanwhile, the comedy store was packed last night, dude.</v>

21
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.360
<v 1>We went to PAX east last week with the fans,</v>

22
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.000
like lines of fans and the beginning,

23
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.520
everybody was touching elbows that lasted like 20 minutes.

24
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.780
And we were just high five in.

25
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.610
<v 0>So I was at the store last night.</v>

26
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.190
A couple of guys were like trying to give you knuckles and Ravel's like,

27
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.850
get the outta here. We'll go down together. Give me a hug.

28
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.600
<v 1>Well, they say, I didn't watch that show yet with that guy that you had, but,</v>

29
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.030
uh, 50 and up or something, or like.

30
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.150
<v 0>The real problem is people with respiratory issues.</v>

31
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.240
People who are overweight and people who are old, those are,

32
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:24.960
those are the real problems, unhealthy people. Okay. That's the real issue.

33
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
That's going to be the real issue. Although Sam Harris did know a guy,

34
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.630
who's a skier who is 50,

35
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.450
who is apparently very healthy and very fit.

36
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:38.010
And he is now on a ventilator and he was in Italy. I don't know the specifics,

37
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.010
you know, sometimes look, I've,

38
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:42.480
I've got the flu before and I'm sure you have as well.

39
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:47.190
And sometimes what happens is you're worn down from travel. You're worn down,

40
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:48.300
maybe from drinking,

41
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.330
you're warmed down from too much exercise and then it gets you.

42
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.540
And then if you're not like, and this is just the common cold,

43
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.140
and apparently the common cold is a type of Corona virus.

44
00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.820
<v 1>Um.</v>

45
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.450
<v 0>I don't know, Google that make sure that's true. But, um, I'm pretty,</v>

46
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:06.210
I was reading up on Corona viruses last night. I was like, what?

47
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.150
Like SARS is a type of Corona virus.

48
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.160
<v 1>Is this just here now forever like this as a part of the world, like Corona.</v>

49
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.540
<v 0>The question. Well, Michael Oster home who wrote this book,</v>

50
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.980
deadliest enemy and who was on, on a Tuesday on the podcast Tuesday,

51
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.200
he opened up a lot of people's eyes as to like

52
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:32.070
what, what the issue is and what, what, what you can do to prevent it.

53
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:36.300
But those wet markets that they have in China are just

54
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.470
bananas, man,

55
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:41.820
with the bats on the tables and coronavirus or large family of viruses that

56
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:44.370
cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe.

57
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.920
These diseases such as, uh,

58
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.710
MERS or SARS,

59
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.600
a novel coronavirus is a new strain that has not been previously identified in

60
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:58.290
humans. So a zoonotic or zoonotic,

61
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.610
meaning they're between animals and people.

62
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.090
So what what's happening is these wet markets.

63
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.500
He was detailing how they have chickens that are in one cage and civets that are

64
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.050
above the chickens. And the civets are on the chickens.

65
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.240
The chickens are eating the civic. And it's like, it's like,

66
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.530
it's just a perfect environment to create a disease.

67
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.490
That's going to jump from one species to the next. That is scary. Yeah.

68
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.970
And he's like in, many of them have jumped to humans. I mean, all of the major,

69
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.710
uh, whether it's avian flu, that's from birds, swine flu, obviously from pigs,

70
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.850
they jumped from farm animals or from these wet markets to people.

71
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.570
Yeah. And they're not going to stop those wet markets. So it's like, I mean,

72
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:40.030
that's how people buy their food, which is just crazy.

73
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.790
Have you ever seen the videos and pictures of what they look like over there?

74
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.810
<v 1>No. That seems.</v>

75
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.370
<v 0>Scary though. You think your game is scary?</v>

76
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.100
Let's see what a bat looks like when it's laid out on a table.

77
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.670
Apparently bats are like a common thing to eat. And bro,

78
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:54.130
when you see what a bat looks like with its mouth open,

79
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:55.480
it looks like it belongs in your game.

80
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.040
<v 1>That that'd be good. Good.</v>

81
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.640
<v 0>Reference.</v>

82
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.180
We were looking at pictures of them yesterday and they have a table laid out.

83
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.070
And then even not just on the raw concrete bats, laid out with her mouth open,

84
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.550
they look cartoonish. They don't even look real and they have no wings. Yeah.

85
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.810
Jamie's oh my God. And over there.

86
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.510
<v 1>How big these bats? These are bats without weight. Holy. Holy, dude. That looks.</v>

87
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.220
<v 0>Like a dog. They do look like those.</v>

88
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.260
<v 1>Dogs. Oh.</v>

89
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.090
<v 0>Oh, those are dogs. Jesus Christ. Those are dogs. Oh, those are bad.</v>

90
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.280
So those are bad. So look at the teeth on the bats. Yeah.

91
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.110
That's really that look at how they're all.

92
00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:31.330
They all have their mouths wide open.

93
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:34.750
Like they're trying to bite you so they die trying to kill you and.

94
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.490
<v 1>They're gonna, they're gonna cook those.</v>

95
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.630
<v 0>Yes. That's how that is how this disease got started. Look at that guy.</v>

96
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.410
He'll go back to him again. Let me see a big picture. Him. He's.

97
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.400
<v 1>Triple stacking the.</v>

98
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.620
<v 0>Behavior stacks of bats, smoking cigarettes. Like they're eating bats.</v>

99
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.150
That's crazy. It's just nuts, man. But this is what happens. We'll see.

100
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.800
Lou has chicken stacked on top of each other.

101
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.400
When you have a billion people and look at that, guy's sleeping on top of that.

102
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.610
<v 1>That should be in our game actually. Yeah. Like.</v>

103
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.600
<v 0>If you're hungry, eat a bat.</v>

104
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.490
<v 1>You could glory kill that thing and get health.</v>

105
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.310
<v 0>That would be good. Apparently SARS came from bats as well.</v>

106
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.740
So don't eat bad kids, but they have to because they're starving. I mean,

107
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.770
that's one of the things that China's doing, what they have to do.

108
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:19.780
There's too many people, not enough food.

109
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:22.810
And a lot of what they're eating is just, we wouldn't imagine eating.

110
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.570
<v 1>It or are you not traveling because of this?</v>

111
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.703
<v 0>I'm not changing.</v>

112
00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.980
<v 1>That's my wife asked me a lot. Like she,</v>

113
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.070
she was really concerned about me coming here and um, I was like, dude, we go,

114
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.963
we gotta sell a game.

115
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.660
<v 0>I just got back from Vegas. And I was a little nervous while I was over there,</v>

116
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:41.560
but I did everything normal. I went to work out. I, I, you know, I ate,

117
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.020
I went to the fights, which is, you know, 20,000 people at the T-Mobile arena,

118
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.020
all stuffed into this one area and everybody was acting normal.

119
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:52.900
Everybody was high five and a hug. And then fighters. I mean,

120
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.480
Jesus Christ when wanna talk about people exposed, you know,

121
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:57.470
they're sweating and they're half.

122
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.140
<v 1>Naked Tyson. Fury's trying to lick that dudes blood. I mean,</v>

123
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.190
I don't think he's worried.

124
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.240
<v 0>That was before the big outbreak. Yeah. I I'm.</v>

125
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.020
I'm worried about old people. I'm worried about my parents. For sure.

126
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.020
I'm more worried about, I'm worried about people who are overweight. You know,

127
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.370
I have friends that are not healthy that maybe very she'd lose some weight and

128
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.430
I'm worried about them. I'm worried about people with respiratory problems,

129
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:20.264
you know, um,

130
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.440
a good friend of mine has a daughter who has cystic fibrosis and he canceled his

131
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:29.330
tour. Shout out to Everlast. He canceled his tour because of that. I mean,

132
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:31.610
but he's got, you know, a real concern. I mean,

133
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.510
his daughter is a pretty serious lung condition. That is really scary. Horrible.

134
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.160
Yeah. And so look, you know, he's got no choice. He has to stay home and, and,

135
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:43.490
and play it safe. And I think a lot of people are going to do that. You know?

136
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.970
Um, it's gonna be interesting to see how the government handles it.

137
00:06:45.971 --> 00:06:47.900
It was one of the things about love or hate Trump.

138
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.990
He's willing to do some that's a lot of people would think it would be

139
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:54.350
unpopular, like closed down traffic. Yeah. Closed down, uh,

140
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.520
flights coming in from other,

141
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.180
other countries that are infected that have high rates of infection. You know?

142
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:02.660
I mean, uh, I wonder what they're going to do and something,

143
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.400
I think something really radical has to be done to try to start this slow down

144
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.640
the S this illness, but I don't know what they can do.

145
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.540
<v 1>Are we waiting for it to, I got to watch your show with this guy.</v>

146
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.780
Are we waiting for it to go away? Like I read a quote that like,

147
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:20.420
when the weather changes it'll it'll stop or something.

148
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.770
<v 0>That's horseshit. Yeah. I'm Michael Oster home, uh, set of straight on that.</v>

149
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:27.230
That's nonsense. He's like, that's not going to have any effect on it.

150
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:31.220
What happens is it just runs through the population and people develop immune

151
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.730
systems that can handle it. You develop an immunity once you catch it.

152
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.660
And for many people, it's just going to be like a bad cold for many people.

153
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:41.000
It's going to be like, you're coughing and you're and you just,

154
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.230
you just try to get better, stay home, drink a lot of fluids, be healthy,

155
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.070
do your best and, uh, eat healthy and then get out.

156
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.060
You're going to have an immunity to it. And that's, what's going to happen.

157
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:57.860
On the other end, I saw one guy, um, he had it and it was fairly mild.

158
00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.840
And then the quarantine and he got over it,

159
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:01.370
he was getting over it and getting better.

160
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.950
And then they quarantined him with a bunch of people that also had it.

161
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.890
And then he got it even worse. It's interesting. Cause I was like,

162
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.120
wonder how he got it again.

163
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:11.180
And I guess probably his immunity wasn't fully developed yet.

164
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.780
And then it just overwhelmed his immune system. Cause there was, you know,

165
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:17.090
he's basically quarantined with a bunch of other people that were really,

166
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:17.924
really sick,

167
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.620
but he got through it and he was talking about it and all these poor people that

168
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:22.580
are stuck on boats.

169
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.200
<v 1>Oh my God, it's crazy.</v>

170
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.380
<v 0>This is going to kill the cruise ship industry. Yeah. Guarantee.</v>

171
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.420
<v 1>That we just went on vacation.</v>

172
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.110
Then I have to say traveling and the like we went to this vacation spot.

173
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.140
Cause there's nobody there. It's actually, it's kind of nice.

174
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.020
<v 0>Right now. Woo. You got the whole beach.</v>

175
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.750
<v 1>To yourself. We had everything to ourselves. It was amazing.</v>

176
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.440
<v 0>Yeah. I'm wonder, you know, I wonder, uh, how this is gonna play out.</v>

177
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.120
<v 1>We go like, you know, you're even at our hotel eating at the buffets and stuff,</v>

178
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.400
but like to your point, I'm just like, it. What are we going to do?

179
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.710
<v 0>They're closing down buffets. That's one of the things they're in Vegas.</v>

180
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.880
They're closing down. Buffets.

181
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.310
<v 1>FES are huge. I haven't been to Vegas too many times,</v>

182
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:02.190
but the one time I was there, I had pretty crazy buffet.

183
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.970
<v 0>Yeah. I mean all you can eat just pig out some of those buff,</v>

184
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.030
but that's also how they do it on a lot of cruise ships. They have buffets.

185
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.900
<v 1>I only went on one cruise ship and by the end I wanted to throw up like,</v>

186
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.080
oh my God. Cause the first day you're like the food's amazing.

187
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.690
It's so buttery gross. Yeah.

188
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.530
<v 0>It's like being stuck on an apartment building fill with drunks,</v>

189
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.320
but you're all on the roof. And if you jump off the side,

190
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:26.340
you're definitely dead. Yes.

191
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.260
<v 1>And they're feeding you the fattiest grossest, but tasty food. Yeah.</v>

192
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.453
No. Oh man.

193
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.940
<v 0>That's your mood. Some people would just it. Let's go all in.</v>
