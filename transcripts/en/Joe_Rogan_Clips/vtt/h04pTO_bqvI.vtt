00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Oh, I, sir, I'm doing good. See you, man.</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.290
What does it feel like? What does it feel like having step back? You step away,

3
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.740
you get to look at it from a fresh perspective. What does this feel like? It.

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.280
<v 1>It feels good, man. It, it feels, uh, I think the biggest thing with me, Joe,</v>

5
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:23.000
is there's satisfaction in my life. You know what I'm saying?

6
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.680
I've done so much in the sport and I can compare myself a little bit to

7
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:28.700
Daniel. You know,

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.780
Daniel would have beat steeper meal chick and he would have retired on top of my

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.750
head. You could almost say retired at the two division world champ.

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.410
And that I don't feel like I have that chip on my shoulder. You know,

11
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.970
as a wrestler, I retired from the Olympics at a very young age, you know,

12
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:46.790
decided to come back three years later, but you know what I mean? It was,

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.850
it was already done. You know what I mean? I retired at the age of 21.

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.580
And then now at the age of 33, I'm, I'm,

15
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.430
I'm truly calling it quits unless there's,

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.450
there's a couple of fights that if I do come back, I like that word, unless.

17
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.640
<v 2>I like that word. Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.810
<v 1>And as you know, and, and, and, and,</v>

19
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.980
and a little bit it's before it was about the money, a little bit with the UFC,

20
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:11.420
and obviously, you know, everybody does have a price, but I think there's,

21
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.870
there's, there's a fight that I would really like in the USC.

22
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.390
And that would be against Alexander Vulcan. Norske.

23
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.300
<v 3>Real. Yeah. If 35 at 45.</v>

24
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.290
<v 1>If they were to give me an opportunity to go up and obviously be compensated,</v>

25
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.840
then that would be a fight that would really,

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.420
that would really wake me up in the morning. Be like, Hey man, this is,

27
00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.520
this is a challenge is a whole new mountain,

28
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.880
a chance to be a three division world champion,

29
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.610
a chance to be a through division world champion. As you know,

30
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:41.270
a lot of people have counted me out against Demetrius against TJ,

31
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.520
against Marlin. Maybe, maybe it was you.

32
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.100
<v 2>Too, Joe. That's what I love about it.</v>

33
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.110
You can't find any evidence to me counting you out, sir.

34
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.800
So I.

35
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.100
<v 1>Love that. I love challenges. And south was a kid. I knew I was,</v>

36
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.430
I knew I was different and you all special. And, uh,

37
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.960
these are the things that you knew, like what, what separates you? Oh my God.

38
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:05.900
I think it's, I think it's a couple of things that follows to explain it to you.

39
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.440
Like what's, what's made me successful in, and I've seen it, you know,

40
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.740
being at the Olympic training center as a high school kid and living out there

41
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.241
for four years.

42
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:18.350
And that's actually where I met Daniel and I was a six year old kid when I first

43
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:21.650
met these guys and I was able to analyze a lot of the greats, like, you know,

44
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.480
uh, Stephen NAB is Daniel Cormier, a lot of the Olympic team. And, uh,

45
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.610
what I've learned now that the age of 33,

46
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.040
I learned that there's been two things that have separated me from,

47
00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:33.680
from the rest of the pack. It's, it's, it's two things.

48
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.330
It's what I call heart and ability.

49
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.200
And I was actually able to tell this story to, uh, to chop tree, you know, the,

50
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.360
the fodder and CEO of one FC. And, uh, you know,

51
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:46.910
so it's two things. I call it heart and ability to what is your heart?

52
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:50.600
Your heart is your passion, your wheel, your desire, your determination,

53
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:55.340
your heart is something that you want to suffer for in order to obtain. Now,

54
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.460
the next one is ability. You know, ability is as a gift that you have since,

55
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.170
since she knows it's a coordination, it's,

56
00:03:03.171 --> 00:03:06.340
it's something that you've wrapped over time where you become a master at it.

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.170
And what happens a lot of time.

58
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.860
It's I always tell people it's good to question one or the other.

59
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.440
It's good to question the mind. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

60
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:16.960
The heart or the ability,

61
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:19.480
because to be the 1% of the one percenters,

62
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.360
like both of these things have to match what happens is a lot of people have

63
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.900
heart, but their abilities, I way down here, you know,

64
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.770
their ability does it match their heart or their abilities up here.

65
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.760
And they're just a little lazy and can't really put the, you know,

66
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.620
because there is a separation between mind and body and your job is to connect

67
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.980
them both. And I, and I'm going to use an example, uh, with Marla Mirage,

68
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.490
he saw me getting my kicked. He saw me getting laid kicked, you know,

69
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:47.350
from the first hallway to the second round,

70
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.140
but I knew that I had to connect and, and make that transition.

71
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:54.700
That was a combination of combined the heart and the ability, you know,

72
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.300
so I was able to kind of, so what separated me, I'd say that I think is being,

73
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.550
being gifted through the ability and then just having, uh, a passion of will.

74
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:04.810
That's your second to none.

75
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.620
<v 0>There's a lot of other factors though. Isn't that there's like not just ability.</v>

76
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.580
It's also,

77
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.540
you have to be coached by someone who really knows what they're doing. It's,

78
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850
there's,

79
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.050
there's so many guys out there that are really tough and they have will,

80
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.360
and they, they work out hard and they're in shape,

81
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:24.900
but they just make technical mistakes and they've never corrected them those

82
00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:26.100
mistakes. Yeah.

83
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.250
<v 1>Well, I think that also goes back on the ability, uh,</v>

84
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.950
I would put that in to the ability portion.

85
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.430
The reason why is because you got to put yourself in the right situations.

86
00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:38.730
Like I didn't start winning until I let go of my coaches.

87
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.750
The first time I lost it, Demetrius Johnson, who was a man, I,

88
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.070
it was hard. And this sounds, this is some very crazy and cynical,

89
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:48.690
but it was kind of hard to blame myself,

90
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.820
even though I was traded because I knew coming from the Olympic sport that I had

91
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.730
a coach that could take me to the top and there was no ifs, or what's like,

92
00:04:56.731 --> 00:05:01.020
I knew he knew the recipe and it may was still a fairly new and it's still

93
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.590
fairly new sport. So I knew that I had to find the professors.

94
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.770
I knew that I had to find the scientists and all this again,

95
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:11.490
in order for me to become that perfect storm. So that's exactly what we did.

96
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:16.260
You know, putting, putting the science, the recovery of find the right coaches,

97
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.350
listening to my ability to understand in my bomb mechanics,

98
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.740
like it was a mixture of, of, of all these things. That's,

99
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.060
that's made that separated me from the first time I fought Demetrius till just

100
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.770
be not just being a latching killer man,

101
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:32.580
to being all these guys that they said that, you know, Demetrius Johnson, TJ,

102
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.930
you know, Mala, Mariah's Dominick Cruz, man. That's, that's.

103
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 4>A hell of a list. Joe lists, you know, it's a hell of a list.</v>

104
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.810
It's one of the reasons.

105
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.100
<v 0>Why it bums me out that you retired like two conflicting feelings,</v>

106
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:47.520
one I'm happy, I'm happy, retired, young and healthy,

107
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.020
and you could do anything you want, man.

108
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:52.410
I really believe a guy who can accomplish what you accomplished inside the

109
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.690
octagon and also winning an Olympic gold medalist.

110
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.370
You winning Olympic gold medal in wrestling at 21 years old,

111
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.850
retiring from the sport, then getting into MMA, being,

112
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.010
coming a two division world champion in MMA,

113
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.990
and then stepping away while you're still healthy.

114
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.600
And at the peak of your abilities, part of me loves that.

115
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.720
I love the fact that you did what you wanted to do, and then you step away.

116
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.110
But part of me looks back at like say,

117
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:19.280
when you fought Benevidez or say, when you fought Demetrius the first time,

118
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.250
and then it looks at you now, like you're a completely different animal.

119
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:26.210
Nobody had been able to shut down Dominick Cruz's footwork game,

120
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.430
but you came in and just chop the out of his legs, just right off the bat.

121
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.264
You, you,

122
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.990
whatever advantage we thought that he would have with his foot work and

123
00:06:35.991 --> 00:06:39.600
movement, what was actually becoming a disadvantage because you,

124
00:06:39.601 --> 00:06:42.570
you were using that against him. You, you,

125
00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:47.300
you found the angles and you found the perfect times to attack his legs,

126
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.510
and then you put them away, which is also something no one's ever done before.

127
00:06:50.511 --> 00:06:53.780
Except Uriah caught him in a submission and finish finished them.

128
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:56.240
But no one was ever putting them away, put them away the way you did.
