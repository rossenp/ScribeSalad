00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.650
one of the things that you said that you disagreed with Bernie on was lobbyists.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.640
Oh yeah.

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.420
<v 0>Yeah. Well,</v>

6
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.140
w I disagree with his notion that everything is attributable to some kind of

7
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:14.850
corporate greed and therefore lobbyists.

8
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.130
It's just not the source of our problems.

9
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.130
It's it contributes to it in some ways, for sure. I mean, these are not,

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.130
these are selfish actors. They, they, they have a role, right.

11
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.280
They're advocating for a specific thing. Um,

12
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.190
but I think politicians like to point to them is like the, the, the,

13
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.690
the Nia, the boogeyman,

14
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.650
it's just blame them for everything that I have. Not,

15
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:39.750
that is not been my experience, that it hasn't,

16
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.110
it has not been my experience that these lobbyists have any kind of excessive

17
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:47.850
control over politicians. I just don't see that. Okay. They, you know, they,

18
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.530
the corporate PAC and give you $5,000, that's it? I mean, this isn't, this,

19
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.220
isn't not in no way, shape or form. Can they buy anybody off? Um,

20
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:58.620
it's also a very transparent form of doing things.

21
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.590
There's this other talking point that it's all dark money. That's just not true.

22
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.350
A corporate PAC is a group of people who worked for a corporation.

23
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.260
They pulled their money together. They can't use company profits, just be clear,

24
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.280
it's this personal money.

25
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.010
And they have limits on what they can donate to that own pack.

26
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.010
And then they use that to advocate for whatever's important to that business.

27
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:16.560
And I tell people, where do you work? I'll ask you where,

28
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.710
what industry are you in? And they'll give me whatever industry let's say.

29
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.550
You definitely have a APAC lobbying for you on Capitol hill. All right.

30
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.860
And they'll, and they'll just point out bills. They'll say, listen,

31
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:28.020
this is problematic in this one, this would hurt our workers.

32
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:32.190
This would do this and put us out of business. Like, don't do that. It's it? Um,

33
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.730
you know, and so the, yeah, there's selfish actors don't get me wrong.

34
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:39.480
Like there, this is advocating for their thing, but that's also our.

35
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.700
<v 1>Democracy. Individuals can donate more.</v>

36
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.280
<v 0>Now. So an individual cap is $2,800 to, up to a campaign.</v>

37
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:51.190
And then a couple like you and your wife would, can double that. Okay. So.

38
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.080
<v 1>The same as.</v>

39
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.913
<v 0>A pack.</v>

40
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.940
<v 1>Basically the same, it's only $5,000 ish. That's the maximum.</v>

41
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.740
<v 0>That is the maximum, but.</v>

42
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.170
<v 1>There's also influence that comes with that. On top of financial,</v>

43
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.910
there's also influenced in terms of just cronyism and people,

44
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.410
reciprocating getting along with each other and working, you know,

45
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.850
establishing long-term relationships where they agree on things and they make

46
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:21.480
deals and they make deals that might not necessarily be in the best interest of

47
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:25.830
people like deals in terms of like what businesses get subsidies,

48
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.430
what businesses don't get subsidies, what things get negotiated, what dealt,

49
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:30.450
what, like, here's the perfect.

50
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.313
<v 0>Examples.</v>

51
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.470
So I think we should have a less powerful government that can't be bought off

52
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:37.410
like that. Yeah. You know, you won't give her if you want government,

53
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.040
because cronyism certainly happens. Right. And they'll say, listen, like those,

54
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:45.360
you know, and who can, who can lobby as the bigger, the bigger company.

55
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.870
So there's, there's some agreement here, but it's,

56
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.600
I think that there's somewhat misunderstanding of what's really happening.

57
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:54.810
So yeah. A big business can,

58
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:58.600
can lobby and then the last for more regulation. So, and,

59
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.060
and then who that really hurt. It hurts their smaller competitors.

60
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:04.720
So the answer is actually who's at fault here.

61
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.770
It's the fact that government's trying to accessibly regulate so much and it,

62
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.000
and it creates, it creates a situation where there's no longer competition.

63
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.440
Okay. Then that's a, that's a real problem now. Um, you know,

64
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.780
that excessive influence though, again, it's,

65
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.250
it's not something I've seen because there's a lot of competition for influence.

66
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.910
Anybody can come to your office and they all, they all disagree, right?

67
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.330
There's all these different interests that,

68
00:03:29.331 --> 00:03:31.510
that actually compete with one another and,

69
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.730
and they represent different interests. So it's, it's not,

70
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.100
it's not self evident to me that that influences is certainly not bought. And,

71
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.030
uh, and, and, and I, I don't, I don't necessarily believe it's excessive either.

72
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:44.710
It's just not what I've seen. Maybe they don't,

73
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.300
maybe they just don't come to me. Well.

74
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.850
<v 1>When I think it was Northwestern university did a study recently where they</v>

75
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:52.330
were,

76
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.280
they showed the public support for policies and public

77
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:58.750
support for, for,

78
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.850
for bills and how low the public support is in comparison

79
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:08.350
to things that get passed and how, when the public, what it was,

80
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.620
things that the public absolutely wanted,

81
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.430
like across the board had something in the range of a 30% chance of getting

82
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.264
passed through.

83
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.310
Whereas there's many things that the public absolutely did not want across the

84
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:24.100
board also had a 30% chance of getting through.

85
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.540
And they were talking about the various influences that may lead to these

86
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.500
policies getting passed. Now, the argument is that you're, you're,

87
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.910
you're electing representatives,

88
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:38.620
those representatives don't do you justice and pass bills and, and,

89
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.760
and enact policies that would help your community and help you.

90
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.380
Then you elect them out of office, but the damage gets done while they're there.

91
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.060
And the idea is that these people would then go on from there,

92
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:53.860
once they've established that influence.

93
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.120
And once they've helped these people get jobs in the corporate sector,

94
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.130
get jobs that represent what they've done for those

95
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:07.030
corporations while they were representative supposedly of the people.

96
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.830
<v 0>Yeah. I think that's, uh,</v>

97
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.740
you're gonna have to really dig into like what issue they're talking about,

98
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.280
what issues not supported by the public. I mean, uh, that's, uh,

99
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.350
I you'd have to unpack those statistics, I think,

100
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:19.570
to really understand what's happening there. The,

101
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.850
but I Al I think that's too cynical of a way to look at politicians.

102
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:25.241
I just don't,

103
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.300
I don't feel that way about my colleagues on the left or the right. Well,

104
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.230
how long have you been a Congressman seven months? So I just, in my mind, like.

105
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.230
<v 1>Nine months in, they start coming to, you may.</v>

106
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.340
<v 0>Maybe know we meet with them. It's just like, they just,</v>

107
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.820
they don't have this influence, you know, they're not, I mean, listen to, they,

108
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:41.650
they present one, they one,

109
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.360
they generally meet with the lobbyists that they already agree with you. Um,

110
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.620
and, and they're generally bringing up very minute things that are,

111
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.710
that you just would never know about if they didn't bring that to you.

112
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.440
<v 1>There's some bills that get passed like that. Don't like, here's one, right?</v>

113
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.011
Medicaid,

114
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:02.870
Medicaid spends billions of dollars on drugs for the elderly and people that

115
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.690
can't afford them billions of dollars. But by law,

116
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.870
the government's not allowed to negotiate the price of those drugs.

117
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.420
<v 0>Okay. So in the price negotiations, how did that happen? Well, it,</v>

118
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.610
it, how did it happen? It, well, it never, it was never a thing to begin with.

119
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:20.630
So the,

120
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.020
there's an argument to me that the government should be able to negotiate

121
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.200
prices, right? The question is, what is the price?

122
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.800
And the other thing you have to point out is there's already a strong force

123
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.830
against the pharmaceutical industry, which is the insurance companies,

124
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.430
because they have an interest in making sure that price is as low as possible.

125
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.850
They're fighting all the time against the pharmaceutical companies in the

126
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.610
healthcare industry. All of these groups are often pitted against each other.

127
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.330
And then as politicians, we kind of look at all of them and we say, all right,

128
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.300
what are your arguments? What are your arguments? Um,

129
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.130
is what you're saying really makes sense.

130
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:54.740
And then we have to make those decisions based on the overall good,

131
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:57.680
but you're going to everybody off when you do that. Like, that's,

132
00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.330
especially with healthcare, because all of these,

133
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.920
a lot of these groups are pitted against each other.

134
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:04.610
So you've got insurance already pitted against pharmacy. Um,

135
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.890
and then it becomes a pretty good question. Like,

136
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:08.690
what is government's role there? Cause I've,

137
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:12.650
I've when I first looked at this problem, I said, yeah, yeah, just negotiate.

138
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.180
Well, that makes sense. Um, I learned a lot more. I learned a lot more and,

139
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.750
and it's not because I met with any lobbyists. It has nothing to do with that.

140
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:23.690
It's because I meet with healthcare professionals and experts who know this

141
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.300
issue really well and economist who,

142
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.000
and it's very far from self-evident that this would work.

143
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:32.900
And it's far from self-evident, that would be beneficial, uh, at all,

144
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.580
and actually make a difference. You know, when we,

145
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:37.220
when we look at the differences in healthcare spending between us and other

146
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:41.270
countries, uh, the drug prices actually have very little to do with them. Uh,

147
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.400
they're able to negotiate those, but they also get,

148
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.890
they also get last choice for medicine. Okay.

149
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:47.360
When you look at great Britain and Canada,

150
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.960
that they're not getting the premiere new drugs like we have in the United

151
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.890
States, um,

152
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.520
we get screwed as Americans because the patent laws are not enforced in these

153
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:59.870
other countries. So our pharmacy, our pharmaceutical companies, um,

154
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.830
they immediately get ripped off in other countries. And that that's a problem,

155
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.360
you know, how do we that's, that should be something.

156
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.740
<v 1>And they get ripped off in that.</v>

157
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:10.100
They've done the research to create these drugs and these other companies in the

158
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:12.020
other countries. So just copy these.

159
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.950
<v 0>Drugs, make generics.</v>

160
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:16.820
<v 1>Because they have socialized medicine and their obligation is to provide</v>

161
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:19.670
medicine to the people. So their obligations to,

162
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.100
they don't care about these copyrights.

163
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.930
They just care about getting medicine to the people. Now,

164
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:28.700
some people would argue that that is in favor of the population in favor of the

165
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:29.534
people that need.

166
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.580
<v 0>Healthcare. I would argue it's not sustainable, though.</v>

167
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.421
It might make it feel good,

168
00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:34.190
but it's not going to do good in the long run because you still.

169
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.170
<v 1>Profit. Even if they're well.</v>

170
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.810
<v 0>They're, they're having they're profiting because they're charging a merit.</v>

171
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:42.020
Well, America is basically paying for this, right. Which is, which is why it's,

172
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.080
which is why it's important for like trade agreements to say, Hey,

173
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:48.620
you guys have to enforce the same patent laws that we have. Otherwise, this,

174
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.610
this is not sustainable situation because eventually you don't make a profit.

175
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.950
Right. Right. And that's, and that's not fair for,

176
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.720
so that's the new NAFTA deal was negotiated this way,

177
00:08:57.721 --> 00:09:02.460
the U S MCA to addressing some of these concerns, for instance, uh, and that's,

178
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.560
that's the right thing to do. Like you ha you have to,

179
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.450
you have to align a cent incentives. When you're talking about any policy,

180
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.180
we have to dig a few layers. It's never as simple as Bernie Sanders says it is.

181
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.970
It never is. He always makes it out to be so simple. It's greed.

182
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.950
Everything is attributable, degrade.

183
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.780
Everything is attributable to the 1% they own you. They, they,

184
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.620
they own the lobbyists. They own all this listen.

185
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.950
There's elements of truth and all of that. But what my point is,

186
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:30.120
it's just not the overarching thing. There's so much more complexities to that.

187
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.290
And we have to have those conversations and like, we're just,

188
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.310
we're we're instead, what we see is just very extreme talking points.

189
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:38.671
First of all,

190
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:43.530
very extreme interpretations of the actual problem and therefore leading

191
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:45.390
to very extreme solutions to that.
