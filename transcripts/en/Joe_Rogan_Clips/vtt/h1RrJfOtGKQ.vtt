1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.710
<v 0>You did the, those, those episodes on the game-changers the, uh, with James was,</v>

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.060
and that was, it was fascinating to watch. Cause I, I watched that movie and,

3
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.020
you know,

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.850
nutrition is also like diet is such an important part of what we do to

5
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:19.380
ourselves that we, that we don't think.

6
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.610
And especially in a time of COVID where so many people, like you say,

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.870
like when you see what this does to people with type one diabetes or, or, uh,

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.660
w with other kinds of, uh, you know,

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.160
conditions that might be caused from either poor diet or lack of access to,

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.150
uh, no healthier options and things like that, you realize like,

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.870
we can put ourselves in a very vulnerable position.

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.030
<v 1>Very vulnerable, but how we eat, Andrew Schultz had a really good point.</v>

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.080
He said, this, this pandemic highlighted the vulnerabilities,

14
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:54.920
both in our economic system and in our health system,

15
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:58.970
like the way we are as human beings, what, who who's vulnerable,

16
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:02.930
the obese people, people with diabetes, older folks. I mean, it, it,

17
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.040
it highlights all these issues where, you know, we,

18
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:09.020
we really need to concentrate on for the future.

19
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.110
If you want more people to survive this, there is,

20
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.410
there are strategies that can be implemented. And we really,

21
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.040
we really need to talk to people about just being normal stuff,

22
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.010
being dehydrated,

23
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:24.260
being well-hydrated making sure you're not dehydrated well rested, um,

24
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.191
teach people,

25
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:29.150
meditation techniques is not hard to learn some breathing exercises that have

26
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:32.360
been actually proven to increase your immune function.

27
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.200
It's not hard to teach people about vitamin D and supplementing.

28
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.370
And if you can't go outside.

29
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.520
<v 0>How do you get people then to take action?</v>

30
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.220
Because here's the other thing you remember, like people's lives are hard.

31
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.670
You're dealing when you're talking about like what we talked about earlier,

32
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.400
like economic inequality, you know,

33
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.760
it's hard to go into an area where they feel like.

34
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.280
I don't know where my next meal is coming from and be like,

35
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.930
so here's what we're going to do.

36
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.660
We're just going to sit and breathe quietly for five minutes.

37
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.870
And everything's going to know it's a really difficult,

38
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.340
it's like hierarchy of needs. You know, how do you,

39
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.950
how do you work into the idea that those types of theories are

40
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:17.750
actually important to the betterment of like in the stability

41
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.800
of the larger part of their life when they're fighting so hard just to stay

42
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:22.850
afloat? Yeah.

43
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.500
<v 1>It's a, that's an interesting point. And, uh, I think what you have to do is it,</v>

44
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.000
it has to be, first of all, told by people who are doing it successfully.

45
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.590
So people that are doing it that like maybe were struggling with their immune

46
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:39.560
system and turned it around and got healthier.

47
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.860
Like those people are the ones that the people that are in a bad position right

48
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:45.590
now, they really respond to when it comes to,

49
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.090
there's an emotional connection with,

50
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.990
if you see some guy is on the cover of men's health magazine,

51
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.950
he's ripped and he starts talking about fitness. You're like,

52
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:54.950
get the outta here. I can't relate to you. I'm never going to look like that.

53
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.560
But if you see someone who is in the city,

54
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.310
the situation that you're in and they turned it.

55
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.710
<v 0>Around, you already look like that.</v>

56
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.650
<v 1>Well, not me, but listen, I've been working out my whole life.</v>

57
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.160
I've never stopped, but if someone is fat,

58
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.270
I'm talking from their perspective and they see some guy who's really thin and

59
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.050
chiseled,

60
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.530
then it's not going to make sense to them that they could ever be like that.

61
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.080
But if they see someone there's a lot of really fantastic photos and

62
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.430
Instagram and Facebook pages online,

63
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.150
where you can get inspiration from someone who actually stuck to a diet,

64
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:33.130
actually stuck to an exercise routine and then speaks really well about how much

65
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.550
it improved, the way they feel, their emotions, their depression,

66
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.620
all the aspects of their life. And that's,

67
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:42.490
I think one of the more like David Goggins is a great example that I use him all

68
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:47.200
the time because he's this incredibly inspirational guy who is a Navy

69
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:49.540
seal. And at one point in time, he was 300 pounds.

70
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:53.440
He was drinking milkshakes and he puts those pictures of himself on Instagram

71
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.280
all the time, just to let people know, Hey, I'm not some alien,

72
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.930
I'm a person who is weak, just like you. I was lazy, I got fat.

73
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.890
And then I figured out how to train my mind to be disciplined and I'd figured

74
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.910
out how to be happier.

75
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.050
And I think that that's really important for people to see that it's,

76
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.790
we're not in a static state,

77
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.970
we're all in a constant state of improvement and growth hopefully,

78
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.860
or deterioration if you're not careful.

79
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.830
<v 0>But does that, you know,</v>

80
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.750
the thing that I worry about those sometimes is similarly to

81
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.490
economic distress, does it make a person's health,

82
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.370
be a function of their Bertschi? Does it,

83
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.720
does it take something that is beyond a lot of people's control that?

84
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:41.520
Isn't that a little bit of like, imagine if you just pull your pants up, you,

85
00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:45.360
you could do it. Like, no, it's not on the way.

86
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.370
<v 1>No you're saying, but it's not it's I did this and I can show you how I did it.</v>

87
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:52.380
And maybe you can do it too. That's what it is.

88
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.000
We don't have to look at every success is somehow or another.

89
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.860
They're thumbing in the face of people who can't achieve a similar goal,

90
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.640
but there are enough people out there that can,

91
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.940
that we should concentrate on that because I think it will have a significant

92
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.690
improvement on the overall health of us, again, as a community.

93
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.910
And I think this is really how we have to look at the United States and human

94
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:16.350
beings on earth. In general,

95
00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:19.740
we have to look at each other as a bunch of people that could very well be

96
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:21.510
neighbors. We're, we're a community.

97
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.700
And if you're my friend and you were fat and you were willing to listen and I

98
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.760
used to be fat too. And I can tell you, Hey man, this is what I did.

99
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:30.594
I stopped drinking.

100
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.830
<v 0>Well, there are people that are there. There are people that are Jim. I mean,</v>

101
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.140
I understand the point there and I'm look,

102
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.770
I'm an advocate for plant based stuff. I think that's a healthy way to do it.

103
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.420
Uh, but obviously eating is such a personal experience that I hesitate to ever,

104
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.750
uh, impart that in any other way.

105
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.230
But I just feel like

106
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.320
sometimes for people,

107
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.080
it's almost more debilitating for that mentality of

108
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.920
this is how you do it.

109
00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.640
You just got to get your together and go through this way.

110
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.550
I do think you have to present more options,

111
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:12.410
but know that it's maybe more complicated and people can be overweight or

112
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:16.970
whatever and be healthy. It's not necessarily, uh,

113
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.800
you know, something that's corrosive to them. But well.

114
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.010
<v 1>It is though being overweight is necessarily corrosive.</v>

115
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.330
It's not healthy for anybody.

116
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.040
It's less healthy than being at an optimal weight.

117
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.340
That's what's important. It gives you some sort of a burden,

118
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.570
whether that burden is sustainable is debatable. Maybe for some people,

119
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:38.980
it is for some people, it isn't look.

120
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.410
Some people can smoke until they're 90 and they're fine.

121
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.920
Other people get pancreatic cancer like Hicks and die in their thirties.

122
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.090
It depends wildly on the person,

123
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.660
but the idea that you can be fat and you can be healthy,

124
00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:56.470
I think is a dangerous narrative because you're telling people, listen,

125
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.630
don't improve. You don't have to,

126
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.020
you can be healthy and be obese at the same time.

127
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.070
But the medical science does not really support that.

128
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.300
The more weight you lose up to a certain point, you know, but when you,

129
00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:14.860
if you get to a healthy body mass, your body works better. It's really simple.

130
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:18.640
It doesn't tax your immune system as much. It doesn't tax your heart as much.

131
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.210
It's better for you. It's better for your joints. Um,

132
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.460
it doesn't mean that we should ignore people that are overweight and you know,

133
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.050
and pretend that, you know, they're, they're not worthy or they're not,

134
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:33.723
they're not good.

135
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.901
<v 0>Definitely. It is.</v>

136
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:39.070
I have a very emotional reaction to that because I feel protective.

137
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.110
You're nice over people. And I just, yeah, I think, yeah.

138
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.930
<v 1>It's great. That's a good thing. No, it is.</v>

139
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:50.800
It's the reason why you're thinking like this, because we're talking,

140
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.310
we're talking about people doing well and you're like,

141
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.840
what about the people who can't do well,

142
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:59.200
let's reach out to them and offer them an olive branch. And yeah, I get it, man.

143
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.390
I get it. You're right. You're right. Look,

144
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:05.320
I have very good friends that are morbidly obese and they don't want to listen.

145
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.200
And there's nothing I can do. I just hug them. And I see them. And you know,

146
00:08:08.201 --> 00:08:11.200
I hope that one day they come to grips with it and they change,

147
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.380
but they don't have to, you know, you,

148
00:08:13.381 --> 00:08:15.070
you live this life for a certain amount of time.

149
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:18.610
And if you want to live it eating cake and drinking beer, that's you,

150
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.610
you do whatever you want. We're all on the end. In the end,

151
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:23.530
we're all going to be in the ground. It's all pointless.

152
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:27.753
<v 0>Wait a minute.</v>

153
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.530
We just had an hour long conversation about the optimistically taking this

154
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:36.430
country and turning it around and got very fatalistic all of a sudden, well.

155
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.780
<v 1>That's true. The end in the end, we're all dying. That's how that story ends.</v>

156
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:45.520
We're all dead. So the story, what I don't want people to do is suffer.

157
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.830
And I want people to feel better while they're alive.

158
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.730
And I think that's something that's missed in the message of health improvement.

159
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.241
So like,

160
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:56.280
you will actually have a better experience on earth and it'll help you mitigate

161
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.290
stress. It'll help you. Uh,

162
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.040
it'll help you have better relationships because you won't be burdened down with

163
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.940
a lot of like anxiety and stress that literally comes from a physical release of

164
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:08.550
energy. I look at the body like a battery,

165
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.630
and I think that some people's batteries just overflowing with corrosive

166
00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:15.930
material because they never exert it. They never blow it out in a battery.

167
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:18.240
A battery is a bad analogy, but there's,

168
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.400
there's a certain amount of physical requirement.

169
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:24.900
I think your body has to ha has. And if you don't give that, that body,

170
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:26.220
that physical exertion,

171
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:31.050
it doesn't feel good where we've evolved to hunt and gather and build

172
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.360
homes and survive from predators.

173
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:37.680
And we carry around all the burdens in our body of this past.

174
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.310
And there's no getting around that and you can either deny it and just deal with

175
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:44.190
all the tension or you can exert your energy,

176
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.110
find some way to calm your mind and live a life. That's better.
