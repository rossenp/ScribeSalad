1
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 0>Maybe even more interesting is Astair Ovre and Francis and Ghana</v>

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.400
because Astair Ovre is one of the most experienced guys in the division.

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.360
Of course, em is the former dream heavyweight champion,

4
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.190
former Strikeforce heavyweight champion and former K one grown on pre

5
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.250
champion.

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.150
One of the very best kickboxers to ever fight in MMA without a

7
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:27.770
doubt.

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.710
But you wanna talk about a guy who has been in wars like let's Google

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.390
Allister, EMS overall record,

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.020
because it's gotta be crazy far as the, uh,

11
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:46.140
number of times he's been stopped. I mean, it's really bananas.

12
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.700
Let's go and look. Well first look at his MMA career.

13
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.900
We'll count this up and this is no disrespect to him.

14
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.300
I'm a huge Aster overing fan.

15
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.100
And I'm not saying that he should retire or anything crazy like that,

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.530
but let's just take a look at how many arms he's been

17
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:05.970
stopped just in MMA. Okay.

18
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.850
So he won two fights in a row. Uh,

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.290
fantastic victory over Mark Hunt.

20
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.210
He Cod him with knees and won a split decision over FEI over

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.970
doom, um, or actually a majority decision. One of the referees I guess, caught,

22
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.840
or one of the judges called it a draw.

23
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.160
I thought that that was a very close decision,

24
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.920
but I thought that ver was gonna get the nod quite honestly. Let's look at the,

25
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.280
the times he's lost though. Steve ACHI, when he fought for the title,

26
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.640
knocked him out. Okay.

27
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.750
Before that Ben Rothwell knocked him out before that of

28
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.470
brown knocked him out before that Antonio Bigfoot Silva knocked him out

29
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.470
brutal knockout.

30
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.350
So that's just within the last four years in the

31
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.290
UFC,

32
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.190
he suffered four brutal knockouts before that Sergei

33
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.660
carton off knocked him out. Brutal knockout in 2007, 10 years ago,

34
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.860
Mauricio Shogun Whoah knocked him out also in 2007, uh,

35
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.980
he lost to Ricardo Oona. He got, um, stopped in that fight.

36
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.100
He tapped, uh, to strikes, uh,

37
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.940
Erio Nora, uh, stopped him little NOGS stopped him.

38
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.890
Uh, corner, stopped it by it's a TKO that was in 2006.

39
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.570
He got stopped by Frei overdo, but that was a Kamora. That was a submission,

40
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.490
um, show gun who stopped him, uh,

41
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.770
the first time in 2005. So show gun knocked him out twice.

42
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.000
He T Cod him in 2005 and Cod him in

43
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.000
2007.

44
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.400
Before that little nog beat him by decision Chuck

45
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.380
Lael,

46
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.760
Cod him in a fantastic fight where overing was really coming on strong against.

47
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 1>Chuck. And then, uh,</v>

48
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.080
Chuck caught him with some brutal punches and Cod him.

49
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:09.760
That was in 2003. Before that Bobby Hoffman,

50
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.360
a lot of people forgot about Bobby Hoffman, way back in rings.

51
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.520
Um, Cod him in 2000

52
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.430
and that's it for MMA.

53
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.750
So just MMA Kos, right?

54
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.270
The first Ko loss we have Bobby Hoffman,

55
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.710
then we have Chuck Lall. Then we have show gun.

56
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.710
Then we have, uh, little,

57
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.820
then we have AONA. Then we have Shogun again.

58
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.380
Then we have carton off. Okay. We already have seven that's carton off.

59
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.860
Then we have Bigfoot silver eight, Travis brown,

60
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.340
nine Ben Rothwell, 10 steep chick, 11,

61
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.690
11 stoppage losses in MMA. I mean, holy.

62
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.650
That's crazy. 11 knockout or stoppage losses in MMA.

63
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.690
Then you go to kickboxing.

64
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.440
Barari stopped him in the K one gro pre vinyl

65
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.800
in 2009, he stopped him. Um,

66
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.840
he got stopped by FETO in,

67
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.960
um, Kein versus K one, 2004.

68
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.160
He got K he got stopped by Bernard Paris,

69
00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.910
K one Holland that's in 2001.

70
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.030
So 1, 2,

71
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.790
3 K losses in kickboxing on top of all the other

72
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.430
MMA losses. That's a lot of stoppage losses folks.

73
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.380
And it's led people to question the durability

74
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.860
of the current guy.

75
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.500
But what we do know is that Astair is extremely

76
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.101
crafty.

77
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:15.020
And one of the things that I like about Astair these days is since he's gone

78
00:05:15.021 --> 00:05:19.700
over to, uh, Jackson and winkled John in Albuquerque,

79
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.130
he has become much more elusive, um,

80
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.290
much slicker on his feet, moves around a lot more.

81
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.890
And doesn't just try to smash people. The Uber aim,

82
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.170
the guy that we saw fight Brock Lesner when in his

83
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.690
UFC debut, that was like classic Uber aim, which is jacked to the,

84
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.560
smashing people running through Ru people.

85
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.040
He would meet force with greater force. Now,

86
00:05:46.041 --> 00:05:50.920
what you're seeing is what you're seeing is the ster overing that

87
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.000
fought junior, do Santos, who fought an incredibly clever fight,

88
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.640
moved around well. Um, he was.

89
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.200
<v 2>Very, very slick,</v>

90
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.880
very difficult to hit and then started scoring on junior and then eventually

91
00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:06.640
caught him with a beautiful left hook and Cod him.

92
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.920
That's that to me is the interesting Andre Arlosky is

93
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.110
today a guy who realizes that perhaps he can't take a lunch like he

94
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:19.950
did when he was younger. You know, he's been in a lot of really,

95
00:06:19.951 --> 00:06:23.830
really tough fights as we just went over and realizes like, Hey,

96
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.310
now I have to be smart. Now I have to be clever. I have to move around a lot.

97
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.270
I have to use my skills and his skills are substantial. In my opinion,

98
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.670
he's the best right up there with Mark Hunt, of course, um,

99
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.180
who he just beat the best heavyweight kickboxer ever,

100
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:43.180
when it comes to credentials, he's the best heavyweight kickboxer ever in MMA.

101
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.180
Really? Uh, no, no heavyweight kickboxer.

102
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:50.220
Other than him and hunt have ever won the K one grand Prix and hunt won it.

103
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.940
He stepped into the finals as an alternate. He had lost earlier that night. Uh,

104
00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.780
not to take anything away from hunt, cuz of course,

105
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.930
mark is still just one of the, the all time greats when it comes to kickboxing.

106
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.970
But when Mark Hunt won, um, he won.

107
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.050
We can go to that record right here. Mark Hunt won, um, the,

108
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.010
the K one ground pre he won it. He had lost that night.

109
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.490
Mm see,

110
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.400
see he's he's fought the K one grand PR a couple times he lost a semi Sult. Uh,

111
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.160
he got, uh, TKO by spitting back kick and he won,

112
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.160
um, well, God he's fought a lot of awesome kickboxing fights too.

113
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.120
So he lost to Rayo

114
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.560
in 2001 in the semi-finals

115
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.150
and then he won that night. He beat Stephan Leko.

116
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.030
So he lost to Rayo Rayo apparently couldn't continue.

117
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.430
And then he came back to win from getting that right? Yeah.

118
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.550
Looks like he beat found, let go in the,

119
00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.870
uh, semi. Well, it says semifinals.

120
00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:11.870
It says wins K one grand pre championship, 2001. Oh, okay.

121
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:16.710
He fought Francisco Filio but that was in, I'm looking at a different date

122
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.750
that was in, uh,

123
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:25.220
2002 or 2001, he beat feeler anyway.

124
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.140
I'm rambling. Did you notice? Yeah, I'm talking too much. Uh,

125
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.980
but so he's fighting Francis,

126
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:35.460
Francis and Ghana and Francis and Ghana who is right now,

127
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:39.660
10 and one in the UFC 10, uh, ten one with, uh,

128
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:43.250
zero draw. So 10 wins just been smashing everybody.

129
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.810
And he looked at his, uh, last fight against Andre Arlosky.

130
00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:49.090
That was a fight where it was like probably one of the first fights where we

131
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:49.924
really got tested.

132
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.970
We really got to see what happens when he fights a former champion and a former

133
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.240
really world class fighter. And, uh, it was a good test,

134
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.520
but now a bigger test is in front of him when he is gonna fight Astair over him.

135
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.760
The, I mean, we've seen him so far, four times inside the octagon,

136
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.230
uh, he stopped Curtis blades. I knockout,

137
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.430
he stopped Bohan. I don't know how to say this guy's name again. Miha

138
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.750
Miha I don't. I remember how to go.

139
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.750
&lt;laugh&gt; boon Miha I do not remember how to say

140
00:09:29.751 --> 00:09:34.550
homeboy's name. Um, then he stopped Anthony Hamilton, uh,

141
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:37.620
by SI mission showing that he has mission skills as well.

142
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.060
And then of course just knocked out Andre Arloski in his last fight.

143
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.900
It's a very interesting fight because the, the question is,

144
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.660
is in Ghana, ready for a guy who's got the skills of Astair over him,

145
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.770
the skill, the experience at the highest level, the crafting a is,

146
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.570
is he gonna set traps and is Francis and Ghana

147
00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.050
gonna be fall for those traps?

148
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.930
The other question is can all can Alster over him,

149
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.810
take a shot from in Ghana and Ghana has legitimate

150
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.650
absolute one punch knockout, power, extreme confidence,

151
00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.200
and he's fr and in his prime right now,

152
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.720
actually entering his prime. I mean, arguably,

153
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.920
he hasn't even reached his prime yet because in Ghana is one of those guys that

154
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:29.760
at 31 years of age is near his physical prime,

155
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.720
but he's still learning. He's still getting better at the sport.

156
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.480
And as he fights better and better competition,

157
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.990
you're going to see more of his skills shine. You're going to see where,

158
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:42.310
where the holes are in his game,

159
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.350
and you're gonna see how he responds to adversity.

160
00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.350
Hopefully we're gonna get a chance to see all those things in this fight. Um,

161
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.750
if Ovre wins,

162
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:54.110
there's a very good argument for him being next in line to fights deep ABI.
