00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 2>Oh God,</v>

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.370
can you like minority report of like legitimate, serious?

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.630
<v 1>You know what the problem with that would be if you could go,</v>

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.980
like if you were with a baby and you CA he said,

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
because of this baby's life and where he's at this baby will one day be a

7
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.244
serial killer.

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.310
<v 0>I'm just trying to figure out how we got to just be in with the baby,</v>

9
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:28.560
with the scenario I'm just hanging. It's not even near baby.

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.610
<v 1>Well, you're at a hospital.</v>

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.810
Maybe there's some like some future prognostication tools where they can like

12
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
zoom in on a baby's brain and see exactly where it's going to go.

13
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.581
<v 0>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:42.870
there's gotta be something to having some sort of consistency with the neurology

15
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.763
of.

16
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.460
<v 1>I think it alters with a life.</v>

17
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.420
I think it's many things and obviously I'm a moron. So I don't really know.

18
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.280
<v 0>You say you're a moron. As I'm sitting,</v>

19
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.640
watching this beautiful sign lit up behind you in this gorgeous building,

20
00:00:56.641 --> 00:01:00.900
you are not a moron, you're total moron, but you're a very smart moron.

21
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.400
<v 1>Compared to smart people. You need to trust me, I'm a legit moron,</v>

22
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.330
but I have a, uh, a way of looking at things. It's, it's, um,

23
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.890
a little freer in my associations because I don't worry about being fired.

24
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.590
Right. And so I haven't worried about being fired for a long time.

25
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:19.650
So I have a certain freedom in the way I look at things,

26
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:23.550
but that's not intelligence. But my point is that I don't remember my point.

27
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.413
What were we talking about?

28
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.883
<v 0>We were talking about.</v>

29
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.020
<v 1>Serial killers. Yeah. Um,</v>

30
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.910
if you could take that child and raise it differently,

31
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.160
would it turn out to be an amazing person? See, like what happens to a person?

32
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.940
You know, the, the, the concept of determinism. Do you know that over freewill,

33
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.230
freewill, meaning that you have control of your destiny? Determinism is like,

34
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.080
hold on a second. It's way more complicated than that. Your,

35
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.890
who you are right now is a combination of many factors that are outside of your

36
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:57.780
control, particularly when you're a child abuse, violence, and trauma,

37
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.350
those shape a child in very horrific ways, uh,

38
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.640
and neglect. One of the things I was, I was watching a documentary about the,

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.180
um, unit Unabomber and the unit bombers brother, Ted Kaczynski.

40
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:12.300
His brother was talking about how, when Ted had a condition,

41
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:13.140
when he was a child,

42
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.290
they brought him to this place to treat him and they let these,

43
00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:19.830
he was a baby and they left him alone for like months.

44
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.810
So during a critical period of his life, like he had no love,

45
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.290
no touch of his mother. Like this is like really important stuff.

46
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.730
I forget how long the period was. I want to say it was like two months,

47
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.120
but even if it was like two weeks, like, what does that do to a child?

48
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.020
<v 0>It's gotta be.</v>

49
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.870
<v 1>Detrimental. See if you could find it, Jamie. It was, uh,</v>

50
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.910
in the documentary that is recently on,

51
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.600
I think it was on Netflix. The, he talked about it, you know?

52
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.530
So he lived in this shack in Montana and he would point guns and people and not

53
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:53.011
kill him.

54
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.610
And then he starts riding this manifesto and then he starts sending bombs to

55
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:59.950
people. But there's so many factors there. Here's, here's one,

56
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.640
besides the fact that it's his parents left him in this place.

57
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.640
They definitely left him in this place for a period of time that I think was

58
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.550
pretty extended. I think it was at least two weeks. It might've been two months.

59
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.540
Jesus. He was also part of the Harvard LSD experiment. Oh.

60
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.820
So in Harvard, during the 19, I guess it was fifties,

61
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.730
not sure when he was going to school at Harvard,

62
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.500
they were doing these LSD studies. And um, I was.

63
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.430
<v 0>Like, MK, ultra.</v>

64
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.090
<v 1>How's you don't know? Right. I would say, yeah, no, I don't know.</v>

65
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.103
And they must've had.

66
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.130
<v 0>For sure, they had studies helping them fuel their own studies.</v>

67
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.180
<v 1>And find a time. But this is what it says about it. Okay. Um,</v>

68
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.080
when Ted Kaczynski was, uh, at a tender age, he got sick.

69
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.010
It was taken to a hospital with hives or swollen red bumps that appeared on his

70
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:50.530
skin. His family said he was isolated from his parents.

71
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.930
His doctor tried to determine what was wrong with the infant.

72
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.920
Mom always faulted the hospital. They would have been there every day visiting,

73
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.090
but the hospital said, no,

74
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:00.850
David Kaczynski said in the docu-series and it was kind of like,

75
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.300
we don't want parents to be in the way we've got our work to do.

76
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:07.030
We have our little baby to cure. So keep your distance.

77
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.420
And they were only allowed to visit him two times a week for two hours.

78
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.160
Oh my God. It's insane.

79
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.350
<v 0>So then you think about us being a quarantine. Are we going to create serial?</v>

80
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.810
Okay.

81
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.010
<v 1>A little bit, but look at the bottom.</v>

82
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.420
He come out and he'd never been the same after that. She said,

83
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.570
so it changed him as a toddler. So you got that. Okay.

84
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:29.500
So this, uh,

85
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.830
this horrific neglect that he experienced as a child through no fault of his

86
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.280
own, so free will we have to look at freewill? Like, what does that mean?

87
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.190
Are you saying he has free, will like this guy with a broken brain?

88
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.730
Cause he was ignored as a child or people that were sexually abused as children

89
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.690
for years and years and years by a close family route relative or uh,

90
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.260
or a family member. And no one believes them. That that's real too. Right.

91
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.890
How much has that changed you? Then he goes on to be a part of these Harvard.

92
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.890
<v 0>LSD studies. And then you also have to factor into that. You have to factor.</v>

93
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.650
<v 1>In the gender. Pretty sure that's true. But you know, I'm wrong a lot.</v>

94
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.250
<v 0>Don't you think you have to factor gender in a little bit? Him?</v>

95
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.850
<v 1>Yeah. I'm sure. Anger. He was apparently like super,</v>

96
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.910
his brother talked about how he's super angry. When a girl would reject him,

97
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.840
he would get furious.

98
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.500
<v 0>Testosterone that is affected differently than somebody who's, you know,</v>

99
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:17.620
a female with estrogen being the leading hormone. Like there's gotta be,

100
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.970
that has to factor into it a little.

101
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.640
<v 1>Bit Unabomber in the Harvard joke, experiments.</v>

102
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.260
<v 0>I mean, you got to admire the outfit though.</v>

103
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.610
That style that's me in the airport.

104
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.230
<v 1>Um, does it say anything in their psychology today as a two? Okay.</v>

105
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.030
Where does it say that he was there? Oh,

106
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.910
it was a part of the entail or progress. Yeah.

107
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.510
So where does it say about Ted Kaczynski? Does it say that in there

108
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.620
I'm 99% sure. He was a part of the study.

109
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.480
<v 0>You'd be surprised. I mean, if,</v>

110
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.490
if Manson was it's like they had like the NBA starting

111
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:49.540
lineup of cereal.

112
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.410
<v 1>Just to Google, uh, Ted Kaczynski, there it is.</v>

113
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.380
<v 0>And analysis of the personality of adult Hitler.</v>

114
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.240
And that's the thing like how, when you think of the,

115
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.870
the circles of psychology and how many overlap,

116
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.830
how many are overlapping with people like Hitler and Ted Kaczynski and all of

117
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:14.210
these? Like what are the, what are those common denominators amongst them?

118
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:18.200
Because that's what we have to figure out is people who study the brain and,

119
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.560
and study behavioral patterns. That's really going to tell us a lot,

120
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.380
but you're right, like will and.

121
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.550
<v 1>Determinism or freewill.</v>

122
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.650
And I used to think much more that it was free will because I'm a stubborn

123
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:36.350
person. I said, look, you figure it up, bro.

124
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.240
Like when I was younger and particularly,

125
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.790
but the more I talked to people that really understand the concept, the more it,

126
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.770
it, let me relax my grip on my opinion, which is very important.

127
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.451
Right? When you,

128
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:53.600
you have an opinion about something it's very important to examine how much of a

129
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:56.960
grip you have on this opinion and whether or not this opinion is connected to

130
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.360
you judging your own intelligence. Are you in a,

131
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:02.840
like a game with people where your opinions better than their opinion? Like,

132
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:04.600
are you married to these ideas? Well.

133
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.040
<v 0>For people as well because of cognitive dissonance,</v>

134
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.640
like we have a natural reaction to learning new things.

135
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.260
<v 1>A hundred percent. Well, we, we have,</v>

136
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.910
we like things to fall in line with whatever we already, I, yeah.

137
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.950
W we very assumed as our ideas.

138
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.990
So this is the study and it says, uh, another ethically problematic,

139
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.700
and this is a up story. Ethically problematic study was conducted by, uh,

140
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.620
Henry a Marie Marie was a professor Murray was a professor at Harvard

141
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:37.550
university and had worked with the office of strategic services.

142
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.850
The predecessor to the CIA was before the CIA.

143
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:42.320
They didn't just didn't have a good name yet.

144
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.130
<v 0>What are we going to call? Just strategic services, put it on the, on the door.</v>

145
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.001
<v 1>What sounds better?</v>

146
00:07:47.001 --> 00:07:50.630
Central intelligence agency or the office of strategic services.

147
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.900
Strategic services is too hard to say. It's so hard to say it's too comfortable.

148
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.050
<v 0>Right? Well.</v>

149
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.180
<v 1>That's true. Yeah. But strategic services, like,</v>

150
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.420
like it sounds got a gun to your head.

151
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.580
What are you doing here for the office of.

152
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.860
<v 0>You have two strategic servicemen and your, and your.</v>

153
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.680
<v 1>Yeah. I agree with the name. CIA, it's a better name. I'll say. Okay.</v>

154
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.940
So during world war II, he wrote an analysis of the personality of Adolf Hitler,

155
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.700
which was a psychological, psychological analysis

156
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.070
of Hitler that was used. I can't just come up with a better word.

157
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.480
Why is psychological so long?

158
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.330
The mind of analysis of Hitler, it was used by the military.

159
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:37.190
And during this time he also helped develop tests to screen soldiers conducting,

160
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.180
uh, conducted as tests on brainwashing and determined how well soldiers could

161
00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:44.810
withstand interrogations. So what they were trying to do is break people.

162
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.640
So they took, this is what's crazy about it.

163
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:50.450
They took these students and they would do things to them.

164
00:08:50.451 --> 00:08:54.620
They would interrogate them and with them and they would also dose them.

165
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.390
And so the interrogation studies,

166
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.890
it says included intense mock interrogations on soldiers as part of

167
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.280
assessing the limits of their psychological breaking points. Okay. That's a.

168
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.550
<v 0>Little perverse.</v>

169
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.920
<v 1>Right? He conducted such interrogation studies on Harvard university</v>

170
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.790
undergraduates, Theodore Kaczynski, who led her later,

171
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:19.500
became known as the Unabomber was one of the 22 participants in Murray study

172
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.630
subjected to several years of interrogations designed to psychologically

173
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:25.890
break the young man.

174
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.870
<v 0>The people who have run these studies under the same interrogation</v>

175
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.290
that the soldiers of world war II were under,

176
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.240
where we went after the Nazis,

177
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:40.290
we should be going after people who ran these terrible tests and basically

178
00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:45.000
created some of society's most prominent and infamous

179
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.140
serial.

180
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.150
<v 1>That's a night. You're right. And it's,</v>

181
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:51.570
it's a nice way of looking at it that we D he deserves punishment.

182
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:55.230
We deserve revenge and all that stuff. Yes, yes.

183
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:57.030
And all of his victims deserve events.

184
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.890
But what I'm interested in is that this

185
00:10:01.891 --> 00:10:06.330
man, like if karma is real, if that's real,

186
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.490
if like what you are today is this long chain

187
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:13.980
of lies that you live that have brought you to this.

188
00:10:13.981 --> 00:10:17.400
And you're thinking of yourself in this income incarnation,

189
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.220
because this is the only one you've ever known. But in reality,

190
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:25.020
you're the process of this long line of beings that has gone on since the

191
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:26.010
beginning of life itself.

192
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.420
<v 0>All the ancestry in you.</v>

193
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.680
<v 1>What did that guy do in another life? Think about if that's true,</v>

194
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.930
I'm not saying it's true, but imagine if it is,

195
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.460
let's just as a thought experiment,

196
00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:40.110
imagine of it is that you're going to come back as a guy who is ignored in this

197
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:43.890
place, because they're treating you with some rando disease that you got,

198
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:46.680
that most babies don't get. So you have these horrible hives.

199
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.750
They keep you in this place where they take care of children for

200
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.970
weeks, they don't let you visit them a couple of times a week,

201
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.060
or however long they kept him there. I don't know how, I don't remember.

202
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:59.520
I want to say it was two months and.

203
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.260
<v 0>We know your numbers are a little off.</v>

204
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.390
<v 1>It could be an hour. He was.</v>

205
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.620
<v 0>There for 45.</v>

206
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.180
<v 1>Years. He was there. Most of his life, they let him out in college. So he,</v>

207
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.830
he gets out of there.

208
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.330
And then his brother would talk about these like moments of rage that he would

209
00:11:15.331 --> 00:11:17.880
have, that would be terrifying. And that like, uh,

210
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.500
like if a girl rejected in particular,

211
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:23.160
he would write like horrific notes to them, like really mean, mean notes.

212
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.080
And then this guy goes,

213
00:11:25.081 --> 00:11:29.730
and does these Harvard studies where they with him relentlessly and they're

214
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:30.391
trying to break him.

215
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:35.040
It's almost like they knew that this was a guy that was unusually broken.

216
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:38.820
<v 0>Right. And susceptible to breaking in the way that would benefit their study.</v>

217
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.500
And especially like,

218
00:11:40.501 --> 00:11:44.580
when you think about the male brain and the formative years go well into your,

219
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.560
into your fricking 20.

220
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.300
<v 1>Yeah. Like 25 to the frontal cortex. I think it's females too.</v>

221
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:53.470
I think maybe you guys are a little quicker. We're a bit quick. We're.

222
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.940
<v 0>Like 18, 19, but you know, still like he's on the heels of his brain,</v>

223
00:11:57.941 --> 00:11:58.780
barely being.

224
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.400
<v 1>Formed acid and trying to break him psychologically and.</v>

225
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.610
<v 0>Doing like mocking alone as a child on</v>

226
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.590
the playground.

227
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.660
Although I do think it's a necessary passage into adulthood is to deal with

228
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.510
adversity. Mocking alone is brutal.

229
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.640
And then you add it to this study with LSD being thrown into the mix where your

230
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:23.890
brain is not on a solid ground,

231
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.420
the way it's going to process everything is obviously detrimental to who you

232
00:12:28.421 --> 00:12:31.870
become. And it, it changes your, it changes your brain chemistry.

233
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.580
<v 1>Well, I think there's like a problem,</v>

234
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.080
a real undeniable problem with having secrecy.

235
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.070
What do you mean if you're like an organization that has ultimate power,

236
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:44.680
like the CIA in the 1950s,

237
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.270
and you can run these studies and no one knows about them and you're giving kids

238
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.840
acid and you're trying to break them. It's

239
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.120
Crazy to them who knows what they did do.

240
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:59.170
<v 0>Right. And it's like, is it really free or study? Or are you guys just bored.</v>

241
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.000
<v 1>Or do you just get to do this.</v>

242
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.740
<v 0>Right? Is this something you get to do?</v>

243
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.840
And you're just pushing the ticket because you can,

244
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:06.610
and you're funded that's so demented.
