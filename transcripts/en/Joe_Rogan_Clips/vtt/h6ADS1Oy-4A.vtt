00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So what were you just saying, Jamie?</v>

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.270
<v 1>We have Ellie's stay at home.</v>

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:12.390
Order will likely remain in place for the next three months,

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.410
unless there is a quote dramatic change to the virus and tools at hand

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.273
officials.

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.440
<v 0>How are people supposed to feed themselves? Like really realistically,</v>

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.360
how do they expect this to work?

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.530
<v 2>You go out to work and then you skitter her back home.</v>

9
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.890
<v 0>That's not what they're saying. That's not what stay at home means.</v>

10
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.420
Stay at home means, you know, go to work.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.410
<v 2>Yeah. But at the same time, they're opening up businesses, right?</v>

12
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.940
<v 0>Opening up very few businesses and you have to get curbside for retail. I.</v>

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.410
<v 2>Heard our governor in the state of California say that</v>

14
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:49.650
70% of businesses are open now. Right.

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.740
<v 0>Well, if that's the case, even if that was the case,</v>

16
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.790
let's say 30% of people are out of work. That's catastrophic. Yeah.

17
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.810
I don't think it's true. I don't, I don't think 70% of the places are open.

18
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.180
<v 2>That's what he said. 70% of the, even.</v>

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.730
<v 0>If they're open, they're not open at a hundred percent capacity.</v>

20
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.760
<v 2>Or they're probably working from home like offices,</v>

21
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:12.990
he's probably counting offices and those people are still working, getting paid,

22
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:13.740
but they're doing it from.

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.550
<v 0>I'm home. So this is just LA LA county LA. Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.910
So that means like comedy store has no chance.

25
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.490
<v 1>But yeah, I believe it was for the county. Yeah. So.</v>

26
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.250
<v 0>This is the same up who thought it would be a good idea to have people rat on</v>

27
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:30.930
people for money technically. Right.

28
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.540
<v 1>This was not coming from the mayor. This is coming from a health,</v>

29
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.870
someone in the health department talking at a supervisor.

30
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.150
<v 2>Meeting or something. So it was a suggestion. It wasn't a.</v>

31
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.960
<v 1>Not an official order, but it's.</v>

32
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.380
<v 0>Coming yet. Right. So it's not an official.</v>

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.551
<v 2>Non official or,</v>

34
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:49.170
but LA is the densest county in America.

35
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.660
How about that? Those.

36
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.553
<v 0>Are really.</v>

37
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.890
<v 2>More than New York. Yeah. As a county.</v>

38
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.500
<v 0>Huh? That seems.</v>

39
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.020
<v 2>Odd. Doesn't it? It does seem odd. It seems like there's like a, of.</v>

40
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.070
<v 0>New York city denser. Yeah. It's just New York. City's the, the,</v>

41
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:08.900
the thing about New York city that makes it great.

42
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.050
Is it everybody sorta mingles together? Everybody gets on the subway together,

43
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.020
but he walks together on the streets. Yeah.

44
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.420
That's also the reason why everybody's getting sick together.

45
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.990
<v 2>Yeah. But I saw an interesting thing that the highest,</v>

46
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.970
this guy wrote an editorial about the reasons for New York

47
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.900
and he lives in New York and he said, Staten island had the highest number.

48
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.010
This was written before. I think Brooklyn is now alleged it, but at the time,

49
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.371
uh,

50
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:38.150
that Staten island was the highest and it was the least densely populated and

51
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:41.150
Manhattan, which is the most densely populated,

52
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.330
had the fewer number of cases. Hmm.

53
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.410
<v 0>Hmm. Well, I wonder if that is similar to, you know,</v>

54
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.700
what they're finding with people that work together or that in prisons and

55
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:55.280
particularly they're finding that there was this one prison,

56
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.920
they did a study on 98% of the people were asymptomatic.

57
00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.643
<v 2>Really?</v>

58
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.570
<v 0>98%. Yeah. 98%. It's nuts. Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.320
It's weird. So I was bringing her up with a friend of mine and I was like, um,

60
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.650
what do you think this is? Because my friend Kyle Kalinsky. And he was like,

61
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.560
I think it's because their immune systems are strong.

62
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.310
Cause they're just interacting with each other constantly. And I was like, oh,

63
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.890
that kinda makes sense. Cause I was thinking, if you're in prison,

64
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.810
you're probably stressed out and you're getting bad.

65
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.180
<v 2>Food. Yeah. And horrible sleep.</v>

66
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.880
<v 0>And yet your immune system strong. Right.</v>

67
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.460
<v 2>Cause you're just being bombarded all the time.</v>

68
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.490
<v 0>You're being bombarded all the time. By stinky, dirty people.</v>

69
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.200
<v 2>You live in an isolated, fancy place, right.</v>

70
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.770
Purified air and all this.

71
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.890
<v 0>You're in a wonderful community in Brentwood. You don't see your neighbors ever.</v>

72
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.120
You don't go anywhere. Very fragile. Yeah. You go to the store, you come home.

73
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.360
And now our immune systems are, I would imagine,

74
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.250
and this is just pure speculation.

75
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.340
But I would imagine that your immune system is like all the other systems of

76
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:01.300
your body that when it gets tested, it gets stronger. Right?

77
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.320
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.041
<v 0>Yeah. For sure.</v>

79
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:07.690
So your immune system right now is being put into a state of atrophy because

80
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.730
it's not being exposed to anything new. Yeah.

81
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.850
<v 2>It's, it's a, it's in a lounge chair. It's just chill.</v>

82
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.140
It's got sunglasses on it. Hasn't worked in years.

83
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.810
<v 0>Yeah. It's got soft leg cramp up when it goes upstairs.</v>

84
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.790
<v 2>And all of a sudden it gets called to go to work. And it's just like, dude, why.</v>

85
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.770
<v 0>Wouldn't you imagine that's the case.</v>

86
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.770
<v 2>It seems like it. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.300
<v 0>I can imagine we're setting ourselves up to get really sick if something comes</v>

88
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.500
down the pipe. Yeah.

89
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.010
<v 2>Yeah. Well that was what was very strange in the beginning of all this,</v>

90
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:45.100
when people were saying that, you know, people just spout out,

91
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.950
you can't do anything for immune system. You can't make it stronger.

92
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.500
And it was like, really?

93
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.070
<v 0>Who was saying.</v>

94
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.790
<v 2>That just online. I, I,</v>

95
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:57.130
I did a thing with really just like people sprouting off. Yeah.

96
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.140
<v 0>Crazy. Because online it's written and when you see things written like, wow,</v>

97
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.190
this must make sense.

98
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.570
<v 2>It's real.</v>

99
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.110
<v 0>I know it's got 150,000 likes. This has gotta be real.</v>

100
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.990
<v 2>It's just, Bob said it it's just a matter of a guy like walking to the street.</v>

101
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.010
It's the same thing. Right.

102
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.850
<v 0>I don't understand how we could take three more months off. Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.470
<v 2>Um, well it depends what they mean by, I mean, you know, when you talk,</v>

104
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:25.900
when you hear the governor talk, it's, you know,

105
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.590
he's moving it along and he's getting these phases and we're getting and pushing

106
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.170
it through and it says it doesn't, I don't,

107
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.820
I don't think it's going to be as I'm stammering because the realization I don't

108
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:38.080
w I don't know.

109
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.730
I don't think it's going to be like what it was in April in may.

110
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.910
Why not July? Because I.

111
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.310
<v 0>Because I want to go outside. I think so, too. LA county breaches, uh,</v>

112
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.220
beaches reopen May 13th. Yes.

113
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.740
<v 2>You can't hang out on your lounge. You can't hang out on your towel.</v>

114
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.880
You got to go in, go.

115
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.970
<v 0>Make that larger. Please just go back to where it was. You can do water sports,</v>

116
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.860
More sitting on the sand. Canopies cores are picnicking, right?

117
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.260
<v 2>You can, you can be active. You can.</v>

118
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.440
<v 0>Go swim and lots are closed. So where they expect you to park.</v>

119
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.000
<v 2>They don't want.</v>

120
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.750
<v 0>You to go individual family activities and exercise only.</v>

121
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.570
<v 2>Hmm. Yeah. So you can go down, you can swim.</v>

122
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.780
You could ride the waves and then get out of the ocean and get back in your car.

123
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.630
<v 0>Thinking you can't picnic.</v>

124
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.490
<v 2>No biking, no biking. No. Why.</v>

125
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.323
<v 0>Can't you bike?</v>

126
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.070
<v 2>I have to say no volleyball that you see that round circle with the slash</v>

127
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.270
through it, with the giant canopies. Those should be banned all year.

128
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.890
Have you ever been next to one of those?

129
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.700
<v 0>Oh, these are disgusting. Oh my why? Why are you allowed to set up camp?</v>

130
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.320
Building a house? You're basically saying this is my area of the sand,

131
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.520
like.

132
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.600
<v 2>Blocking everyone's view.</v>

133
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.140
<v 0>Yeah. You can get a towel. That's what you get. You get a towel and that's it.</v>

134
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.153
It's how it's always been.

135
00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.050
<v 2>No, these people come down there. They've got coolers and tables. Hire them.</v>

136
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.160
<v 0>They seem to have fences. Now people are setting up beach fences. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:06.050
They're selling beach fences. You set it up.

138
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:08.750
You stick it in the sand and you mark off your area. Oh.

139
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.583
<v 2>My God.</v>

140
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.530
<v 0>We're creating dorks. Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.660
<v 2>Oh, this is all before social distance.</v>

142
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:19.040
These are just people making camps there and bringing 20 twenty-five people, uh,

143
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.280
here.

144
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.230
<v 0>So reopens. Tomorrow's what they're saying. Yeah, baby. Yeah. Well, that's good.</v>

145
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.700
That's, that's a start. I think we need to move in the other direction.

146
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:30.830
I think we need to quarantine people that are at risk.

147
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:34.550
That's what I think really. And then let people make their own choices.

148
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.690
You know, this, the,

149
00:07:36.691 --> 00:07:40.550
the idea that these hospitals are going to be overwhelmed is not true.

150
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.760
It's not correct. Luckily we're very fortunate. Yeah.

151
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.760
And the idea that we're going to run out of ventilators, that's not true either.

152
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.810
Right? So,

153
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.350
and then also if that doctor that worked with Michael yo was telling you this

154
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:54.680
before we started, the doctor said that if he put him on a ventilator,

155
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:56.450
he would die. Um,

156
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.230
cause his body would stop trying to breathe and it would just sort of give up.

157
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.090
And this is what Michael Yos doctors told him. And he, he survived.

158
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.480
And then we're finding out that a lot of people they put on ventilators don't

159
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:12.860
make it. And I wonder if what he's saying applies to those people.

160
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.860
<v 2>Right? He was, he has a special case of way.</v>

161
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.880
They didn't want him on the ventilator.

162
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.620
<v 0>No, it was doctors, just a wise guy. He's just smart and just figured it out.</v>

163
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.000
Well, I mean.

164
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.910
<v 2>I mean, it, it's a weird thing to think, you know, what,</v>

165
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:28.670
what if we hadn't done all of these measures, would the hospitals,

166
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.840
because the hospitals for a beat were crazy. It depends on where you are.

167
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.170
Like if you were in Queens, it was insane.

168
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.150
<v 0>Yeah. There's places where it's horrible. Yeah. So.</v>

169
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.980
<v 2>Like, if you, if we hadn't done these things,</v>

170
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.750
what would have the result of them?

171
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.790
<v 0>It's a good question. You know? I mean,</v>

172
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.950
would we have achieved herd immunity or would we have achieved it

173
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:50.420
quicker? Yeah. Know,

174
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.180
herd immunity is like 60% of the people who've been infected.

175
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:55.680
And then right then the virus sort of dies off.

176
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.650
<v 2>Right. You know, when you look at the Spanish flu,</v>

177
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.520
when you look at the history of that and you know,

178
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.620
the places that did something fared much better than the places that didn't the

179
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:10.280
end result was, you know, all these people died. It,

180
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.410
it goes through the same amount of time, but just,

181
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:16.260
you have a lot more fatalities, you know? And it's,

182
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.440
this it's always been this kind of calculation. Like, you know,

183
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:20.520
people are doing the math.

184
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.390
I feel like people are doing the math and they're saying, okay,

185
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:25.800
X amount will die,

186
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.440
but we've got to get back to work and get these people to work.

187
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.180
And they're trying to figure out that equation.

188
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.240
It's the suffering of the people that are probably going to survive.

189
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.110
Even if they get it,

190
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.510
is that suffering going to be greater than the suffering for families who lose

191
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:41.850
people. Right. So that's that balancing act.

192
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.230
And you can see where people are coming out on it. Certain places are like, no,

193
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:50.250
it's just time to go. And yeah, there'll be casualties, but we'll deal.

194
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.250
And other people are saying, save lives at all costs.

195
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.940
<v 0>Well, if we say save lives at all costs, we should all stop driving.</v>

196
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.040
<v 2>I don't want to do that too. So I can't go. Yeah, no, I know what you're saying.</v>

197
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.840
Yeah. Right. There's things that are risks.

198
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.700
<v 0>This is one of those things. That's a,</v>

199
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:09.420
it's a uniquely human problem because there's no real answer for it because most

200
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:13.390
human problems [inaudible]. Yeah. You know what I mean?

201
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.140
<v 2>Yeah, yeah, no. Right. You don't, uh, you kind of, we are,</v>

202
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.680
we're all isolated on this one thing. And then you stop thinking, well,

203
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.830
we've live at risk all day long, every, you know.

204
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.280
<v 0>Well, not only do we live at risk all day long,</v>

205
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:33.930
but we make decisions that could put ourselves at risk and we're

206
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:36.150
allowed to make those decisions. But with this,

207
00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:37.710
you're not allowed to make those decisions.

208
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.460
And the ideas will because you put others at risk. Okay.

209
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.140
But who and why? And do, do you know, when do we decide,

210
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.520
like how long can we go on with this? If we don't have any new tools in July,

211
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.770
what is going to be the difference between July and now?

212
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.330
<v 2>Well, that's what Fowchee saying about the fall. He saying that, you know,</v>

213
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.880
there's going to be a resurgence of it in the fall.

214
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.250
You're going to have more because it's the flu season.

215
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.400
People are going to eat and you need to be prepared to,

216
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.080
with testing and stuff too,

217
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.380
to deal with this in the right way or else you're back to what we were dealing

218
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:13.230
with in April and may. And that you've gotta be,

219
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.340
you gotta learn from it and be prepared. And it's the testing, the testing,

220
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:17.880
the testing.

221
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.740
<v 0>Yeah. It just seems, you know, Elan just opened up his factory in California,</v>

222
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.000
the Tesla factory and said, come, come arrest me. Right. Basically saying,

223
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.180
what you're doing is a violation of civil liberties.

224
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.500
You're telling people that they're not allowed to go to work and that this is a,

225
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.580
we come a fascist state. See how that goes.

226
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.570
<v 2>Yeah. I kind of feel like they they're seeing,</v>

227
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.450
like they know that they'll save lives this way, but they don't. I mean, look,

228
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.290
if you're the, if you're the governor, right, what do you do? What do you do?

229
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.140
I mean, you want, you want people to be safe,

230
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:56.950
but you also are looking at the books every day and realizing that your state

231
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.370
is in need of a trillion dollars to survive. Like yeah.

232
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.060
<v 0>It would be if, if, I mean, if that's, it, it might be a lot more than that.</v>

233
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.433
Like, you know,

234
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:10.330
it's just based on what we know is active in the businesses that are open right

235
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:12.880
now. I mean, how many, a friend of mine was saying,

236
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:15.730
how many people are unemployed right now? And they don't even know it. Yeah.

237
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.230
Business is just never going to make it right.

238
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:19.030
And then also there's going to be less people with money.

239
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.380
So there's going to be less spending.

240
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:22.390
So these are comments that need some sort of a research.

241
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.040
<v 2>So if you're the governor,</v>

242
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.720
you're not out there just to control people and take away their civil liberties

243
00:12:28.721 --> 00:12:31.390
because you're screwing yourself on the other end, you know,

244
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:34.420
with people being broken, the economy falling apart. So you're in this,

245
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.390
in this spot. I do not envy it.

246
00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.500
<v 0>Also, when you start telling people what to do, it's very difficult to stop.</v>

247
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.380
Once you have the ability to tell people what to do,

248
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:47.500
it's very difficult to just turn that off and go, go ahead, go back to normal.

249
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:49.270
Do whatever you want to do now. Right. Right.

250
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.490
Which is what we used to do just four months ago. Right?

251
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.040
Do whatever you want to do. But now all of a sudden,

252
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.120
did you see that goofy list that they put out of all the stuff you can and can't

253
00:12:58.121 --> 00:13:02.380
do? No. It's even goofier than the list that we saw about the beaches.

254
00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.240
It's really preposterous.

255
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:08.770
This really long list that California put out of things you're allowed to do

256
00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:13.030
outside. You can meditate. You can do soft martial arts.

257
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.680
You can watch the sunrise or the sunset meets. So asinine.

258
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.910
It's just so it's, you're getting people in this case,

259
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.970
you're getting people that have no business telling people what to do.

260
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.080
And all of a sudden they've been assigned this ability to tell people what

261
00:13:29.081 --> 00:13:32.770
they're allowed to do and not to do. Right. And so they make this gigantic,

262
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:37.510
stupid list. And it's really offensive. It is a weird thing.

263
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.110
It's dumb. Yeah. Crenshaw put something up on his Instagram,

264
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:45.130
see if you can find it where he, he shows what you can and can't do.

265
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.650
And this one particular list and how preposterous it is.

266
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.610
There's a bunch of lists that different states are putting up in different

267
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:52.780
states have different approaches.

268
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.640
One thing that I do like about the fact that we are the United States of America

269
00:13:57.641 --> 00:13:59.530
is a different states do have different approaches.

270
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:01.810
And we get to watch how that experiment plays out.

271
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.680
<v 2>Experiment. Isn't it like? I'm just like, so how's Georgia everywhere.</v>

272
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.840
Every day I sit down like what's going on?

273
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.190
<v 0>Yeah. Permitted, walking, running, exercising, surfing fishing,</v>

274
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.310
no chairs Bar.

275
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.110
Habited sunbathing sitting in chairs, groups,

276
00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:21.340
sports groups of people swimming.

277
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.070
And here's what he says for your daily dose of things that are stupid.

278
00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:27.490
Here you go. How many geniuses sat around and deliberated over those,

279
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.100
these particulars? Okay. They can fish,

280
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.360
but we don't want them getting any sun while they fish and no chairs because we

281
00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:36.880
are saving lives, high fives all around

282
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.800
He's so right. I guess this is New Jersey. O C N J that's New Jersey,

283
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:46.210
right? Eh.

284
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.760
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Ocean county. New Jersey. Yeah.</v>

285
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.490
<v 0>Off. off with that group.</v>
