00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>And, you know, I think for someone like Kathy, who's experienced Kathy Griffin,</v>

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.480
who's experienced that public shaming. She's right.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.640
<v 1>That amazes me. Right?</v>

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:13.480
Like she's been publicly shamed herself in the most horrific way has basically

5
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:18.480
had to live underground. And now she's saying, shame him, name him and docs him.

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.120
I think I don't understand.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.710
<v 0>Thatinforce is it reinforces people's idea that they should be more,</v>

8
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.230
more committed to their side, more committed to their team?

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.750
The only way you're gonna get any support,

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.550
if you have been attacked and isolated, not alone is to get back deep,

11
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.270
deep into the team again, like how do you get back deep into the team? Again,

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.510
you gotta be rabbit mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, and that's part of it.

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.791
It's a,

14
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:45.020
it's a natural reaction that people have to sort of signal to everyone else on

15
00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:47.580
the team. They're all in they're fully committed.

16
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:50.140
They don't even care about their career. I'm an activist.

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.940
&lt;laugh&gt; like that kind of happens. And it's, it's people that want love.

18
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.900
It's what a lot of it is. Yeah. It's they,

19
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:57.980
they do recognize that there's something wrong. They,

20
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:00.700
they are reacting to a real thing. I'm not denying that,

21
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.210
but I am am saying that the, the reason, the overwhelming reason,

22
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.130
the motivation for this kind of O overzealous reaction is often a

23
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:14.090
signaling thing. So they wanna let everybody know totally I'm on the team, man.

24
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.250
I'm all in. Let's go punch some Nazis. And the people that have,

25
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:21.010
I've talked to people that have said that and in real life,

26
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.440
and I'm like the man, you, you can't punch anybody. You shouldn't punch anybody.

27
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.920
They're gonna punch you back. What do you don't punch? What, first of all,

28
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:29.120
who's.

29
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.440
<v 1>A, or serve your, save your punch for a real one. A real one. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.800
A real one, you know, in Poland. Yes. Or in Hungary right now. Right? Right.

31
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.841
You know, not a,

32
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:43.070
not a 16 year old kid who maybe has no idea what that had to say. Ifies.

33
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.110
<v 0>Well, um, I mean.</v>

34
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.510
<v 1>And all, I mean, there's a broader point, which is like the very same people,</v>

35
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.950
like one of the sort of wisdoms of,

36
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.710
of criminal justice reform, right.

37
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.070
Is which I believe in is that we shouldn't try kids as adults and we should

38
00:01:59.071 --> 00:01:59.904
forgive.

39
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.860
We should have greater generosity and mercy forgiveness for the crimes of a

40
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:07.060
child. Even if they're they've committed them. Yes.

41
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.860
Those same people are the ones saying docs him and shame him generally,

42
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:11.694
politically.

43
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.980
<v 0>Well, you're seeing that now. And this is again,</v>

44
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.620
there's never been a doxing before. There was no doxing. Right.

45
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.060
How long has doxing been around a decade? Well.

46
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.850
<v 1>Like since game gamer gate is when it got huge. Right? Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.730
<v 0>Maybe let's go crazy and say, the first doxing was 20 years ago. That's a blip.</v>

48
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.130
Right? That's so recent. So, you know,

49
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.130
this is not a thing that people have really had to balance out in their

50
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:39.930
mind when to do it. And when not to do it, they just do it.

51
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.610
<v 1>I think people have no idea of what that looks like. Right.</v>

52
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.680
And unless you've experienced it or watch someone, you know, experience it,

53
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.480
it's, it's like, it's like an abstraction. Cuz these people are abstraction.

54
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:52.600
They're two dimensional little puppets.

55
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.080
<v 0>That's exactly what it is. That's exactly what it is.</v>

56
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.080
And this extreme lack of empathy, the,

57
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.120
the lack of empathy towards anyone who doesn't share your position.

58
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.800
This is very strange. It's um, it's very,

59
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.760
it's pisspore thinking and it's everywhere.

60
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.320
<v 1>And, and everyone wants to feel like not being a part of,</v>

61
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:17.560
one of the tribes is an extremely lonely position and you get called all the bad

62
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:18.281
names. Right.

63
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.390
Because people want you to be a part of their tribe and people don't wanna be

64
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.670
called bad names and they wanna feel like they're in an in group hun. 100% like,

65
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.590
I emotionally, I totally get that. Yeah. A hundred percent.

66
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:30.510
It kinda sucks being homeless. Well, it's.

67
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.750
<v 0>Just politically homeless. Yes. It's just,</v>

68
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.790
when you got a president,

69
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.980
that's so polarizing and you have an opposition to him.

70
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.980
That's so there, there there's so much momentum in opposing him.

71
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.820
And I think this is a giant wedge in between these two sides.

72
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.820
And then you have that hat and that hat, if that kid wasn't wearing that hat,

73
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.500
I guarantee you'd be like 20% less hate. It would be. Oh yeah. It would be.

74
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.050
People would still get mad at him because he was still like,

75
00:04:00.051 --> 00:04:03.530
I've seen people say when a native elder walks up to you and he's banging his

76
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.410
drums, get the out of the way. I saw that like, come on,

77
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.610
you can't expect that you, what? You can't just beat your drum. First of all,

78
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:15.450
you got right in the kid's face like inches from the kid's face. Pretty amazing.

79
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.730
The restraint. This kid had to just smile.

80
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.040
And the idea that you're gonna judge this kid,

81
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.240
millions and millions and millions of people are going over this right now,

82
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.760
that kid woke up that morning. He had no idea.

83
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.760
He was a kid in a cult. Okay. He's in a Catholic cult school.

84
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.360
And he's going to some weird thing.

85
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.160
Some March for life where people are trying to kill babies,

86
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.000
we gotta stop him from killing babies. Right.

87
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:42.590
And he goes there and there's this black Israelit calling him the faggots.

88
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:45.430
And there's, there's all these people calling him names. And,

89
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.430
and then all of a sudden,

90
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:48.870
this guy's beating a drum in front of his face and we're supposed to,

91
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.870
we're supposed to doc, this kid now. Cuz he smirked. Yeah. That's,

92
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:53.704
that's a crazy,

93
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.990
an impossible lack of empathy. It's impossible to defend.

94
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.020
Like unless you hate boys, unless you hate all boys, cuz boys are dumb.

95
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.260
Like 16 year old boys are almost universally dumb. They all,

96
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.140
they all grow up to be men. Some of those men will be your best friend.

97
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.540
Some of those men will be amazing.

98
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.860
Some of those men you'd be so happy to see when you see 'em you give 'em a big

99
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:19.540
hug. Okay. That's me. Right. That's me.

100
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.290
I was a stupid six year old. Right. And I'm a man now.

101
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:25.570
And I try to be as nice as I can to everybody.

102
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.690
I go way outta my way to be a kind person that could be that kid too.

103
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.610
Like what you're doing is not good for anybody. It's not,

104
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.970
it's not good for society to take this trend and run with it. And, and this is,

105
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:40.330
well, this is what people do now. You know, you dock 16 year olds and it turbo.

106
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.570
<v 1>Charges the right.</v>

107
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.960
Like that's what I think people are not quite understanding that dynamic.

108
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.040
That if you are someone who you know,

109
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.000
is frustrated with Trump and is maybe moving to the middle and you know,

110
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.240
imagine that person it's easy to imagine. Yeah. Then you see this.

111
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.960
And you're like, I don't want those people being in charge of me.

112
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.640
I don't want those people running the government. Yes. I mean,

113
00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:05.120
that's the like visceral reaction. I just,

114
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.280
I don't think they're understanding the like implications of what they're.

115
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.920
<v 0>Doing. I don't think they understand. Maybe they do. Maybe they do no,</v>

116
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:15.000
there's no mastermind behind this. There's and there's no, I Don' a mastermind,

117
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.110
but like don't think they do understand or implications the, the,

118
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.470
when you have a spectrum, right? The far right. And the far left,

119
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.590
they have a very similar reaction as they drive a person to the other side,

120
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.910
the person that sees the far right. And sees repulsive racism and,

121
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.310
and, and bigotry that, you know, build that wall. these Mexicans,

122
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.260
those little kids. They, they should have known better. They're all illegals.

123
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.100
That kind of person that pushes people towards progressiveivism it pushes people

124
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:48.060
towards much more liberal, even socialist ideology, like that grossness.

125
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.380
And the same thing can be said for someone like I'm gonna send you something,

126
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:56.140
Jamie, this is a real, uh, poster that Antifa is sending,

127
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.650
um, putting on, um, on wall, on walls and,

128
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.370
and fence posts and in, uh, the Pacific Northwest. And uh,

129
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.490
it's actually kind of hilarious cuz it's so stupid. No, I see it. I'm gonna,

130
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:12.810
I'm gonna send it to Jamie and Jamie's gonna put it up on the screen here.

131
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.810
But uh, it, it says, uh, oops, wrong, wrong, Jamie.

132
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.200
Sorry Jamie. Kilsstein &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; here you go buddy.

133
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.800
I just sent it. It says, when you date a white, it's not all right.

134
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.320
And it's like, oh my God. It's telling people to not date white people.

135
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.600
<v 1>Propagation of whites is propagation of hatred, oppression, homophobia, sexism,</v>

136
00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:41.550
transphobia racism. And ablebolism now if I was a, so are we supposed to yes.

137
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.390
Sterilize white.

138
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.590
<v 0>People. There it is. We could see it up on the big screen. So it's even crazy.</v>

139
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:49.510
That's it's but see racist. This is the thing. Racism is,

140
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:52.790
racism is terrible. Right? So how do you stop racism? Well,

141
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.630
racism is can only be perpetrated by white people. Oh,

142
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.950
well the problem is white people. We gotta stop white people. Well now you race,

143
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.540
like you're literally being racist to stop racist.

144
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.660
<v 1>Is this really everywhere? I've.</v>

145
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.460
<v 0>Never seen this. Oh, well the people are finding it and posting it online.</v>

146
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:08.940
Oh my God. Oh my God. And someone sent it to me. Um,

147
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.020
I don't know if it's everywhere. It's probably just one. Right? Do you see?

148
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.820
But the per, but the person exists, right. That person exists.

149
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:16.020
And they think they're a progressive, do.

150
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.380
<v 1>You see the cold civil war that we're in, in this country becoming a hot one?</v>

151
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.810
<v 0>No, I hope not. I that's why I worry about, but where does this go?</v>

152
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.290
Where does this go? No one knows if we did, we,

153
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.530
you could make a lot of money in the stock market. &lt;laugh&gt; this is,

154
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.410
this is why I'm concerned.

155
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.970
Especially because I understand violence a lot better than most people do.

156
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.890
You can't just say go punch people. When RA Oslan says,

157
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.120
have you seen more punchable face?

158
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:46.240
That is so dangerous because you're almost saying go punch

159
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:50.360
this kid. I saw someone else. I accidentally favored something.

160
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.240
I didn't mean it. Unfavored it.

161
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.080
I did someone pointed to me and I'm just lucky that I looked at it because I

162
00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.000
normally don't even read comments. But somebody pointed out that I favored a,

163
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.560
a really preposterous tweet. Um, that said honest que um,

164
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.520
it said the reply from the school was pathetic. And impoent name these kids. Oh,

165
00:09:09.521 --> 00:09:13.960
that's Kathy Griffin. Uh, here's the one that said this guy said,

166
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.750
God, I can't find it. He was basically saying no need to. Here. It is. Uh,

167
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.070
a face like that. Never changes. This image will define his life.

168
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.910
Oh my no one need, no one need ever forgive him.

169
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.070
This is a person with a blue check mark by their name.

170
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.430
No one need ever forgive him a face like that defines his life.

171
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:38.500
That is virtual signaling in the most toxic form. It's so, so dangerous.

172
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.820
It's also like to think like that. The idea.

173
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.420
<v 1>That just I'm sorry. I was trying to no, it's okay.</v>

174
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.260
The idea that people cannot change. It's crazy and are irredeemable right. Is.

175
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.140
<v 0>Crazy. Cancel culture. I was talking about this with, with Kanye. Honestly,</v>

176
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.410
we were talking about cancel culture. When was he on the show?

177
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.490
We werere talking about in person. Oh, okay. On the phone. Okay. Show.

178
00:10:00.491 --> 00:10:01.810
He's gotta be on the show. Okay, cool.

179
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.810
Allegedly he's he's a little nervous about.

180
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.730
<v 1>I'd like to see him with the samurai sword posing in front of, I.</v>

181
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.690
<v 0>Think he would go with Musk gun. Yeah, you'reprobably right. I looked.</v>

182
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.690
<v 2>Up that poster. It's been,</v>

183
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.530
it was first posted over two years ago and it's

184
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.320
supposedly is uh, like role.

185
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.040
<v 0>Oh yeah. Oh good. That makes sense. Yeahs. Good.</v>

186
00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:21.720
That's but this is the world where it's hard to find.

187
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.280
What's a troll and what's not what I was gonna say that if I was cynical,

188
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.280
I would say that if I was a person who's like far, right, exactly.

189
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.680
You put that up of course, just to with these people and it sweet people.

190
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.440
I mean, it's basically like some CIA SIOPS type. You know? I mean,

191
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.383
this is, this is,

192
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.590
but we're so through the looking glass here that like that post that I just read

193
00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:41.791
you,

194
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.670
that's a real post about this guy is unredeable no one may ever forgive him.

195
00:10:46.671 --> 00:10:48.470
That's just as bad. In my opinion,

196
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.590
is that poster saying don't date white people. It's all crazy.

197
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.830
You're depressing me. We no don't no, no, no.

198
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.390
<v 1>I'm just like, it's you have to like fight.</v>

199
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.420
I have to fight this feeling of despair. You have to like,

200
00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.780
I find myself fighting it because the basic,

201
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:08.460
like some like basic virtues, right? Yes. That used to be normal. Right?

202
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:12.140
Like civility, right. Civility has now become for some people,

203
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.620
a code word for like complicity with Naziism. Right?

204
00:11:16.621 --> 00:11:20.890
Like if you're civil and you believe in civility and you believe in, you know,

205
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.370
treating people decently and with giving them the benefit of the doubt,

206
00:11:25.371 --> 00:11:25.920
like that,

207
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.410
that word itself has become a code or a signal in a negative way.

208
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.930
Hmm. Empathy. Like hum. Humil, doubt. Even saying it. I don't know. You know,

209
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.960
I, I just, these basic virtue seemed to have been like swept away.

210
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.280
Yeah. And I don't know when they, when they got lost.

211
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:48.560
<v 0>Well, a key ingredient for sure. The thing that hardened, the epoxy was Trump.</v>

212
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.400
I think these, these trends, these trends are going in that direction anyway.

213
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.160
But he capitalized on that. You know, he's a very smart manipulator. I mean,

214
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.200
he knew how to capitalize on that. I mean, this chant of build that wall,

215
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.280
it's not an accident that that's something that he concentrates on and it's not

216
00:12:05.281 --> 00:12:06.640
just that it's, uh,

217
00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:10.240
they're in a political battle right now because if they get him to back down off

218
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:14.110
the wall, then you know, he looks like a, a loser when 2020 comes around,

219
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.150
he looks less powerful to all his people. Um, there's that for sure.

220
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.950
But there's also this he's so egregious,

221
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.430
like every he's so he's so that guy, well he's gotten.

222
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.430
<v 1>Rid of all the guardrails. Yeah. Like he's broken the dam. My question,</v>

223
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.780
like thinking about how we're gonna get beyond this is how do we build it back

224
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:38.060
because he's broken something or he's signifying the fact that it was broken one

225
00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:38.620
or the other.

226
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.820
I think that he was both a symptom of something that was broken that we didn't

227
00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:44.500
recognize. And now he's further catalyze that brokenness.

228
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.300
<v 0>Well, I think both sides have to recognize that the other side has some points.</v>

229
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.313
That's one thing.

230
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.420
And then I think we also have to treat ourselves like we're all a family and

231
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.890
we're all on a big team, cuz that's what we really are.

232
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.570
If we really are the United States of American. I mean, what, what is a,

233
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.610
what is a country? I mean, if, if anything, we're supposed to be a team,

234
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.530
the idea that we're separated and we're two teams in this one team,

235
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.530
the real differences in terms of like who gets elected,

236
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.610
like how it's going to affect your life,

237
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.680
involve BI involve some social policies, involve some things,

238
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.880
but the way we interact with each other on a day to day,

239
00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:22.440
doesn't involve that at all. That has to be fixed first,

240
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.080
the way we think about each other on a day to day basis,

241
00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.240
it used to be a time where you could have a conservative friend and you could be

242
00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:32.200
a liberal and you could be a longhaed hippie guy and you,

243
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.960
and as long as you are a, a good,

244
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.790
hard person who didn't let their lawn go crazy. Your next door neighbor,

245
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.070
who was like a gold water, Republican would talk to you totally.

246
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.670
And you would go, how's it going, Mike, what's going on with the, uh, you know,

247
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.030
guys at the force are trying to put together this case and this and that.

248
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:47.923
And you know,

249
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.710
a professor could live right next to a cop and they would be friends and one

250
00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:54.270
would be conservative and one would be liberal and they would make fun of each

251
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:55.980
other a little bit and rib each other a little bit.

252
00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.180
And that would be the end of it. That would be, it, it wouldn't be this,

253
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.980
this civil war that we're experiencing right now, right now, just verbal.

254
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.140
And hopefully it stays that way, but it's, it's, it's confusing.

255
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:10.100
It's confusing cuz there's a lack of a,

256
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.100
a frustrating lack of empathy that when I look at human beings and when I,

257
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.970
people that aren't seeing what everyone else is seeing,

258
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.610
or they're not seeing things objectively and they're irrational and overly

259
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.690
emotional, I always assume there's something else they're running from.

260
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:30.130
I always assume when I see someone lashing out and insulting everyone

261
00:14:30.131 --> 00:14:33.290
around them, I always assume it's not the, the people around them.

262
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.810
It's something internal. There's some something,

263
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.680
maybe some existential angst they're fighting against some realization of the

264
00:14:40.681 --> 00:14:42.560
futility of life, whatever the it is.
