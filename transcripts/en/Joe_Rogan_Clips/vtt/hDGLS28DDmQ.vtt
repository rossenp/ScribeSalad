00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.360
<v 2>This really gets old people. Um, for, um, I,</v>

3
00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:10.040
what I would say are obvious reasons whether it's immune system,

4
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:13.240
whether it's lack of vitamin D, where it's being shut up, whether it's a, um,

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.120
lowered cholesterol. I mean, we haven't, you know,

6
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.080
you don't even talk about what happens with all of the statin drugs that people

7
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:21.750
are tanked to lower their cholesterol. Well,

8
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.870
high cholesterol is act actually protective for something like this. Um,

9
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.870
so you could predict that a lot of older people were going to die if

10
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:32.390
they weren't well protected. Can we talk.

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.150
<v 0>About that for a second? So statin drugs, the,</v>

12
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.510
the idea is you're lowering cholesterol. Cause people have high cholesterol,

13
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.980
the high high cholesterol puts them at a higher risk of heart attack and.

14
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.180
<v 1>Stroke. Not really, not really, but I mean, we can talk about that too.</v>

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.620
That's the irony there. That's where it gets.

16
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.300
<v 0>Confusing, right? Because you,</v>

17
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.620
some people will argue that it's the balance of LDL and HDL and that

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.060
cholesterol is actually essential for production of, uh,

19
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.220
sex hormones and a lot of other things that the human body requires. A.

20
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.730
<v 1>Lot of things. It's probably the most important hor uh, uh,</v>

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.530
cholesterol is probably the most important molecule in the human body.

22
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.450
If you really were to parse it, uh, vitamin D sex hormones, uh,

23
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.690
it's a working molecule on a lot of, uh, cell membranes. And, uh,

24
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.650
to think that we would, I mean, the body it's so important,

25
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.370
the body makes like 1300 milligrams a day,

26
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.560
regardless of what your cholesterol intake is from food.

27
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.320
So in my mind, the notion that we would, um,

28
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.600
take this amazing molecule that is basically life giving in,

29
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:36.040
in many regards and vilify it and then take drugs to lower it.

30
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.600
Uh, which if you look at the research and I,

31
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.280
I wasn't planning on going down this path,

32
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.070
but if you look at the research on cholesterol and heart disease over the past

33
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.430
20 years, it's shifted everything away from cholesterol,

34
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:49.910
being the proximate cause of heart disease,

35
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:53.150
cholesterol and saturated fat are not the proximate cause of heart disease.

36
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.590
It's oxidation and inflammation. Cholesterol is,

37
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:59.550
is involved in the repair of damage to the tissue. And as a result,

38
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:02.390
people get because of the oxidation and inflammation,

39
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:05.100
there's Cho role that's in the plaques and things like that. But,

40
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.020
but I think many,

41
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.020
many doctors I'm gonna say the preponderance of doctors now agree that

42
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:14.300
cholesterol isn't the bad guy, uh, that people made it out to be. And,

43
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.380
and if you look at other other studies cohorts of people, who've had, um,

44
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.540
cholesterol of, you know,

45
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.890
like one 30 and lower or 200 and of

46
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.810
the all cause mortality, you die,

47
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.450
everything else at a much greater rate with low cholesterol than you do with

48
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:34.890
high cholesterol. The only difference is the, the cardiac outcomes.

49
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.810
Um, and it's not even deaths.

50
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:40.210
It's just cardiac events is a little bit higher in the, in the higher group.

51
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.600
<v 0>And what, what is it about co cholesterol that why,</v>

52
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.560
why did cholesterol become the bad guy? Why did it become the, the boogieman?

53
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.320
<v 1>Um, you know, I.</v>

54
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.160
<v 0>Does it have to do with the hate to interrupt you there? Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.800
Does it have to do with when they,

56
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.040
when the sugar industry paid off those scientists to, uh, put,

57
00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:03.400
push the blame on saturated.

58
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.920
<v 1>Fat? Yeah. I mean, um, a lot of this goes back to,</v>

59
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.600
I'm not a conspiracy theorist, you know, I'm, I'm not, uh,

60
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.120
I think most people at the top are too greedy and stupid to organize into a

61
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:18.240
cabal. Right. So I'm, I'm thinking, how do this happen in terms of the,

62
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.150
so mistakes were made early on whether it's Ansel keys and I know you've had a

63
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:26.670
lot of people in the show talking about Ansel keys in the, in the seven, uh,

64
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:31.110
country study. Um, can you explain that real quick for people? Oh,

65
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.070
just this, this scientist, uh, in the, um, sixties,

66
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.380
I guess, uh, around then, uh, Ansel keys done a study looking at, um,

67
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.740
saturated fat intake, uh, of, um, and heart, uh,

68
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:48.220
correlated with heart disease in different countries and, and found, um,

69
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.581
at the end of the day,

70
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:51.860
he found that there was a correlation between high saturated,

71
00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:54.700
fat intake and heart disease. Um,

72
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:58.260
but then later on you find out that he looked at 32 study, uh, 32 countries,

73
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.130
but picked the seven that fit his, his paradigm mostly. So that was, you know,

74
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.410
I, I dunno if you've had Gary Tobbs or, or Nina on the show, but, you know,

75
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:09.250
they've all, everyone has sort of beaten this one to death. So the,

76
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:14.170
the idea was that that was the sort of the start of it. And then, um,

77
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.970
um, McGovern and his committee when he was with the, uh, you know, uh, overs,

78
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.800
seeing the us department of agriculture and,

79
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.320
and trying to create the first food pyramids was convinced by predicate that,

80
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.600
uh, because McGovern's wife had had a good experience at the predicate longevity

81
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:35.520
center, which was a zero fat sort of, um, protocol. Um,

82
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.320
so that politicized, that enough, that they decided to vilify,

83
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.190
um, cholesterol over the years has been, um,

84
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.830
more vilified because of, uh, studies done again, correlating,

85
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.430
uh, higher cholesterol with, with, uh, higher incidence of, of heart issues.

86
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.350
And the drug industry certainly got on that.

87
00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:01.580
And that's why statins came to the forefront. Uh, the.

88
00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.340
<v 0>Statins themselves though, have a host of pretty bad side.</v>

89
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.380
<v 1>Effects. I'm, I'm telling you, I mean,</v>

90
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.460
I think &lt;laugh&gt; until some of these other things have come down recently,

91
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.860
I, I would say that this,

92
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.860
it statins are probably the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on the American

93
00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:19.420
public in terms of medicine, but that's just me, I'm not a doctor.

94
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.210
I just do a lot of re urgent reading. So the idea that we would, yeah,

95
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:28.890
so to your point, statins tend to, um, you know, there,

96
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.250
there are, uh, brain fog issues, liver issues, uh, um,

97
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:35.330
muscle weakness issues. Um,

98
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.410
one of the things that statins do is they, uh,

99
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.410
decrease the amount of Coq 10 that your body produces, uh,

100
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:43.840
because it's similar pathway. And so you have to,

101
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.920
should generally take supplemental Coq 10 with statins. Um,

102
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.760
a friend of mine said that when he did the original,

103
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:54.720
when he was researching statins, one of the original patents on statins,

104
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.760
inclu acknowledged this deficiency of cocuten.

105
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.960
And so it included cocuten and the drug, but cocuten was so expensive to make.

106
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.040
He just cleaved off that part of the patent O anyway, um,

107
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.640
where I don't know where, where that was headed, but, um, you know, where the,

108
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.480
if we're talking about COVID, it appears that high cholesterol,

109
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.750
higher cholesterol is protective for infections like COVID, but how is that.

110
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.830
<v 0>The case? Because one of the problems with COVID is people with high obesity,</v>

111
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.550
obese people tend to have a really hard time with COVID. In fact,

112
00:06:26.551 --> 00:06:30.430
78% of the hospitalizations, they found out that those people were obese.

113
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.070
I would imagine a lot of those obese people also have high cholesterol.

114
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.060
<v 1>Okay. But look at all the other factors. So, you know, if we're, again, obesity.</v>

115
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.700
<v 0>Is a big factor in terms just overall diminishing of your immune system. Yeah.</v>

116
00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.940
<v 1>Exactly. Your, your, but I would, I would say that from, you know,</v>

117
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:49.940
what I've read, um, blood glucose, so, you know,

118
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.460
diabetics are much more susceptible to COVID because this virus tends to like

119
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.130
higher blood sugar. Um, if you, you have a preexisting, uh,

120
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.090
systemic in inflammation, not a good sign, um, vitamin D probably,

121
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.770
you know, across the board,

122
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.890
the greatest predictor of your survivability of coping. Yeah.

123
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.930
So if people have been locked inside all you know,

124
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.770
all year and haven't had any sun exposure, um,

125
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.680
their vitamin D status has been compromised, um, uh,

126
00:07:22.681 --> 00:07:23.514
tremendously.
