00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>What a nightmare, things like that are just roaming around and us.</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.360
We think we're being spiritual. Hey man, I'm just gonna get on my board.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm just gonna get on my board. Be monster food.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.240
<v 1>No, I put my foot in then back.</v>

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.840
<v 0>Out. I'm such a. When it comes to the ocean, I was in Hawaii.</v>

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.870
We win the snorkeling dive of the water and you're staring down and it cool.

7
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.030
We were by this reef. And,

8
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.710
but all I was thinking is I just need see one of these and I'm never getting in

9
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:28.710
this water again. &lt;laugh&gt; one of those.

10
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.310
<v 1>I kinda wanna do that now. I couldn't,</v>

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.150
I was too heavy before I was passed a weight limit that you could go do some

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.230
diving how'd you? And I would always tell myself I didn't wanna do it,

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.070
but now I wanna do.

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.140
<v 0>It. Yeah. Can tell yourself a lot of things, right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.</v>

15
00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:48.300
Mitch, a joke about a writing that, uh,

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.340
when he gets a funny idea, he writes things down or he,

17
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.260
if he's lazy, he.

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.713
<v 1>Not that funny.</v>

19
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.980
<v 0>How did you lose the weight?</v>

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.170
<v 1>Um, I really just changed my, I got a trainer that was a big part of it.</v>

21
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.330
I just changed my diet and, um, started exercising bunch,

22
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.410
but from a guy who didn't exercise at all and ate multiple filly cheese steaks a

23
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.410
day to a guy who eats a bunch of boneless, skinless chicken breasts,

24
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:23.720
and protein shakes. And now I work out like six time times a day. Wow. Yeah.

25
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.240
Just seemed like I was gonna die if I didn't.

26
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.720
<v 0>So, so what do you do for working out these days?</v>

27
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.360
<v 1>Uh, you know, a lot of weight lifting, lot of, um, oh, see the day, you know,</v>

28
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:39.200
just lot back, a little, little biceps and you know, one arm rolls and,

29
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.200
and whatnot. Just general weightlift.

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.110
<v 0>So, but you're you lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, um,</v>

31
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.470
do you find it has a, uh, an effect on your mood on how you feel? Oh,

32
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:50.550
absolutely. How do you,

33
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.990
how much better do you feel and how much do you attribute it to, uh,

34
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.750
the working out the losing weight or both of them together?

35
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.830
<v 1>It's a combination. Definitely the, um, the diet and, and just feeling better</v>

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.300
wise is, is, is very helpful. Um, but you know,

37
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:10.660
just doing two shows a night now, you know, that used to be a thing for me.

38
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.820
I used to be like really tired afterwards. Mm. And now it's, you know,

39
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.460
no problem. I, I do a lot of, um, voiceovers and,

40
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.260
and other little things. And so, you know,

41
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.780
I'm always bouncing around from going,

42
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.410
like he shows the weekend and coming home and then having to go do voiceover on

43
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:29.930
Monday morning and taking care of my son and helping him with his homework and

44
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.730
just being able to do that and not being like, oh, I'm just,

45
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.410
I gotta go pass out. I'm tired. You know, that's really the,

46
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:40.650
the biggest deal being able to take on more. So then I'm able to, um,

47
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.033
make more money.

48
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.520
<v 0>So I was, uh, carrying my, her around on my shoulders the other day.</v>

49
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.400
She likes to get carried around she's 63 pounds. And, uh,

50
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.160
while she's on my shoulders, uh, after, you know, 40 minutes or so of that,

51
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.320
like, it's rough. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

52
00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.560
it starts really hurting your neck, start getting really tired.

53
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.240
And I had to put her down and, uh, I was thinking like, how crazy is that?

54
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.920
That there's a lot of people that just carry that much extra around with them

55
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.853
all the time.

56
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.720
They're always carrying around an extra 60 pounds and you don't think it's that

57
00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:15.760
much of a deal until you don't have it. And then you walk with it. Yeah.

58
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.230
You know, and you realize like, and it's just, even if it's not that, like,

59
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.630
when a kid's sitting on your neck,

60
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:25.630
it's not like the ideal place to carry all the weight. They actually make a, um,

61
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.790
a thing. There's a company called the outdoorsman.

62
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:31.830
They make a thing called the Atlas pack. It's like a backpack frame.

63
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.430
But the back of it is like one of those weightlifting posts.

64
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.900
So you could slide an Olympic, uh, barbell or a Olympic plate on,

65
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.220
and two plates. You, you put as much as 90 pounds on it, clamp this thing down,

66
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.060
and then it's sitting more on your hips. It's way easier to carry.

67
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.860
But even that still it's Fu it's sucks, man.

68
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:54.300
Walking around with just 45 extra pounds on your back. Sucks. Yeah.

69
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.540
<v 1>Just getting, you know, just being like my mid thirties and being like, oh my,</v>

70
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.090
my knees are, I didn't, I never played football. I never did anything like that.

71
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:05.250
My knee shouldn't be hurting and right. And just knowing,

72
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.730
I think I had to just change a, just change my mindset about like before,

73
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:13.970
when I was just doing standup to do it and didn't think I was gonna be

74
00:04:13.971 --> 00:04:16.970
successful. It didn't matter. I was just like, I'm just living for today.

75
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.490
Gimme free pizza, gimme whatever. And then it was like,

76
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.680
once this thing started changing a little bit, I was like, oh,

77
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.800
I'm things are happening. I still don't even really know what I'm doing. Let me,

78
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.520
if I give myself a better chance and take care of my health,

79
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:35.160
take care of my body. Um, let me see how far I can push these gifts,

80
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:36.240
push these skills, you know,

81
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.400
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it became more about not wanting to waste opportunity.

82
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.710
<v 0>That's very cool. That's cool. I like that.</v>

83
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.750
So your love of standup made you sort of

84
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:53.190
concentrate even more on your own body. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Yeah.

85
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.990
Like not your love of yourself, not your love of your body. Like of course,

86
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.590
like this is, you have to go through number what you do in your life.

87
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.780
You're going through it with your body, but it was your love of standup.

88
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.620
Then you like, God, I gotta do something about this body. Yeah. That crazy.

89
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.610
Yeah.

90
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.380
<v 1>Love of standup. Love my son and love of fashion. And I didn't, you know,</v>

91
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.020
when you get to certain size, all your shirts got dogs on 'em and you know,

92
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.220
&lt;laugh&gt;, I don't want that anymore.

93
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.250
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It gets like you get into that triple XL,</v>

94
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.090
like I'm happy whenever anybody does anything that, uh,

95
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.690
that benefits their health, whether it's, uh, for whatever your motivation,

96
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.250
the end result is always good. It's always good. No matter what,

97
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.810
motivation's positive or negative, if you wanna prove somebody wrong, you know,

98
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.840
or you just wanna do just do better, just have a better path, you know?

99
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.720
So it's, so it's so attainable for so many people.

100
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.000
So many people could at least be way healthier,

101
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.360
at least have way more energy at least like understand, like,

102
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.880
not that feeling of just being like, Ugh, all day. And every time I cheat,

103
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.760
like, uh, with burgers and fries and, and, and like milkshakes and like that.

104
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.840
If I really go off the deep end with my diet, I feel like dog,

105
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.040
I feel terrible. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it hits me. I'm like, oh,

106
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.080
and then you gotta realize, Hey man,

107
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:16.870
this is how a lot of people feel all the time.

108
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.710
<v 1>Yeah. That's the big deal for me. Same thing.</v>

109
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:23.550
Just going off eight half a burger and,

110
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.990
and was feeling so sick. And then I was like, man, I used to live like this,

111
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.790
every meal. Yeah. And, and my body, you know, is just a, you know,

112
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.790
Testament of what your body's capable to adapt to, you know,

113
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.950
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, but a,

114
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.860
once you start going the other way and start really getting healthy,

115
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.420
you really in your body becomes more sensitive to it. And you really are like,

116
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.300
oh, I prefer not to cheat, you know? Yeah.

117
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.580
You still gotta have that balance. You gotta have fun.

118
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.540
<v 0>There's nothing wrong with an ice cream or something like that every now and</v>

119
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:55.700
again, or some sort of a dessert, but really it's, they,

120
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.970
they just think that your body has to be accustomed to getting what it needs.

121
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.290
That's what it is. And for too many people,

122
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:03.730
they're running on a nutrition deficit.

123
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.810
So when your body's just not getting what it needs for long periods of time,

124
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.570
then you develop chronic inflammation and all sorts of other problems.

125
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.570
And this is what people are really suffering from. You know, there's,

126
00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:17.570
they're suffering from a nutritional deficiency.

127
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:21.120
That's probably lasted for years. They probably never, they, they, you know,

128
00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:24.440
some people, they just, they go 10, 15,

129
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.080
20 years without even thinking about their diet. They're just eating dog.

130
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.800
You're just eating stuff that doesn't have enough nutrients and your body just

131
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:34.080
starts to get weaker. There's no way around it. And if you just, ah,

132
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.150
just turn that, start eating salads, eating, uh, healthy and,

133
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.350
and, and you know, some healthy meat and just take some vitamins,

134
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.870
just take some vitamin supplements, real simple, you know,

135
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.230
it's not just get yourself some multivitamins,

136
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.270
get yourself like a little thing of athletic greens or something like get,

137
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.510
get your health online. And once you do, you'd be like, oh,

138
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.700
I feel so much better. I feel, so this is all I had to do.

139
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.580
And I'm this person now. Yeah.

140
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.060
<v 1>Mentally so much better, much clearer, much happier.</v>

141
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.860
<v 0>Much happier. It's so hard though. Cuz we, we love mouth pleasure like mm.</v>

142
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:12.901
You know,

143
00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:15.980
but to the point where people are poisoning their bodies to get mouth pleasure.

144
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:16.860
Yeah. And.

145
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.490
<v 1>It's just, you know, constantly pushed in your face. Every, he always knows.</v>

146
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.890
We talk about all the time, you know, cheeseburgers, 50 cents salad like five,

147
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.410
$6, you know, is you have to make that effort.

148
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.130
You have to be able wanna cook at home and it's not, it's not made easy. And,

149
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.130
and that's what I think. Um, we become as a society,

150
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.840
less cool and less, um, appreciative of effort,

151
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.093
you know?

152
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.280
<v 0>Yeah. But there's also,</v>

153
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.320
there's something really annoying about people that want you to eat healthy.

154
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.680
Yeah.

155
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.400
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; that too. Oh, get off your.</v>

156
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.000
<v 0>High horse. Get the outta here.</v>

157
00:08:54.001 --> 00:08:57.440
If you're sitting there and you're having a burger and fries and enjoying the

158
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:02.000
out of it and some next to you's got kale with shaved pecans and &lt;laugh&gt;

159
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.360
talking about your diet while they're pouring fresh olive oil on top of their

160
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.080
salad, &lt;laugh&gt; come on, man. Leave me alone. You know,

161
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.550
leave me alone. Why enjoy something gross? Yeah.

162
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:18.470
Taste D but I think as long as the,

163
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.430
the majority of your diet is really healthy, then you can get in those off days.

164
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.990
It doesn't matter. Your body will bounce back. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just,

165
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.510
don't don't put it in a deficit.
