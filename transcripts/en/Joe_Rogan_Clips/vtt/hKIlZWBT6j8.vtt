1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 3>That would've been an interesting fight to see him versus could be,</v>

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.240
but the way Vera controlled him on the ground.

4
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.080
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think it would've been interesting.</v>

5
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.800
<v 1>Yeah. Ask that. But we wanted to know, you know,</v>

6
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.960
what would happen cuz Tony's D off of his back, you know,

7
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:17.120
like submitted Kevin Lee, right? No.

8
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.110
<v 0>He's, he's got good S you know, elbows know he's, he's tough. He's very,</v>

9
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:22.944
very, very tough.

10
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.110
<v 1>I think I'm more interested in seeing Oliver fight for the title than anybody in</v>

11
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:28.430
that division. Yeah.

12
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.390
<v 2>He's gotta do think Oliver versus KIB would've went.</v>

13
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.670
<v 0>I don't know. Same thing that would've happened to everybody else. I,</v>

14
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.710
you think so? I think so. You know, it's like, CBEs just too good. Yeah. I,

15
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.860
I think, you know, CIBS that go to that, that division for me.

16
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.140
<v 1>Yeah. I believe so. Yeah. I believe he's the go to that division,</v>

17
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.460
but I don't know what would happen with Olivera until you see it.

18
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.620
See with Olivera,

19
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.620
like there are moments like when Cub Swanson knocked him out there's moments and

20
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:56.460
you go back in his career and you go, oh, well, this guy's not the greatest.

21
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.900
And then you see him in some fights, like the Kevin Lee fight,

22
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.410
we submitted Kevin Lee, put him out and then Kevin wakes up and thinks,

23
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.850
thinks he's still fighting. Right. Um, submits Tony in a spectacular way.

24
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.170
And just, just he's so technical. Yeah. Like everything's so good.

25
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.370
He's never outta position. Everything's so he doesn't force anything.

26
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:19.010
Everything looks amazing. It Jitsu looks really good. Oh, amazing. It's amazing.

27
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.890
And you go, man, I wanna see him fight for the title. I wanna see him fight.

28
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.440
Dustin. I wanna see him fight Connor. I wanna see him fight.

29
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:27.040
Whoever else is in that division. I don't think.

30
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.680
<v 0>Connor's gonna be a contender anymore though. I think that's it.</v>

31
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.400
I think that's it. You know, it's like, um, you know,

32
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.200
I'm sure he'll make money and you know,

33
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.920
he'll probably fight a few more times if he wants to, but it's like, um, I,

34
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.760
I just, you know, it's like, he, he, you know,

35
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.510
I think time has probably taken us total. Do.

36
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.071
<v 1>You think that's it,</v>

37
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:47.670
or do you think it's just money and motivation and spending a lot of time out of

38
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.110
the sport? I mean, look, he's training for Floyd.

39
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.630
So he is boxing for a long time. Then he takes two years off.

40
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:55.430
He's fighting Kabe. Right. You know, and then he beats cowboy,

41
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.830
but just swarmed him, you know, swarmed him, jumped on him real quick,

42
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.750
hurt him quick and, and stopped him. And cowboy.

43
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.540
<v 0>Was always a slow starter. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, uh, that, I, I think it just,</v>

44
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.180
you know, maybe it's time, maybe it's maybe it's desire. Maybe I, I don't know.

45
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.260
I don't have the answer, but I think the time has come went, it's.

46
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.140
<v 1>Easy to say that after you see the result. Right. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.220
But what's interesting in that fight is there's moments in that fight where he

48
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.380
was having big success and he hurt dust.

49
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.130
And at one point in time with a big left hand. Yeah. But that low calf kick.

50
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.530
Yeah. That low calf kick is a beast. That's.

51
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.650
<v 2>A, it changed, it changed the, you know, the look on his face, changed life.</v>

52
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.490
Yeah. I think, I think me personally, I'm a Conner fan,

53
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.970
so probably I go a little bias on it, but I think it's more so, uh, that time,

54
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.210
you know, that time going to, uh,

55
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.280
boxing and then coming over first fight fighting KIB and then you take time off

56
00:02:46.281 --> 00:02:49.200
and then you come back and then you fight cowboy and then you pandemic comes,

57
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.560
you get a whole nother year off and then you come back and you fight Dustin Poer

58
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.000
let's think about his last few fights. Let's think about his last three losses.

59
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.360
You got Floyd Mayweather. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

60
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.240
Arguably one of the greatest boxers of all time, if not,

61
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.960
definitely the best defensive boxers of all times, right? Yeah.

62
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.480
And one of the smartest boxers of all times, as far as how he did his career,

63
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.680
and then you lose the KIB yeah. You say it's the greatest 1, 55,

64
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.600
or ever even one around against. KIB probably drunk off as whiskey as well.

65
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.110
You know? Uh, then you got the Dustin Poer fight.

66
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.310
I think he's pretty serious about the Dustin Poer fight.

67
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.190
But I think at the same time,

68
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.670
I think he's thinking bigger than what he was at the time.

69
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.270
I think he's thinking about boxing, Pao,

70
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.670
doing all these other things that he does in there with, uh, my hands or this.

71
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.550
Fantastic. And it's time to show you guys that max,

72
00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:37.430
Holloway's not the best boxer. He gets chopped at the leg.

73
00:03:37.431 --> 00:03:39.740
Now it's hard to move. It's hard to move you.

74
00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:42.540
Can't it's hard to defend a take down. It's hard to grapple. It's hard to box.

75
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.140
It's hard to do anything. You know, me personally,

76
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.860
I never thought a Irish man could get knocked out until then. &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

77
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.100
so crazy night, you know? But yeah. I, I don't,

78
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.740
I don't necessarily think it's over for the guy.

79
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.580
I just think the guy has to not take a rich person's approach.

80
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.900
I think he has to take more of an approach.

81
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.970
He took back in the day when he was on welfare. Right. Go out there and get it.

82
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.090
Stop telling everybody what your training schedule is gonna be and just do what

83
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.970
the Jim tells you to do. Well, he was.

84
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.770
<v 1>Still, he was pretty rich when he fought Eddie Alvarez, you know,</v>

85
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:11.770
he was already a multimillionaire. It's not,

86
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.490
I don't necessarily think it's a rich thing.

87
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.810
I don't know if that affects him that much, but I do think it's inactivity.

88
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.440
And I do think that Dustin got a lot better and Dustin's at 1 45.

89
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.400
Dustin was depleted and diminished at 1 55. He's huge.

90
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.360
He doesn't even look like a 55 or he looks like a 70. Yeah.

91
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.680
He's his back is gigantic. Yeah.

92
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.800
And Dustin look at Dustin's series of victories.

93
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.080
Look at the people that he beat, beat the outta max Holloway. Yeah. Right.

94
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.760
That's.

95
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.720
<v 0>Crazy. But that was at 1 55, not 45.</v>

96
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.190
<v 1>Right. But still you still old max hollow. Oh, he, he beat him.</v>

97
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.150
He beat him and beat him with what max Holloway is best at, which is standup.

98
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.550
I mean, you see what max Holloway did to Calvin cater like Jesus Christ,

99
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.910
max Holloways standup is out outstanding. So he beats him for whatever reason.

100
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.990
<v 0>He looked a little bit slow in that fight. Max did. Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.790
I thought max looked a little bit off. Uh, when he fought, Dustin might be way.

102
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.100
Yeah. It's like, he just, he was a little bit slower. It's like, you know,

103
00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.260
that last height, he looked so fast and some of the other fights, but.

104
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.460
<v 1>It's by Alto and he's fighting Dustin.</v>

105
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.180
<v 2>Dos make fights. Dustin's.</v>

106
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.820
<v 1>Good, man. Oh, Dustin's very, he's good.</v>

107
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.220
<v 0>And he's not could be, he's not, you know, he's not, uh, you know, he's like,</v>

108
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:19.860
he is good, but it's you think it.

109
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.730
<v 2>Was dust victory rematch. You think, think, uh, hands down.</v>

110
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.330
<v 1>Dustin again. No, I would never say hands down. You never know.</v>

111
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.890
Cuz Connor did have moments in that fight. They,

112
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.530
the first he had moments in the first round and Dustin said there was a moment

113
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:32.450
in that first round. Well, he got his bell wrong and he was in trouble.

114
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.410
Now imagine if Connor connects again, right? Imagine, I mean,

115
00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:38.890
that's how fights are fights are weird. Things happen.

116
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.680
<v 2>Loose Connor, Connor plays, touch button to park is, is, is a, a great Connor,</v>

117
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.720
you know, he's moving and he's throwing those spinning heel kicks and.

118
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.720
The thing is.

119
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.040
<v 1>Though, he's heavy on that front leg, wide karate stance. He, you know,</v>

120
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:54.200
he's always doing this. He's always doing this man.

121
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.280
When that leg is available for that low Calca, that changes.

122
00:05:57.281 --> 00:05:58.880
Everything changes your whole approach.

123
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.520
And Connor is also a guy that's never been known to like switch back and forth.

124
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.280
He doesn't like to have left leg forward. It's not,

125
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:09.600
that's not a common thing for him. No. So once his leg is getting chewed up,

126
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.880
you know, it's not like he's got that option.

127
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.760
Like he can fight just as good from Orthodox.

128
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.400
<v 2>No. And it's probably worse from Orthodox now that he all, he,</v>

129
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.030
his work on his boxing. Right. You know?

130
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.750
And it's like the things that he probably used to do from a switch dance,

131
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.870
you know, different kicks, different setups. It's probably not there anymore,

132
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.750
you know? Yeah. He's probably really, really great fighter from that one stance.

133
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.750
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but now when you take him outside of that dance,

134
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.990
he probably becomes, you know, almost like a C or D great fighter.

135
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.710
<v 1>Well, they're talking about doing that fight again,</v>

136
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.820
which a lot of people not to vision are, cuz they're like, well,

137
00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:40.300
what the you guys are tying up? No, do it,

138
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.900
the championship do it because it's not really the championship.

139
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.620
They don't want the championship has not even been decided whether or not K

140
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.020
beeb's gonna step down. Yeah. So then there's been talk. Well,

141
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:50.580
they might do it again, but they'll do it for the belt. No, I think.

142
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.780
<v 2>Char I think, uh, Charles and Chandler for, uh, even an intern belt,</v>

143
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.490
just some type of belt Charles and Chandler makes sense.

144
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:00.050
People probably can get mad about that.

145
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.210
Cuz the Chandler's barely coming from Bellator over to UFC. But come on, dude.

146
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:07.850
He just knocked out Dan. Yeah. He didn't take him down and smash him,

147
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:09.650
smashed him, which we all thought he was gonna do.

148
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.410
He knocked him out one punch with that left hook that we talk about, right? Yep.

149
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.330
<v 1>Yeah. Be long one too long left hook. Yeah.</v>

150
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.440
So touched him to the body with the right hand, then left.

151
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.320
<v 2>Hooked him. The, the Bronx guy, you know, Charles, you know, he's,</v>

152
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.120
he's been doing great. He deserves to fight for a belt.

153
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.200
So him and uh, you know, Mr. Beto are fighting for a belt.

154
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.880
I think it sounds good. And I believe.

155
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.640
<v 1>A Dustin fighting for the belt. Well, does.</v>

156
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.560
<v 2>That make sense? He's trying to make money right now. He's not.</v>

157
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.990
<v 1>Make his money lost. It could be. So it's like, you know.</v>

158
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.950
<v 2>He lost a CIB, you know, he almost submitted, he almost submitted Kabe.</v>

159
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.070
You know, he had CIB in a really tight, guilty, yeah. Guilty, you know?

160
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.190
I mean he took him in a deep water for sure. Yeah. I mean,

161
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.430
I'm pretty sure it could be probably farted two times in that guilting.

162
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.190
You know what I mean? It's like, yeah. When you, when you get choke real hard,

163
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.270
it's like, you know, I mean, and you pass over and you're good to go.

164
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.630
You do you.

165
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.260
<v 1>Like, what do you do with just engaging?</v>

166
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.300
<v 2>Cause just engaging. Just Chasey. Just got, he got, he got sub his performance.</v>

167
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.500
I like Justin GCI, but his performance against KIB was, was embarrassing.

168
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.220
<v 1>I don't know if.</v>

169
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:11.661
<v 2>It was embarrassing.</v>

170
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.300
I don't that I think it was embarrasing he ran the whole time.

171
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.620
If I run like that against Derek Brunson, that's a problem.

172
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.100
Don't run from somebody just cause they.

173
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.410
<v 1>Gotta keep way to land those leg kicks. Yeah. He was hurting to jab.</v>

174
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.370
<v 2>Definitely hurting jab. What's wrong with the jab. Nobody throws jab.</v>

175
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.530
<v 1>Don't you, you remember that? I want you to remember that.</v>

176
00:08:28.531 --> 00:08:32.890
You just said that you throw hook, throw, throw, throw the jab, throw the jab.

177
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.870
Yeah.

178
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.850
<v 2>Set myself up. But yeah. I, I, I,</v>

179
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.570
from everything I seen from Justin Gache and then that fight, I was like,

180
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.040
oh that dude. I, I, you didn't like it. I lost money on that. Hell yeah.

181
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:43.874
What do you think.

182
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.920
<v 1>About Gache versus Chandler?</v>

183
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.520
<v 2>That's a good fight. That's that'd be fun.</v>

184
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.080
<v 1>That's a good fight. Yeah. That's a good fight.</v>
