<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.860
Is it possible that we were in this weird state with

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.430
people because we've decided that we are,

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.460
we're losing power and other aspects of our life.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.560
So we're getting more and more determined to take it back and other places,

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.260
because the fact that so many people have been denied,

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.530
the ability to make a living. I mean, it's kind of crazy. I mean,

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.300
I don't know what to think about it,

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.830
but it seems to me that if I'm allowed to go to certain essential businesses

10
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.980
with a mask on and no one's dying. I mean,

11
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.440
if I'm going to a supermarket and everyone's wearing a mask,

12
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.830
everybody seems okay. Right. And scientists seem to think they're okay.

13
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
Like w what point in time do we allow that for everywhere?

14
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.140
And at what point in time do we, uh, allow people to take chances?

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.590
We allow people to flip dirt bikes.

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.830
We allow people to jump out of helicopters.

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.340
We allow people to do all kinds of crazy. We allow people to wingsuit. Why,

18
00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:03.270
why don't we allow people to not wear a mask?

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.820
Why don't we allow people to open up their business?

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.670
Why don't we allow people to do whatever they wanted to do?

21
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.640
Is it the really the right? And the idea is, well,

22
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:15.480
you have to protect the other people. I agree. You do have to protect,

23
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.470
protect the other people.

24
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.320
But one of the things that's going to make the other people more vulnerable is

25
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.470
the collapsed the economy. And we're not saying that for some reason,

26
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.100
there's this weird thing where politicians want you to love them,

27
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.540
and they want you to love them.

28
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:31.980
So if you are leaning towards defunding the beliefs and,

29
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.260
and making sure that, uh,

30
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.670
all the socialism ideas get accepted into major universities,

31
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:42.210
and it gets taught in the curriculum and grade school,

32
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.080
if you drone on enough and the person who's running for mayor knows the only way

33
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.480
that they can win is to embrace your ideas.

34
00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.920
They're going to do it because a dirty system, it doesn't make any sense.

35
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.030
And you should be able to vote from your phone, right. But you can't. Right?

36
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:01.790
So we get this weird corrupted intertwined system that it

37
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.700
it's, it's all food. Well.

38
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.170
<v 1>First of all, every country gets the government. She deserves. Um, the question,</v>

39
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.060
the question is not, why do we allow people to tell us what to do it is,

40
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.980
why are we allowing them to actually tell us what to do? Who is no,

41
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:21.380
seriously, we are afraid. We've been,

42
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.460
the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. This is a good one.

43
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.120
It's one thing to say, you playing might crash. The car might crash.

44
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:31.730
You might get hit by a car. You might die of an overdose.

45
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.120
It's another thing to say, some other without a mass might kill you.

46
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.330
That's some real fear, and that's not to be taken lightly. That is not to be,

47
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.160
and they have, they have with us over this.

48
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.470
I don't care whether it's true or not,

49
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:50.360
or what's true or not the cavalier nature of this shutdown and fear and

50
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:55.340
colors and stages and numbers and charts and connecting it to the stock

51
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.770
market. I don't like that about president Trump at all,

52
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.940
but see he at what he calls the economy.

53
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.580
I don't know if he's behind this digital dollar or not,

54
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.530
but I think we're all going to be taken care of.

55
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.950
The 10 million are going to be on a universal, basic income,

56
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.950
and that's going to happen. I'm not worried about that,

57
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:15.130
but what are we left with? And just,

58
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:19.920
where do we go from there is going to be the question because what does,

59
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.810
what does Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, his slogan?

60
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:27.370
Do you know what their slogan is? Brain damage and prison time. It should be

61
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.740
build back better. Hmm. So that's pretty,

62
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.960
that's pretty clever. Okay. Hey,

63
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.060
it's so clever that the same slogan is used by the United nations. The,

64
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.890
um, the green new deal organization, 360 3 fifty.org.

65
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.130
Boris Johnson is using it as his campaign,

66
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.030
Francois McColl using it as his campaign, uh,

67
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.710
Justin Trudeau build back better. This is a globalist plan.

68
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.080
Build back better. This is a globalist plant.

69
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.100
It means we're going to shut down all,

70
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.290
uh, coal and, uh, uh, and gas and fracking.

71
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.610
And we're going as much as possible. The transition to solar and wind.

72
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.430
<v 0>Does that sound like a good idea? If it's feasible.</v>

73
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.650
<v 1>I don't think it's feasible. And, uh, but,</v>

74
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.000
but what is being promised with the green new deal is we will create good paying

75
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.150
green new jobs. Now that's just a philosophy,

76
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:30.990
whether you think is good or not right now, I don't think so, but for sure,

77
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.530
I know that bill gates, who was a big part of, you know,

78
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.210
this green new deal that he's investing in nuclear plants,

79
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.240
because when the sun don't shine in the window and blow,

80
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.600
you need some power and it's going to come from his nuclear plants.

81
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.360
<v 0>How does bill gates have ambition left?</v>

82
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.230
<v 2>Oh man, maybe he's being blackmailed.</v>

83
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.930
<v 0>What'd he think he knows?</v>

84
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.000
<v 1>No, I think he's being blackmailed of stuff. He's done.</v>

85
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.760
I don't know if that sweater allegedly. Yeah. What was it? Someone's.

86
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.680
<v 0>Got a picture of him when a tank top on doing, doing the most muscular.</v>

87
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860
Yeah.

88
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.820
<v 1>You can't. This is another thing, man. This whole Epstein business,</v>

89
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:12.654
this has gotten.

90
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.730
<v 0>Millennials. Bill gates meets with Jeffrey Epstein.</v>

91
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.620
Many times, despite his past.

92
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.760
<v 1>It's gotten everyone nuts. The kids are going like, ah, that guy, and you know,</v>

93
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.510
this is good though. Cause there's something there.

94
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.710
Obviously there's obviously something there. Obviously something there. Wait.

95
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.690
<v 0>A minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Stop.</v>

96
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.130
You seem to be one of those guys. Who's really into conspiracies. No,

97
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.170
let me break this down. Let me break this down.

98
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.130
There's no way there's anything more to what you're seeing in the news.

99
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.610
When it comes to a story, excuse me, please, sir.

100
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.700
About a man who, uh,

101
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.390
traveled to island with bill Clinton 26 times.

102
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.640
Did he fly with bill 26 times or did he to the government just find me?

103
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.390
They just took the money straight out of my digital dollar wallet. Yeah.

104
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:05.660
You thought you were son.

105
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.470
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

106
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.620
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

107
00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:15.760
They're going to be available everywhere,

108
00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:19.360
but after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

109
00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:23.380
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

110
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.450
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

111
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.560
Buh-bye.
