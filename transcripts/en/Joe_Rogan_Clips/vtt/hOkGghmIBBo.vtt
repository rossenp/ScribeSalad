00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.690
It doesn't mean just because you don't like Trump as an individual that suddenly

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:08.580
you're okay with hard left policies.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.500
But I think the Democrats make that mistake.

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.570
<v 1>I think they're there.</v>

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.290
They think that that's the solution to Trump goes as far away from him as

7
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:18.690
possible. And then the solution by the center. I think exactly.

8
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.070
That's the solution. I think the solution somewhere in the center and when,

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.310
when you see like what's happening in Portland and Seattle,

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.660
I think people are more aware than ever now that civil unrest is like,

11
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.420
it's, it's very strange.

12
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.080
It's very strange to watch them try to break into that.

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.490
What was the building in Portland?

14
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.910
<v 2>They were trying to Hatfield a courthouse, the federal courthouse.</v>

15
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.980
That was insane. Yeah. Watch.

16
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.080
<v 1>On. That was insane. I don't understand the motivation,</v>

17
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.730
like connecting that to how, how do you connect that in Portland,

18
00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:51.500
the most liberal city in the country?

19
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.520
How do you PR how do you are arguably right. Probably the most liberal,

20
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:56.240
the most.

21
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.340
<v 2>Progressive model Portland right there.</v>

22
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.650
<v 1>How do you connect that to black lives matter? I mean,</v>

23
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:05.030
how do you connect that to George Floyd's death? How do you connect that to why?

24
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.710
Why, why? I just don't understand.

25
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:10.190
Why would you try to break into the courthouse to trying to recreate what went

26
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:13.970
wrong? What didn't work in Seattle, right? That whole, uh,

27
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.400
zone Toronto. Yeah, that didn't work. I mean, that was nonsense. It was crazy.

28
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.740
You made a worst version of American six blocks.

29
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.220
It's like one of those little tiny, a little, you know,

30
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:28.700
like if you took a glass dome and you put like little animals in there and

31
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.490
you'll let them eat each other alive, like I was like, we're going to,

32
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.140
we're going to create utopian glass.

33
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:35.990
Like they made a worst version of the United States.

34
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:38.990
They put up borders immediately. They stopped people from coming in.

35
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:42.950
They had armed guards, they wind up using police tied. They didn't have cops,

36
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:46.430
but they have people that act like cops and beat the out of people for filming.

37
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.480
Right. The whole thing is madness. They had murders. It.

38
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.530
<v 2>Was it's. Um.</v>

39
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.830
<v 0>I mean, look, Portland. I, I know Portland extremely well. My parents lived,</v>

40
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.610
uh, in Portland for a couple of decades, place a, it used to be a real,

41
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.520
a hell of a place, but over the years, and, and, you know, I,

42
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.870
I know Republicans and Democrats who feel the same way who were in Portland and

43
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:12.740
the surrounding area. And they all feel like this place is, is slowly, you know,

44
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.570
circling down a toilet because of local and state, uh, management.

45
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.470
Right. And so, uh, what happened in Portland?

46
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:26.030
Not really a surprise, you know, it's, it's the same. The, the, the people that,

47
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:30.470
that, that, that do this sort of activity, right. That, you know, uh,

48
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.830
have been referred to as Antifa or anarchists or whatever,

49
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.170
they, the same sort of trust of ferry and, you know,

50
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.060
bottom feeding folks in,

51
00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:45.920
in really any city in the world who engage in a WTO protest because it's

52
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:49.670
cool to get out there and protest. I don't understand the mentality,

53
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:52.580
but if you try to figure out a motivation for them, you know,

54
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:54.380
you'll lose your mind because they definitely don't have one.

55
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:58.460
You could take 10 of those people out of Portland who were engaged in sort of

56
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.070
the, the violent activity and asked him, well, why are you doing this?

57
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.220
And you'll get 10 different answers, right. They really don't have,

58
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.230
it's not like that. And they've the, the sad part about it is they,

59
00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:14.140
they hijacked a very legitimate protest over, um,

60
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.700
you know, really serious, important questions about how do we,

61
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.530
how do we improve policing around the country? How do we get to that point?

62
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:27.730
And I'll tell you the most disappointing part about it is after,

63
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.150
after the tragedy would with George Floyd,

64
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.630
if the focus had been on, okay, here's what we have to do.

65
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.980
We have to seriously, not just lip service,

66
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:46.090
we have to improve the policing to solve this particular issue.

67
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.120
How do we do that? Well, there are certain logistical things you can do.

68
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.890
You can improve your vetting and hiring of police candidates, right? Of,

69
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:56.410
of applicants for the job. You can do that. That's a,

70
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.180
that's a protocol you can put in place.

71
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.910
You can improve the training that costs money. So defunding,

72
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:02.650
the police has kind of. You can,

73
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:06.070
you can improve the training and make it continuous.

74
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:07.390
It's not just a one-time thing.

75
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:10.930
It's a continuous training on how to respond to situations. It's like,

76
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.440
it's like a, a weapons training. If you don't keep doing it,

77
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:18.400
if you're not always practicing, it just doesn't work. Right.

78
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.570
And then what can you, you do, you can also improve disciplinary action, right?

79
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.220
Those are, those are concrete things that you can do. They're not easy,

80
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.420
right? But it's,

81
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.650
it's not as heavy a lift as deciding in the aftermath of the George Floyd

82
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:33.041
tragedy,

83
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:35.950
that what we're rarely going to do is we're going to remove racism from the

84
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:39.670
hearts and minds of people, Hey, this is not going to happen. Right.

85
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.620
I'd like to think of web in theory, Hey, great. Get rid of racism. But, uh,

86
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.190
I, you know what you should, what this should have been,

87
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.990
was a protest about doing things that actually will impact meaningfully people's

88
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.860
lives. And it, and it, it veered off because people wanted to feel,

89
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.890
self-righteous it veered off into what you have to prove, how you're you are,

90
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:04.420
you have to remove racism right now. I know, I know, uh,

91
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.910
black people that object to, uh, white people.

92
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:10.510
I know white people that object to, uh, people not of their race.

93
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:12.500
I know Hispanics that don't like people of, uh,

94
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:16.840
of non-Hispanics racism exists, sad to say, right?

95
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.830
And all mankind, it's a human element of, of, of nature.

96
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.480
Would you rather spin your wheels and act self-righteous and try to say, well,

97
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.950
we're gonna have this exercise where we remove racism from, from mankind.

98
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.900
Would you rather say in the aftermath of this,

99
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:34.090
let's do the things that can actually make a difference.

100
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.170
And that's what we didn't do. And then legitimate protests over,

101
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.160
over the anger and frustration about all this got further hijacked by again,

102
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:44.060
Antifa, anarchism, whatever you want to call.

103
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.960
<v 1>That's a big part of the problem. You know, um,</v>

104
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.640
Ben Shapiro and I had this conversation about, uh, the PR the protests and this,

105
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:54.720
this term where they are large, mostly peaceful protests.

106
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.120
And he had a hilarious point. He said, OJ Simpson had a mostly peaceful night.

107
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.530
The night he killed his wife.

108
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.920
It was only three minutes of the entire day that wasn't peaceful.

109
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.200
Like that is a great point,

110
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.780
but it is true in the protest that most of those people want the world to be a

111
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:15.260
better place. Right. The problem is the people that hijack that,

112
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:19.700
and they're trying to light the federal buildings on fire and smash monuments,

113
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.180
you know, particularly, I mean, like they're going after Abraham Lincoln.

114
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.960
I mean, Jesus Christ, right? He's the guy that freed the slaves, like,

115
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:29.150
what are we doing? And we're going to erase history. Yeah.

116
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.080
W I would have loved if Abraham Lincoln could have had a time machine and gone

117
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:37.220
to 2020 and understood what we know now about systemic racism. However,

118
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.030
he lived in the 17 hundreds when you wrote with a feather, okay.

119
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.690
Give the guy a break. The world was,

120
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.580
it was a weird place back then.

121
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.780
<v 0>Well, and that's, and that's part of it is, is trying to,</v>

122
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.030
trying to judge people of the past by current morals or current

123
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.770
understanding, current thinking is, is, uh, is pretty absurd, right?

124
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:04.780
It doesn't justify past bad actions, but you know what, th this idea,

125
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.991
you know,

126
00:07:04.991 --> 00:07:09.280
that you're going to erase history or remove history or not learn from it, uh,

127
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.300
going forward,

128
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.520
is it discredits the ability of people to have

129
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:18.820
rational thought, right. To, to understand and look at it at a context,

130
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.660
looking at something in context and say, okay, now a days that's unacceptable,

131
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.440
but okay. I get w you know why these things occurred?

132
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:31.120
It's tragic or it's regrettable, whatever. But I mean, look, in, in the UK,

133
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:34.060
they were, you know, they were attacking the statue of Churchill. Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:35.110
Mean, holy. That's crazy.

135
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.920
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I think I said, did I just say Lincoln 17 hundreds of men, 1800?</v>

136
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.140
Well, it was 1865, right? But either way,

137
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.490
the idea that this guy is supposed to be a perfect person back then look,

138
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.450
history is supposed to be about the things that happen.

139
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.870
The people that made a difference and how we got to where we are today.

140
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.880
And Lincoln has a big part, the 1865, the emancipation proclamation.

141
00:07:57.881 --> 00:08:02.260
That's a big part of how we are, who we are today. It's look,

142
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.030
it's horrible that the early settlers brought over

143
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:10.540
slaves from Africa. It's horrible. That slaves still exist today.

144
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.820
All these things are horrible. They're horrible,

145
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:16.960
but taking down statues of people that made a difference and made change. Look,

146
00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:17.770
if you want to take,

147
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.270
if you want to take down statues of Confederate generals and stuff like that,

148
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.470
there's a good argument. There,

149
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.390
it's a good argument that maybe we shouldn't have those,

150
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:27.670
or maybe we should have them somewhere. You know, like,

151
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.400
like at the same place we have a statue of Gingiss con, right?

152
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.900
Like maybe they shouldn't be, you know what I'm saying?

153
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.950
Is there a statue of gang?

154
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.620
<v 2>I'm sure there is somewhere, somewhere in Mongolia.</v>

155
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:36.603
<v 1>There's gotta be right.</v>

156
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.240
Making his car and killed 10% of the population while he was alive.

157
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.440
But it doesn't mean there shouldn't be some recognition of this historical

158
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.420
figure when you're talking about 2020.

159
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.500
<v 0>Well, I think interestingly, and this doesn't again, you know, you can, you can,</v>

160
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.110
the problem is nowadays, right? You've got a,

161
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.970
you've got sort of the righteous mob on the left,

162
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.870
the righteous mob on the right. And the problem people make is,

163
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.270
is a try to placate one side of the other thinking,

164
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:02.550
somehow they're always going to be there. They're going to be pure enough.

165
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:05.070
You're never pure enough for the self-righteous mob,

166
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.250
no matter where they are on the spectrum, they're always find a new,

167
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.160
there's a new benchmark. There's always that opportunity. But you know,

168
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:14.220
a lot of the Confederate statues out there were put up in an effort to,

169
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.270
and this sounds weird, but in an effort to try to unify the country again,

170
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.150
right. And in the aftermath of, of the civil war,

171
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:25.490
and there was this element of saying, let's try to. And so, okay. That's a lot.

172
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:27.590
<v 1>Of them were put up actually during the civil rights. Right.</v>

173
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.710
They were put up when they were thinking that people are getting too

174
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.820
highfalutin, you wanted to celebrate. And that's absolutely true. Yeah.

175
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.340
Those are the really cheap ones too. It's true. They're really Lee made.

176
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.900
Cause there, they made them real quick. Right.

177
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.730
<v 0>But I mean, so the point being is I agree. Yeah.</v>

178
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.250
If you want to take those down well sure. Yeah. I mean,

179
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:47.240
why would you have a statue of some Confederate leader? Find, take it out,

180
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.750
take it off the streets that makes I get, I get that right. That,

181
00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.800
and if that helps people feel terrific,

182
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.980
put it in a museum or whatever you're gonna do with it. But George Washington,

183
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.740
George Washington. Yeah. I know exactly. Abraham Lincoln was funny.

184
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.610
<v 1>When they were taking down Confederate statues. Trump wants said,</v>

185
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:07.970
what's next you going to take down George Washington. And everyone was laughing.

186
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:10.250
Like, they're not going to do that, but yet they are going to do that now.

187
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.890
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And you know what, and, and two things, again,</v>

188
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:17.030
as always can be true at the same time somebody could be, you know, uh,

189
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.120
doing some things you disagree with vehemently,

190
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:24.170
they could have also done something that helped move the country forward,

191
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.650
did something that had extreme positive. I can.

192
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.730
<v 1>Just con argument, you know,</v>

193
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.510
they opened up trade with China and the process of killing 10 million people.

194
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:34.520
He opened up trade with these, let's see a free trader.

195
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.710
<v 3>I didn't know that. Yeah. It's a free trade.</v>

196
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.400
<v 1>Guy. Free trade slash raper. Sure. First NAFTA murderer.</v>

197
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:44.840
He killed so many people. They changed the carbon footprint of the earth. Yeah.

198
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.630
Like times of this crazy article about it though,

199
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:50.330
like he literally killed 10% of the people on earth,

200
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.090
but he was an angry man. Look,

201
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.920
it's awful that we have history that's filled with terrible acts and

202
00:10:57.921 --> 00:10:58.754
deeds,

203
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.560
but I don't think that removing statues of people who tried to make a

204
00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:07.490
difference, you know, within the context of their, their time, you know,

205
00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:12.200
with Lincoln 1865 with George Washington, 17 hundreds, I mean, this is you're,

206
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:15.650
you're, you're talking about people that when they were doing this,

207
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:18.650
they were the best example of humanity that you could find.

208
00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:21.260
They were the best example of what we had. I mean,

209
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:24.020
when George Washington was the first president of the United States, I mean,

210
00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:27.560
you want to talk about a radical undertaking,

211
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:32.090
this crazy experiment in self-government while they

212
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.350
escape from the grasp of, of Europe. I mean, it's really nuts.

213
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.460
<v 0>Yeah. And again, I think there's, there's a, an element here that</v>

214
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.990
we, we missed the, we missed the boat maybe again, right.

215
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:47.480
We've gone through these. It's not like we haven't had protests before in,

216
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:48.860
on black lives matter protests and,

217
00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:53.440
and over the same issues of police brutality and all that. But, um, I, I,

218
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:57.280
it all falls into that same bucket from my perspective that we,

219
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.020
we don't do the hard things. Right. The hard things would have been to say, um,

220
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.540
from a local state and federal position,

221
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.400
let's enact these different protocols that can improve policing.

222
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.250
Let's do those things that we need to do. That's a heavy lift in a way,

223
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.990
the easier things are, let's stare down a statue, right. Or, you know, find,

224
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.100
find a way to, to,

225
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:20.980
to make us feel better about ourselves without necessarily having it.

226
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.650
And it's like this, this a shell game,

227
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:27.430
I think that the politicians sometimes play right. That, and you see it,

228
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:29.620
you saw it in Portland where, you know, okay,

229
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:33.070
let's just play Kate this for a while. I don't make everybody feel better.

230
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:34.810
And then they'll, the protests will die down.

231
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.590
<v 1>Seattle's the best example. Right. When the mayor came out and said,</v>

232
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.330
she called it, maybe it's the summer of love.

233
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.450
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 67, the summer of love.</v>

234
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.480
<v 1>Of that, they have, they've totally squashed that now is that,</v>

235
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.690
that whole place brought back to the original business owners. Uh.

236
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.390
<v 0>I, you know, I don't know is the answer to that question.</v>

237
00:12:51.391 --> 00:12:55.680
I do know that they've, you know, they've been looking at how do we do, um,

238
00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.250
community-based policing? How do we defund the police?

239
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:04.020
And yet still have something that resembles our response to this citizens need

240
00:13:04.021 --> 00:13:07.770
for security. I don't know what any of all that dribble means. Um,

241
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.850
if you want to, if you want to improve the policing, you it's an investment,

242
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.420
right. It's not defunding, but against defunding and saying that and saying,

243
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:20.520
this is what I'm for. It's a easy way, right. To feel good.

244
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.990
And to placate people, and then you don't do. And then five years from now,

245
00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:27.930
we have another incident because you didn't actually do the things that make

246
00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:28.764
policing better.

247
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.840
<v 1>I get where you got in New York city. It began,</v>

248
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.220
it gets even worse for the citizens because now the police don't have any faith

249
00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:38.310
at all in the government. They're not respected. They're not appreciated.

250
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.030
And you've seen this giant uptick in crime because their presence isn't there

251
00:13:42.031 --> 00:13:44.160
anymore. Yeah. I mean, it's really crazy, man.

252
00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:47.580
It's like a movie I've never thought if you will went back to March,

253
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:48.480
when we shut down,

254
00:13:48.481 --> 00:13:51.990
I never thought I would be sitting here with you at the end of July,

255
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.900
early August here. And we would be talking about this.

256
00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.630
I would have never thought that this would have taken place,

257
00:13:57.631 --> 00:14:01.140
that we would have legitimate civil unrest in this country.

258
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:04.650
People getting shot in the streets and protests, you know? Um,

259
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:08.340
I know that there's a real concern.

260
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.950
A lot of these cities that they're going,

261
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.410
someone's going to try to recreate what happened in Seattle,

262
00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:16.140
recreate what happened in Portland. And they're worried about it.

263
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.610
The thing about it is it seems so organized. It really does.

264
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:25.410
It doesn't seem that haphazard, it seems organized. How does, how does,

265
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.030
how do these things get started?

266
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.890
Like how do you get something as big as these Portland riots?

267
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.070
<v 0>Well, it, it, you know, it's a, it's a really good question.</v>

268
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:37.800
And sometimes what you see is a,

269
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.800
what appears to be a grassroots movement or grassroots activity happening just

270
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.500
kind of swelling up from, from a couple of neighborhoods. Yes.

271
00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:50.730
There was an element of that, but you also see, like, if you're talking about,

272
00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:56.060
um, you know, um, talking about activist, environmental groups, as an example,

273
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.570
you'll also see some commonality between some of these groups,

274
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:03.080
you'll see commonality in, in communications advice,

275
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:07.700
in financing and in legal assistance and support from national

276
00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:11.870
groups. Right. And yet it's in their, um, it's in their agenda.

277
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:15.770
It's to their advantage to make it appear as if it's a grassroots movement.

278
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:20.060
So that all stays in the background. I'd argue that, you know, yeah.

279
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.670
Some of this, um, I, and again,

280
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:26.660
not to disappear down some rabbit hole where it's a George Soros funded thing,

281
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.300
but I mean, you know, is there,

282
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.140
are there some elements that help with, uh,

283
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.940
communication support or, uh,

284
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.870
transportation assistance or legal advice or, uh,

285
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:42.110
whatever it may be. Absolutely. You know, these things, they,

286
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:46.820
they very rarely, is there an actual, genuine,

287
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.860
organic grassroots movement that has no, uh, outside organizational support,

288
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.110
that's this spontaneous.

289
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.740
<v 2>And this big. Yeah. So, yeah, but again, I, you know,</v>

290
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.030
we'll get, we're putting our tinfoil hats on, but if anybody corrected on,

291
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.090
you can put them on, I left mine out in the car, but yeah, I'll go get it.

292
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.840
<v 1>You've been on the inside, you know, working for the CIA, you know,</v>

293
00:16:10.841 --> 00:16:11.674
how it works.

294
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.860
<v 0>Oh, we very rarely organized things. Like.</v>

295
00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:19.210
<v 2>That's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying that, you know, yeah.</v>

296
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.170
You guys.

297
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.470
<v 1>Did it. I'm saying you understand how these people operate. Right. Right.</v>

298
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.240
There's a way that someone like me doesn't.

299
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:27.820
<v 0>And also, you know, again, look, I, I, you know,</v>

300
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.400
we've talked about this in the past and I, I'm not,

301
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.870
I'm not necessarily a conspiracy theorist, but sometimes yeah. Sometimes,

302
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.990
you know, the, the, you got to follow the threads of that you can pull on and,

303
00:16:38.991 --> 00:16:41.500
and sometimes it takes you down an interesting path and you think, okay,

304
00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:42.490
maybe there is something to.

305
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.350
<v 1>This. I wouldn't say you're a conspiracy theorist,</v>

306
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.170
but I would say you're open to the possibility of conspiracy.

307
00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:50.500
Like when you and I talked about the Martin Luther king assassination. Yeah.

308
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.370
And you, you took a big pause and you said that one does not make sense. Yeah.

309
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.610
<v 2>No, I agree. I still feel that way. Yeah.</v>

310
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.040
<v 1>Yeah. One is filled with holes. Yeah. And I agree as well.</v>

311
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:04.030
I looked into it much more after you and I talked and it's yeah.

312
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.700
<v 0>The way that you sometimes can get actually further into it without</v>

313
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.070
kind of disappearing down some of these peripheral side stories and issues

314
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.750
is, uh, is money. Right? Look for, look for funding, look for issues of, of, uh,

315
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:24.220
where did money go. Um, cause that's sometimes will take you down a more,

316
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.800
um, legitimate path, right.

317
00:17:26.801 --> 00:17:29.950
And a lot of times investigations get built on very shaky ground because you

318
00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:33.610
start with a theory or whatever, and it can never starting on firm ground,

319
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.120
but sometimes when you follow the money, it, it,

320
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.820
it keeps you a little more grounded. Um, yeah.

321
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.520
<v 2>Follow the money, follow the fellow. That's the.</v>

322
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.160
<v 1>Thing with this. It's like, where is the money coming from?</v>

323
00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:49.710
Like where where's the money coming from that organizes and helps these people

324
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:51.600
get out of jail and, and all that.

325
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.670
<v 0>Jazz well, and there's certain things that, uh,</v>

326
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.980
let's go back to Portland for a minute. Um,

327
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.530
one of the problems is I think the media

328
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.040
journalism in general, um, you know,

329
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.720
isn't anywhere near as curious or, or, uh, um,

330
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.880
concerned with investigation as it used to be. Right. It's, it's,

331
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.130
it's easier now to just say, this is where I'm at. I'm subjective.

332
00:18:19.131 --> 00:18:22.010
Of course I'm subjective, you know? And so here I go. Here's my,

333
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:25.730
here's my there's the idea of objectivity in journalism is pretty much out the

334
00:18:25.731 --> 00:18:30.260
window. Um, with Portland early on, for instance,

335
00:18:30.261 --> 00:18:34.080
they, they published, uh, uh, mugshots and,

336
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.450
and names of,

337
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.470
I think there were maybe a dozen of the individuals who were arrested for

338
00:18:39.471 --> 00:18:43.610
violent activity, right? Violent activity. Now, a curious journalist,

339
00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:46.460
you would have thought would have said, let's do some research.

340
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.910
Let's look at all these people and let's look at their backgrounds. You know,

341
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.760
it's already public information. They've already posted it.

342
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.370
Let's dig into this and find out who are these people?

343
00:18:55.371 --> 00:18:59.150
Are there any linkages or any commonalities between all these individuals?

344
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.940
Can we find something that's interesting there? Maybe we won't,

345
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.300
but let's do some investigation. Right? Cause I, you know,

346
00:19:05.301 --> 00:19:07.820
you'd like to think that's what journalism used to be. And maybe, you know,

347
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.320
it doesn't seem like it is anymore. Um, but that doesn't happen.

348
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.660
<v 1>I think there's a problem. And here's one of the problems.</v>

349
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.310
Most journalists are left wing. There's a giant number.

350
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.840
I don't know what the percentage of it is,

351
00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.730
but if you want to go with whether it's Newsweek or CNN or the New York times or

352
00:19:25.731 --> 00:19:28.370
Washington post, or many, many, many,

353
00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:32.060
many of these papers and organizations lean left,

354
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.710
there's a dirty secret.

355
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.730
The dirty secret is Antifa acts as the thug,

356
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.960
enforcers of the left, the people that do things like this,

357
00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:44.630
whether you approve of violence or disapprove of violence,

358
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.730
what they're doing is they,

359
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:51.650
they act as the people doing the dirty work that many people on the left

360
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:55.580
think has to be done in order to enact real change. Now,

361
00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:59.720
if you had the same thing in the right, imagine my friend, Tim Dillon said this,

362
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.400
imagine if the proud boys were lighting Portland on fire, right.

363
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.530
Can you imagine if we had a democratic president and the proud boys were

364
00:20:09.531 --> 00:20:12.260
trying to break into the courthouse and light Portland on fire,

365
00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:14.540
people would go crazy.

366
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.040
It would be terrifying if it was a different political ideology,

367
00:20:19.041 --> 00:20:21.020
but the same exact actions.

368
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:26.030
So because these actions are done with the correct political ideology, you know,

369
00:20:26.031 --> 00:20:27.860
under the guise of, you know,

370
00:20:27.861 --> 00:20:31.940
racial justice under the guise of reforming our government.

371
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.630
So then everybody's okay with people, literally burning books,

372
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.530
throwing books on a pile. I mean, that's a Bible. So.

373
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.900
<v 2>Go ahead. You can, it's nicotine crazy.</v>

374
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.140
<v 1>They're burning Bibles. Like what does the Bible have to do with it?</v>

375
00:20:45.141 --> 00:20:47.740
The Bible gives a lot of people comfort, whether you in it or not,

376
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.220
you throwing stacks of Bibles and then you're lining them on fire in front of a

377
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:54.280
courthouse. But what if they'd been throwing the Koran? Right. Good.

378
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:57.730
A very good example. Very good example. It we'd all be losing.

379
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:00.670
<v 0>Our minds, but Nancy Pelosi came out and said, well,</v>

380
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:02.320
people are going to do what they're going to know.

381
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.410
<v 4>Really Nancy really? Uh.</v>

382
00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.740
<v 1>Well, she's, she's an odd duck. That lady.</v>
