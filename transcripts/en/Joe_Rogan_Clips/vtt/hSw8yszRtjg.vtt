00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 1>Experience. Well, what I'm really hoping,</v>

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.280
really hoping is that some sort of a rapid

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.680
test for COVID not even like the 15 minute one that we came,

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.920
cuz I heard something about some saliva test that they're trying to develop.

6
00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:19.160
That's extremely rapid. That would be amazing.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.430
If you could just test right before they come into your restaurant and no one

8
00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:23.750
has to worry about. Yeah.

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.270
<v 0>You know, we're gearing up for what it's, what the new world is gonna be. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.390
Temperature, you know, everybody gets their temperature taken, you know.

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.550
<v 1>But that's not good enough.</v>

12
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:35.230
See the temperature thing is not good enough because if you're asymptomatic,

13
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.550
but you're still spreading it, like why are we pretending?

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.350
Like that's avoiding science.

15
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780
We need to find out whether or not people actually have it.

16
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.380
This temperature thing is just whether or not you're sick.

17
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.140
I know it doesn't mean you don't have it. I know if your,

18
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.340
if your temperature is low, it's, it's real weird.

19
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.580
<v 0>And that's, what's being, that's what's gonna be mandated on us. I mean,</v>

20
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:58.140
there's a certain series of things that we're gonna have to do and it's,

21
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.250
you know, nobody knows for sure or whatnot, but you know, who knows?

22
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.690
<v 1>Well, at a certain point in time,</v>

23
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.050
I think we really need to make a decision as to whether

24
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.050
or not we're just gonna allow this to take over our

25
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:19.810
world or whether we're going to do what we can

26
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.930
do to protect the sick. You know,

27
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.000
if you're in contact with people that have a, a weakened immune system,

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.000
you you're gonna have to have a different life than someone who doesn't.

29
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:32.080
If you're a person with a weakened immune system, yeah.

30
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:34.560
You're gonna have a different life. If you're an older person,

31
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:38.120
you're gonna have to have a different life. But for the vast majority of us,

32
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.503
this, this,

33
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.950
we're gonna have to give people the freedom to make choice and to,

34
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.070
to do what they want to do with their own life and their own health.

35
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.590
If you're giving people the freedom to eat terrible food,

36
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.430
the heart attacks are killing people as quickly as anything mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

37
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:54.930
right.

38
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.350
Cancer is killing people as quickly as anything cigarettes kill a half a million

39
00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:01.550
people a year. There's no government mandate.

40
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.500
That's trying to get people stop smoking cigarettes. In fact,

41
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.140
there's not a single word ever spoken about it in presidential can campaigns and

42
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.300
governor, governor campaigns, congressional campaigns,

43
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.140
no one's out there trying to get people to stop smoking cigarettes,

44
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.060
but yet it's killing a half a million people every year in this country alone.

45
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.700
We're so strange in, uh,

46
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.370
and I understand cigarettes is a choice and infectious diseases are not or

47
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:30.410
worried about protecting people who, uh, have these compromised immune systems,

48
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.370
but it's not most people, you know, the,

49
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:37.050
the vast majority of people that are gonna get this are not,

50
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:38.130
it's not gonna be fatal.

51
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.210
We have to figure out how to protect the people that are high risk,

52
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.890
but to quarantine the whole country.

53
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.000
It just seems like maybe it was a good move to do initially,

54
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.240
but we can't sustain that. So now we have to figure out how to move forward.

55
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.480
And there's all these protests all over California. Now,

56
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.120
I'm sure you've seen it in the orange county and Huntington beach and there's

57
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.600
counties in Northern California that are like, we're opening up everything.

58
00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:04.680
We're gonna open up restaurants. We're opening up bars.

59
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.600
We're going back to business. Texas is basically back to business.

60
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.920
Montana is doing the same. And you know, they have a,

61
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.600
a modified approach to dealing this and we're gonna have to figure it out on the

62
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.110
long way, but I just don't want us to lose. I,

63
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.470
I don't want us to lose any people,

64
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.870
but I certainly don't want us to lose restaurants either.

65
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.390
I don't want us to lose bars. I don't want us to lose comedy clubs.

66
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.310
I don't want us to lose small businesses that are by.

67
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.470
<v 0>What you're gonna look like. I mean, here we are like, you know,</v>

68
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.470
you talk about a comedy club. Like how do you even like,

69
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.500
I don't six feet apart and then doesn't make sense.

70
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:42.460
There's a certain energy in the room. Like what type of world do we have?

71
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.700
You know, in front of us, the way it's slated right now. Right? We.

72
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.340
<v 1>Don't even know what kind of government overreach are we gonna have where people</v>

73
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.820
gonna come in and police this, you know, like what, I mean,

74
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:55.460
there's no real science to that either. By the way, you know,

75
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:58.420
they have a bunch of people jammed into a room, whether six feet apart or not,

76
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.610
you're touching things, you're breathing on each other. I mean, I don't,

77
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.170
I don't know. I, I think you should allow people to do what they wanna do.

78
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.691
You know,

79
00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:11.450
if it gets to a certain point where we have some sort of a viable cure or

80
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.770
a treatment, like there's this, um, what is that stuff called again?

81
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:19.650
This antiviral medication that Dr. Fauci has been REMS. Dere.

82
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:23.880
Yeah. REM DVIR say it. I mean, boy, we're,

83
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:24.920
we're hoping for that. Right.

84
00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:28.240
We're hoping that there's some sort of a treatment where it's not a death

85
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.360
sentence for people, even with immune compromised systems. So, I mean,

86
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.233
I just, uh,

87
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.240
I feel so bad for people like you and for all the people out there that own

88
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:44.270
these amazing restaurants that it's one of my favorite things to do is to go to

89
00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:47.230
a nice restaurant and it would be, and for me to.

90
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.110
<v 0>Go to work &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

91
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.790
<v 1>Yes. It'd be such a shame if, because of this,</v>

92
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.110
this pandemic, all that goes away. I mean,

93
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.950
and what kind of a buildup are we looking at to try to bring those places back?

94
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.243
Yeah.

95
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.340
<v 0>I, you know, I don't have the answers, you know, for me, um, you know.</v>

96
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.660
<v 1>What can be done if you had a magic wand,</v>

97
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.460
what would you do if someone said, Adam, fix this.

98
00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.460
<v 0>It's difficult for me because, you know, I hear your point,</v>

99
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.290
but I have just such great empathy for are, you know,

100
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:27.050
people that would get sick just by someone else's negligence. Yeah. And,

101
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.650
and for me, so that, it's a bit of a tussle here because, you know,

102
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.690
I wanna just, you know,

103
00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:37.650
on one hand you have like an economy that is just tanking and businesses that

104
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.730
are gonna go out of, you know, business. But then on the other hand, you know,

105
00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:44.400
you have people that are defenseless. Um,

106
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.120
some people that look healthy, fantastic, you know, like a friend,

107
00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:52.120
like 45 years old goes in, then they're on a ventilator and it's just like,

108
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.560
you can't give the answers. Right.

109
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.600
I don't know if I'm even prepared to give you a summary on it. I, I,

110
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.000
I haven't formulated in my brain the way that I've just been coping and that's

111
00:06:03.001 --> 00:06:07.680
all I'm just trying to hold on. Um, and you know, for me,

112
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.080
I'm just trying to put faith in the fact that people have to eat and people like

113
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.920
you really want to have restaurants around and in the end,

114
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:17.590
we're gonna find our way.

115
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.510
And the only way I know to get through this is just to head down and work and be

116
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.230
really helpful to people that are in need and be there for the community and

117
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:31.710
feed them. But outside of that, you know, I,

118
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.560
I don't know God, like if I had the, I, I don't know how to answer you.

119
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.840
<v 1>Yeah. Nobody knows. That's, what's crazy.</v>

120
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.400
<v 0>Is even if I was in control, I mean, you know, because I,</v>

121
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.840
I don't want people to die unnecessarily by people's negligence,

122
00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.080
but on the other hand, uh.

123
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.520
<v 1>I just don't know. Well,</v>

124
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:53.800
it's such an incredibly messy situation with no clear cut answer because of the

125
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:56.880
fact that you do have these people that are seemingly healthy 35 year old people

126
00:06:56.881 --> 00:07:00.310
that are getting dying and it doesn't make sense. And then you have, you know,

127
00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:03.510
you hear, oh guy, world war II veteran, a hundred, two years old beats COVID.

128
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.550
Yeah. You know, like you see that too. So it's like, what,

129
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.630
how do I think about this? Do I think about it? Like the common cold?

130
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:13.470
Do I think about it? Like the flu? Do I think about it?

131
00:07:13.471 --> 00:07:17.990
Like some new thing that we, I mean, everyone is unsure. I,

132
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.140
and that's what makes I think.

133
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.500
<v 0>The key is strange us to get the VA, you know, a vaccine as quick as possible,</v>

134
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.700
you know, so that we can get it, you know, um,

135
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.860
at least have some type of defense mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, for this, um,

136
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:32.260
because, and I don't know how long that's gonna take people,

137
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.380
like are talking a ridiculous amount of time.

138
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.010
<v 1>But, well, it takes a long time to develop a vaccine correctly mean they're,</v>

139
00:07:39.011 --> 00:07:41.010
they're going through a bunch of trials right now. Um,

140
00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:45.490
we've talked about it before. There's several ongoing, including ones with, uh,

141
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.890
human beings that they're testing the vaccine on. There was a woman in Seattle,

142
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.290
she was the first ever, uh, person to receive this coronavirus vaccine there.

143
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.330
They did a story on her and they're monitoring her, you know,

144
00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.610
what does look cause.

145
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.960
<v 0>That's the only way for us to be sure. Yes. I mean, because responsibly, I mean,</v>

146
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:05.080
even just people coming into the restaurant, like, don't get me wrong.

147
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.720
I want the business and I wanna have a bar that's bustling. I wanna have a vibe.

148
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.240
I want people to be happy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; well fed enjoy themselves, but.

149
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.360
<v 1>You know, not be nervous, not be nervous,</v>

150
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:17.920
someone coughs and everybody freaks out. Yeah. Servers.

151
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.070
<v 0>Have mask on. So all of a sudden we can't have music cuz people can't hear,</v>

152
00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.670
you know, the server and there's, you know?

153
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.310
<v 1>Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Nobody used to give a, they would shake hands. It's weird.</v>

154
00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:31.630
You see people shake hands in a movie now and you're like, oh,

155
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:32.464
what are you doing?

156
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.150
<v 0>I know it's you can just get twitchy.</v>

157
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.630
<v 1>About it. You know? So yeah, it happens so quickly too. That's, what's weird.</v>

158
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.860
Like the, the whole world shift so rapidly and um,

159
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.780
people like you are the ones. I mean,

160
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:46.780
obviously the people that get hit the hardest of the people,

161
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.340
a with the disease and B that work with people with the disease, right?

162
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.300
The people that are, that have the disease and then the,

163
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.760
the first responders and hospital workers and,

164
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.240
and all the different people that work to help those people. They're,

165
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:02.400
they're the most devastated by this,

166
00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:07.600
but there are so many small businesses right now that are in this position that

167
00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:09.600
you're in, where there's so much uncertainty.

168
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.480
<v 0>Is the key is gonna be the rent game. I mean, at the end of the day, um,</v>

169
00:09:13.481 --> 00:09:17.310
for a lot of these business, that it's, the looming factor is, is being on,

170
00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.270
on the hook. You know, not,

171
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:23.790
not only just to make rent the following month with a compromised, uh, um,

172
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:27.750
you know, 50% occupancy. You know, if you can imagine, you know,

173
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:28.910
if you're paying rent for that, you know,

174
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:32.830
you have a model in terms of how much income, you know, someone brought out the,

175
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.100
the, the possibility of like, I, of, you know, forgiving the rent,

176
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:40.860
taking the rent and putting it on the back end of it. So right now,

177
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.500
essentially the, for the three months, you're not,

178
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.220
you don't need to pay the rent,

179
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.180
but you'll be add on three months to the end of your lease. Mm. You know,

180
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:55.850
that for me, makes sense. But for us to turn around and, you know,

181
00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:58.250
work at, you know, 10, 15% capacity,

182
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:02.050
and then all of a sudden get a bill for six figures, say, okay, you owe this.

183
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.210
So who's gonna, who's gonna fill my shoes. Like,

184
00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:06.890
so if I can't make it at my location,

185
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.410
who's gonna come along and take on that ran anyway, nobody's gonna do it.

186
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.530
So they're stuck. We're stuck. What are we gonna do?
