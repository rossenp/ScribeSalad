00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.853
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 2>You told me he got you up on a show. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.700
<v 1>Um, at, and it's like I said, I melted it. Like, what's the guy, man,</v>

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.450
the flying Jew. That's on his show. Lee and it,

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.890
I remember the first time I did it,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.980
I was looking at him and Lee had a li a light maybes for these little

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.180
stars of death, little tree edibles here, eight, like for them. And,

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.200
and, and I'm looking, and he's literally over there melted

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.910
his eyes, opened it. I looked over, I all laid. It was like,

10
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.940
it was like a blob of a person over there. So I'm like, okay,

11
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:43.560
I'm never going to be like that on this show. Oh. A year later,

12
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.450
I'm literally in there. And he was like, ah, you know, eat,

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.770
do I eat,

14
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.470
eat edible? And I'm sitting there.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.180
And I thought I was talking pretty regular at

16
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:05.020
first. And then all of a sudden I noticed that it's like, oh, I don't,

17
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:09.240
I don't think I'm speaking correctly. Like, and like, and he was like, no,

18
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.750
you up, you got, you got, got you. And I'm like, I got you.

19
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.290
I'm like, no, I don't. I don't, I don't think. And I'm looking at it.

20
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.790
I'm looking at Lee is like, yo wasted. Yeah.

21
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.880
I'm like, yeah, man. And so when I looked back and I was like, yo,

22
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:31.380
I was so up and I didn't even eat. I ate another edible, but the star,

23
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:35.580
he gave me that star. And this was this.

24
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.530
When people learn about me, I'm when I lose, I lose when I win,

25
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:45.420
I win. But I'm never embarrassed to say without a wimped out on some.

26
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.970
So I had,

27
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.320
I was already messing with these mushrooms. I was on mushrooms.

28
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.610
And then he gives me this star. And I'm like,

29
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.660
I told myself, I'm gonna eat it. I mean, he just started, let me just stop.

30
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.060
But I kept thinking about what other people was telling me.

31
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.040
Don't eat the death star, don't eat the star. And I'm like, oh no,

32
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.540
I'm gonna eat it, Joe. Ain't gonna punk me out.

33
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.340
So I'm staying at the lows.

34
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.040
And I literally stash the star at the

35
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.450
Lowe's in this, in, in the room. I'm like, whoa. When somebody find this,

36
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.030
they're going to have a good time. I'm not going to have this on me.

37
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.850
And then I stashed the mushrooms inside the hotels.

38
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:32.940
And what's a maintenance man probably found them and had a good time.

39
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:34.860
Like I was, I was wasted.

40
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.000
<v 0>The too much, those stars. He's given them to me, the 250 milligrams.</v>

41
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.470
That's too much. I seen Joey for those 4,000 milligrams. Like it's nothing.

42
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.250
We want to play him once.

43
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.790
And he had these Cheeba chews. I forget how many milligrams.

44
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.240
They were several hundred milligrams to, he pops to Cheeba chews.

45
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.190
I'm nervous just sitting next to him. I'm like, are you, he's like Joe Rogan,

46
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.520
come on. It's time to dance with the devil. So we're on the plane.

47
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.340
In the middle of the plane ride. He runs over. He grabs me.

48
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.180
He touched me with Joe Rogan. I almost had a packet that I almost,

49
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.300
I almost couldn't do it. I almost couldn't do it. He goes, but I'm fine.

50
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.990
And then he pulls out two more stars at death and throws them. And I'm like, no,

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.970
it was ha like, so he almost had a panic attack. And then two hours later,

52
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.820
we were on the way to New York, grabs me by the shoulder and tells me,

53
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:29.500
and then pops two more. Oh, he doesn't give a. He goes to the basement.

54
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.960
He goes right down there. He wants to see what's in the corners.

55
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.433
What's the.

56
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.080
<v 1>I don't, I don't even understand how he could do so many edible.</v>

57
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.940
I don't even strange. He had a, what did he try to give you this dude? Um,

58
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.190
an opioid it's like, I got the last two biscuits. I got this copy myself.

59
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.773
I was like,

60
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.330
[inaudible] like I said, how do you even have them too?

61
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.130
It's like the last two biscuits biscuits.

62
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.470
I was like, yo crazy.
