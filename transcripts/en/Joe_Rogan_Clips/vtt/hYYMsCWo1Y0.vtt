00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.840
<v 1>Yeah. So let's, let's get going. Um, so taking it from the top, let's,</v>

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.840
let's discuss, give us your take on how we got here, because this is, uh,

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.080
it's been very strange, obviously, uh,

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.190
the president completely miscalculated what was gonna happen and the way he was

6
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:22.270
explaining it to the news,

7
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.190
he was kind of saying that it was just a few cases and they'll be gone.

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.750
And now obviously New York city shut down.

9
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.830
The entire country is separated from each other.

10
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.910
Everybody is isolating at home. Give us your take on how we got here.

11
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.030
<v 2>Well, you know, the, the truth is, uh,</v>

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.940
we knew this was coming or something like it. We had a head up and, and,

13
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.660
and even a, even a heads up before last year,

14
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.740
because this is now our third major coronavirus disaster of

15
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.060
the 21st century. We had, uh, what's called SAR,

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.300
severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003,

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.940
that started in China and caused a terrible epidemic in Toronto.

18
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.970
It actually took the, uh, the rolling stones to do a concert,

19
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.170
to bring the economy back to Toronto in 2003.

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.970
And then it was mayor's coronavirus infection in, uh, 2012.

21
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.130
And this is the third one.

22
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.850
So we actually realized that coronaviruses were gonna become a new thing.

23
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:22.960
And we embarked on a big coronavirus vaccine program a decade ago.

24
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.300
And, um,

25
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.040
and each time they've caused devastating hospital epidemics they've affected

26
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:30.080
healthcare workers. So, uh,

27
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.400
the point is this unfortunately has become a new normal for the globe is

28
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.680
terrible coronavirus, uh, epidemics. And, uh,

29
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.950
we saw this one coming up in, at the end of 2019 in China. And,

30
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.790
uh, I knew we were in for trouble because that's what coronaviruses do.

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.670
<v 1>So you knew that we were gonna be in trouble because there was no way they could</v>

32
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:54.190
contain it and keep it in China.

33
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.950
<v 2>Well, the, the difference with this one, uh, compared to the other two,</v>

34
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:03.660
was this the other two SARS and mayors. Now we call this new one, saw ours two.

35
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.260
So the were SARS one, then mayors, then SARS two.

36
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.660
So both SARS one and mayors made you so sick and had such

37
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.340
a high case fatality rate that anybody who got it was almost immediately

38
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.260
hospitalized. And basically out of the community, the,

39
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.170
the difference with this one, ironically, is it, as it's pretty lethal,

40
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:29.730
it's about five to 10 times more lethal than regular flu seasonal flu.

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.090
Uh, but also there's a big group of people who don't get very sick at all.

42
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.810
And so you have this sort of perfect mix where it's not the most

43
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.610
lethal infection we've ever seen.

44
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.240
It's not the most transmi infection we've ever seen,

45
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:49.800
but it's high enough in both categories that it combines in this very toxic way.

46
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.600
So what you have is you have a group of people who are getting very sick are in

47
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:56.600
the intensive care unit, like older people,

48
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.920
those with diabetes and hypertension,

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.480
even a group of younger people who are getting it very sick,

50
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.200
and then a larger group who are only getting mildly sick,

51
00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:10.640
who could still walk around the community and be out and about in stores and

52
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.320
restaurants and infecting everybody. And so this is what's caused the problem.

53
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.150
Uh, it's a, it's highly transmissible, big group of people walking around,

54
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:23.590
spreading it and a smaller subset,

55
00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.910
but a big subset who are getting very sick and even dying in intensive care

56
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:31.230
units. So that's, what's playing out in New York city right now, for instance.

57
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.950
<v 1>Do we know why so many people are asymptomatic?</v>

58
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.340
<v 2>We don't, uh, we really don't, uh, there's a rough, uh,</v>

59
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.580
correlation with age. So younger people seem to do better.

60
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.500
And actually kids seem to do really well with this infection. They don't,

61
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:49.700
they don't get with, with one exception that I'll tell you about in a minute.

62
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.540
Most kids don't get very sick at all,

63
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.740
but they're helping with the community spread. And, and we don't, uh,

64
00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:58.260
quite know why also, but something that's very important.

65
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.450
And one of the reasons why, uh,

66
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.570
I really wanted to come on and talk to you about COVID is we there's this

67
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.730
buzz out there in the community that it's only old people that are getting

68
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.530
sick and dying and going to ICUs. But in fact,

69
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.570
the centers for disease control came out with this very chilling document a few

70
00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:18.404
weeks ago,

71
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.480
showing that about a third of the very sick people in the hospital are under

72
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.800
the age of 40 or 44.

73
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.800
So between 20 and 44 young adults are getting very sick and that word

74
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.440
has not gotten out adequately because when the infect disinfection first

75
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.640
appeared in central China,

76
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.600
it was all about older individuals over the age of 70.

77
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.150
Those were diabetes and hypertension, and we didn't hear about the young adults,

78
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.550
but then for reasons that we don't understand,

79
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:50.190
we saw this big group in Italy and France, uh,

80
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:53.550
in Spain of younger adults. And we're seeing that play out in the us.

81
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.670
And I know, and on the people who, you know, listen to you and watch you,

82
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.230
you know, it's a big group between that age of 20 and 44,

83
00:05:00.231 --> 00:05:04.020
and they really need to a year that they're at risk for severe illness,

84
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:05.180
despite what they might have heard.

85
00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.220
<v 1>Previously. Well, we have a friend, uh, Michael yo,</v>

86
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.700
who was actually on a podcast with me the week before he went to New York.

87
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:16.140
He was there that weekend actually. And that's when he got it.

88
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.860
So he got COVID 19 in Manhattan and then flew back

89
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.930
sick. And here's what's really, maybe you could help me with this. Uh,

90
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.170
he said he was feeling terrible and then took Advil and it

91
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.130
got exponentially worse. Is that coincidental? Do you think, I mean, there's,

92
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:40.810
there's been talks of avoiding ibuprofen. Michael's 45 years old,

93
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.800
very healthy, robust guy. So when he was, I mean,

94
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.640
he was in the hospital for a week and his words were, I almost died. I mean,

95
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:54.440
he was really, really concerned. What, what about, what about an ibuprofen?

96
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:56.561
<v 2>So, uh,</v>

97
00:05:56.561 --> 00:06:00.240
there's been a lot of buzz on the internet about ibuprofen and then the world

98
00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:04.600
health organization came out with a specific statement saying those are rumors.

99
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.360
So there's not a lot of evidence to say that you get worse with ibuprofen.

100
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.840
Probably he was just one of those young adults. That's gonna get very sick.

101
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:15.240
And that's what this virus does.

102
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.110
It has the ability to get deep into the pulmonary system in your lungs,

103
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.790
binds to receptors on the cells of your lungs and causes a terrible

104
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.750
pneumonia. And on top of it, you get a big inflammatory response. So it really,

105
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.950
uh, can, uh, it's a severe pneumonia could even prevent your ability to breathe.

106
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.780
And that's why so many people who are getting really sick with this virus have

107
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:38.780
to go on respirators.

108
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.780
<v 1>That's exactly what happened to Michael. He got pneumonia. Um,</v>

109
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.860
so there's is that there's a rumor that you shouldn't

110
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.820
take ibuprofen, but is that unfounded?

111
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.460
Are you advising people to take ibuprofen?

112
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.100
Do you think they should just avoid it just in case and where did this rumor

113
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:58.890
start from and what, what is the concern with ibuprofen?

114
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.530
<v 2>And then, and then you've got the problem. You know, some people, uh, you know,</v>

115
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.210
also say don't take aspirin because if this is a respiratory virus infection,

116
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.090
there could be a severe reaction, uh, with, with aspirin as well. So for now,

117
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.450
uh, you know, and, uh, I said, the other thing, Joe is anything we say today,

118
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.480
uh, I might look like the biggest idiot in the world tomorrow or next week.

119
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.960
And that's because this is a brand new virus and we've never seen before, right?

120
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:27.400
So we're on a steep learning curve.

121
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.560
So we're learning new things about this virus, uh, every day. So that's why, uh,

122
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:34.400
you know, so many things I'm gonna say today,

123
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.350
if I sound like I'm waffling or hedging, it's it's because I am, uh, uh, we, we,

124
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.830
we're learning so much, that's new about this virus.

125
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:47.070
So it's really important that everybody be really mindful and pay attention

126
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.430
to real health information that, uh, that from accurate sources,

127
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.710
because things move, things change. As we learn more about this,

128
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:59.540
this is a virus that we didn't even know existed about four months

129
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.100
ago. And, um, we've learned about an incredible period of time.

130
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.940
The Chinese put up a lot of information on these pre-print servers about what

131
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.340
the virus is, what the sequence is, the genetic code,

132
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.540
what the receptor binds to when we had the original SAR,

133
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.860
we call this new one SARS too, the COVID 19. So the VI,

134
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:19.020
the disease is called COVID.

135
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.130
The virus is called SARS two SARS coronavirus two.

136
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.010
When we had the original SARS one,

137
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:27.770
it took us over a year to learn all that information.

138
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.690
Now everything's been compressed in a few weeks, so it's really extraordinary,

139
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.770
but there's still so much, so much we're learning right now.

140
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.570
<v 1>That I'm so glad you brought that up,</v>

141
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:40.720
cuz that is really important for people to understand people that maybe haven't

142
00:08:40.721 --> 00:08:44.240
looked into the complications that are involved in trying to recognize

143
00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:48.960
treatments and cures for a virus that it is it's you everyone's learning.

144
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.600
<v 2>Yeah. And also, you know,</v>

145
00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.000
and everything we have known so far about the virus is what happened in China.

146
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.720
And it turns out that Chinese are,

147
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.560
have some genetic differences to Europeans and, and Americans and,

148
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.160
and things can change depending on, it's not just the pathogen.

149
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.400
It's also what we call the host, the person too. So the fact, you know,

150
00:09:10.401 --> 00:09:15.350
that the virus affected young adults in Europe and the us S in

151
00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:20.230
a way that did not necessarily occur in China, uh, is important. And so we,

152
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:20.831
or keep we,

153
00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:24.470
and then who knows what happens when this virus goes into Latin America or

154
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.030
India, or Sub-Saharan Africa. It may,

155
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:29.830
and it's not because the virus is mutating necessarily.

156
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.630
It's just that there's also the host component as well,

157
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.910
which is quite important.

158
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.980
<v 1>Well, that's of the, uh,</v>

159
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.340
issues that people are having in terms of blood type there's,

160
00:09:39.341 --> 00:09:41.620
there's all this talk of certain blood types,

161
00:09:41.621 --> 00:09:45.300
maybe more susceptible to the virus, particularly blood type a.

162
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.380
<v 2>Yeah, well actually, um,</v>

163
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.540
this is actually well known in the infectious disease literature there. I mean,

164
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:54.820
there's a whole, I put one up on Twitter, I think a week or so ago.

165
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.610
Uh there's you know, dozens of different pathogens,

166
00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:03.450
both including viruses and bacteria that behave differently depending on a

167
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:08.130
person's blood type. So host genetics influences things quite a bit.

168
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.360
<v 3>I.</v>
