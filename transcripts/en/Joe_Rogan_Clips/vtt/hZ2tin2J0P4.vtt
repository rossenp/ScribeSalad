00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.853
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 2>I remember when I'm doing this podcast and he found out that I</v>

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.490
actually knew Moses Malone, like no Moses Malone.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.000
How do you know Moses Malone? Um, most of the longest, like, uh,

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.350
very before he passed. So the,

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.090
the first guy who ever, um, invested in my career,

7
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:26.790
his name is Anthony Colbert. And he, um,

8
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.430
he was the first people to sign Destiny's child. They had,

9
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:32.550
he had a music company with mobile. It's called Mo music.

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.840
And he had been friends with mold for years.

11
00:00:36.841 --> 00:00:39.270
So he would mold would be at his office all the time.

12
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.860
And we was in the same building.

13
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:45.120
I worked for this record label called key players. I was the record pool.

14
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.540
I gave all the DJs, they records. So I would organize records,

15
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.000
give them out to DJs. When I first came home.

16
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.880
So Moses would be downstairs and with Colbert and

17
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.200
he introduced me to Moses.

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.920
<v 0>And so after that, Moses would always recognize me.</v>

19
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.730
So then one day Moses, like yo H

20
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.120
Cohen don't want to go to lunch. He ain't got time. You going to go lunch?

21
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to lunch with Moses alone.

22
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.180
It's this strip club called treasures. He loved going to

23
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.290
in Houston called charges, chief,

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.210
best buffet in town, best buffet in town. I'm like, huh?

25
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.730
This is the best buffet in town lane. Are we,

26
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.000
are we going to show club? We going to eat, this is the best buffet in Thai.

27
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:39.960
You understand what I'm saying to you?

28
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.720
I go in it's my first time ever having food, going to a strip club for food.

29
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:49.870
I'm like, oh, okay. So eating there. And the buffet is a huge buffet.

30
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.660
Like a chef it's lit up. It looked like a cafeteria, the little lamps,

31
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.060
but it's all these naked women in here, you know? I'm like, oh, okay.

32
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.460
So you like, you like crab with your crab. He was like, man, um, look here now.

33
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:06.380
This is the buffet I say.

34
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.650
So we all get about is the buffet or is the strip club? So it's another,

35
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.790
it's a male strip club called a bear in Houston. I said, so

36
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.880
all the men is here.

37
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.780
If this buffet was in LaBear,

38
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.720
would you go, well, hell no, I wouldn't go. I said,

39
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.430
it's not the best buffet in town. It's got with this buffet.

40
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:31.830
This is what is important about this buffet.

41
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.460
Because if it was penis with the buffet, you wouldn't go eat the buffet.

42
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.150
He was like, yeah, pretty much correct. And that's how me and Moses got tight,

43
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.480
argued about treasures in the buffet and known him ever since.

44
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.670
So when he passed, I was at his funeral and we used to talk all the time.

45
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.300
I've been mad at Moses one time, over a motorcycle seat.

46
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.100
And this is when you can't.

47
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.740
I learned that you really can't tell people what to do with they,

48
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.190
they own money. Ali, you funny, man. You funny? If I say, well,

49
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.010
why don't you invest in my career? How much you need,

50
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.830
how much you need leave about $5,000 to get, you know,

51
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.720
press kit and all this other stuff done.

52
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.800
Moses totally ignored me after that. Right?

53
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.060
Eight months later, randomly talking me, him, Colbert, Luke,

54
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.750
randomly talking. He's telling him about that.

55
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:26.140
He replaced the seat on his motorcycle

56
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.350
just because in the seat cost him $5,000. And I am.

57
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.590
Like he has no idea why I've even made. I'm like,

58
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.480
so you a motorcycle seat. It's like, yeah.

59
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.170
I just walked out and slammed the door. He was like, you know, he mad at you.

60
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.200
Cause he asked you to give him $5,000 to further his career.

61
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.010
And you didn't never say anything. So what do you made about,

62
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.670
cause you just spent $5 on a motorcycle seat that you didn't have to change and

63
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:56.560
you could have helped them. He was like, well.

64
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.900
I can't tell them how to spend my money.

65
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.930
It's like he got an alligator motorcycle seat with an M on it.

66
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.953
<v 1>All. I get.</v>

67
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.620
<v 0>Nice seat. I sounds good, but I want it. I get it.</v>

68
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.800
<v 1>You know, in retrospect though,</v>

69
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.460
you happy that you didn't get the money from him.

70
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.270
<v 0>I'm excited.</v>

71
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.980
I was because I think that it would have probably changed how we interacted.

72
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.210
<v 1>For sure. You know?</v>

73
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.430
<v 0>And you know, it's, it's, it's things that as an adult, you know,</v>

74
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.670
why you don't, you understand why you didn't get it as a comic. You have,

75
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.340
you definitely have to understand that as a comic. Cause you know how we are,

76
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.650
I'm not getting something right.

77
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.900
And we feel like we've been rejected or pushed to the side and then you

78
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.850
start some kind of start getting better.

79
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.670
Cause they feel like other people getting other opportunities for sometime it's

80
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:49.030
not for you in that particular space. It's been,

81
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.830
it's been shows that haven't been for me and I've been

82
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.890
cool with it. Then there's been shows that I thought that wasn't for me,

83
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.083
that I got off.

84
00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.680
<v 1>We have the benefit of hindsight.</v>

85
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.640
You have the benefit of becoming successful and then looking back and go, oh,

86
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:04.960
all those things that went wrong.

87
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:08.350
That's probably good because you develop more character,

88
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.300
you understand the business better and reaching out for someone to help you.

89
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.810
It rarely really helps you. You think it's gonna help you,

90
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.750
but it's gonna your relationship with that person because you're gonna have to

91
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:22.420
pay them back quickly. And you're probably not going to be able to. Yeah.

92
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.340
And then it's also gonna,

93
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:27.610
you're gonna know that you had to borrow money from somebody, you know,

94
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.030
when you know, you just did it yourself. It's like, you have a piece,

95
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.820
like I'm a self-made man. You can look at it that way.

96
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.710
<v 0>And be easy. And who wants to be around like,</v>

97
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.800
yo you see right there, you know, I made it right.

98
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.820
Like that would be the worst. Yeah. So my poverty, yo, so you know,

99
00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:52.720
Joe Rogan, right? I'm the, I'm the one that gave him all this to start.
