00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. No idea.</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 1>Yeah. I was, um,</v>

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.820
talking to a Neil deGrasse Tyson the other day and he was trying to explain to

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.260
me, um, uh, escape, velocity, like any,

5
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:18.360
he takes my shoe. He goes, let me see your shoe.

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.660
And he takes my shoe and he goes, now, if I throw this up in the air,

7
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:24.810
it's going to come down. But if I throw it hard enough,

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.180
it will escape the pole of the gravity of the earth. And once it's free,

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.790
it'll go on forever. You see it? That was cool.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.350
Yeah. Like you try to like, put that in your head, like, wait a minute.

11
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.090
What goes on.

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.600
<v 0>Forever? Isn't that the problem now this guy, this is great too.</v>

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.080
Just dummies talking. Isn't this, the problem with the moon.

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
Is that not the problem with the moon, but if you jump on the moon,

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.910
you can escape the escape. Like it's easier to get out of the escape philosophy.

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.720
The moon. No.

17
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.700
<v 1>It's one six horse gravity. Oh really?</v>

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.130
<v 0>Yeah. I thought we sat on the moon. You could like show him.</v>

19
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.050
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no. You can, theoretically,</v>

20
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
you can jump higher. And if you believe in NASA, bro,

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.520
there's some videos of guys jumping around on the moon. Yeah.

22
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.440
The problem with the videos of people on the moon is that there are videos

23
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.630
that look 100% fake,

24
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.770
but guys fall forward and looks like they get yanked up by wires.

25
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
There's a lot of video that looks fake as. I don't know if it's fake.

26
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.020
I don't know if it just looked fake because it's one, six, the earth gravity.

27
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:33.300
And we don't know what that really looks like until you see it play out.

28
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.110
But there's some videos of guys falling down face first and getting yanked back

29
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:38.730
up. It looks like a yanked by cords.

30
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.620
<v 0>Have you seen that picture? That thing that looks at Jamie.</v>

31
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:42.840
<v 2>Can we talk about this last time?</v>

32
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
Some people send in videos of NFL players doing the exact same thing in the end

33
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.370
zone.

34
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.550
<v 1>Yeah. Super athletes. Three or four guys doing throw their body,</v>

35
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:53.760
but they don't have a giant pack on their back. And when I'm wearing helmets,

36
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:57.090
they're wearing helmets that light compared to what the astronauts are wearing.

37
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.720
Dude astronauts have like one set of a suit that keeps them one second.

38
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.030
<v 0>True. But it's the concept is the suit. If there,</v>

39
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.430
the concept is they're not even on the moon and then that suit,

40
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.450
it could just be paper money.

41
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.140
<v 1>But some of the ones where they're pitched completely forward and they just go</v>

42
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:13.080
badly. What it is, let me find it right now. Yeah. I would love to see it.

43
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.033
That's interesting.

44
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.010
<v 0>So you, you're still wavering on whether we went to the mint.</v>

45
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.870
<v 1>Uh, more weight I'm too dumb and uneducated to really know. Right.</v>

46
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:25.920
But I am wavering more on the possibility that some of the footage was faked.

47
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.450
<v 2>It's a five second video. So it's like no ahead. But yeah. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.190
<v 1>Boom. That is not the same thing, Jamie,</v>

49
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.850
I can do that super similar though. I can do that.

50
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.400
That guy goes to I'll do that right now. Find another one.

51
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:45.750
The guy goes to his knees and then uses his momentum, the popup from his knees.

52
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.960
I've.

53
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.900
<v 0>Seen some, that looked pretty crazy though, man.</v>

54
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.790
<v 1>That's ridiculous. The moon ones are way more.</v>

55
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.960
<v 0>Preposterous in that better examples in that they're.</v>

56
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.570
<v 1>Super athletes.</v>

57
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
What they're doing is springing up and you can see the kinetic energy from their

58
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:01.870
legs. It's forcing them up. They're super athlete, right? They,

59
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.930
they show off those guys do backflips and all the time. They're,

60
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.410
they're physically capable of doing things that a normal person can't do,

61
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.930
but they're not physically capable of defying physics.

62
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.500
What you're seeing in a lot of those moon videos looks like someone's defying

63
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.790
physics they pitch for and they bounce back up. I think they shot a bunch of.

64
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.620
And I think some of the video,

65
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.320
if you're going into space and you're experiencing deep radiation,

66
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:25.570
the van Allen radiation belts, and from the sun,

67
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.660
you can't even go through the x-ray machine at the airport,

68
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.660
the old x-ray machines with film, they wouldn't let you,

69
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.180
because if you went through with Phil, it would kill your film.

70
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.670
So how are they getting these perfect videos and photos?

71
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.410
And none of them are up by radiation.

72
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.500
It's entirely possible that they did go to the moon,

73
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.120
but they faked a bunch of the film footage because they wanted to have something

74
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.450
and they couldn't really bring anything back. It's entirely possible.

75
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.140
There's fake footage from the Russians. 100% is a precedent.

76
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.150
The footage of Eureka Garren when he's circling the earth for the first time.

77
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:01.060
And he goes into a rocket and the first guy in space, it's fake as.

78
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.390
He's inside this tiny little compartment and all of a sudden there's,

79
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.240
they've got room in there for a camera. Get the outta here.

80
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.670
You see a light source this way and a light source.

81
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.220
That way he's got dueling shadows behind him.

82
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.660
Cause they got lights set up in there.

83
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.400
Cause they're filming him inside this capsule. No, he shot up in the space.

84
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.570
He really did do it,

85
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.440
but they couldn't fit a bad camera in his tiny little capsule.

86
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.980
It's there's no room. So they just faked it after the fact make sense.

87
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.620
Of course it makes sense. A lot of money. There was no internet.

88
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:34.000
Back then there was no VHS tapes back then they broadcast something on TV.

89
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:36.400
As far as their eyes and their mind goes.

90
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.980
That was the only time people are going to see it. Right.

91
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.530
All they have to do is show it to you once. Pull it off.

92
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.570
Nobody ever imagined you'd be able to pull it up on your phone or two stoners

93
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:49.150
like you and me would be watching on a podcast.

94
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.440
You can find the video of Urunga Garren from inside his, uh,

95
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.710
what would you call those things? Pods. Pods. Would you call it?

96
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.540
You're a Garren in space. You watch it. You go get the out of here.

97
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.370
You watch it and you go, what? That is fake. That is not him or this.

98
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.540
Not him in space. Rather see your nose and blast off

99
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.300
[inaudible] areas is getting on the bus. Buses, headache space.

100
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.350
I can't believe it. Your show me, where are you? Right? Seasoned. Look at that.

101
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.150
Back it up. That was it. That's it. Watch this.

102
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.210
Are we good? We're good. We're on a Starbuck. Here we go. And turn off.

103
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.970
Look at the lights you see, hold up, back up, back up, back up. Stop. Pause it.

104
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.390
Leave the shadows. Shout out to the left. Shout out to the right.

105
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.200
His lights in front of him. They had lights in there.

106
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.890
He's in his tiny little cat. This tiny little pod. How's it lit up.

107
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.140
No, maybe they just have, I don't want, I mean, just don't windows.

108
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.530
Why couldn't they have lights in there Joe? Cause they got no room.

109
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:57.770
How did it seems.

110
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.603
<v 0>Like there's enough room.</v>

111
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.040
<v 1>They don't have lights back then these candles campfire.</v>

112
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.023
There's a campfire in there.

113
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.300
<v 2>I saw a few breakdowns of the moon landing too. That said it would be way, way,</v>

114
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.060
way harder to fake it back then than it would have been to actually just.

115
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.800
<v 1>I read that too. Yeah, I've heard that too,</v>

116
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.260
but I don't think we're talking about faking, going to the moon.

117
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.070
You're not understanding what I'm saying. We're talking about faking footage,

118
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.230
not talking about faking, going to the moon.

119
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.660
I think they probably did go to the moon,

120
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.110
but I would imagine that at least some of the footage you're seeing is

121
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.560
horseshit.

122
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.730
<v 2>It was uh, from what I,</v>

123
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.470
I wasn't obviously alive then it was like a 140 minute live stream. Right?

124
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.753
So that's.

125
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.840
<v 1>No, no it's not. No, if you, if you just have people in orbit,</v>

126
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.370
it wouldn't be hard to fake. Look, I think it'd be harder to go there.

127
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.610
There would be to fake it. I think going there,

128
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.940
if they did go there and I think they probably did was an unbelievably difficult

129
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.340
thing to do, but like faking that they were there. How hard would that be? Like,

130
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.090
like after the fact like filming footage or filming footage of them in orbit is.

131
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.840
<v 2>The part you can't. I would have been a mile of film.</v>

132
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.730
<v 0>Joe. It's really interesting. Why.</v>

133
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.210
<v 1>Do you know that all that missing? You know,</v>

134
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.070
all the original footage is missing. That's.

135
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.560
<v 0>The weirdest thing. All the man. Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.470
<v 1>I mean, I know you do and you being skeptical guy. I looked it up, but look,</v>

137
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.740
it's missing. Remember when that only that you know what else is missing?

138
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.723
The telemetry data,

139
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.240
all the ones and zeros that show the location of the capsule,

140
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.770
whatever the it is on the waist. I thought.

141
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.510
<v 2>I read, they still have that data.</v>

142
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.260
That just the original paper it was on or the original magnetic tapes got reused

143
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:31.094
because they didn't.

144
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.380
<v 1>Okay. Well, why would you say that? Unless you just,</v>

145
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.630
why don't just Google it and find out that that's what I read. I read.

146
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.463
<v 2>One last time.</v>

147
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.580
<v 1>What'd you read?</v>

148
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.150
<v 2>I read that that the original tapes got written over because they needed the</v>

149
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:43.280
magnetic tape because there was a shortage at some point.

150
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.110
<v 1>In time. So, but still.</v>

151
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.670
<v 2>But the data is still somewhere else.</v>

152
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.730
<v 1>They recorded over the original tapes of the moon landing.</v>

153
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.390
How much of a shortage of magnetic tape do you have when you're going to record

154
00:07:56.391 --> 00:08:01.250
over all of the video from the moon landing Hackett,

155
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.410
we got a presidential parade from 76. You want to keep that? Yeah. Keep that,

156
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.480
keep that a good one. It's like,

157
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:10.730
if you're going through like your family's VHS tapes,

158
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:14.210
like what do you want picnic from 82. Yeah, that was when Mikey drew up,

159
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.660
save it, save it. Like they're saving everything,

160
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:20.660
but they record over the moon landing. That's it.

161
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.500
<v 0>Let's just record over the first time in human history, literally.</v>

162
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.130
<v 1>The craziest thing in human history to ever record over. Right?</v>

163
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:31.250
It is the dumbest thing in humans. I'm not saying they didn't do it.

164
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.750
They might have,

165
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.010
they might that's the official story might be legit because CNN.

166
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.650
<v 0>Well, but it might not. Where do you put your money on the moon landing?</v>

167
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:42.770
Because you know what I'm detecting Joe, when we first got to be friends,

168
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.640
as I recall, you didn't really believe in the moon land.

169
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:47.570
I didn't believe it at all.

170
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.950
And then you went through a phase because of the podcast and having a lot of

171
00:08:51.951 --> 00:08:54.170
conversations with different people or something happened where you started

172
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:56.760
shifting your ideas and thinking we did go.

173
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 1>To the moon. No, I started shifting my ideas about everything.</v>

174
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.130
The moon landing is just an example.

175
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:06.720
That's an extreme example of a position I took that I think represents there is,

176
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.250
there is mystery to that story.

177
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.890
There's a lot of mystery to that story is still to this day.

178
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.930
There's a bunch of weird connected to the moon landing. A lot of it. So when I,

179
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:19.740
and people were like, no, there's not shut up. No, there is, there is.

180
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.450
There's a bunch of weird connected to it.

181
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:24.180
How about the fact that they gave a moon rock to a,

182
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.740
was it the prime minister of Holland,

183
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.470
Neil Armstrong and buzz Aldrin and

184
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:36.330
Michael Collins signed on this plaque and they gave this moon rock to this guy

185
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:41.010
in Holland and it turned out to be petrified wood. It was fake.

186
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.270
Like it's,

187
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.050
there's so much weird connected to the moon landing that it makes you go like,

188
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.890
wow,

189
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.630
like creepy speeches that Neil Armstrong gave 25 years after the moon

190
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:55.590
landing talking about uncovering hidden truths, truths,

191
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.470
protective layers that are, you know, Ooh,

192
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.770
great deeds that could be done to those who could remove one of truth,

193
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.790
protective layers. This is a speech that he gave. There's so much weird. Some.

194
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.120
<v 0>People say there's alien relics.</v>

195
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:09.900
<v 1>Up. There's people ridiculous. There's no evidence of that.</v>

196
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.690
But there is evidence that these people are talking really weird about the moon

197
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.110
land. Jamie, can you pull up clean set? You know what Clinton said in his book,

198
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.980
he wrote a book called my life. And in one of the chapters in my life,

199
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.020
he talks about a conversation that he had with a carpenter.

200
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.340
When people landed on the moon,

201
00:10:23.341 --> 00:10:25.830
he was working in a construction site and the guy said,

202
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:28.950
I don't believe it for a second. Those television fellers,

203
00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:32.070
they could fake anything. And he says, back then I thought the guy was a crank.

204
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.870
But after eight years in the white house,

205
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.360
I was starting to think that maybe he was ahead of his time.

206
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.760
Now this is what bill Clinton wrote in his book,

207
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.400
my life. Wow. Why would the,

208
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.790
would you ever write that if you were the president of the United States for

209
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:49.320
eight years and you're saying, Hey,

210
00:10:49.321 --> 00:10:51.970
maybe the guy who thought we didn't go to the moon was right, right.

211
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.730
Might not be right. It might be that they faked some footage.

212
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.000
They did fake some photos. There's a photo of micro Collins.

213
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.450
Who's on a moonwalk from like Gemini 15.

214
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.160
And it's not a real photo. It's a photo of him from the test runs. They did,

215
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.510
it's in a warehouse and they blacked out all the background. It's been proven.

216
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.510
They reversed the image and blacked out the background.

217
00:11:15.511 --> 00:11:19.260
You could see the two of them. If you overlay them, they line up perfectly.

218
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:24.090
It's the exact same image. So someone, whether it is a, uh,

219
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.511
you know,

220
00:11:24.511 --> 00:11:29.390
an overzealous PR agent for NASA or a journalist at the time who

221
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.930
actually made that photograph,

222
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.620
but somebody did and tried to pass that photo office space.

223
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.220
So there's some deception. We know that one is a hundred percent sure.

224
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.660
So then you look at the other ones, you look at the videos of guys falling down,

225
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.450
getting yanked back up and the bouncing around like they're on trampolines and

226
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:47.670
some videos where they're hiding behind the lunar Rover. Like,

227
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:51.090
what the are you doing? If you guys tear your suits, you're dead. Sure.

228
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.830
You guys are jumping around on the moon.

229
00:11:52.831 --> 00:11:56.080
Like you're having a party up there is that real right?

230
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.610
How come I can't get a regular camera through the radar machine,

231
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:02.110
the x-ray machine at the airport.

232
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.280
But you guys can fly through the radiation of space and that should comes out.

233
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:08.020
But what with those cameras were insulated.

234
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:10.900
There were different kinds of camera. The camera is not true.

235
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.160
Hassle bad said it. They were the same cameras. It's a regular camera.

236
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.630
There was no specific protection.

237
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:19.810
There's nothing unusual about the protection that those cameras had.

238
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.540
<v 0>It's interesting, man. You've like gone back.</v>

239
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.370
<v 1>No, I haven't. I think this is the thing, man. I'm not taking any position.</v>

240
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.670
You're agnostic a hundred percent because I don't know anything about space.

241
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.550
I don't know anything about the physics of space travel.

242
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.670
I don't know anything about the requirements that technological requirements,

243
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:41.230
but I do know it's one of the only things that happened between 1969 and 1972.

244
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.290
And this is a cheaper, easier, and faster to reproduce today.

245
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.140
It's weird to be here. It's funny. It's a weird thing.

246
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.640
That's the only time in history,

247
00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:50.500
people have been more than 400 miles from the earth.

248
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:54.850
Surface was always moon missions, all the Apollo missions, man, everything,

249
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.620
since then, all the space shuttle stuff inside 400 miles satellites, you know.

250
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.090
<v 0>It's always been a weird thing.</v>

251
00:13:01.091 --> 00:13:03.220
You talk to people about that part and they'll say like,

252
00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:04.720
we just don't need to go there anymore. Maybe.

253
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.510
<v 1>We don't, maybe they're right. Maybe they're right. They might be right.</v>

254
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.000
We don't know, but it's juicy to think they're not right.

255
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.230
But it's interesting how rabidly people fight off the notion.

256
00:13:14.231 --> 00:13:18.940
Here's the other weird about the Nazis or running our space program.

257
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.390
That's a fact operation paperclip, Verna Von Braun was a Nazi.

258
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.100
They brought all the scientists over like legit Nazis who would hang Jews in

259
00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:30.760
front of their rocket factories in Berlin, Git guys who were,

260
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.420
were tattoos from the Holocaust, identified Wernher Von Braun,

261
00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:37.150
talked about him being in there. That was the head of NASA.

262
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.880
That was the guy who was trying to get us to the moon. Yeah, dude,

263
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:40.840
there's a lot of weird.

264
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.630
<v 0>See, now you're getting deep into it.</v>

265
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:48.010
It's the Nazis doing some kind of thing where they're like trying to fake the

266
00:13:48.011 --> 00:13:51.740
moon landing. Like it's some out to attach to the Nazis. I think.

267
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.350
<v 1>The Nazis were the best rocket scientists available, right?</v>

268
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.420
Or one of them other than the ones that we had here.

269
00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.380
And then the ones the Russians had,

270
00:13:59.381 --> 00:14:01.690
there was a lot of competition to get the best rocket scientists,

271
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.410
but some of the best rocket scientists were in Nazi Germany. So when Nazi,

272
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:09.160
Germany fell, operation paperclip took place. And in operation,

273
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.960
operation paperclip, they brought a number of Nazi scientists from Germany,

274
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.140
secretly to America. And one of them, they put as a head of NASA.

275
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.660
<v 0>Yeah. This is where the, this is where it gets really cool.</v>

276
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:24.040
Someone's explaining all this to me about how basically it's the thing is like,

277
00:14:24.041 --> 00:14:26.080
okay, you think in world war two,

278
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:30.670
that we just rounded up all the Nazis and they just disappeared.

279
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:33.980
And it's like, what do you think? All the Nazis went and they're.

280
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.060
<v 1>Not the ones who were really good at making cool. Yeah.</v>

281
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:40.930
<v 0>Well bear aspirin, you know like the, the idea is that the non aspirin. Yeah.</v>

282
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.760
We'll look up. I'm so sorry to ask Jimmy,

283
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:47.590
but do you mind looking up bear aspirin and psych on be like, and, and, and,

284
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.170
and the Jewish slaves, I think working for bear aspirin,

285
00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:52.340
but when you look at like a lot of the corporate,

286
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:55.730
the ideas that the Nazis didn't really go anywhere,

287
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:57.410
they just started corporations.

288
00:14:57.411 --> 00:14:59.360
And some of the biggest corporations we have right now.

289
00:14:59.360 --> 00:14:59.870
<v 1>An hour,</v>

290
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.550
do you know why Zyklon B is I Clumby because Zyklon B took the smell out of it.

291
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:09.290
Zyklon a was the stuff that had a C an agent in it that made it smell terrible.

292
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.810
So you could smell that. So when they used it,

293
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.420
the gas that the people in the concentration camps,

294
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.890
they changed it so that it was undetectable yet.

295
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.040
Did it say, what does it say? Jamie is quick on the trigger here today.

296
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:25.040
Frustrated with us changes the cameras. So if you guys are like, oh,

297
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:29.330
the bear aspirin company has finally apologized for the inhumane acts of its

298
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:33.740
parent firm, including using Jewish slave laborers during the Holocaust. Holy.
