00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. People are going to have to look at this, like, okay,</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.360
now we know something can happen that we never thought could happen before in

3
00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:12.570
the whole world shuts down. Now we know that's it, but we should,

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.990
we should act accordingly in like how we run things.

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.790
Now we know.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300
<v 1>Well, that's a silver lining. I mean, like that's a silver line. It's like,</v>

7
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.830
when you have a thing happen that you realize like, you know, whatever,

8
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:27.660
like w in your car,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.100
you get lucky and you notice that the tire is like super flat and you feel you

10
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:34.290
fill it up. You just didn't notice or whatever, you see a thing.

11
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.400
And it saves you from a later thing that could have been a million times worse.

12
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.510
But, you know, man,

13
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.470
the wake up call to me is like,

14
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:48.210
it's no joke that you need to at least be on like some terms with your

15
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:51.900
neighbors. And it's no joke that you need to understand how to do,

16
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.780
like how to grow food out of the ground.

17
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.300
And it seemed like basic first aid and stuff like that.

18
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:01.050
And also to always have gas in your car, man, like, you know, we,

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.270
the other day went to get groceries and like the, you know,

20
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:09.840
left a credit card at the house. Right. And like the,

21
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.710
the car was kind of low on fuel. Cause I hadn't gassed it up like I should have.

22
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:14.340
Right.

23
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.330
And the combination of suddenly not being able to put gas in the car and these

24
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:23.250
two dumb mistakes, it wasn't just a normal day where your car runs out of gas.

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.430
Now it's your cars run out of gas during a pandemic.

26
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.960
Meaning you got to call somebody to come and get put gas in your car or walk

27
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:33.900
somewhere to get gas. That's a whole different walk than before.

28
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.830
And that's asking someone to come and help you is kind of like asking them, Hey,

29
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:40.290
would you mind like taking a chance? I mean,

30
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.870
I know you're wearing a mask and everything, but you know what I mean?

31
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.050
So suddenly ups in this kind of environment,

32
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
they mean a lot more than ups in like the previous world that we are in.

33
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.540
And that's teaching me a real kind of responsibility, you know,

34
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:58.890
like having some cash on hand, like stuff like that. Like what we, you know,

35
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.880
we should always be doing that. And to me that is one of the, you know,

36
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.760
and I hate using errors using the term silver lining right now. And it's like,

37
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.410
anytime you say, I just like, yeah,

38
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:12.180
it's a silver lining on like people who drown in their own mucus. It's not the,

39
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.530
you know, it's up.

40
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:17.340
But I guess one of the silver linings in it is just that the,

41
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.810
the fact that it's like, look, man, Trump just was talking about,

42
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.870
maybe we should inject ourselves with a Lysol.

43
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.330
<v 0>Okay. Crazy. That video. Have you seen the one when they focused on the lady,</v>

44
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.540
who's a science advisor and she's sitting there listening to him, say all this.

45
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.643
Yeah.

46
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.170
<v 1>Yeah. I have. I've.</v>

47
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.670
<v 0>Seen Paris tweeted it, it it's uh, he said, uh,</v>

48
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.890
when you look into the abyss, the abyss looks into you.

49
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.830
<v 1>That's it. You know? But also in that look, you know, I saw,</v>

50
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.370
I saw her thinking like, listen, who's in line. You want to have,

51
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.330
do you want this job?

52
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.980
I'm doing what I can to steer this crazy ship as best as I can.

53
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.660
And there's not much I could do, but it's like, you know,

54
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:06.460
you see somebody seriously say to an entire planet that it might be a good

55
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.000
idea to inject Lysol into your products here.

56
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.130
<v 0>Let me hear it. You can start from the beginning.</v>

57
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.930
I think you got to actually double click on it. And on my computer,

58
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:24.340
I had to to get the sound out of it. Nothing.

59
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.780
The you hear that whisper. No, I don't hear. That was Duncan.

60
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.700
That was me. It's haunted. Anyway,

61
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.440
bottom line is, he's saying wacky. And the focus is on this lady.

62
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.960
And as she's watching him, she's like,

63
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.080
I can't even believe I have to handle.

64
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.380
<v 1>Yeah. And she does do that too. But to me.</v>

65
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.000
<v 0>We have to get the disinfectant into the body. That's maybe possible.</v>

66
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.830
We could get up to drink license, white.

67
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.903
<v 1>Powerful.</v>

68
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.170
<v 0>Like it, uh, use light to kill it from outside or inside.</v>

69
00:04:03.171 --> 00:04:04.070
I don't know how you're doing.

70
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.580
<v 1>There you go. Cause you see a thing like that. And it's like, okay,</v>

71
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.410
lean into that. Like,

72
00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:12.380
that's going to like lean into that as the thing that you can count on.

73
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.510
That's the thing saying inject lighter.

74
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.240
That's the kind of thing where like in your craziest friend,

75
00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:20.760
if they said that to you, you would you be considering like calling their,

76
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.570
their friends or their mom to be like, Hey Jack,

77
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.460
he's having like a hardcore manic episode.

78
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.030
He's talking about injecting Lysol into himself. You better do something.

79
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.420
That's the president. And to me, what that tells me is like,

80
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.310
you need gas in your car. You need to make sure your phone is juiced up.

81
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.010
You know what I mean? You need to make sure that you are like,

82
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.980
you gotta be ready. Because if, if,

83
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.570
if we like think we're gonna lean into some like imaginary hammock

84
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.380
made of like people who are saying that we should inject ourselves with Lysol,

85
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.100
then we're made, then that's our fault. That's your cause. You know, it's like,

86
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.550
let's imagine, let's say you went and you, I don't know,

87
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.160
you went into the forest and you got attacked by a tiger.

88
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.400
But right before you went in the tiger, you enter the forest.

89
00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:05.390
You said to somebody, Hey,

90
00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:07.970
do you think I should go in that forest are tigers there? And they're like, no.

91
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.290
And then they start shooting up with Lysol. You know what I mean?

92
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.890
If you go in that forest and the tag tiger gets you, that's your fault.

93
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.730
You listened to a dude who thought you could shoot up Lysol.

94
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.850
You know what I mean? That's your.

95
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.510
<v 0>[Inaudible] what was he thinking while he was saying that he's probably like,</v>

96
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.360
there's gotta be an intelligent way to get out of this subject that I've already

97
00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:40.280
started. And I've already like coming up with, uh, perhaps, uh, for instance,

98
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.940
uh, maybe you could, uh, maybe you could.

99
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.470
<v 2>So supposing we hit the body with a tremendous, uh,</v>

100
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.650
whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light.

101
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.500
And I think that hasn't been checked, but you're going to test it. And I said,

102
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.720
supposing, working on inside the body, you can,

103
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.740
which you can do either through the skin or uh, in some other way.

104
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.960
And I think you said you're going to test that too. Sounds interesting. Right.

105
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:13.190
And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute,

106
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.810
one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, uh,

107
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.870
by injection inside or,

108
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.050
or almost a cleaning? Cause you see a

109
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.370
tremendous number of along. So it'd be interesting to check that.

110
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.170
<v 1>Yeah, the lungs, can we take your lungs out and spray them?</v>

111
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.790
<v 0>I sat down, put your lungs through a carwash. Like what? Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.290
What a crazy thing to say.

113
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.540
<v 1>I mean, cleaning, cleaning, give them a cleaning.</v>

114
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.160
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

115
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.640
I just liked being his doctor and you have to listen to him say this, like, uh,

116
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.900
so why don't you, uh, do like the disinfectant, you know,

117
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.060
inside it's like a cleaning, can you, did.

118
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.890
<v 1>I live here and bleach,</v>

119
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.260
can you take my liver up microwave it, I, yeah. You know,

120
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:05.810
so to me you see that and it's like, okay,

121
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.730
well I'm not quite certain that that is where I'm going to get my data

122
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.150
stream from because that's a Lysol person. And then, but then we,

123
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.840
but then there must be like a thing we can do regardless of the fact that

124
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:18.674
clearly.

125
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.050
<v 0>Bro, you wouldn't even talk like that on a podcast.</v>

126
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.850
<v 1>Do I've never say that in a, but.</v>

127
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.283
<v 0>Imagine,</v>

128
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.240
imagine you have zero expertise in a certain subject,

129
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.290
you talking to someone who's like some expert in this said subject and you're

130
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:36.860
proposing these outlandish. Like you're on a podium.

131
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.100
You're not even having a private conversation in front of everybody.

132
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.670
You're somehow or another having a side conversation where you're proposing

133
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:48.140
these ridiculous ideas that show that you don't understand how disinfectant

134
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:51.890
works. W why, why is that even conversation even taking place.

135
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.490
<v 1>Also, the other thing is, cause he,</v>

136
00:07:53.491 --> 00:07:58.100
he did ask the question that is a time for someone on that side of the room to

137
00:07:58.101 --> 00:08:00.260
go no looking at her.

138
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:01.071
<v 0>Well,</v>

139
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:04.820
she knows she can't do that because she knows if she interrupts him and goes,

140
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.670
what you can't do that you can't inject us in flux.

141
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.440
He would probably be upset and she wants to do the best work that she can do.

142
00:08:12.441 --> 00:08:17.360
And this is just some nonsense she has to handle along the way. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:21.260
I guess just a bad path. He look, first of all, and me, look,

144
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.650
the guy works some ungodly amount of hours in a day. Right.

145
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:29.270
He's going to do some dumb. Like, and he wings it a lot. Right.

146
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.340
So he probably was stuck on that conversation of things that might be able to be

147
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:37.100
done. And uh, maybe, uh,

148
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.770
you could do a strong ultraviolet light,

149
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:42.020
like in the skin that then also he's like, oh my God, um,

150
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:47.000
I'm laying out possible ways that you could cure this there.

151
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:49.580
I better keep going. I better have more than one. Yeah.

152
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.630
And there's like disinfectant that's right. Disinfect. It does. In fact,

153
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.120
maybe inside or outside, they have a way of doing that. And then he say,

154
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.050
and then he goes to her, like, he's looking for support. Like a,

155
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:03.540
I think you said maybe I think you said maybe you look into that.

156
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.030
<v 1>Yeah, man. I mean,</v>

157
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.500
it definitely has that sense of like when you had to give a report at school and

158
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:11.760
you hadn't prepared for.
