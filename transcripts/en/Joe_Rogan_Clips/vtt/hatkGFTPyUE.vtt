00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.520
<v 2>I mean, I worry about it. You kind of go,</v>

3
00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.200
what happens when the progressives convince Facebook that San

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.520
is, is dangerous.

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.800
<v 1>Yeah. And that's not outside the realm of possibility at all. The,</v>

6
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.520
this thing that you say about silencing you,

7
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:20.400
that's not outside the realm of possibility. You know, I've seen it. I mean,

8
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.950
we were talking about Barry Weiss earlier. She got,

9
00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.150
basically pushed out in New York times because of this sort of ideology

10
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:32.710
that's spreading rampant through journalism and journalism has become slash

11
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.770
activism.

12
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.590
And then there's this idea that you have to do whatever you can

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.100
and by any means necessary, push your agenda and silence the oppressors.

14
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.100
You know, even if these oppressors are people like you, that are just saying,

15
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:48.580
listen, you've gotta take a,

16
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.820
a more radical approach to dealing with these ever-growing problems.

17
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.780
And one of the ways might be this carrot in this,

18
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.180
in this stick and this idea that you have to give people consequences for their

19
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:02.690
actions and people for good actions.

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.650
And we could possibly like build people back up,

21
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.330
but we're gonna have to do it in a way that's gonna make folks uncomfortable.

22
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.970
Yeah.

23
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.890
<v 0>I mean, it's definitely, it seems like two things are going on at once, right?</v>

24
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:15.770
There's definitely this top down effort at censorship and including of people

25
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:18.450
like me. In fact, I was censored by Facebook. You were.

26
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.470
<v 1>I was.</v>

27
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.320
<v 0>How so? Um, when my last book came, 'em out, they censored, um, true facts.</v>

28
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.840
Which book is that? Apocalypse never this one. Yep. Um, yeah, they.

29
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.960
<v 1>Censored. Why environmental alarmism hurts.</v>

30
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.360
<v 0>Us all. Yeah. That came out in June of last year and I was censored, um,</v>

31
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.280
in the article I wrote about it.

32
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.560
And now other people that write about climate change are being censored.

33
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.400
I will say though, you know, I mean.

34
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.350
<v 1>How so were you censored? Like what, what did you say that was? They put a.</v>

35
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.310
<v 0>They put a, uh, they put a,</v>

36
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.510
like a warning label on the article that was being shared.

37
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.670
That was the initial article,

38
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.270
announcing the book saying this contains misleading and false information.

39
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.470
It's not true. Didn't contain a single piece of false information.

40
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.420
And misleading is a really subjective thing, right?

41
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.380
<v 1>Like what did you say that they objected.</v>

42
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.460
<v 0>To the main? So the main issues were, I point out that we're not in the,</v>

43
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.860
in the midst of a mass extinction, uh,

44
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.940
a mass extinction is when over when 75 or 90% of all species on earth are,

45
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.500
are extinct or going extinct. In fact,

46
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:25.250
only 6% of species are critically endangered and most of them should or will

47
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.113
survive.

48
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.730
The other one is I pointed out that natural disasters are not getting worse.

49
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.210
Deaths from natural disasters have declined over 90% over the last hundred

50
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:37.810
years. We're just much better at dealing with hurricanes and floods and, and,

51
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.810
you know, non-client related disasters like earthquakes as well. Um,

52
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.400
and so what they, they respond, you know, the, on the disasters,

53
00:02:45.401 --> 00:02:48.280
they point out that there's some evidence that hurricanes are becoming somewhat

54
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:48.940
more intense,

55
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.200
but then they leave out the fact that the best available science predicts that

56
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.360
hurricanes will become 25% less frequent,

57
00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.720
but 5% more intense north Atlantic hurricanes. But it, but I even,

58
00:03:00.721 --> 00:03:03.760
that doesn't matter because our just we're just so much better at preparing for

59
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:05.800
hurricanes. So like vanishingly few people die.

60
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.680
I think something like in the most recent, I think 2019,

61
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:12.720
something like 400 Americans died of natural disasters, right?

62
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.640
It's like 300 cuz I was like 300 times more people died of drug deaths in the

63
00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:19.390
United States than from natural disaster. I mean, these,

64
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.350
this is how these two books work together is me as a,

65
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.830
as someone that considers myself liberal or moderate, I used to be progressive.

66
00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.110
I don't use that label anymore.

67
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.470
But my view is the drug crisis is objectively a much bigger threat to

68
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:35.070
human life and to civilization than climate change,

69
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.230
like we're adapted really well to climate change.

70
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.540
We should do something about it. It's real, there are risks associated with it,

71
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:44.580
but like there's no scenario in the intergovernment panel,

72
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:49.020
climate change of climate change killing 93,000 Americans a year. In fact,

73
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:52.140
there's no scenario of it killing of a, of an increasing, uh,

74
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:53.460
deaths from natural disasters at all.

75
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.820
<v 1>Is it, why is it more attractive? Why is that a more attractive talking point?</v>

76
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.690
Because this is one of the things that you, you can keep hearing from, uh,

77
00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:04.090
whether it's whistle blowers at, uh,

78
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.370
news organizations where they're saying that climate change is the next thing

79
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.450
they're looking at it, according to, you know,

80
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.410
these people that are talking about it, they're,

81
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.330
they're looking at climate change as the next thing that's gonna freak people

82
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.410
out enough to guarantee ratings.

83
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.920
<v 0>You. Yeah. I mean, I, I look at the,</v>

84
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.480
so both of these books are similar in the sense that I debunk popular myths.

85
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.560
I explain what the solutions are.

86
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.840
And then I also explore why it is that say the people that say they're the most

87
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.920
concerned about climate change,

88
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.040
oppose the main solutions to reducing carbon emissions or adapting to climate

89
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:43.150
change. &lt;affirmative&gt; basically the three things won't surprise you.

90
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.430
There's financial interests. There's just sort of a broader will to power,

91
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.790
both kind of status and politics. And just kind of,

92
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.950
I'm gonna jet around the world and tell people how to live their.

93
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.670
<v 1>Lives, which is hilarious and often happens.</v>

94
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.470
<v 0>Yes. And then the third is, um, religion and that, you know,</v>

95
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.220
the of God, what NCHA called the death of God,

96
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.700
which is basically we just stop believing in traditional religions,

97
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:09.420
whether it's Judaism or Christianity or Buddhism or Hinduism,

98
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.700
as we stop believing in traditional religions, we still have a fear of death.

99
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.780
We still have a need to believe in some higher power.

100
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.500
And so we make new religions. And the problem with the new religion,

101
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.170
whether it's climate apocalypse woke is or woke is or victimology.

102
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.650
The problem is that the people that are,

103
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.570
that are the adherence to those new religions,

104
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.450
don't think that they're promoting a new religion.

105
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.970
They think that they're just being more compassionate or I'm just being more

106
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:38.130
sensitive or whatever. Yeah. So they're actually more,

107
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.370
they're more dogmatic than the people in the traditional religions,

108
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.160
cuz know you meet people that have even evangelical views.

109
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.960
They'll always be like, well, you know, I am an evangelical Christian, right?

110
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.600
So they have some awareness of it. But, but folks that are,

111
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:51.760
they don't like these people don't go, well,

112
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.680
I am an apocalyptic environmentalist. What they say is &lt;laugh&gt; they go, they go,

113
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.360
I'm more aware of the science or, you know, I'm, I just love nature.

114
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.320
And I just care about poor people more than you.

115
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.680
It's always cast in some sort of highly charged moralizing

116
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.560
framework, you know, which is like this idea, you know, it's like this,

117
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.800
the main idea of the folks that, that have created the,

118
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.070
the disaster in our cities is that they care. That's the conceit, you know,

119
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.350
it's, it's the, I care. I just care more than you do. You are just more in,

120
00:06:22.351 --> 00:06:26.790
you're just insensitive, total, but that kind of emotional,

121
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.710
that kind of appeal to emotion, um, has, has a lot of power.
