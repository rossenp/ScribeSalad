1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, maybe for the last few months,</v>

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:08.520
since we started the Hulu, the American saga, a series,

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.200
people been pushing me to do a podcast. Right. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, um,

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.560
I, they would love listening to you. I end up not doing one,

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.320
but we have one for the show. Of course, that kind of does, you know,

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:23.430
like after the show go off, you could go and listen and hear, uh, you know,

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.190
more inside detail to the story. But still during that process, it was like,

8
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.150
you need to do a, a podcast, whereas, because just the way you think,

9
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.870
um, we just need more people with that kind of thinking, you know what I mean?

10
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.830
Yeah. So when he just said, does he talk to us? You know, he don't talk to us,

11
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.780
but then after he was finished talking to himself for 44 minutes,

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.620
he felt a weight come off of him. I was son, but there's a scripture on that,

13
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.900
bro. What is it? The scripture is in the BA of VA GDA. Ooh. Is that the Karan?

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.100
No, no, no. I don't know. I don't that's I know the Karan is the Quran.

15
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.370
All right. I just need to know. So the bag of vagida it means the song of God,

16
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:06.090
just put G I T a GDA, the GDA, right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

17
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:07.730
it's actually the words of Krishna.

18
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.210
And he says contemplation with yourself,

19
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:15.490
which is talking with yourself will take you further than praying.

20
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.370
Ooh. Okay. And if a man is not contemplating, right.

21
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.680
If you're not, whether you doing it verbally, like right now,

22
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:28.720
we talking out loud, we all got that voice in our head. Yeah, man,

23
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:29.920
you had that voice. You was like, yo,

24
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.160
should I put the condom on the Nu &lt;laugh&gt;t.

25
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.960
<v 1>You't that loud. No more though. I feel you we've been there.</v>

26
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.720
You have that voice.

27
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.120
<v 0>And, and you know, if you, if you listen to it or you don't listen to it. Right,</v>

28
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:43.710
right, right. But the bottom line is that according to Krisna,

29
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.070
it's that contemplation that makes us better.

30
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.270
It's that reflection of what we did, what we are gonna do. And, and when you,

31
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.750
and you verbalize it, even out loud, what? I mean, the spoken word.

32
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.870
It's even more powerful song. You get it out. Yeah.

33
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.390
<v 1>That's how I felt. That's good. I, but it I'm telling you part of it was like,</v>

34
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.540
I was not letting Joe talk to me. I, I was like, that, man.

35
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.340
He not doing that, but I'm, I'm glad I did it, man. The.

36
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.220
<v 2>Bodyda did not reach him.</v>

37
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.420
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. You gotta do a podcast. Huh? He should.</v>

38
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.853
<v 2>I think, look.</v>

39
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.073
<v 1>Son.</v>

40
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.100
<v 0>The cause.</v>

41
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.660
<v 1>They tell people, they get, they get mad money too. Son, you can make money.</v>

42
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.210
<v 2>The most important thing is that you, you have a voice.</v>

43
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.170
Like you're an interesting guy. If you did a podcast, it would be interesting.

44
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:28.050
There's a lot of people,

45
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.890
it's good to have a bunch of different people doing it from all different,

46
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.330
different styles of art. Different. If a.

47
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.890
<v 1>Person is already, if a person has already been interesteding people. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.770
For what people want to wanna keep getting different pieces of you,

49
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.120
how can you give it to him? Talk about that's a, that's a easy.

50
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.280
<v 2>Thats. That's a no brainer. Quote. The bogova GDA. It's you and Duncan.</v>

51
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:53.400
Trusel the only people who quote the VA. Bava GDA. That's hilarious.

52
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.000
I love that book. Oh, that's an amazing book, man.

53
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.440
That's what Oppenheimer quoted. When he, uh,

54
00:02:58.441 --> 00:03:01.960
watched the first atomic bomb blow off said I am become death.

55
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.080
Destroyer of worlds. The quote, right from the about GDA. Yeah. That's crazy.

56
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.520
That's a. Yeah. That's a, that is a fascinating book, man.

57
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.440
There's all sorts of illusions to like UFOs and.

58
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.960
I was about say that talk about.

59
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.750
<v 0>Well, well the Marata, which is longer version. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.750
The BA so the Baja vagida is about 700 verses.

61
00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.110
That's took out of the Marata, which is one of the longest,

62
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.550
it's not the longest poem, but.

63
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.390
<v 2>It's in the top two. How do you say it? Is it Maha? Bararata how do you say.</v>

64
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.550
<v 0>It? Yeah. You might have that. B is in there. I't know if that B is silent,</v>

65
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.290
you know? Yeah.

66
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.790
<v 1>That's the one with all that I know. I Don know words. It got silent. B yeah.</v>

67
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.040
Maha. Barrata.

68
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.220
<v 2>That's that's.</v>

69
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.980
<v 1>What word has a silent B. I never even know that was where.</v>

70
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.060
<v 2>Existed. Maha. Barrata a silent B there something I,</v>

71
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.660
that that's gotta a be in there that that be makes noise. Right.

72
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.580
But it's uh, there's vionas in that right? Where there's flying crafts.

73
00:03:56.581 --> 00:03:57.740
There's a bunch of weird.

74
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.930
The people face history had to figure out what the are they talking about?

75
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.890
<v 0>Yeah. And, uh, you know,</v>

76
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.010
that ancient civilization was measuring what they call coppers every 35,000

77
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.730
years, you know? And they were saying, you know, measuring coppers.

78
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.170
Yeah. No like that's that's that's like K a P P 80, like capanana oh, copper.

79
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.760
Oh, I got a tendency to, I I would wanna just make a disclaimer real quick.

80
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.000
I have a tendency to pronounce words. The way I pronounce &lt;laugh&gt;.

81
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.240
<v 1>I have a tendency to listen. Understand the words way you pronounce it. Words,</v>

I say this real quick. I forgot this. I did my show earlier. Right? Son.

84
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.230
Joe said he never spin his six, 16 say.

85
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.190
<v 2>Oh, you never spit a six 16. No, I didn't. I'm very white. &lt;laugh&gt; eight. No,</v>

86
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.150
no, man. He, I didn't even know what he was talking about. I had to like go.

87
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.990
<v 1>Over it with, tell him the bars. You said you spit.</v>

88
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.630
<v 2>Oh, what? I said, hip hop.</v>

89
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.133
<v 1>Hips.</v>

90
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.710
<v 2>He was asking me about sugar hill. And I said, yeah, I remember that.</v>

91
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:01.620
And then I started saying.

92
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.740
<v 1>It. I don't think I was asking you about sugar hair, sir.</v>

93
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.780
I think we talked about no, no, no. I wish I could remember exactly. Didn't he?

94
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:10.220
I think you did. We went to sugar hair after, after a period of time. Yeah.

95
00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:13.220
You asked me if I knew. No, no, this is what I said. You, I spent 16.

96
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.740
You was like this, what you told me, Joe, you said I don't have time to spit 16.

97
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.740
No, I don't have any time to, this is what you said though.

98
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:22.450
Don't you said I have much better said enjoy it.

99
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.090
<v 2>You said, Joe, you enjoy listening to it. I don't have time to do it.</v>

100
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:25.770
That's what Joe, you.

101
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.090
<v 1>Said I have much better things to do my time than spit 16.</v>

102
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.130
<v 2>I don't think that's what I said. I'm pretty sure that's what you said. Well,</v>

103
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:36.490
what I said was I'm too busy to do one, two more thing and I like rap,

104
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.370
but I don't like to do it. Cause I maybe I would love it, but I'm not going to,

105
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.320
I don't have any time. Okay. That's all right. That's not your thing. Yep. Yeah.

106
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:46.440
That's all it means. Don't try to twist it. I didn't twist it.

107
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:48.200
Taste dare takess for itself. I am the producer.

108
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.880
<v 1>I'm youre.</v>

109
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.480
<v 2>Treating me in a terrible man. I fire misoting edit.</v>

110
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.520
<v 0>It. You gonna edit it out. Let's edit. It's edit this.</v>

111
00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.760
<v 2>We were talking about how few white rappers ever actually make it like the tiny</v>

112
00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:04.440
percentage in, in comparison to the ones who try it. Like how many of ' try it?

113
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.160
You gotta think there must be millions and millions that have tried it. Right?

114
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.040
Right, right. Like there's like a small handful of guys.

115
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.840
<v 0>Well, in all reality,</v>

116
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.910
it's a small handful period for race. So that's true too.

117
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.510
So if you look at the ratio, I'm a ratio guy. So as we talk, you'll see,

118
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.590
I'm always, I'm always pulling some numbers into things,

119
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.150
but if you look at the ratio, let's say 1 million white guys tried, right.

120
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.870
Five made it. Let's say 50 million blacks tried. You see what I mean?

121
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.860
So, so it's usually you the ratio, right?

122
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.940
<v 2>Many more doing it. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.340
<v 0>Makes sense. But hiphop, let me just say something about hiphop. Cause I could,</v>

124
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.300
I could say that right is dead. No &lt;laugh&gt; I could hip hop nervous.

125
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.020
<v 1>I'm just check it. I was like, you killed it. I Tekashi tried to kill it,</v>

126
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:54.340
but go.

127
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.250
<v 0>Ahead. No, the beautiful thing is that hip hop. It is really one of those. No.</v>

128
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.290
Okay. I'm sorry. No, no, it's all good. I'm you know, that's I like,

129
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.690
I like this, this, this energy here, but hip hop is a pure American,

130
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.690
uh, creation culture. Yeah. It's like, it's like, it's, you know,

131
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:13.810
people try to chase it. Nah, man. Chase it right here. Yeah.

132
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.970
And when it was formed, right. It's definitely, you know, you know,

133
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:19.520
lot of young black men, you know,

134
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.120
to go back to uh coolhook and grandma flash and, and melody, Mel,

135
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.800
and um, spoony G you know, you could go back to the classes, you know,

136
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.000
grandma CA right.

137
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.280
But within grandma CA crew with the corut brother, you got Charlie chase.

138
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.420
Right.

139
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.790
So you got the Spanish brothers there within our first hip hop songs that we

140
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.910
love, you know, L KU J rock, the bells. Oh,

141
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:48.710
guess's who produced that? Rick Rubin. Mm. He got the white brother there.

142
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.430
Oh yeah. We was talking about that. Um, so the,

143
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.110
so the youth culture of America at that time, right.

144
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.030
Even with fab five Freddy going down, you know,

145
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.500
town to the C B GB crowd and all andlonie and all these,

146
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.220
all these things was melding from our culture now. Whereas of course,

147
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.100
uh, it's it's a dominantly, a black expression, right. It's you know,

148
00:08:10.101 --> 00:08:11.700
we could say we dominated the culture,

149
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.420
but it took angles from every other part of New York to,

150
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:19.460
to make it exist. And that means it took our Spanish bar,

151
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.730
others and their culture.

152
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.650
It took out white brothers and their culture to all form it. And then of course,

153
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:28.130
when wtang came, we bought the Asian culture in, you know what I mean? Mmhmm.

154
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.490
Yeah. And, and UAN, when you say that, it's.

155
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.410
<v 1>Like, it came in like a thunderstorm, like woo.</v>

156
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.170
<v 0>You know what I mean? So, so we should, so, so,</v>

157
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.090
but we should be proud to know that it's, that it, you know,

158
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.880
that it it's like an inclusive American art form. It is,

159
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.880
you know what I mean? And look, Bruce Lee, who was an American,

160
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.520
right. People gotta, you know, he represents the Asian culture,

161
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.360
but he was born in America, went back, made it big in Hong Kong. Right.

162
00:08:55.361 --> 00:08:58.000
And they came back to America and took it to the next level again.

163
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:02.160
And when you look at some of those break dance moves and some of the

164
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:07.000
philosophies that he brought to mixing more styles together, you know, G KDO,

165
00:09:07.001 --> 00:09:08.920
which means the way of the intercepting fists,

166
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.160
or also the way of the combined boxing with fencing with, with,

167
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.630
with wing Chung. Yes. Right. He, he,

168
00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:21.230
he put all those MMASS together before it was even that right.

169
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.110
When it was taboo. Exactly.

170
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.710
Hip hop also is that same type of product where you do have the,

171
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.590
the soul of James Brown, the, the jazz of the loneliius monk.

172
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.580
You know what I mean? The, the rock beat a Billy SQUI. Yeah.

173
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.700
I got a big beat or honky tonk wall by rolling stones. Those are break beats,

174
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.300
but yet you also got the Latin feeling of the Mabo Kings, uh,

175
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.580
and uh, songs like Apache and the Mexican. Do you, do.

176
00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.420
<v 1>You think hip hop is evolving and not just cuz is it</v>

177
00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:58.170
evolving? Um, &lt;affirmative&gt; in a sense of the creativity of it?

178
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.290
<v 0>I think it, it is definitely because.</v>

179
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.330
<v 1>People, they got a situation now where it don't have to evolve.</v>

180
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.290
Mo people have found a way to make money off of something that people may not

181
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:10.130
agree with. There's like hot. But do you think hip hop is evolving?

182
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.210
<v 0>Yes. It, it always evolved. Right?</v>

183
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.360
So it's part of the evolution we are seeing now is as we in my

184
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:21.320
generation, we've relied on music that was created before us,

185
00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:25.520
because we went to, we came in a time where it took music programs outta school.

186
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.440
Right. So you didn't learn how to play a guitar, piano and the,

187
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:33.080
your music equipment or your instrument became your turntables.

188
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.400
It became your drum machine. Right. Eventually became our sample.

189
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.430
And then we sampled a lot of songs,

190
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.750
a lot of breaks from old records that already existed. Right. Right.

191
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.630
But this generation, right. They're not actually forced to sample.

192
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.270
They actually could take their keyboard, their drum machine, their laptop,

193
00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.630
and just create and on their phone too. Yeah. And on their phone,

194
00:10:55.631 --> 00:11:00.340
it just create the beat. Right. And so now the beat has no, uh,

195
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.740
historical reference to it in the sense of, oh, that was a James Brown sample.

196
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.540
And that was a Marvin gay sample. No, this that's just that kid who,

197
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.820
whether he did fruitie loops and threw some co progressing together,

198
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.220
or whether he sat there on his garage band on his phone and, and,

199
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.660
and hit the guitar program that comes with it. Right.

200
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.570
Or whatever the creativity of it is now having this form of

201
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:26.170
originality. Right. Right. Now, of course, once something like that happens,

202
00:11:26.171 --> 00:11:29.530
there's a formula. So we keep hearing that same formula exists right now. Right.

203
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.210
But I think one of the greatest evolution of hip hop right. Is,

204
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.570
and, and, and that's ever,

205
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.720
I'm gonna use the word evolution loose because when I think about the coldrust

206
00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:44.680
brothers and the four MDs, they did this anyway in the beginning.

207
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.960
But hip hop has become more melodic now than it did in the

208
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:54.160
nineties, in the early two thousands. Right. So what I mean by that, you know,

209
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.280
rappers now, you know, you know, I'm just so D

210
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.120
like it, it's all melody, it's all, you know, it's all chanting, right.

211
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.040
Uh, it has the regga chant vibe to it. When we was doing it,

212
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.200
I smoke on the Mike like smoke and Joe Fraer the L Lisa. Right.

213
00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:14.830
And is all aggressive chop wrap, you know what I mean? So,

214
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.870
so to see that it evolves to this melodic form, and then you look at Kanye,

215
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:21.990
he's now took it to gospel.

216
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:24.550
<v 1>It's melodic as hell right now. Snoop.</v>

217
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.070
<v 0>Took it to the Snoop lion.</v>

218
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.550
<v 1>But Snoop lion, he was Snoop was really successful. The Snoop lion thing.</v>

219
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:34.580
Didn't wasn't that successful, but the one, he, he won the album gospel album.

220
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.620
I think he was getting awards and nominated and like,

221
00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:38.020
and stayed on top of billboard for.

222
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.300
<v 0>A while. Yeah. And now Kanye is, is in that world. So, so it's evolving, right.</v>
