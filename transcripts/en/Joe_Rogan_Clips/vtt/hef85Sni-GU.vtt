00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.800
It reminded me of a Floyd Mayweather and he knocked out Victor

3
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.940
Ortiz when they were kissing or whatever they did. But Jim gray,

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.230
not well remember headbutted him. I know. But then they didn't,

5
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.480
they made up Victoria.

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.110
<v 1>T's went to make up at Floyd Mayweather, Floyd made with it, like, yay. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.310
Okay. Boom. Yeah. Yeah.

8
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.990
<v 0>But it wasn't Jim gray. It was, it was an older God. What's his name?</v>

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.850
Larry merchant. Yes. Larry merchant.

10
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:32.960
And Larry merchant said that if he was 50 years younger, he'd kick Floyd's.

11
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.180
I remember that. Yeah. I was like, okay, no, you wouldn't have no,

12
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:41.330
you wouldn't. But it reminded me of,

13
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.390
he got mad and then he was just going to kick his. What a crazy.

14
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.130
<v 1>Thing to say too. Literally.</v>

15
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.810
One of the greatest boxers that's ever put on gloves. Yeah. I mean,

16
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:53.000
you can make an argument who the greatest boxer of all time is,

17
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.550
but you better have Floyd Mayweather. There's going to be in there.

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.400
<v 0>Probably. If you're holding a microphone,</v>

19
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.170
you probably weren't ever going to kick his.

20
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.600
<v 2>What's up with the, uh, Mayweather fighting Logan. Paul, you see this? Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.630
<v 1>Yes. Well, Logan Paul makes some money.</v>

22
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.210
Well, one thing I will tell you, Logan,

23
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:18.290
Paul is a really good athlete and he's an enormous man. Now,

24
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.090
if it was an MMA fight, I would pick Logan Paul. Well, Logan,

25
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.230
listen to me, there's a video of Logan, Paul wrestling with Paulo Kosta.

26
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.690
It's a real live wrestling,

27
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.060
like live wrestling sparring session where he is exhibiting real

28
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:39.320
skill. He knows how to scramble. He's got real wrestling skill.

29
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:43.100
And I think he wrestled in college. Okay. No,

30
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.370
didn't just in high school, but he was good though. Right? Did he go to college?

31
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.760
He went.

32
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.640
<v 2>To OU he did wrestling as party school in the country. I.</v>

33
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.530
<v 0>Just partied. So he's from Ohio, right? Well, you know, that's why I know. Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.890
He knows.

35
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.350
<v 1>Everything. So how good was he in high school?</v>

36
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.040
<v 2>Uh, I remember hearing, I don't know if he won state, but I'll,</v>

37
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.360
I'll check that real quick.

38
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.280
<v 1>Either way. Yeah. Kim with Paula Kosta Paulo is, uh,</v>

39
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.580
the UFC's number one contender in the middle of division and the most beautiful

40
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:15.320
man in the UFC. Perfect specimen of a man and a wrecking machine.

41
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.120
Just a wrecking machine. Yeah. And the two of those guys are there.

42
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.870
They're doing wrestling, drill and sparring and Logan,

43
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:28.130
Paul is hanging in there, man, with an elite MMA, you know,

44
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:29.750
world championship, caliber fighter,

45
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:34.400
a guy who like went to war with Yolo Romero and walked him down. Right. I mean,

46
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.280
Paula Costa is a monster. He's a man in Logan.

47
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:42.170
Paul is hanging in there and I don't care what anybody says. Like the, what,

48
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.430
what I saw in that I'm like that kid is impressive. Now he's gotta be 600. Well,

49
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.510
he might actually did.

50
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.590
<v 2>Let's see when he joined the wrestling team, it says Ohio state and Athens,</v>

51
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:54.710
which is not just, oh you, so you might've joined the team. I don't know if he,

52
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.170
I don't know if he had a record if he performed with him or if he just.

53
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.220
<v 1>Did a little bit of wrestling in college, he wrestled in high school as well.</v>

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.803
Yeah. Either way.

55
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.910
<v 0>He's, he's a big dude. He's a big.</v>

56
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.820
<v 1>Dude and he's a real athlete. And one of the things that I saw, you know,</v>

57
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:09.310
I know he lost his boxing match.

58
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.920
They had a draw the first time that he lost the second time.

59
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.240
But what I'm seeing him throw punches, like he's very athletic.

60
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.790
He throws punches with good technique, you know,

61
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.370
but obviously the other kid that he boxed with did as well,

62
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.480
but there's such a difference between that and Floyd Mayweather in a boxing

63
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.640
match. It's going to be hilarious. Yeah.

64
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.300
The only thing is that Floyd is so much smaller than him. Yeah.

65
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.320
<v 0>He's gotta be compared to Logan tiny. That's why I say I got the big guy.</v>

66
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:36.630
I got the one punch Logan Kao.

67
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.900
<v 3>Oh, oh my God. That's so hilarious. Could you.</v>

68
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.010
<v 1>Imagine if he did, could you imagine if he clips Floyd Mayweather in a temple,</v>

69
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.260
is he floor? Oh. Measure.

70
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.450
<v 0>What the crowd would do? Imagine there would be a crowd. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.700
<v 1>Yeah. But um, I wonder when they're going to be able to have it,</v>

72
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.990
let's do it in China or some. Yeah, it.

73
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.350
<v 0>I don't know. I'm just pretty impressed with how Logan Paul is,</v>

74
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.640
has for a young kid has made so much money.

75
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.890
Just talking a lot of and turn these, these opportunities to flight.

76
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.780
Hi Floyd. What.

77
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.530
<v 1>I know,</v>

78
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.230
but the thing about it is like who's going to sanction that the weight

79
00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:19.110
classes are so.

80
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.810
<v 0>Different. Floyd is 50 pounds different.</v>

81
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.510
<v 1>It could be 50 pounds plus it could be more,</v>

82
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.070
I don't think Floyd's walks around at more than 155 pounds, a hundred,

83
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.200
maybe one 60 at the most, you know? And when he's in shape, you know,

84
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.933
less than that.

85
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.020
<v 0>But here's the crazy thing. I'll watch the out of it. Oh,</v>

86
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.920
wash the out of it too.

87
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.310
<v 1>I mean, everybody will, you're talking about Mike Tyson versus Roy Jones Jr.</v>

88
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.030
Like a lot of people, like, what is, what are we doing? What is happening here?

89
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.330
I liked the fact that they decided not to do it September 12th.

90
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:56.130
So it already would have happened.

91
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.830
They decided to extend it deepened to November,

92
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.520
give everybody a chance to like really train and ramp up the promotion and let

93
00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:06.510
everybody know. And, and it's more and more exciting every day. Roy Jones Jr.

94
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:09.180
Was posting some on his Instagram dude.

95
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.350
He's still got some hands speed. Yeah. See if you can find that.

96
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.820
And he he's coming in here soon.

97
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.730
<v 2>It was fine for Logan Paul wrestling coast.</v>

98
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:20.100
And I'm finding them is like play sports.

99
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.410
<v 1>Yeah. There's a little bit of boxing place barring,</v>

100
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.480
but there's a bunch of wrestling scrambling in there.

101
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:25.500
That's really impressive on.

102
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.800
<v 2>The video. I saw it was on his blog. I know, I know.</v>

103
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.900
I know I'm looking to do another retraction,

104
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.850
but it might have just looking like I might have to.

105
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.180
<v 1>I apologize. I lied about Logan, Paul wrestling.</v>

106
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.640
<v 0>Just doing an advanced Fila for everything. Just in case.</v>

107
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.580
<v 1>It is going to be one of the most ridiculous things ever though.</v>

108
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.290
If you can get a YouTube star,

109
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.100
two to box the literal best boxes. Right.

110
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.040
<v 0>Of all times. Never lost. Yeah. 15. Oh.</v>

111
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.030
<v 1>So yeah. But back it up before that. Yeah. Let him,</v>

112
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.550
let him scramble the jujitsu terrain. Okay. So this is just you Jitsu training.

113
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.140
They're uh, they're rolling around the mat, but they do some, uh, scrambles.

114
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.300
See, I don't know how much, uh, Logan has trained. You just watch the wrestling.

115
00:06:11.301 --> 00:06:15.530
Watch this though. Seriously, the kid can wrestle like, come on.

116
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:19.790
They're not showing it. What kind of horseshit is this?

117
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.310
Is this a, because they want them to look good. They want, I don't know. God it.

118
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.360
I know it's there.

119
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.640
<v 0>Hey, what about the, oh no.</v>

120
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.530
<v 1>What have we got? Come on. Show me some. That's it?</v>

121
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.150
Hmm. Well it exists it's somewhere.

122
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.453
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

123
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.410
<v 1>So he, they, they did a lot of sparring like boxing sparring, for sure. Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.770
This is just showing, let it go right here. Let's see what happens here.

125
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.360
Come on Logan. Show me some Breslin, bro.

126
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.480
This it's amazing that Paul close to can make 185 pounds. That's what's amazing.

127
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.410
The dude walks around at two 30 and he's a tank. I mean, yeah.

128
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.070
<v 2>He could be a heavyweight at 30 close to seven week class, I guess.</v>

129
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.350
At least they're close. Similar.

130
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.700
<v 3>I swear. It's real. I swear.</v>

131
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:19.300
It's not like the Antifa guys lighting fires in Portland. It's real.

132
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.460
They did find.

133
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.920
<v 1>It. The getting arrested part. I'll find it. Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.630
<v 2>Yeah. There's videos of him wrestling from like.</v>

135
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.710
<v 1>High school, but oh no. He's there's no videos of him wrestling. Paula Kosta.</v>

136
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.280
<v 2>No video. Right. There was the best I could find. I'm looking at it harder, but,</v>

137
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.793
come on.

138
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.360
<v 1>Jamie's is punishing me for the Portland thing.</v>

139
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.390
<v 2>There's this video of him saying it's getting knocked out,</v>

140
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:43.360
but I was a hundred percent. Yeah.

141
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.170
<v 1>A hundred percent fake. Yeah. Well he's smart. He's getting a lot of attention.</v>

142
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.010
I just think he's going to be whipping it air. Oh yeah.

143
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.780
<v 0>But if he, if that one connects, that's what I got my money.</v>

144
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.480
<v 1>On. That would be so bananas. I know.</v>

145
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.600
Imagine a Floyd goes cause low fifth gen one,

146
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.060
because he gets killed by Logan. Paul.

147
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.140
<v 0>Jacked. I mean he works out hard. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Super nice.</v>

148
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.490
And he's training.

149
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.310
<v 1>With Shannon. The cannon Briggs. Is he Shannon? The candidate.</v>

150
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.940
At least he was before that last fight that he did. Shannon.

151
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:18.560
The Canon was training with him. Yeah.

152
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.380
<v 0>Well and he, he hunts.</v>

153
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.920
<v 1>So that's good. Yeah. Where does he hunt? He hunted in Ohio. Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.570
What'd he look like white tail. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah.

First of all, for a lot of people that there's a hunting industry. Yeah. Yeah.

160
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.550
