00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Look, you get out in that world, Joe,</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.210
you you're famous everywhere. You've never been to these places,

3
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.770
but when you get there, they're going to know you.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.120
Or there's a thing that happened to me years ago in London,

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.270
where I was in a restaurant and I was kind of waiting for the table.

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.650
And when the lady she asked me my name, she said, what's your name to go, David.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.740
She goes with David on the list. What's your last name? Go Chapelle.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.610
And she looks up and I look around and everyone was kind of looking.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.290
I could tell they'd heard of me,

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.320
but they didn't know that I was that kind of thing. This was,

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.070
this was after I quit the show, but not long after like, oh 5 0 6.

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.080
<v 1>What did you do for those 10 years?</v>

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.040
<v 0>I was on a lot of. I learned a lot. I mean, but it was,</v>

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.500
it was a humble existence. I, you know, I,

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.640
I had had young children and uh, I was raising my kids.

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.540
I was living in a suburban life. Uh,

17
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.800
and then every once in a while I get this feeling like I'm the funniest guy.

18
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.190
I gotta get out there. And I was like, fly to Denver, do a week in Denver.

19
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:06.750
Wasn't it. And that's when he would read,

20
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:10.400
I was doing like these six hours shows I perform, I got desperate for it. I,

21
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.810
I loved it. And, uh,

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.180
at one point I had done one of these big comedy tours that live nation put

23
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:22.470
together that oddball tour. And I did all right, man. I had a good run.

24
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:25.440
I wiped out in Hartford and that was all over the internet.

25
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.530
That was the first time that thing had happened to me. Uh,

26
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.860
but for the most part, the tour went good, but it was a tough tour for me.

27
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.940
Cause it was a long show. I had to close it. You know,

28
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.880
my child was weren't as tight as they normally were, but I wouldn't,

29
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.690
I didn't suck by any means, but you know, it could have been babbling.

30
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.850
It was humbling, but it made me want to go back.

31
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.660
And, and the shows were like, every show was like 20,000 seats. They were like,

32
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:55.600
all these, what year was this around. I can't remember.

33
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.720
Bama was president, maybe, I don't know, 8, 9, 10. They.

34
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.750
<v 1>Were famous for just showing up places you would just fly.</v>

35
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.720
<v 0>Into. As the one I staffed when I started on,</v>

36
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.960
I used to in the summer I started riding motorcycles,

37
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.350
which is like very uncharacteristically, but I loved it.

38
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.530
And I wrote as I'm gonna ride my bike across country. And I did,

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.110
I cheated at a tour bus with me. It was trailers.

40
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.620
So if it rained or something or if I just want to bail, I could,

41
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.030
but I rode across country and I'd never seen America like that.

42
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.180
And we talk about how big it is and expansive. And man,

43
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:32.490
I saw all the little pockets on a bike. You know,

44
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:36.690
you really feel the environment, see things. Um,

45
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.210
and I would I'd stop and play. One of my favorite birthdays was here in Austin.

46
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.760
I was, I'd never been to Austin really. And I pulled up on sixth street.

47
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:48.810
I've been to Austin, but, and it was seen, Austin pulled up on sixth street.

48
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.681
It was my birthday.

49
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:52.620
I was riding with the guys like we wouldn't do for your birthday. And you know,

50
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:55.980
at that time we wouldn't drink and smoke and everything. I said,

51
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.980
I want to just stand up. And I found a bar. It was,

52
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.210
it was right around closing. And I saw the DJ packing up and I said,

53
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:07.540
can I use your microphone? And he recognized me. So he's like, oh yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.640
And I went up there and I just started talking. And you know what?

55
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.180
It was just like, you know, teasing the bar staff as they're cleaning up,

56
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.910
talking to patrons and then I'll get home fast buddy and all that.

57
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.460
And people laugh and they can't. It was like, dude,

58
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.890
I used to do street comedy in New York and kind of remind me of that.

59
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:27.490
Like building a crowd. And then the wild people stopped and listened.

60
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.430
Now I'm not a tech savvy dude, Twitter, it come out.

61
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.840
And I guess people had started tweeting like, yo, this just crazy.

62
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:38.110
Dave Chappelle just in here ran bam. I took like an hour.

63
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:43.090
That place was packed and I must've stayed on stage three or four hours.

64
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.400
Wow. And you know, they, they closed the door,

65
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.990
they locked the door cause it was after hours and I was in there killing it.

66
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.150
It was best birthday ever at one of the best birthday live at sometime

67
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.710
around when I turned 40.

68
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.770
I just decided that I'm going to have fun. You know, like right now, you know,

69
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.490
this is a weird thing to talk about. But after DMX passed and black Robin,

70
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.690
you know, now far more often people from my peer group pass away

71
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.130
and it just makes me feel like it's not a midlife crisis.

72
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.170
It's almost the opposite of that. It's like, look,

73
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.300
I know I don't get to stay here forever.

74
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.520
My time is limited and precious and I don't take any of these things for

75
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:27.220
granted. Don't take this money for granted this platform.

76
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.820
And I'm not talking about the fame platform. I'm talking about comedy.

77
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.440
This John was like, I made it. This genre

78
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.010
it's been so good for me.
