00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.130
<v 2>Like I look, I have a Tesla and I love my Tesla. I love it to death.</v>

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.200
It's probably the best car that I have, but there's something that I miss.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.390
And what I miss is the, I want to,

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.770
I want to feel the gear. I want to feel the,

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.370
I pushed a left pedal down the clutch engages.

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.240
I pushed the gear shift into third gear. I let the clutch out.

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.320
I pushed down the gas.

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
There's this interaction with this thing that lets me I'm, I'm engaged.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.730
I'm feeling it. There's something about those,

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.990
those kind of old cars and mechanical watches.

12
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:40.470
And there's a lot of other things that they, those things excite me.

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.280
It's like tactile. It's like a dance. I like cooking over fire.

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.990
You know what I'm saying? Like, there's,

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.670
there's things that I still like that are older things. I like running on dirt,

16
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.330
you know? There's I like those things chopping wood. There's things.

17
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.080
There's tactile experiences, you know? Yeah.

18
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.820
I know those are dying. I know they're dying. The manual gearbox is dying.

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.520
<v 0>Um, my car stole a stick. I talked about it last time I was here,</v>

20
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.900
the Mazda3 it's a sticker.

21
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.620
<v 1>Shift. People are kissing with masks on, do you understand what's happening?</v>

22
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.630
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. People are making out with masks on no one mask.

23
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.350
They're dangerous, dangerous people, but you know what I'm saying? Like,

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.290
I feel like mass kissing is like,

25
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.550
it's a step in the wrong direction. It's where we're going to become aliens.

26
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.900
We're going to become the grays with the big black eyes, that giant heads.

27
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.180
We're not going to kiss it all anymore. No,

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.880
we're going to do it all through our brain. That'd be a Relic of the past.

29
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.320
That's going to be the difference between a Tesla and a manual.

30
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:44.100
1970 Chevelle is going to be the difference between real

31
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.720
and,

32
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.490
and people just plugging into some some computer and

33
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.390
just letting it all happen inside some virtual reality experience where you

34
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:57.750
don't have to worry about cooties. That's what I'm worried about, man.

35
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.830
I'm worried about tactile human experiences and I'm not really worried.

36
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.830
I'm recognizing that the same way. If you wanted to,

37
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.980
if you wanted to look back on primates and your early primates

38
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.090
and go look, if you brought a Chimp into the future and said, Hey,

39
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:17.610
this is what it's going to be like, going to fly in planes. And you're gonna,

40
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.540
you're going to eat off plates, like that. I like swinging from trees.

41
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.520
And I like throw all my own at my enemies.

42
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.280
<v 0>Like, I can't give that up.</v>

43
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.930
<v 1>I'm not giving up throwing,</v>

44
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.430
like in my hand and giving him a good topsoil.

45
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.500
And I get together with my other Chimp buddies and we up some dude across our

46
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:41.760
imaginary line. We kill him. No, there's, there's parts of that.

47
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:46.710
That for sure. We're we're w w life is better today,

48
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.330
but I'm not a future human. I'm a current human.

49
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.890
And in, in my current state, there's tactile experiences that I enjoy.

50
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.130
I like kissing. I like holding hands.

51
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.860
I like shaking a person's hand when I meet them. I like drinking whiskey.

52
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.800
I like driving cars. I like shifting my own gears.

53
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.410
I like opening doors for myself. Whenever those,

54
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:11.470
one of those things where like you step towards it and the door opens up.

55
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.300
I never use those things. I grabbed that handle. I opened that up.

56
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.180
I like opening doors. I like it. I want to,

57
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.960
I want to experience things I want to, I want to interact with the world.

58
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.580
I like interacting. Yeah.

59
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.090
<v 0>I think there'll always be a place for that. [inaudible] no, no more.</v>

60
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.270
Well COVID has put a wrench into that. COVID.

61
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.980
<v 1>It's basically showing us what the future holds in store for us.</v>

62
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.900
What the future holds in store for us is the elimination of biological threats.

63
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.920
And there's a lot of biological threats that we take for granted,

64
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.690
like emotions, hormones, the desire to breed,

65
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.760
conquering the natural primate instincts to

66
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:59.200
dominate environments and to expand our boundaries and our kingdoms.

67
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.510
All those things are dangerous. They're not good,

68
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:06.270
but they also create art and romance and controversy. And th th they, they,

69
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.030
they provide people within enthusiasm and motivation.

70
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.650
There's all these things about being a human that creates art and,

71
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:16.440
and makes things like wine. They,

72
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.040
it makes things worth living whiskey, cigars.

73
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.470
<v 0>I do miss the kinetic nature of life pre COVID. You know what I mean?</v>

74
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:30.190
Like bumping into someone, going to something,

75
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:34.570
just serendipitously meeting someone that doesn't happen

76
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.660
any more. Really. Now everything is just so happens.

77
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.583
<v 1>In Texas.</v>

78
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.350
<v 0>I'm two days in, so I'm learning, but.</v>

79
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.700
<v 1>I'm going to take you around. Yeah. We're going to be fine. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.300
The people that don't want it to go back are the people that are most fearful.

81
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.220
The people that are like my grandmother died. I understand I get it. Yeah. It's,

82
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.540
it's a terrifying tragedy that anybody has to die from a disease,

83
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.490
but we have to recognize that we're all gonna die and you can't stop all life

84
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.460
because a disease comes along and kills. Some of us,

85
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.560
we have to recognize what can we do to mitigate the dangers of this disease.

86
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.600
Plus, what can we do to mitigate the dangers of dissolving our culture?

87
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.210
We haven't done that instead.

88
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:23.800
We've only concentrated on MIS mitigating the dangers of spreading something.

89
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.720
So stay home, wear three masks, touchdown, one wear gloves while you're driving.

90
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:32.440
Like, man, this is not life. This is not life.

91
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.620
And most of these people that are three mass people,

92
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:40.240
they don't know anything about vitamins and course attend and

93
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.890
saunas and all the different methods that you can use to stimulate your immune

94
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:47.980
system. It's like, we're, we're,

95
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:52.900
we're we don't want people to be able to take their own chances and

96
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.600
make their own risks. And the more liberal you are,

97
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.190
and the more left wing you are,

98
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.070
the more likely you are to appeal to authoritarianism.

99
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.200
And this is the one of the most discouraging aspects of our culture in 2021

100
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:07.100
is that like these,

101
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.070
all these people that are supposed to be like left wing people in my,

102
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.070
when I was a kid, I thought of I've always been left wing.

103
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.630
I've always been my family's like my, my stepdad's a hippie.

104
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.400
He was a hippie. My mom, there were,

105
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.470
there were very like open-minded left wing people there that it was all

106
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:25.880
about free expression.

107
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.620
It was all about letting people be who they are and living whatever life you

108
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.200
want it to be in and accepting people for who they are.

109
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.940
This is not what's happening. Now.

110
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:39.080
This is all this fear based weird appeal to

111
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:42.980
authoritarianism, to there's too much disinformation on the internet.

112
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.650
We have to have a czar of truth.

113
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.000
There's people calling for a czar of truth. Do you know this?

114
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.210
This is the new thing they're asking for the government to create a czar of

115
00:06:53.211 --> 00:06:56.840
truth, the government to decide what's real.

116
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.290
And what's not to just dispel disinformation.

117
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.960
So you can pull this up czar of truth.

118
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.810
This is something that CNN has talked about.

119
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.700
A lot of these like weirdo networks have talked about like, do you,

120
00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.690
do you understand these people understand what happens when you start censoring

121
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.520
people? And we start saying things like,

122
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.490
we need the government to step in the government's never been good at anything.

123
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.030
They'd never been good at anything, not one thing.

124
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.580
<v 0>And there being this whole, this whole like COVID crisis,</v>

125
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:28.460
like businesses are suffering. They're just here, businesses you're.

126
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.800
But especially in LA, it sucks. It's like.

127
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:32.510
<v 1>All the restaurants are gone.</v>

128
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.890
<v 0>Yeah. There's no contingency plan in place. And then also they're like,</v>

129
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:41.360
stay home. But then how do you make money? So you can't have it both ways.

130
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.980
You have to have like a safety net in place.

131
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.940
<v 1>The theme of the people that are making these distinctions and making these</v>

132
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.770
decisions, they don't lose a paycheck. That's the problem.

133
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.300
All these mayors and governors and health board advisors,

134
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:55.370
they don't miss a paycheck.

135
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.550
They can shut down everything and they do it for optics.

136
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.030
<v 0>Yeah. I think there's a way to be smart about this. Obviously,</v>

137
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.940
this is a real thing and it does affect people.

138
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.250
<v 1>But listen, man, you got through.</v>

139
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.610
<v 0>It. I got through it. Yeah, sure. But like I'm, I'm younger.</v>

140
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:14.510
And I know there are cases where, where people are hit really hard by this,

141
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.220
but I think sometimes there's bureaucracy attached to it where you're not even

142
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:23.570
using logic, like the comedy story, you know, they were,

143
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.080
they were all out before this like, look, it's in purple tier right now,

144
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:28.220
whatever it is. They've overplayed.

145
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.550
Outdoor dining is allowed now in Los Angeles.

146
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.420
But when I made the decision to come out here, everything was clamped down.

147
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:39.410
But before it was clamped down, they did have outdoor dining and all that.

148
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.430
And the comedy store was allowed to have outside seating in the parking lot.

149
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:46.640
You know, where we park before we do our sets. So there was tables,

150
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.530
there was chairs and they could watch TV. They could watch a football game.

151
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.510
They could watch the comedy store documentary.

152
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.790
They were able to be congregated in that parking lot.

153
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.980
But they weren't allowed to, if you put a comedian doing jokes,

154
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.510
outdoor, that was suddenly against the rules,

155
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.970
but like nothing has changed other than,

156
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.800
instead of a TV that they're focuses on. They are watching a comedian.

157
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.680
But for some reason, the city deemed that, not allowable because.

158
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.990
<v 1>The city is filled, the city government is filled with people.</v>

159
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:25.830
So stupid. They want to be a part of the city government.

160
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.090
<v 0>Yes. It just meant like on the ground park words in your mouth. All right.</v>

161
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.020
Thank you. It makes,

162
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:35.310
it makes no sense just to anyone and they have to make sense.

163
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.460
And it was frustrating because before the shutdown,

164
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:40.170
when everything was like super locked down,

165
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.700
I was doing a lot of outdoor shows in LA and I was doing all these alt shells,

166
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.000
just like in backyards and on the top of hotels and stuff.

167
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.530
But the comedy store wasn't allowed to do shows because it was called the comedy

168
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:54.870
store. There's too much attention on it.

169
00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.670
<v 1>Yeah. I think it's just a bunch of fools. That's all it is.</v>

170
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.370
It's just a bunch of fools working in government.

171
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.410
It doesn't have to make any sense.

172
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.560
They just have to keep their jobs and they have to give off.

173
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.340
They have to give off the perception that they're doing something that is

174
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:13.560
helping and it's not true.

175
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.450
