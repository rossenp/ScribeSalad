<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.613
<v 2>And this is something,</v>

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.960
a lesson we never learned in history that we really should have,

4
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.680
but in world war I,

5
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.720
Woodrow Wilson said he was gonna make the world safe for democracy.

6
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.400
That was the American mission in world war I,

7
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.960
and at the time the world certainly was not safe for democracy. I mean,

8
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.710
Europe was all monarchs pretty much. And we overthrew the monarchs, the,

9
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:23.950
the monarchies pretty much lost.

10
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:27.110
And the ones that are still there are like monarchies and name only, you know,

11
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:29.110
England and stuff like that. Um,

12
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.030
and then in the next decades you had the rise of Hitler, uh,

13
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.230
Stalin or Lenon, and then Stalin. And you're like, oh man, those,

14
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:41.980
those monarchs don't seem so bad. All of a sudden now, you know, like, oh,

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.900
it turns out you could get rid of something and something much worse can come

16
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.900
after it. You need a full length plan. But for Obama who even goes,

17
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.460
you know, I,

18
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.300
I think he acknowledged at one point that Libya was his biggest mistake.

19
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.700
And he said not having a plan for the day after, uh,

20
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.980
GDA was overthrown was a big mistake. And it's like, yeah,

21
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.050
I sure we had just lived through a rack. Like how could you not see that coming?

22
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.210
Right. How could, how could you not be like, oh yeah.

23
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:13.130
And then after that still tried to overthrow Asad in, in Syria. Right.

24
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.570
And you're you don't back on that.

25
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.690
<v 0>Oh yeah. Do you remember when they gave that speech?</v>

26
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.490
When he gave a speech on television and everybody was like,

27
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.320
this mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then they, it kind of just went.

28
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.000
<v 1>Away. It was one of the most beautiful moments in, in modern American history.</v>

29
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:31.880
People really actually stood up and stopped a war from happening. Yeah.

30
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.760
So instead they just, uh, covertly funded the Al Qaeda, uh, side of it.

31
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.320
Jimmy do broke this down when he was on your show perfectly. Yes. You know,

32
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.160
those, those guys who go like, uh, they,

33
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.790
they tell the story of Syria and it's like the, um, you know, Mike B.

34
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.230
Baker who I love, but his version of the story in Syria is like, well,

35
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.350
Asad started killing all of his own people. And so what are we gonna do?

36
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.310
You know, like, that's the story that they wanna tell you, right? It's like,

37
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.270
well, this guy just so bad, he's killing all these people you go,

38
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.100
is that really.

39
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.850
<v 0>Mike Baker's version.</v>

40
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.030
<v 1>Of it was wasn't that's a caricature of it, but that's more or less that's,</v>

41
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:03.980
that's more or less it. Right. I love Mike Bakker about the way I do too. Uh,

42
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:08.300
but, uh, so that's, but the real story is that you go, okay,

43
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:09.134
so if we're there,

44
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.220
if the narrative is that we are there because Assad's killing his own people and

45
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:16.180
oh my God, I think he used a gas attack or, oh my God, I think he did this.

46
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:19.500
And this is really dangerous. Well then why is it that, uh,

47
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.610
general Wesley Clark is telling us on video that he saw plans to have

48
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:27.930
regime change in Syria in 2003. Yeah. That was a dark video.

49
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.970
Why are there articles in 2007 about regime?

50
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.290
Cause he certainly wasn't killing his own people then. Right.

51
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.490
And then as Jimmy DOR broke down perfectly,

52
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.330
you realized that actually what happened was that the CIA and the Saudis

53
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.410
launched this operation timber, Sycamore, and they,

54
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.160
they said that we are going to arm all of the anti Asad rebels,

55
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.240
largely consisting of Al Qaeda and ISIS in an attempt to take him

56
00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:53.760
out, to have the next regime change.

57
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.920
That has bit that this plant had been in the works for years.

58
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.120
And when confronted with that threat,

59
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.960
Asad launched a brutal war against them, certainly killed a whole lot of people.

60
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.160
I mean, like if there, if there was ISIS in a town,

61
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:09.800
he'd just kill everybody in the town. Like he didn't care. Um,

62
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.080
but the story's not as simple as like, oh, he started killing his own people.

63
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.760
And so now we have to overthrow him.

64
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.000
The story is we tried to overthrow him and in response,

65
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.550
war broke out where something like 500,000 people died.

66
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.230
<v 0>Was Wesley Clark. Was he running for president when that happened?</v>

67
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.670
<v 1>I, if I'm not mistaken, I believe he ran before.</v>

68
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.230
I could be wrong about that.

69
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.630
I think was he one of the democratic candidates in 2000? I believe so.

70
00:03:35.631 --> 00:03:38.070
I believe this was after mm. After all that.

71
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.260
<v 0>The, that was a, a dark video.</v>

72
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.580
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when you saw him laying out the foundation that they had

73
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.900
and the fact that he was willing to do that and say it all in an interview on

74
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:47.734
television.

75
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.620
<v 1>Yeah. No, it was really, really creepy.</v>

76
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.060
And it's very hard to not look back at that and go like, okay, well,

77
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.380
not all of it came true. Exactly.

78
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.970
But certainly there has in an agenda since nine 11 to have one regime

79
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.490
change after the next, in the middle east, it wasn't just, oh,

80
00:04:06.491 --> 00:04:08.410
we have to go to Afghanistan and oh,

81
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:11.890
we also have to go to Iraq cuz we think they have w MDs or something. It's like,

82
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:12.110
well,

83
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.010
why then have there been these five subsequent countries that we also have to go

84
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.370
and over through and no one ever with the exception of Wesley Clark? No,

85
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.360
no politician ever told the American people, Hey, here's what our plan is. Yeah.

86
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:25.520
This is what we want to do.

87
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.320
Do you guys agree with this or do you not agree with this?

88
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.680
You have no say in this we're we're doing this and each time we're gonna claim

89
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.360
that it's completely just like, oh the humanitarian impulse, the people there.

90
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.080
<v 0>Yeah. The, uh,</v>

91
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.630
the difference between what's happening now and in the past is first of all,

92
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.990
there's so much video, right? Where you could see a guy like Wesley Clark,

93
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.893
talk about that.

94
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.390
But also that you can see video of the events actually happening.

95
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:53.270
Like we have video of Saddam, Husein being hung.

96
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.630
We have video of Kadafi being captured by those rebels where they stick a knife

97
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.910
up his mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that video is that,

98
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.460
that is one of the most bizarre videos Kadafi in shock.

99
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.220
Not, not even responding to the fact that someone just stuck a knife up his,

100
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.780
like I said, just completely gripped with terror,

101
00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.500
knowing that this is the end and that the rebels have captured and they're all

102
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.940
screaming and yelling and going crazy and.

103
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.250
<v 1>Well. Uh that's right. And, and what's happened is that the,</v>

104
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.410
the corporate press has lost their monopoly on information that

105
00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.530
they had for all of our lives. Right? Like now it's like, well,

106
00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:32.650
you can get it from all these places.

107
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.570
And that there's good and bad that comes with that.

108
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.410
But they're also now flipping out and, and you can see it,

109
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:44.200
like they're losing their grip on power and something more and more insane about

110
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:45.034
it.

111
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.000
<v 0>But they've lost the ethics of journalism.</v>

112
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like this James OEF thing on CNN where that guy who worked,

113
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.560
was he the chief, whatever.

114
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.840
<v 1>He is. Yeah. I forget his position, but a big, he was a pretty big CNN guy. And.</v>

115
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.000
<v 0>The crazy thing is they catch him on Tinder dates. So they, they gets must,</v>

116
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.760
she must have been hot. &lt;laugh&gt; hot. Girls will get you to talk.

117
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.320
So he's got this hot girl and he's telling her how they.

118
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.360
<v 1>Do propaganda,</v>

119
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.600
how they basically would accentuate anything that was wrong with Trump.

120
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.721
They would talk about,

121
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:16.320
they completely underplay anything that's wrong with Biden, which is,

122
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.670
is to be fair. Pretty obvious. Yeah.

123
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.670
To anyone who just has an open mind and watch a CNN. But to hear him say it,

124
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.590
yeah. Still was, it.

125
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.270
<v 0>Was powerful. And the fact that he said,</v>

126
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:26.790
they're gonna do it now for climate change.

127
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.630
<v 1>It's like, wow. And, and there that Pushe is already starting. Yeah. Um,</v>

128
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.670
can you imagine just like,

129
00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:35.550
if you were like the head of CNN and you have to give a meeting in the morning

130
00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:37.380
and you're like, all right, so one more guys,

131
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:42.060
if a hot chick takes you out to a bar and starts asking you to tell her about

132
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:46.020
how we're propaganda that's that's James OIF. All right. So please, please,

133
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.460
don't just start babbling about how we do propaganda. It's.

134
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.220
<v 0>So crazy. It's just, it's so weird to see it laid out like that. We're,</v>

135
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.850
you know, he's explaining how they do it, but what a Blaber mouth,

136
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.690
the fact that this guy like, you know, Hey man, this is kind of important.

137
00:07:03.691 --> 00:07:06.850
Like imagine if someone heard you say this. Yeah.

138
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.290
