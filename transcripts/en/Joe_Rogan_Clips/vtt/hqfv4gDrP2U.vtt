00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 2>We were talking today or yesterday,</v>

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:08.370
rather with Russell Peters about when was the last time you saw a good comedy

4
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.960
movie and can you make a good comedy movie anymore or have they,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.240
have they made it so dangerous in terms of like being canceled that comedy

6
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.860
movies are no longer something you can do.

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.830
<v 0>There's a movie called I think it's called the overnighters.</v>

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.800
I might need a double check on that. The guy, I think his name is Adam Scott.

9
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.370
Is that a guy? A comic actor. And then, um,

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.120
who's the guy from Rushmore. Who's great. Jason Schwartzman.

11
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:35.520
It's Jason Schwartzman and Adam Scott. I think it's called the overnighters.

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.080
And it's hilarious.

13
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.270
<v 1>How long ago did you come out? Ah.</v>

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.970
<v 0>I might need a check on that too. Maybe five years ago.</v>

15
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.830
<v 1>It was about the cutoff. It's a.</v>

16
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.720
<v 0>Really low budget all in one place movie. And it's like hysterical. I think.</v>

17
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.780
<v 1>I would wonder, like, what is the cutoff in terms of like,</v>

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.560
when was the last time of really good?

19
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.220
They over overnight it's 2015. Yeah.

20
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.820
Like when was the last time there was like an edgy comedy.

21
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.350
<v 0>This one's not edgy, but, but it's good. I mean, I guess there's some,</v>

22
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.410
it depends on what edgy means. So many different things to different people,

23
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.430
but it's really.

24
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.900
<v 1>You know what I watched the other day super bad. Yeah. That's holy.</v>

25
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.480
You could never make that movie too.

26
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.380
<v 0>It's amazing. How many things? Just a few years later,</v>

27
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.170
I mean the new bore ad I thought was pretty funny. Oh yeah.

28
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.150
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. That, but that's a weird one, right? Like he figured out a loophole,</v>

29
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.350
you kind of doing parody and you're doing this thing where you're freaking

30
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:38.310
people out, like when she has her period at the dance off. Right. You know,

31
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.090
like there's,

32
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.080
there's things that he could get away with in that it's a beautiful genre in

33
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:44.130
that regard. Right. You,

34
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:48.180
you could do stuff in a kind of parody movie that you can't do in a regular

35
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:49.014
movie.

36
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.350
<v 0>But don't you find there's never been, maybe I'm wrong.</v>

37
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.950
I feel like maybe I'm such a comedy that I'm like,

38
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.820
don't you feel like there's not never been a ton of great comedy films.

39
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:01.650
I feel like there's like a few addicted.

40
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.490
<v 1>Um, it's hard to do movie.</v>

41
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.710
Like I watched stepbrothers stepbrothers the other night.

42
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:12.360
It's another movie you could never do today. It's I think it's hard to do those.

43
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:13.680
Like some people just like Judd,

44
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.280
Apatow's really good at making those kinds of moves or was really good.

45
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.740
I don't know if he's made one of those kinds of movies in a while,

46
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:24.600
but those like really ridiculous over the top movies,

47
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:26.490
but the language and the subject matter.

48
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:29.490
And it's like the stuff that they talk about and say to each other,

49
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.850
I just don't think you can do that today. Or if you did do that,

50
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.800
you would face a tremendous amount of criticism, even though most people agree.

51
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:41.970
Like if you would try to watch stepbrother today, rock solid, funny movie, man.

52
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
Really funny. Right. I was crying, like crying, laughing.

53
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:48.510
There's some really funny moments in that movie where you're like,

54
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:53.040
I forgot how good this is when he rubs his balls over the dudes drum set. Right?

55
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.420
Like there's so many of these moments where you're like, this is so crazy, but.

56
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.350
<v 0>It feels like now people are getting more comedy from podcasts and stand up</v>

57
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.980
than movies because it's making, like, I watched the Oscars and like,

58
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:07.240
they didn't even make a joke.

59
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:11.050
There was like zero jokes because everybody's so afraid to.

60
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.550
<v 1>This year.</v>

61
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.210
<v 0>I think there was no host. It was just like, uh, we just bring people up.</v>

62
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.490
I mean, they weren't even like attempting to do jokes.

63
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:22.060
The only jokes were the voiceover lady that says like,

64
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.770
stay tuned coming up, Brad Pitt. I swear to God Brad Pitt's coming.

65
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.370
That was like the only attempt at humor. It was like really.

66
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.660
<v 1>Well, the,</v>

67
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.190
when Kevin Hart didn't do it because they wanted him to apologize for

68
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.990
jokes that were homophobic for many years ago. Um, and he said, look,

69
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.990
I'm not going to do this. I've already apologized for those jokes. I evolved.

70
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:48.010
I grew, I'm not the same person anymore. And that's fine. I don't need to do it.

71
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.920
You know? And then they didn't have a host that year, I believe.

72
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.370
And I think that's it. I don't think they've had a host since then. Right?

73
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.950
<v 0>Ah, I don't know. You might be right about that.</v>

74
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:59.530
I know the one year they had two,

75
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.800
it was James Franco and Anne Hathaway hosted it.

76
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.200
Cause they did none comics,

77
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.240
but it does feel like right now it's like rude to even try

78
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:15.130
to be funny on that high level. It's very bizarre.

79
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.320
I was listening to a podcast the other day that I love.

80
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.330
That's sort of like a mental health podcast.

81
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.660
And this lady was telling the host who was like a straight white guy.

82
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.240
He was like, I'm learning about privilege. And he was saying,

83
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.650
even my self-deprecating humor is a little bit offensive

84
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.580
because it's my privilege to do self-deprecating humor.

85
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:36.940
Because as a straight white male, people assume I'm joking,

86
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:41.740
but other people couldn't make such jokes because of whatever

87
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.491
history.

88
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:47.440
And they were literally discussing earnestly how straight white

89
00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:50.140
men shouldn't really try to be funny.

90
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.150
<v 1>There was that guy castrato.</v>

91
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.790
<v 0>It felt a little [inaudible]. I mean, it was just a really bizarre conversation.</v>

92
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.080
<v 1>You can never be woke enough. That's the problem. It keeps going,</v>

93
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.540
keeps going further and further and further down the line.

94
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.960
And if you get to the point where you capitulate,

95
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:10.600
where you agree to all these demands,

96
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.980
it will eventually get to straight white men are not allowed to talk, right.

97
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.400
Because it's your privilege to express yourself when other people of color have

98
00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.920
been silenced throughout history, it will be,

99
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.240
you're not allowed to go outside because so many people were imprisoned for so

100
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:27.280
many years. I mean, I'm not joking. No, I know.

101
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:30.340
I know it really we'll get there. It's that crazy? You know,

102
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.050
we just gotta be nice to each other man.

103
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.030
And there's a lot of people that are taking advantage of this

104
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:40.720
weirdness in our culture. And then that becomes their thing.

105
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.600
Their thing is calling people out for their privilege,

106
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.500
calling people out for their position, you know, it's so

107
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.500
crazy times. Yeah.

108
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.251
<v 0>Yeah. Most definitely.</v>

109
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:55.660
But I do feel like there's more there's it's feels like I hear more people sort

110
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:57.950
of speaking out against that kind of stuff.

111
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.470
Then I hear from people saying that's a good idea.

112
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.380
Like I think there's way more people that are like what that's insane. Well,

113
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:06.290
especially in our circles. True. Yeah. Maybe I'm in a bubble. I don't know.

114
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.130
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, we were definitely in a comedy bubble. I mean, this is what we do.</v>

115
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.970
We talk. Right. You know, when you talk and you see something stupid like that,

116
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.280
like I was a straight white man. I shouldn't be self-deprecating like.

117
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.350
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I'm in a lot of trouble if we can't do that, but.</v>

118
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.400
<v 1>We're humans. If you're a human being, you should be able to express yourself.</v>

119
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:30.200
You shouldn't have to take into account all the other people that are either

120
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:34.940
not heard or not expressing themselves currently or not in the

121
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:38.990
same, you know, whatever category is you like, come on, man.

122
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:42.340
We can't do that because that's what you're doing is you're, you're,

123
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.000
you're forcing yourself to think double and

124
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.810
triple about every single thing you say and whether or not you have the right to

125
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:53.030
say it, whether or not you have the right to express yourself.

126
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.060
<v 0>Yeah. And then, then, then nobody's having fun.</v>

127
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.120
That doesn't seem like a fun way to live at all. It's a terrible widow.
