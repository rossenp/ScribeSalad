00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 0>So, um, tell me about this carnivore diet.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.670
Cause I had Sean Baker in here and he talked to me about it,

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:08.490
but he doesn't have any science, you know, there's no,

4
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:12.840
like he doesn't have any like real tests or any long-term studies or anything

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.630
like that. And you know, I, I, I'm a person that believes in balance and I, I,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.790
I think that you need phytonutrients, you need plant fiber.

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:24.630
I think there's a lot of healthy stuff that you get from plants. Um,

8
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.460
I'm big believer in eating meat though, but all meat, you guys do an all meat.

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.050
<v 1>I think gonna find it. I think there's some holes one at a time. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.720
I think there's some, I think there's some holes in every diet, right?

11
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
I think when you go and you make the decision to only eat meat, then uh,

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.320
some rational thought should come into your head.

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.710
Maybe when I switch all the way to just meet all the time,

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.290
maybe there's a possibility I'm going to eat too much meat.

15
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.340
And so maybe that would make sense to bring in some fruit and bring in some

16
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.370
vegetables, just so you're not eating too much meat for the simple reason,

17
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.070
vegetables have been shown and, and there's, you know,

18
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:02.640
you can get a study to show you anything. Uh, but there's study a study.

19
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:06.990
That's been done on 200,000 people that went on for 14 years and they studied,

20
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.011
uh, vegetables.

21
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.310
They study every type of vegetable and they found that they were more neutral

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.510
than they were harmful or good for you. They found that fruit was a little bit,

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.540
uh, better for you. And again, you can have any study say, wait a minute.

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.373
<v 0>What is this study?</v>

25
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.420
<v 1>It's called a pure study. Wait a minute.</v>

26
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.450
<v 0>They said, vegetables are neutral. What does that mean?</v>

27
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.240
<v 1>They're neutral. They're just really help you that much.</v>

28
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.060
They weren't necessarily great. And they weren't necessarily bad. I.

29
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.050
<v 0>Don't know what the Harrison to.</v>

30
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.990
<v 1>What the, I don't know what their standard was for what they were looking for.</v>

31
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.810
Exactly. But the main thing they were looking for was, uh,

32
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.320
it being protective in terms of your heart. That was their main,

33
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.900
the main thing they were looking at.

34
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.330
So they found out that saturated fat is protective of your heart.

35
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.790
They found out that cholesterol is actually protective of your heart.

36
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.450
They found out that salt is PR. Now it's all like, you know,

37
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:55.410
without you can't take in tons and tons of salt, because then something's gonna.

38
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.830
<v 0>Kill you. If you eat a pound of salt, you're dead, you know, assaults.</v>

39
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.300
One of those things it's really good for you.

40
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:03.570
It's an essential mineral to a certain extent, but if you take too much.

41
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.450
<v 1>So I think any of these things can be done too far.</v>

42
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:09.960
I jumped on a carnivore diet just to give it a shot and to see exactly what it

43
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:10.794
was about.

44
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.320
<v 0>Because you talked to Sean, Sean Baker. Yeah, he.</v>

45
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.680
<v 1>Was, he was on your podcast. I got inspired to do it. He was already doing it.</v>

46
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.190
So I was like, all right, let me try it out. I tried it out, got leaner,

47
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.840
felt better. And I was like, this is pretty.

48
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.800
<v 0>Cool. And why'd you start it.</v>

49
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.420
<v 2>So I was doing a ketogenic diet for over a year and lost a lot of weight on that</v>

50
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.680
was doing great feeling.

51
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.600
<v 0>Really good, man. You look and healthy.</v>

52
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.800
<v 1>I appreciate it. I still have.</v>

53
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.700
<v 2>I still have a long way to go. In my opinion, you know, I,</v>

54
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.480
this is a work in progress, but, um, the reason I did it was really simple.

55
00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:43.620
It's a dietary intervention. Um, I went through sobriety as you know,

56
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.640
I was a drug addict and an alcoholic for about six years.

57
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.430
And when I went through, um, sobriety, that's, uh,

58
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:53.340
that's an intervention like there it's, there's something wrong,

59
00:02:53.341 --> 00:02:54.780
there's a problem. We need to fix it.

60
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.770
So my problem now was arthritis and I needed something that was like an

61
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:03.100
intervention that would get me from, you know, uh,

62
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.900
being arthritic and in pain and not being able to lift, to being able to lift.

63
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.830
And so there, some of this might be a placebo effect of me going like, well,

64
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:14.580
I'm on this diet and I feel great and whatever. And so I'm,

65
00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:16.600
I'm now lifting more. Um,

66
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.780
some of it may be a placebo effect and that's okay with me if it is,

67
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.330
but I feel excellent on this diet.

68
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:25.210
And I think the reason is I'm getting a lot more protein in,

69
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.510
I wasn't getting enough protein on keto because I was listening to everybody

70
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:31.870
say, well, it'll knock you out of ketosis if you eat too much protein.

71
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.050
And that's what I constantly was being told, but I wasn't muscular.

72
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:38.710
I didn't have, I wasn't being able to put on muscle.

73
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.790
<v 0>Well, you, you were constantly testing your, um, blood levels. Were you?</v>

74
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.970
<v 2>We using a meter? Yeah. Every day, about three or four times.</v>

75
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:48.610
Like I'm crazy with it because you're out of ketosis.

76
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.760
The things that would knock me out of ketosis were just like mainly anything

77
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:53.350
with carbohydrates. Um,

78
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.290
I wasn't really having too much of a problem with protein because I wasn't

79
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.260
eating a lot of protein, but, um, there was,

80
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.470
there were things that if I cheated on my diet, for example, of course,

81
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:04.690
that would usually kick me out of ketosis.

82
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.580
But then I also got to a point where you become so fat adapted that you become

83
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.520
what we like to call metabolically flexible,

84
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.430
metabolic flexibility just means you can switch from being a fat burner.

85
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.550
You know, I'm mostly a fat burner for the most part, cause I'm eating high fat.

86
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.040
But then if I do eat something with sugar in it,

87
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.920
it doesn't really affect me that much because I,

88
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.410
because I'm used to it 90%, yeah.

89
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.610
Going with the fat so I can kind of move back and forth between those two

90
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.430
things. But what I realized on the carnivore diet,

91
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.400
when I switched over to carnivore the whole time I was thinking, man,

92
00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.810
if I could just have an apple,

93
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.350
I would feel like I would feel so much better because just eating the steak,

94
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.310
it's killing me and it's driving me crazy. I was a killing you just mentally.

95
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.580
I wasn't ready for it. I wasn't tough enough to just say, okay,

96
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:50.260
I'll just have steak on a plate.

97
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.760
<v 1>Well, you automatically use intermittent fasting almost cause you're like,</v>

98
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:58.030
you don't always have a hamburger in your pocket or you don't always run through

99
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.490
in and out burger or whatever it might be. But yeah,

100
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:03.700
you end up utilizing some intermittent fasting and you're like, man.

101
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:06.760
The only food I have to eat is a hamburger or a steak.

102
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.880
<v 2>That's where I was at. And it was hamburger or steak. And I'm like, well,</v>

103
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:13.090
how about an apple? So I talked to our friend, Stan efforting,

104
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.660
who's a bodybuilder and he's huge jacked. And he's also a powerlifter and.

105
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.790
<v 1>Soup the one years old too. And.</v>

106
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.070
<v 2>Jack super one of the smartest guys. I know.</v>

107
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.700
And he sent me that study that I sent to you with the, about the fruit.

108
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.020
And I don't know if you watched that or not,

109
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:30.670
but basically they did a large scale study with fruit and they found out that

110
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.930
the fruit actually would drive blood glucose down instead of dry,

111
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.250
instead of bringing it up when taken with protein, like red meat.

112
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.010
And so I'm like looking at this going like, well,

113
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.990
it's not going to drive my glucose up. I mean,

114
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:47.440
that'd be the one thing I'm concerned with, why not have some fruit?

115
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:50.560
And so then I'm talking with Stan about it. He was saying like,

116
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:54.160
I think fruit is totally fine. And I think you can have as much as you want.

117
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.530
And so I sort of switched over. It's crazy though, because.

118
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.650
<v 0>That's that's I.</v>

119
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.530
<v 1>Mean, your body, how did, how was your body, not your.</v>

120
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.610
<v 2>Useless level? They've done studies where they've,</v>

121
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.530
where they've studied fruit toast.

122
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.840
So like everybody thinks fruit toast is really bad.

123
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.050
<v 0>But they think that because of high fructose corn syrup and fructose.</v>

124
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.270
<v 2>Is really bad when it's outside of fruit. Right. But for some reason, um,</v>

125
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.360
fruit fruit has these phytonutrients. It has fiber in it.

126
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.710
And those things sort of like protect you from what's going on in the sugar.

127
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:28.520
They actually, th there's phytonutrients in fruit, like say an apple,

128
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.540
there's certain phytonutrients in there that won't allow your small intestine to

129
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:34.670
like absorb the fat. And so it,

130
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.720
it actually helps you to digest things like red meat that have high fat.

131
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.251
<v 1>There's yeah.</v>

132
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:42.230
There's co-factors and fruit that help you digest the sugars in them.

133
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.590
<v 2>I'm not sure about, I'm not a doctor, I'm a filmmaker. So I started,</v>

134
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.893
I'm basically,

135
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.830
I'm asked a lot of questions and a lot of people and start figuring things out

136
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.840
and then it's trial and error. Um,

137
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.500
right now I'm in a trial trial and error part and it seems like it's been

138
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:59.180
working pretty good. So now are you.

139
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.200
<v 0>Getting your blood work done?</v>

140
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.710
<v 2>Yes. Um, just got my blood work done, um,</v>

141
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.440
from last month and it, uh,

142
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.080
everything improved from Quito to carnivore.

143
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.320
I didn't really have any cholesterol issues. Um,

144
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.130
I didn't have any the, uh, what was it? What were my issues?

145
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.600
<v 1>We we've had our blood work done probably four or five times in the last year or</v>

146
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:25.430
so I would say. Yeah. And, uh, you know, not all the numbers are, are great,

147
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:28.280
but for the most part it's been pretty healthy. The cholesterol has been good.

148
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:33.200
The triglycerides have been good. Um, this doesn't show up in your blood, uh,

149
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.800
just, it's not in the hot, not in the high range of, you know, of what,

150
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.200
what it shows you on the, uh, on the sheet.

151
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.020
And then we also had other people for what, uh, oh,

152
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:46.030
in terms of like the triglycerides and the, the cholesterol and stuff like that,

153
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.250
we'll be talking about, well.

154
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.100
<v 0>Like what you said, and what's not good. No, I'm just saying.</v>

155
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.670
<v 1>Everything's, everything's been pretty good. Like this last time I did have my,</v>

156
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.610
um, uh, I had one of my markers. Okay.

157
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.380
<v 2>We both had high C-reactive protein and we don't, we're not sure why.</v>

158
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.820
So that's something that we have to like look into what is C-reactive protein,

159
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.550
it's a marker for inflammation. And my C-reactive specifically of the heart.

160
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.990
Yeah. My C-reactive protein. This mine was really high on keto,

161
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.920
but then after I went keto to carnivores, it came way, way down. So I don't,

162
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.390
I don't know where it is right now.

163
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.200
<v 1>So, uh, had a really high mine registered really high at a nowhere.</v>

164
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.140
It was totally fine with all the blood work I've had done.

165
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.890
And the last one I had done it, skyrocketed people were saying, well,

166
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:32.840
maybe it's because you worked out beforehand or.

167
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.410
<v 0>You'd have to be what you consistent in when you ate,</v>

168
00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.500
when you got your test done, were you guys on a fast.

169
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:41.810
<v 1>Beforehand? So I might've it up.</v>

170
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.650
<v 0>Oh, you it up for sure. Yeah.</v>

171
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.530
You train test yourself after the way you train, you train like a thing.

172
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.690
<v 2>Yeah. The blood work it's, it's, you know,</v>

173
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.510
it's a snapshot in time and we hear that a lot.

174
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.050
And I think that that's important to realize and recognize that, um, it's just,

175
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.210
you know, this one snapshot in time and we constantly change all the time. So.

176
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:07.350
<v 0>Particularly important with dietary cholesterol, with cholesterol in the blood,</v>

177
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:12.120
the way it registers, if you have a big, you know, fat filled meal, right.

178
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.080
And then go and get a blood test versus you fasting it's like,

179
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.930
how was your body absorbing? This is, what's really an important,

180
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.720
how's your body absorbing these essential nutrients, nutrients, not like what,

181
00:09:23.721 --> 00:09:25.440
what happens right after you eat,

182
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.290
because your body knows what to do with that stuff.

183
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.450
<v 2>My cholesterol was one 90, which is good. I mean, I want it,</v>

184
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.800
they want it to be under 200,

185
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.340
but I thought it was really interesting was my HDL went way up from, uh,

186
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.140
by like 60 points went up, uh, going from Quito to carnivore. Well.

187
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.780
<v 0>Are you eating a lot of fatty cuts? Like ribbons.</v>

188
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.610
<v 2>Mostly rib-eyes yeah.</v>

189
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.450
<v 0>I like a lot of dietary fat. I like a lot of like meat fats.</v>

190
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.620
<v 2>I think there's a certain point. Right? Cause, um, I, I don't know before,</v>

191
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.560
when I was doing the ketogenic diet, um,

192
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.870
the fat is kind of free flowing because, uh,

193
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:00.720
you make your Bulletproof coffees and you just dump it fat and everything.

194
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.300
You're putting butter on everything. Right. But when you have,

195
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.690
when you have a steak, what's really nice about having a steak.

196
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:10.710
Is your rate about 65 to 75% fat already?

197
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.500
Like just kind of born out of the.

198
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.870
<v 0>Box. Yeah. You're eating corn, fed beef is that.</v>

199
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.540
<v 2>I eat both. Um, I think that, um, the difference between the grass fed and the,</v>

200
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:21.570
and the grain Fred,

201
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.590
there really isn't a substantial amount of proof of how much better that is.

202
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.220
I do know that grass fed beef has five times the amount of omega-3.

203
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.250
So you always want to pick grass fed beef when you can,

204
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.940
but a lot of people can't afford it. And also, uh, the, for me,

205
00:10:35.941 --> 00:10:37.800
the best meat is at Costco.

206
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:41.460
That's the best tasting meat that you're going to find. I've been everywhere.

207
00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.220
<v 0>Why is Costco better? It just.</v>

208
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.090
<v 2>Tastes the best around for the best. They have the best meat. They.</v>

209
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.110
<v 0>Some like expensive butcher shop. It's corn.</v>

210
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.850
<v 2>Fed. I think Costco, Costco is all organic now, too.</v>

211
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.620
<v 0>That's a weird word though. That word is so loosely defined as organic. Well,</v>

212
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:04.470
we didn't spray it with a chemical right before he gave it to you.

213
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.680
So there is a, um, what is exactly organic.

214
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.150
<v 2>You have to pay to get organic status too. That's a weird thing. You know,</v>

215
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.370
you have to pay a lot of money. Cause I remember, um,

216
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.360
talking to Bulletproof and the guy was telling me, like, you have to, uh,

217
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.200
to Dave Asprey is telling me you have to pay money to get, uh,

218
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.910
recognized as being organic. So.

219
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.520
<v 0>Whatever that guy says, fat.</v>

220
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.210
<v 2>Greatest. Sure. I know, but I'm saying you have to pay to get it to be yeah.</v>

221
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:34.080
<v 0>I wonder if that's true. Yeah. I don't know if that's true. It is.</v>

222
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.913
<v 2>True. Is it.</v>

223
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.533
<v 0>Mia? Well, I mean,</v>

224
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.770
I'm sure it costs money to get tested and to make sure that you're certified.

225
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.660
<v 2>Inside something like that. You have to pay money for it.</v>

226
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.800
<v 0>I mean, there, there has to be some sort of a testing costs money. I mean,</v>

227
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:49.830
but when you're looking at the standards like that, what does that mean?

228
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:54.190
It means no antibiotics, no added hormones. Right? Is that what it food?

229
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.560
It means no pesticides, right? Yeah. I mean,

230
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.370
excuse me for plants and vegetables and fruits and plants. Um, what,

231
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:04.480
the one thing that concerns me, um, with grass fed meat is that you're,

232
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:08.470
you're eating. Um, well you, you definitely get a more expensive cut,

233
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.850
but you're eating an animal that is eating what it's supposed to eat. You know,

234
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:17.230
when you're eating, like I've had Y goo beef and Colby beef, it's delicious.

235
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:20.290
It's awesome. But that thing's dead. That's a dying animal.

236
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:24.010
That's like eating a giant fat guy about to have a heart attack. I mean,

237
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:27.850
all that marbling, that's not supposed to happen. Like you shoot a bison,

238
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:32.740
like a free range, bison, you get a dark Ruby, red Hunka meat.

239
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:34.720
I mean, and that's all I can say.

240
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.020
<v 2>I completely agree with you. Um, but there,</v>

241
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.490
there isn't science to really support that eating a cow that was fed with soy or

242
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:46.420
corn is necessarily way worse. And so, um,

243
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.250
I might just be stupid for waiting for that to come out.

244
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.531
<v 0>Hold on a second.</v>

245
00:12:50.531 --> 00:12:55.150
You just said that there's way more omega fatty acids and grass fed

246
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:58.900
beef. That's omega fatty acids are essential for brain development,

247
00:12:58.901 --> 00:12:59.830
muscle development.

248
00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:03.370
There's so there's so many benefits to ascend those essential fatty acids.

249
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:06.130
And if those are more present in grass fed meat,

250
00:13:06.131 --> 00:13:09.100
wouldn't you just assume that grass fed meat is more nutritious?

251
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.870
<v 2>Yeah. I w I would say that it has more, it has moral Meg has more omega three.</v>

252
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:18.070
It might be more nutritious than in that, that particular, uh,

253
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:21.390
way that I say, like, you know, is the cost benefit. You know,

254
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.240
the other day I went and bought, um, grass fed meat from whole foods,

255
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.200
33 99, a pound for a filet, 1999,

256
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:34.120
a pound at Costco for a Flay. The Costco one is so much better.

257
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.970
The one from whole food was almost not edible like it did,

258
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:40.390
didn't it didn't taste good. It's real tough to meet. So, and so.

259
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.673
<v 0>Top filet.</v>

260
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.220
<v 2>At whole foods, I don't know why they'd have crappy meat for some reason.</v>

261
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:46.390
<v 1>Grass fed stuff. Sometimes.</v>

262
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.920
<v 0>You get a sponsorship for Costco right before. No.</v>

263
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.820
<v 2>No, no, no. But what I'm saying is that,</v>

264
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:55.840
um, I've,

265
00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.670
I've gone to a lot of places to try to find what meat I thought tastes the

266
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:04.060
best then. Um, you know, so for me,

267
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.130
sometimes I have to like,

268
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.190
you have to eat a lot of meat and if it doesn't taste that good,

269
00:14:09.191 --> 00:14:12.250
you're not going to get through it. So I prefer to have meat that tastes better.

270
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.250
I like 'em for grass fed meat.

271
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.800
I like to use grass fed beef patties,

272
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.020
cause they're a little fattier and it just tastes really,

273
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.260
those tastes are enemy, you know, but the grass fed steaks just,

274
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.440
they don't really taste as good. So I just kind of switched back and forth.

275
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.310
I think these are some.

276
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.310
<v 1>Smaller issues. These aren't the main things that we're really trying to fight.</v>

277
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.170
You know, my brother and I, we just, uh, took on to do another film and he,

278
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.680
you know, he and I are doing this one together on nutrition and we're just,

279
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.630
we're trying to find out some truths. I mean,

280
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:43.420
we're trying to find out about grass fed and organic and all these different

281
00:14:43.421 --> 00:14:44.380
things. Uh,

282
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:47.920
but mainly we're just trying to figure out how the do we help fight obesity?

283
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:51.710
How do we help fight diabetes? How do we help people, uh,

284
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.120
gain control of their diet?

285
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.790
And I think that's really truly we're talking about is control.

286
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.450
And you look at it, something like a ketogenic diet, in my opinion,

287
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.290
it's one of the few diets that can really help people with control of their diet

288
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:07.160
because it can help break up the cravings. And that's really ultimately,

289
00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.210
I think where our fight is,

290
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.860
it's against cravings of all these convenient foods that tastes so good. Well,

291
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:16.160
the crave interface all the time, refined carbohydrates and sugars.
