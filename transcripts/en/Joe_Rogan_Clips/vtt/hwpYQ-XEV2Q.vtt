00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. If aliens are real,</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.980
I'm not a hundred percent of events, but I'm probably like 90% convinced.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.840
But if they are real, I leave in the room for. It's like, Jamie,

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.800
get a picture of your shirt.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.560
<v 1>The shirt you're wearing, why we're talking.</v>

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.920
<v 0>About that? It's a UFO. It says, can they see it?</v>

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.980
Believe that that's a dope shirt.

8
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.360
<v 2>That's a saucer. If I've ever seen one. I think if they're, if they're here,</v>

9
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:27.810
they're not going.

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.640
<v 0>To let us. That's what I think.</v>

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.540
That's what I think they're gonna swoop in and go, Hey, Hey, Hey, well,

12
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.550
that's fine, Jack.

13
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.570
<v 3>I'm 25. Right? I can't speak on anything,</v>

14
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.760
but just looking from past experience and

15
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.600
you know, there's like drawings, like even in the Mona Lisa,

16
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:50.780
there's a weird thing or whatever in the background and,

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.930
but there's a spike. It's a spike in like,

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.860
because.

19
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.450
<v 1>It's getting pretty weird here.</v>

20
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.620
<v 0>The spike,</v>

21
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.820
they think it's hard to tell because sometimes when people talk about UFO's a

22
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:09.290
bunch of other people hallucinate or lie, like there's a lot of that, right?

23
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.940
So every time there's a real legit UFO, you get a bunch of nuts, just nutcases,

24
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.070
who just want to tell crazy about being taken.

25
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.410
<v 3>I mean, would you say what it looks like I was in,</v>

26
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.960
I was probably 16.

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.190
I was at in upstate New York and, uh,

28
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.750
it would just stay there. So I, whoa, let me precursor this.

29
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.850
My aunt and uncle were very strict and we had to go to bed at a very

30
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:40.040
strict deadline, probably 10:00 PM.

31
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.370
And I was looking out the window with my cousin and it's just a

32
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:50.960
light that just stays there and then just goes off.

33
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.760
I mean, you just, you can't explain it.

34
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.860
<v 0>Well, if you're seven you're 17 at the time, 16, 16. How, uh,</v>

35
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.540
probably how strong is this memory when you're like looking at it when you try

36
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.980
and remember medium. Medium. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean,

37
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:13.390
there's something there for sure.

38
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:16.240
Something took off and did something that didn't make sense to you. For sure.

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
<v 3>Hm. And then Utah, I mean, their happens all the time. I mean, even here in LA,</v>

40
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.640
I can't tell you how many times. Cause I used to live in Tarzana. So,

41
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.220
uh, there was like a balcony here and it looked kinda like,

42
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.810
it sounds corny, but like a classic, like forcefield,

43
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.950
whenever you think of a force field and it just kinda goes like this and it's

44
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.190
kind of like a dome in a circular shape

45
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.560
and it just goes like this and it goes back in whoa,

46
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.570
in Tarzana looking down at the city. And I'm like,

47
00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.860
how did no one else see this? They might have,

48
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.040
but I was there with like four other people and they saw it too.

49
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.550
<v 0>The thing about unique events is if a unique event happens and</v>

50
00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:10.530
it never happens again. It's hard to remember.

51
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.290
It's hard to be sure what you saw. It's hard, but if aliens are visiting us,

52
00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:17.610
like how often are they doing it?

53
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.880
Like unique events would probably be what it would be, right.

54
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.170
It'd be like occasionally once every six months someone sees one somewhere,

55
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.380
but they're here all the time. They probably just know how to evade detection.

56
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.030
I mean, it just, if something can travel here from another planet,

57
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.870
it's going to be able to know when they're being watched and when they're not

58
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:37.800
being watched, that's not going.

59
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.640
<v 3>To be hard. That's why you gotta wonder if it's like intentional. I.</v>

60
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.870
<v 0>Think there's enough.</v>

61
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.000
Talk about it now that we're probably going to find out what it is in our

62
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:50.250
lifetime. I never would think that before.

63
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.340
I think the government withheld information, for whatever reason,

64
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:58.110
maybe they think people are scared. Maybe they think it's a threat to gov to,

65
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.560
you know,

66
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.730
the national security to have a bunch of people worried that aliens are flying

67
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:04.860
around us all the time. There's nothing we can do about it.

68
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.330
Maybe they like had a conversation and they thought maybe it'd be better to keep

69
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:13.110
people in the quiet or keep them in the dark so that they don't freak out

70
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.520
because there's nothing we can do about it. Anyway,

71
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.030
if we just tell them that there's aliens that are visiting us all the time,

72
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.680
right? That's not going to be good.

73
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.940
They're not going to pay attention to taxes and mortgage rates and the stock

74
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:24.300
market.

75
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.170
<v 1>They're going to care about uranium and.</v>

76
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.220
<v 0>They're around us all the time. They're going to be,</v>

77
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.270
people are going to freak out. So I think like little drops of F like this,

78
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.700
the recent one, they said where they, yeah. Whether.

79
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.330
<v 3>The Pentagon just say, yeah, they said they've.</v>

80
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.500
<v 0>Recovered crafts that are not from this world.</v>

81
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.580
Not made on earth, not made on earth, not made on earth.

82
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.150
They're basically saying we don't know what the it is, but we didn't make it

83
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.210
that's bananas.

84
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.160
And I think that's going to lead to more and more information coming out about

85
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:01.860
it. Well, we're going to try to get a sense of understanding.

86
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:03.870
Like how long have they known this? You know,

87
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:08.820
how much of like all that Roswell New Mexico was true or tell us what was

88
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:09.654
going on.

89
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.860
<v 3>It backtracking. You gotta wonder if like, oh,</v>

90
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.740
we've been hiding this the whole time. Or this is the first time for real,

91
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.200
that we don't.

92
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.610
<v 0>Know. This is what I like to think.</v>

93
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.750
I like to think that the people that are in charge at the Pentagon are Patriots

94
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.430
and they realize it's probably better.

95
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.990
Especially when you're dealing with the United States in this kind of turmoil

96
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.980
that they're in right now.

97
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.420
It's crazy between racial turmoil and turmoil with the police and

98
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.220
turmoil with, uh, people, uh, protesting and cities and blocking traffic.

99
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:47.580
There's so much crazy turmoil. They'd be like, no, one's even gonna notice now,

100
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.080
just let it say it now to say, yeah, we got UFO's like, everything is so crazy.

101
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.260
The new cycle of any crazy story. Like this is only a few days.

102
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.370
And then people forget.

103
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.280
<v 3>Well, or it's just people already know,</v>

104
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.540
and it's just normalization or you, and you think about movies.

105
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.460
It's just normalizing you to the idea that I can't even

106
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.210
like the Canadian. I don't quote me on this.

107
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:17.810
But a Canadian, someone in office was like,

108
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.580
there's like seven species of aliens in the U S government.

109
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.970
<v 0>It would be crazy if it was true that, you know, Tommy Lee Jones and Wilson.</v>

110
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:33.880
<v 1>Y'all remember that all along. Yeah. Check that out. Please fact,</v>

111
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:37.030
check that for me. A loony person though. I have no idea.

112
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.740
<v 0>People can get elected and still be crazy. That's a proper, certain,</v>

113
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.230
that's a problem. You know, just because like,

114
00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:48.280
when you hear about someone having like a really high profile job and they say

115
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:48.971
something crazy,

116
00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:51.790
it doesn't mean they're not crazy just because they're the prime minister of

117
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:54.430
some country. They could be out of their mind. What do we got?

118
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.790
<v 1>It was kind of close to that. How close?</v>

119
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.320
<v 0>Well, yeah, as former defense minister claims that aliens are real,</v>

120
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.420
apparently there is a humanoid ask.

121
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.710
Race of aliens called the tall whites living among us.

122
00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.653
Huh?

123
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.750
<v 1>What publication is this? Vice?</v>

124
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.110
<v 4>There's a few other places. Well, there's a field.</v>

125
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.750
<v 1>It's like a real, real deal.</v>

126
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.110
Come on. That's crazy. Yeah. That.

127
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.830
<v 0>Is crazy. The thing is, is that guy nuts? Like what else does he believe in?</v>

128
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.330
You know, how, w how does he feel about ghosts, right? When you, uh,

129
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.820
think about like an alien signing. Like, if you saw an alien,

130
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:42.180
they never saw one again for the rest of your life, you would be you,

131
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.020
it would with your memory. Even if the alien was real. If,

132
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:47.440
if a saucer emerged in front of you, then it took off.

133
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.490
This is the same thing with a ghost. Like if you saw a ghost,

134
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:55.750
if you walked into your basement to go get a screw for something, and you turn,

135
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:59.140
and he saw an apparition of a woman, right. Was like staring you down.

136
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.980
Did you ever see that? Where Moe Del Toro movie about the lady,

137
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:06.790
who's a ghost to adopt kids. No, dude.

138
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.740
It's a dark movie. What is it called mother? What is, what is it called?

139
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.353
It's.

140
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.110
<v 5>Creepy. Isn't it? It's like horror movies.</v>

141
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.100
<v 2>Me too. I love it. I'm a dirty little. I love horror movies.</v>

142
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.290
I think it's called mama. Mama. Yes.

143
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.730
<v 1>Oh, is that that's not what you to Swedish kids, right?</v>

144
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.800
Um, I don't dish. You have two sons. Did you see this? Nah, she has two kids.

145
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.653
I haven't seen that.

146
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.350
<v 0>Um, she, well, I don't want to give it away. I don't give the story away,</v>

147
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.570
but it's crazy.

148
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.290
She finds these kids in the woods and raises them and she's a ghost and it's a,

149
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.020
Tara, she's.

150
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.720
<v 1>A ghost. And so is that a spoiler.</v>

151
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.580
<v 0>Kids? They find the kids. I can't tell you anymore.</v>

152
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.280
<v 1>Boiler alert. I can't tell you anymore. No, you know,</v>

153
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:57.150
she's a ghost from the very beginning. Okay. Okay, good. Yeah.

154
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:58.140
This is terrifying.

155
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:02.820
<v 0>Dude. It's horrifying. It's a terrifying movie. Well,</v>

156
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:04.290
you get the best of both worlds.

157
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.430
<v 3>Right? You get a creepy, like mom's style. And then you get creepy kids,</v>

158
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.830
which are like terrifying.

159
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.460
<v 1>What's the movie say.</v>

160
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.030
<v 0>More without, um, well, spoiler alert in it.</v>

161
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.700
<v 3>There's a, I think it may be called. It might become,</v>

162
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.070
so it's two kids. It might be Swedish or, um,

163
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.010
like Norwegian or something.

164
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:33.920
<v 0>Is it the vampire movie? No, there's a vampire movie. A foreign vampire movie.</v>

165
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.930
Is it let the right one in? I think it is.

166
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.160
Or is that the American version of it? Let the right one in is a scary movie.

167
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.430
That's a scary movie, right? Yeah. That's a vampire movie about vampire kids,

168
00:09:43.431 --> 00:09:45.920
right? Yeah. See,

169
00:09:45.921 --> 00:09:50.120
the thing about a ghost is if you saw one and it was,

170
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.111
if they're just real,

171
00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:54.380
every now and then you saw one and it was right in front of you and you're in

172
00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:55.050
the woods,

173
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.210
you're going to walk your dog and you see some old man with no legs floating in

174
00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:04.070
front of you. Good night. Mommy is a good night. Mommy. What's this one about?

175
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.260
I don't know, same kind of deal.

176
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.830
<v 1>Oh, Jesus Christ. Good. Yeah. I missed it.</v>

177
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.180
Scary lady in the corner. Check that mother out. I'm scared,

178
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.440
but you see him in the woods. Yeah, please. Oh.

179
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.670
<v 0>Yeah. If you saw some,</v>

180
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.510
some apparition in the woods and then you never saw it again for the rest of

181
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:28.250
your life, it doesn't mean it wasn't real. Right?

182
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.190
It just means it's really rare that that happens. Like,

183
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.880
that's a thing about a unique event. Like imagine if you're an aunt,

184
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.700
your whole life, right. All you've ever known as this handheld,

185
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.180
everybody's chilling, working every day, chopping up leaves,

186
00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:43.880
going out and getting popcorn or whatever it finds.

187
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.360
And then one day some person comes along like post Malone,

188
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:50.660
just stomps the out of that anthill, till that moment,

189
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:54.830
all that thing has ever known was that that anthill never even knew that it was

190
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:58.160
possible for something that could cause it's been alive for a couple of weeks.

191
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.800
And during that couple of weeks, no one's ever stumped on the anthill,

192
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.420
but then it happens.

193
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:06.500
And then you realize that there's no pattern to these things.

194
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.230
Anything can happen. Like if you're,

195
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:13.910
if you're a person aliens can land and land on the white house lawn tomorrow and

196
00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:16.490
take over the world. And there's nothing we can do about it.

197
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.850
Like that could be our new normal, okay. masks.

198
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.040
The new normal is there's alien,

199
00:11:22.041 --> 00:11:25.160
spaceships that hover over every city and they tell you what to do.

200
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.440
And you have to work for them now forever.

201
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.850
<v 3>An argument we're smarter than that.</v>

202
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.790
<v 0>Yes we are. But we're in comparison,</v>

203
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.920
probably dumber than aliens are like we're dumping in comparison to aliens.

204
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:41.540
Then ants are to people.

205
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.250
<v 3>Well, that's why you like all these celestial sightings. Yeah. I mean,</v>

206
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:50.450
this is all spit balling here, but it could be possible. Right?

207
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.220
Celestial sightings

208
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.750
documented throughout history, your history, you,

209
00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.100
Hey, I just made a fire. This is dope. Right? Fire is cool.

210
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.990
But what the is that?

211
00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:10.820
That has to be know God like man has always looked

212
00:12:10.821 --> 00:12:15.350
up for answers. It's true. And so that's,

213
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.540
that's, that's why it's a scary thing.

214
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.270
<v 1>Because do they want to hurt us or do they.</v>

215
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.280
<v 3>Are they, did we come from them? I.</v>

216
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.630
<v 0>Don't think it's impossible.</v>

217
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.260
I don't think it's impossible that we're a product of genetic manipulation.

218
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.440
I don't know if we are. I know we're definitely primates.

219
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.720
<v 3>We're just play things. Maybe we just look.</v>

220
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.350
<v 0>So different than every other monkey. All the other monkeys are covered in hair.</v>

221
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.860
This is this weird semi hairless monkey, you know,

222
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:43.300
who knows how to use electronics?

223
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.680
Who knows how to send each video through the sky on a narky? Yes,

224
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.503
yes. Yes.

225
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.420
<v 3>My, my, yeah. I've Lou is here. I got a great friend, Lou, shout out to Lou.</v>

226
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.283
He would.

227
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.020
<v 1>Talk your ear off about this whole.</v>

228
00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:03.120
<v 0>About this to an actual archeologist yesterday or the nephrology Garrett. Yeah,</v>

229
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.000
the Neville M or the Annunaki from planet.

230
00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:09.510
Nibiru all that Zacharias Hitchin stuff. You ever read those books? No, sir.

231
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.820
The books are weird, man. You know, it's weird.

232
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.170
Like there's stuff that he was saying in like,

233
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.940
I believe it was like the 1970s where he was deciphered during these, uh, texts.

234
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.480
And one of the things that he said is this is the craziest.

235
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:29.220
One of all humans were genetically engineered from lower primates

236
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.530
and they were used to harm to a harvest gold and that the

237
00:13:34.531 --> 00:13:39.450
Annunaki needed gold because gold is very plentiful here and

238
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.080
very hard to find very rare on their planet. Right.

239
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.310
And they engineered humans to mine. That's why people love gold so much.

240
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.100
If you think about like the usefulness of gold, gold,

241
00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:53.040
isn't even remotely it's unless you're making electronics,

242
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.970
like gold is not the best metal. Like why is it so valuable?

243
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.890
Because it's pretty, what's not even the prettiest.

244
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:03.570
Like rubies are prettier than gold. Emeralds are pretty than gold. White gold.

245
00:14:03.571 --> 00:14:07.170
So expensive. Where does diamonds fit in? It's a good question.

246
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.350
Probably just someone tricked to check the thinking. It was a good move.

247
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.300
I was reading about like, yeah,

248
00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:15.460
that's what it's like one movie.

249
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.150
<v 3>She had a diamond and then bloody pop. Let me finish.</v>

250
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.650
<v 0>What I'm saying, because this is where it gets weird.</v>

251
00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:25.240
They said that they needed it to hang in their atmosphere to

252
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:29.050
protect them from the sun because they were losing their atmosphere. Well,

253
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:30.490
we're losing our atmosphere.

254
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.980
And one of the things that scientists have suggested is hanging

255
00:14:35.981 --> 00:14:39.520
reflective particles above, above the earth,

256
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:44.440
like putting them in orbit all like a reflective dust in orbit so that it would

257
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:48.430
mute out some of the effects of the sun. So what they suggested,

258
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.210
what he was saying in 19 eight is what they suggested in like

259
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:54.950
2018. Right.

260
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.430
So when they're talking about how to fix some of the global warming issues,

261
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:02.900
they were literally saying some of the stuff that was in this book that he was

262
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.910
reading, uh, you know, he's deciphering the,

263
00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:09.230
these ancient Sumerian texts from 6,000 years ago. No.

264
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.570
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know. I was about to ask interpretation. Where did he get it from?</v>

265
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.550
He.

266
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.660
<v 0>Is just a guy.</v>

267
00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:21.640
Who's a linguist who studies these ancient languages and reinterprets them.

268
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.240
But it's very highly in dispute. That's the problem. Like you are not, you are,

269
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.040
you are, I, we're not going to figure it out.

270
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.530
We're not going to know who's right, right. It's too complicated. Right.

271
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.160
But there's a website called Cichon is wrong.com. And if you go there,

272
00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:35.530
it refutes all of this. I don't know. Who's right. Who's wrong.

273
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.370
But it's interesting to see the argument, but again, what the,

274
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.990
whatever the was going on back then at 6,000 years ago, whatever was going on,

275
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.470
they were.

276
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.090
<v 1>Writing about some wacky right there.</v>

277
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.090
And is that the shrooms or is that, is it content I'm re yeah.

278
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.410
You know.

279
00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:54.243
<v 0>That's,</v>

280
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.350
it's not impossible that we could have easily been contacted by some

281
00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:03.760
other life form. That's similar to us, but that's a million years advanced.

282
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.760
It could have been contacted all throughout history, right? Yeah.

283
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.400
Up until 1860, whatever the it was all you would have as a drawing and a story.

284
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.623
Imagine that.

285
00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.710
<v 3>How famous people, who the knows.</v>

286
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:23.020
But now if you look at the last 200 years,

287
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.180
it is accelerated like a.

288
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.320
And there's so much like 200 years ago,

289
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.530
people would look at, uh,

290
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.970
the Bronco or anything like that and be like, what the? What is that?

291
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.220
It happened so quick. It's.

292
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.180
<v 0>Happening so quick right now. I mean, they,</v>

293
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:49.840
that space X thing they've already, they've figured out how to get something,

294
00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:53.440
to fly into the sky and then bring it back and land it. It's insane. Yeah.

295
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:59.590
We are in a weird time. And if the aliens come right now, it's the,

296
00:16:59.591 --> 00:17:02.530
probably the best time to come or we're going to be the most relaxed about it.

297
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.540
No, one's been able to work for six months.

298
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.520
<v 1>Yeah. I feel like everybody's oh,</v>

299
00:17:06.850 --> 00:17:10.420
what's people are scared to shake hands when you get to this terrified,

300
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.320
are you going to say, hi, are you, are you going to grab your boat?

301
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:19.540
<v 0>Oh, I'm going to say hi for sure. I'm not stupid. Could come here.</v>

302
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.180
<v 1>It's integration. Yeah.</v>

303
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.000
<v 0>I'm not even interested in kicking someone's from another dimension.</v>

304
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.710
I just want to say hi. Tell me what's up. Tell me what's actually,

305
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.240
I want to have an alien on the podcast.

306
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.990
Imagine I could call Tyler up three foot tall,

307
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.130
40 pound dude with a giant bulbous head and like

308
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.540
antenna, like fingers. And he's explaining how they traverse space.

309
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.210
You imagine they're making sounds and you interpret those sounds no matter what

310
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.040
language you're in all over the world,

311
00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:55.110
you instantaneously interpret what they're saying.

312
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.830
<v 1>Brain you, and be able to hear them. If they would do it through a podcast</v>

313
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:03.900
near the sounds, they make this sound

314
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.420
[inaudible].

315
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:09.000
<v 0>They would hit you with some sound that's so complex.</v>

316
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:11.130
You would understand exactly what they're saying.

317
00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:14.070
Even though you don't know the language and everybody would be like,

318
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:17.940
what in the is going on? Oh my God. There's an alien on the JRE.

319
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.670
And that's what it would be me talking to some alien.

320
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.210
<v 1>They better give you some more money.</v>

321
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.350
<v 0>I think that's the least of our problems in the aliens. Come.</v>

322
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.830
That is going to be wiped out. That's when we need gold. Yeah.

323
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:33.630
We're going to be gold miners. Again, folks,

324
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.540
we're going to look for some sturdy person with a wide back.

325
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.820
<v 1>That's where that's, what's going to be valuable.</v>

326
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.490
<v 0>But I mean, good enough to mind gold. I don't know.</v>

327
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.320
Imagine if that's life in the future, they come down and go,

328
00:18:46.321 --> 00:18:49.560
you get two choices. Oh, eat one. We eat you two.

329
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:53.400
You mind gold for us or they eat, stay alive. Why not? Why wouldn't they eat us?

330
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.920
They'd be like, listen, you guys are just protein. You're. They.

331
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.300
<v 3>Probably eat clouds. Yeah. Or like energy. They probably just eat energy.</v>

332
00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.510
<v 0>Yeah. They may be. They just exist in some sort of a, like a.</v>

333
00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.320
<v 1>Material. Probably. They're.</v>

334
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.330
<v 3>Probably just a theorial.</v>

335
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.440
<v 0>Well, maybe they figured out a way to make life.</v>

336
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.430
So maybe they figured out a way how to make life,

337
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.720
where you can transfer your consciousness and some eternal mechanical thing.

338
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:22.850
Okay.
