<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 1>Experience. First of all, anybody who really wants to know you in depth,</v>

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.510
in your element, talking with a fellow warrior,

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860
I strongly recommend that podcast, um, for, for people.

5
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.930
Don't what, what number is it? Do you know which.

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.030
<v 0>Number? I don't know what number it is.</v>

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.980
<v 1>Just listening to it. It's um, Jocko podcast,</v>

8
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:24.150
1,

9
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.590
1 5 into the fire and beyond the call of duty. Yeah.

10
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.600
Jocko is a beast.

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.220
And you two together talking about the incidents

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.260
that happen with you overseas. It's insane.

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.710
I mean, it is like I had a call buddy.

14
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.200
Might've stopped the podcast and call my friend Brendan, just to talk to him.

15
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
Yeah. I was like, this is so intense. It's like I was driving,

16
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.940
I was getting nervous. Right. You know, drive it in my car,

17
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.030
my Tesla electric car, dry,

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.110
my hands are sweating and I'm breathing heavy. I'm like. Yeah.

19
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.330
<v 0>It was, well, if you hear all those, like, you know,</v>

20
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:07.380
when you're listening to that podcast, that was by far the most. I mean,

21
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:09.990
he like Jocko just pulled it out of me, like, right. Like, you know,

22
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:13.590
most everybody hits like the, the, the high points of it, but you know,

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:15.110
me and Jocko just made that connection.

24
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.060
It was the first time we'd ever met face to face. Yeah. We just went like,

25
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.380
you know, he picked me, he actually picked me up from the airport and we went,

26
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.710
we went there and we sat down and did the, the, the podcast. And,

27
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:27.630
and I don't know, I think,

28
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:30.900
I think he knew the questions to ask because I think it was good for both of us

29
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:34.680
because, you know, if you got to the point kind of in the middle of it,

30
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.270
if you start hearing those silences,

31
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.800
it was both of us trying to keep from tears falling. Right. Like it was like,

32
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.740
it was like that moment you're trying to, I just, you know, it really,

33
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.250
we really connected and it was, you know, it was a tough podcast.

34
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.590
<v 1>Well, you, you could tell because for Jocko,</v>

35
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.630
I listen to a lot of Jocko's podcasts,

36
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:55.200
but that was one where he was really in his element. First of all, it's very,

37
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.680
obviously he has a deep respect for you and who you are and what you stand for.

38
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.310
And then two, it brought him back to his own experiences and more.

39
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.260
And so the whole thing is just,

40
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.350
it's one of the most intense podcasts I've ever listened to,

41
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:08.730
if not the most intense wow.

42
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.660
<v 0>Have him. Yeah. It was, it was heavy. It was a hard, like, it was a hard one,</v>

43
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.540
you know, he, I, like you said, I think, I think we both,

44
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.000
I think Jocko was getting as much out of it as I was. Right.

45
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.690
And I have the utmost respect for Jocko. The guys just, you know, he is,

46
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.280
he's the epitome of, of, of a warrior all around, you know, like from day,

47
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.300
day in and day out. I mean,

48
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:31.440
he wakes up every day and lives the things that he says. I mean, you know, he,

49
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:35.280
he does what he says and he lives it and he puts people first. And he's just,

50
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:37.170
I mean, he's one of the, he's one of the greatest guys I've ever met.

51
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.280
<v 1>And I agree, I couldn't set it better. And Tim Kennedy as well, you know,</v>

52
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:44.370
we're both friends with Tim and that same thing, that's that kind of, yeah,

53
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.230
it's a rare, rare human being.

54
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.720
<v 0>It isn't, you know, and I think that's what, like, you know,</v>

55
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.760
that's what I'm so fortunate about is like, I'm just, I'm,

56
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.590
I'm surrounded by just people like that. Right. Like, you know, I'm, I'm,

57
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:59.320
so I'm so fortunate to have a circle like that. You know, I think that, that,

58
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.290
that's what makes us who we are, you know, I mean, it's the true,

59
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.960
the epitome is, is, is, is iron sharpens iron.

60
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.950
And when you're surrounded by guys like Jocko and Tim Kennedy and,

61
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.340
and I mean, what will you have no option, but even if you're you're, you know,

62
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.650
even if you're last in that group, like you're still,

63
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.540
you're still above average, you know.

64
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.640
<v 1>It's cliche, you know, that comes up when people talk about military,</v>

65
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.780
you know, that, you know, people will say things and sometimes it's,

66
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:28.180
it's hard to understand whether or not they grasp exactly what they're saying,

67
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.860
but that people make sacrifices so that you could be free. And I don't think,

68
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.690
I don't think people re it's hard to truly internalize that without having

69
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.780
experienced what you've experienced with Jocko and Tim Kennedy have experienced

70
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.670
when I'm listening to it. Um, I know that it's correct. I know that it's true.

71
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.950
I support it a hundred percent, but it's almost like a,

72
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.590
an alien thing to me because I've never experienced it.

73
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:54.370
So when hearing you guys talk about it and climbing inside your head for a bit

74
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:59.050
and let and listen to describe it, that, that cliche the land of the free,

75
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:03.670
because of the brave, it, it, it, it gets highlighted where you understand,

76
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:03.881
like,

77
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:08.860
this is why America's not like it is in other places because

78
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:10.030
of this strong military.

79
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.310
And one of the things you guys talked about in that podcast was this idea of us

80
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:19.810
invading Afghanistan, that you were fighting a long side Afghans,

81
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.570
and most people who talk about war will have this peripheral sort of cursory

82
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.380
understanding about what they would like the world to be like, you know,

83
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.080
that they would like no war and that, oh, this is terrible.

84
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:35.680
We shouldn't be over there that don't truly understand what you want.

85
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.560
<v 0>You know, they, they don't. And, and, and I think, you know,</v>

86
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.590
the perspective that I get to come back and I think all these guys telling their

87
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:45.580
stories, you know, from Rob O'Neill to marks a trail, like I think every,

88
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.440
every warrior out there has to tell their story to make people understand,

89
00:04:50.441 --> 00:04:52.180
right? Like it's so important for that,

90
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:54.940
because we've got a perspective of the world that a lot of people don't get.

91
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.520
And, uh, you know, I mean, I stood next to,

92
00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.290
I stood next to people and that, that we couldn't like,

93
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.040
you talk about not believing, not being raised, not coming from the same place,

94
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.920
not having, you know, we could have found every reason not to,

95
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.770
to be on the same ground,

96
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.040
but we stood next to each other and we were willing to die for each other.

97
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.130
We found, we chose to find the common denominator.

98
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.100
And that was because there's only two types of people in this world.

99
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.430
There's good and evil. Yes. It really comes down to that. Like,

100
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.820
like war is so simple. Life is so simple when you try to complicate it,

101
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:32.230
there's other reasons. And it's like this, this whole, this whole thing,

102
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:36.910
we were all over there fighting for this, for, for the belief to be free, this,

103
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:41.770
this disbelief of democracy, this belief of, of what we all live for.

104
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:45.370
And it's, you can't see it, but, but we live it every day.

105
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:48.190
And we were willing to give our lives for, for, for people.

106
00:05:48.191 --> 00:05:50.050
We didn't even know people. We didn't even meet.

107
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.090
<v 1>One of the things you talked about with Jocko,</v>

108
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.470
you said you didn't just lose four brothers that day.

109
00:05:56.471 --> 00:06:00.530
You lost 10 because you lost six Afghany brothers as well. Yeah.

110
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.120
<v 0>You know, th the, the Afghans were as close to me is, as the Marines were,</v>

111
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.750
you know, my, my team of Afghan soldiers, you know, I lived on a base.

112
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.490
It was four U S and 80 Afghans.

113
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.900
And every day I went out on patrol and I'm patrolling with them and they're no

114
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:18.590
different than, than me and you, you know, they, they just want a place.

115
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.130
I'll never forget that it really hit home. To me is I had an Afghan.

116
00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:24.830
We were sitting up on the mountain, actually, the cover of my book.

117
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:28.190
It was that day. We were sitting on the, on the, on that, that mountain,

118
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.740
because we had chased some Taliban up, up that hill.

119
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.600
And we were sitting up there in this Afghan, looked at me and he just said,

120
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:39.140
I hope that someday, you can bring your family here on vacation.

121
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:43.520
I hope that we can get it to that point. Wow. And it really hit home to me.

122
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:47.990
It's like, you know, we're all just alike.

123
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.530
You know, we're all just alike. We all just want to live a great life.

124
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.680
And we all just want to get along. I mean, if you don't, if you don't get along,

125
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:55.940
it's because you choose not to get along.

126
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.240
<v 1>For people who don't understand the conflict in Afghanistan,</v>

127
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.970
explain what is happening and why we're over.

128
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.880
<v 0>Yeah. So, you know, the basically Afghanistan,</v>

129
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:07.400
and it was the same thing in Iraq, too. I mean, you know,

130
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.850
that's where these terrorist organizations were. Right. And, uh, you know,

131
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.040
we're over there fighting alongside Afghanistan.

132
00:07:13.041 --> 00:07:14.540
We're over there fighting alongside Iraq.

133
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.820
We're not fighting Iraq and fighting Afghanistan.

134
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.040
We were fighting alongside both of those countries and trying to rebuild it up

135
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.970
and trying to get rid of these terrorist cells that are inside those countries.

136
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:29.150
You know, uh, like you said, I mean, I, everybody thinks that, you know,

137
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:31.760
we're fighting Iraq and we're fighting Afghanistan. It's not the case.

138
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:35.510
We're alongside them, helping them rebuild their countries. You know.

139
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.770
<v 1>When you go to black rifle, coffee in, uh, salt lake, you know,</v>

140
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.970
those guys are awesome. Awesome.

141
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:45.800
They brought a bunch of former Afghany troops over and they work for them over

142
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:49.670
there. Like a lot of the guys working in the factory. Yeah. You're like, oh,

143
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.360
okay. I guy like these, these guys are so close. These people,

144
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:57.080
they brought them back and gave them jobs and America. Absolutely. You know,

145
00:07:57.081 --> 00:07:58.040
and this is, um,

146
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.080
I just think most people don't really have a full picture

147
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.100
of what what's at stake and why it's even happening.

148
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.960
They just don't want war, right.

149
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.550
<v 0>The stolen war. But it's like, you know, I mean, there's no way,</v>

150
00:08:13.551 --> 00:08:16.190
you mean you can go in your house and lock your doors and,

151
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.940
and sit there and try to pretend that the evil that we fight doesn't exist,

152
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:24.440
but it exists. It exists. It's there, it's there.

153
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.410
And if we don't go fight it over there, it's going to come here.

154
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.430
<v 1>That's another cliche that like seems alien to people. You know, it's a, it's,</v>

155
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.140
it's a true statement. It's always been true throughout human history.

156
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.850
But when you live in a country like America, we're so fortunate.

157
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.200
It's so awesome here. Even when it sucks. It's awesome.

158
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.070
In comparison to the rest of the world, you know, um, uh,

159
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.320
it's very rare that you have a place where you really can start at the bottom

160
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.440
and your.

161
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.420
<v 0>Way up to be a successful person. I mean,</v>

162
00:08:57.421 --> 00:08:59.760
literally you can start here and come from nothing.

163
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.590
And within your generation be the president of the United States,

164
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.130
you could literally start from that. And,

165
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:09.000
and it's the only country on the face of the planet.
