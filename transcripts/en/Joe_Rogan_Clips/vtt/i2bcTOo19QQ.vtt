00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.330
<v 4>They found some of those teeth and shipments of dragon bones. Oh,</v>

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.400
what the we're dragging is that I'm sure they were selling them as dragon boats,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.000
but like, I wonder what those were probably dinosaur rocks or something.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.010
Dragging bones is they collected 40 70th amongst shipments of in quotes,

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.910
dragon bones. Speaking of dragon bones, anybody heard from Charlie sheen lately.

7
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.830
Remember that guy tiger bud dragon bones.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.350
My friend saw him at a restaurant one time and I'm like, get the out of it.

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:33.780
And he, he takes a video. He goes, look, he eats.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.090
Cause he's just the guy that's going like this. And I just like,

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.310
imagine that that guy had achieved like this enormous. Oh,

12
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.440
here it goes from baller to squalor.

13
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.610
Charlie sheen moves into modest Malibu apartment after he was forced to live

14
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:48.630
with his dad 80.

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.890
<v 0>And mom's 76. Oh it is man. I heard he lost all his teeth or hurts. Oh,</v>

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.920
he's I know he's unwell. So I guess if, uh, yeah, yeah. Well,

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.940
that's what becomes like,

18
00:00:56.941 --> 00:01:00.120
see if you could find the most current photo of Charlie sheen.

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.230
I figured that would've had,

20
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.330
I remember when like people were using hashtag tiger blood and that wasn't that

21
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:09.630
long ago, right? It was like 15 years ago. No, not that long.

22
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.280
It was 10 20 11. And you went off the rails.

23
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.150
That was a crazy time.

24
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.800
People found out that he had HIV that's when they were like not so funny

25
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:23.670
anymore. And they, you know, he possibly had given it to other people,

26
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.560
not the coolest thing, Charlie, he was the guy that was like,

27
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.890
you remember when he did that interview where he was like, yeah,

28
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.380
I smoke crack. Yeah. I love it. I would a tiger bliss. Smoke grams of it.

29
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.080
Yeah. Hashtag winning.

30
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.280
Did he even use hashtag winning or did you say winning? He used hashtag winning.

31
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.490
I don't think it does anymore. I mean, didn't,

32
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:50.280
I don't think he said hashtag winning. I think he just said winning, winning.

33
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.470
And he was a, he was a year ago. Jesus Christ.

34
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.240
Please play that play that this is Marine.

35
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.310
We get some volume he's doing for cameo. It's a thing.

36
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.523
Isn't that working.

37
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.140
<v 1>Remain here. I will, I will remain available if, if,</v>

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.880
if you can all agree that, uh, that,

39
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.960
that all the tiger blood then winning.

40
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:19.790
And if we could just kind of just kind of leave that

41
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:22.820
where it belongs in the past, uh.

42
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.280
<v 0>Hey, this is tough to watch very difficult.</v>

43
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.960
It sounds like he doesn't want to keep going.

44
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.100
<v 1>That, that, that depth, we're all finding our way through. So,</v>

45
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.240
so if a message from me can, can, can brighten the day of, of,

46
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:36.440
of yourself for,

47
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.360
or a loved one or even someone you don't really care about then,

48
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.680
uh, then, um, then I'm honored to, to offer that. So, uh,

49
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.390
greetings, good people of planet cameo.

50
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.500
It's the sheen I'm back through.

51
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.420
<v 0>Whoa, that's heavy.</v>

52
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.060
I remember when he was doing live performances or he's going out and he's doing,

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.300
he was selling out theaters. And the first one he did was, uh,

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.010
like everybody was excited to see him,

55
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.460
but then they realized this was after he got fired from two and a half men,

56
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.320
they realized he really didn't have an act yet. Just then he realized,

57
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:15.250
like I got to do something.

58
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.760
I sold out all the theaters and now people are gonna scream at me and be mad at

59
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:22.510
me. Cause he was like, you paid to see me losers. Like that kind of.

60
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.360
He was just being defensive. Right, right. Then he hired my friend,

61
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:29.980
Russell Peters and Russell Peters took over and was like

62
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.000
interviewing him.

63
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.500
And then the shows became actually success because Russell is very entertaining.

64
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:38.830
And what do you, what are you doing? Canada represents, hold on. He says.

65
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.930
<v 2>This wasn't new. But uh, he blames all of those fun quotes on, uh,</v>

66
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.730
too much testosterone cream. He was using to try to get his libido up. Roid,

67
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:50.530
rage, accidental roid rage.

68
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.530
<v 0>That's what tiger blood came from. Nothing to do with Coke.</v>

69
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.360
You know who the other way,

70
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:59.290
do you know who the last noted celebrity was to visit? To visit Merlin? Who?

71
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.400
Russell Peters. Oh, L let's scroll up. Let me see what he looked like back then.

72
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.130
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Scroll down the video.

73
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.080
Like look how good he looked vibrant.

74
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.660
It is sad to see where he's gotten in this voice.

75
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:14.290
There's just nothing here that this Michael stray hand is interviewing us.

76
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.640
<v 3>I am I'm for eight months now I've been enrolled in an FDA study for a</v>

77
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:22.010
medication for a drug called pro one 40 that's that's in,

78
00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:24.640
in the late stages of its, of its of its trial run.

79
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.120
We are very close to being approved. Um,

80
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.780
and it is not this hideous cocktail that leads to so many side effects

81
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.850
emotionally and physically it's one shot a week. It's going well.

82
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:39.970
And I, I feel like I'm carrying the torch for a lot of folks out there that are

83
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.310
suffering from the same, same thing, you know,

84
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.120
in all of this that has happened to have there been a silver lining. Oh yeah,

85
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:49.060
yeah, yeah, no. I mean, today I got, the dad was diagnosed.

86
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.730
I immediately wanted to eat a bullet. Can I stop?

87
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.150
<v 0>Michael Strahan is such a stud that his list actually helps him become more</v>

88
00:04:58.151 --> 00:04:58.984
endearing.

89
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.770
<v 2>We never fixed the gap.</v>

90
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.430
<v 0>In his teeth, but it's also like, it's like such a alpha,</v>

91
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.560
such a beast of a man, such a manly man invites you to criticize it.

92
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.430
But when he has a little list and be like, I like you a little bit more,

93
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.060
it's a little bit,

94
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.830
a little bit easier to deal with the fact that you're a superhuman.

95
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.830
I think that he was talking about HIV. Yeah. And this one, he.

96
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.730
<v 2>Was, yeah. He.</v>

97
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.650
<v 0>Says, I want to go way back. See, this was, what year was this? Three years.</v>

98
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.520
<v 2>Ago. Jesus.</v>

99
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.180
<v 0>Christ. He looked so much better. Three years ago.</v>

100
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.860
What is going on, man? That's a,

101
00:05:35.861 --> 00:05:38.980
it's a really sad thing to see because you know, he, he was, I mean,

102
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:42.760
he captivated the world for a while. I get it. But it's so sad to see, you know,

103
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.430
there's something about someone who becomes a humble later. And I mean,

104
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.580
there's a level of humility that is evident in that video where we watched that

105
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.190
he's, he's trying to get some cameo orders.

106
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:54.700
Like it was a dude that was also who was embracing,

107
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.450
being like shamed. It was like, yeah, I smoke crack. Yeah.

108
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.930
I eat like I pay hookers to leave. Like he was,

109
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.940
he had all this wildness to like the way he was accepting this shifts like a

110
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:10.100
defiance. Yeah.

111
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.040
Cause people were tired of people being like they were being humbled by this and

112
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.510
goes back to the genuine and the honesty factor. I mean,

113
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:20.840
is there anything more honesty than admitting you're a drug addiction?

114
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.640
It was a little bit of, it was that,

115
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:25.880
but it was also that he used to be Charlie sheen.

116
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.500
He was Charlie sheen from major league and platoon and he was a

117
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.450
massive movie star.

118
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.290
And then all of a sudden here he is on television talking about smoking crack.

119
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.730
He had tiger blood. He was a giant, uh,

120
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.050
conspiracy theorist for a while to remember he wrote a letter to Obama,

121
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.930
uh, demanding that Obama released a truth about nine 11. Do you remember that,

122
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.370
Jeremy?

123
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.290
<v 2>No. I was just about to ask you where, what,</v>

124
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.940
I couldn't remember where this all started. The Charlie sheen stuff, you know,

125
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:04.880
like where, where did that first hit? Was he alive? Streaming on?

126
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.980
<v 0>We got fired from the firing that's yeah. That's what propelled him.</v>

127
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.190
He got fired from two and a half men. And then he went off on a,

128
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.000
he started calling the, the guy by his, uh, his proper Jewish name.

129
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:21.260
So it started off as he started at any went off. Oh, the Chuck Lorre,

130
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.620
Alex Jones, Matt speaking downs. I was Jones. Uh, call me once he goes,

131
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:31.190
Hey Joel, someone wants to talk to you. And he puts me on the phone with, um,

132
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.580
Gary Busey. Oh. Post motorcycle accident.

133
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.880
And Carey Gary Busey was, I mean, it was literally like,

134
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:42.650
I was the beneficiary of this long rant. I go, Hey man,

135
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:45.530
what's up? And I was just like, Hey, Joe,

136
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.250
want to talk to you about the universe and life and expanding consciousness and

137
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.540
all these different things that are happening right now.

138
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:56.330
And he all Gary Bucy like just talked at me

139
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.590
for a few minutes and then gave the phone back to Alex and I go,

140
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:02.690
what the was that? I'll call you later, man.
