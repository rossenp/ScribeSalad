1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.920
<v 0>Well, did you read the Fauci emails? Yes. The freedom of information emails.</v>

2
00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:07.280
That's really crazy because, well, he, first of all,

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.920
he's admitting in these emails, that masks don't work he's Wey. Yes.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.280
Yeah. He talked about it. Talked about it openly.

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.640
<v 1>Uh, wait, I didn't know that part.</v>

6
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.840
I knew I only here's the thought you're gonna talk about the, uh, well that too.

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.910
<v 0>But here's the thing, part of the email was look,</v>

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.270
part of the mask conversation with Fauci has always been that at the beginning

9
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.510
of the pandemic, he said, masks didn't work Uhhuh. But then he said,

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.870
the reason he said that is because there wasn't enough masks for first

11
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:34.350
responders and hospital staff. And he didn't,

12
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:36.150
he wanted to make sure that the supply wasn't diminished.

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.750
So he said that he didn't tell the truth, Uhhuh, Uhhuh. Okay.

14
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.100
But in these emails, he's also, these are private emails.

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.740
He's saying masks don't work for real. Yes. He's saying they're, they're,

16
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:51.740
they're not effective for what you outside of a hospital setting Uhhuh.

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.100
But these masks, like for personal use though,

18
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.860
the kind of cloth masks and paper masks that everybody's wearing,

19
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.740
they're they're not effective. They're not, they can't exactly what did he say?

20
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:02.770
Let's let's pull. So we get exactly what he said,

21
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.370
but that's not even the big part.

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.330
The big part is he's talking about gain of function research in the Wuhan lab,

23
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.170
and he's concerned about it and thinking whether or not they had paused that and

24
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:15.210
whether they're still doing that.

25
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.610
And he's trying to connect the gain of function,

26
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.800
research in the Wuhan lab with this COVID breakout and whether that's where it

27
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:26.960
came from. Right. And why is that a big deal? Because that's, they funded it.

28
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.920
The NIH funded these people who funded the gain of function research

29
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.400
in the Wuhan lab, which means they're responsible for funding.

30
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.360
The very research that led to this outbreak, if that's where it came from.

31
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.710
Right. So all this time, when he, he is been saying, it came from nature,

32
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.750
there's no way it came from a lab. Well, you know, that's shifted right now.

33
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.230
Everybody's saying, well, now everyone from.

34
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.950
<v 1>A lab. Right, right, right. But then not confirm because the.</v>

35
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.910
<v 0>Evidence, right. But the evidence is pointing. Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.910
As it's most likely that it came from a lab Uhhuh this whole time,

37
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.710
Fauci has been saying it didn't,

38
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.310
but you see in his emails that he was concerned.

39
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.740
<v 1>Well, concern, but isn't that, but isn't that like,</v>

40
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:09.020
just trying to figure out what the information is. Not really mean.

41
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.740
Cause he doesn't definitively know either. Right?

42
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.220
<v 0>There's a lot of indications. According to the email mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

43
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.300
he's talking to another scientist, right?

44
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.820
The scientist points out the variables are the, the, the, um,

45
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.860
the components of the virus.

46
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.610
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's to indicate that it possibly came from a lab Uhhuh,

47
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.370
but publicly he's been out and out dismissing that because

48
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.490
he's connected to.

49
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.323
<v 1>That research.</v>

50
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.490
<v 0>Yeah. Cause he's connected to the very research they were doing there.</v>

51
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.010
Uhhuh it's really complicated. It's it's Rand. Paul's been grilling them.

52
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.640
Have you seen those things? Hey, go, typical mask.

53
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:47.360
You buying a drugstore is not really effective in keeping out the virus,

54
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.080
which is small enough to pass through the material. It might however,

55
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:54.160
provide some slight benefit in keeping out gross droplets.

56
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.560
If someone coughs or sneezes on you.

57
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.400
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I do not recommend that you wear a mask,

58
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.720
particularly since you're going to a very low risk location. See,

59
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.600
this is just him saying that these drugstore masks are not really effective.

60
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.510
Right. But this is,

61
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.280
this is in an email after he has said publicly mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that you

62
00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:14.040
didn't have to wear masks because they, they didn't really help.

63
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.600
And then he's saying this in, after that, he said, well,

64
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.350
he wasn't telling the truth there because he didn't want people to buy all the

65
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.270
masks. But then he's saying this after that, right.

66
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.390
In an email that they don't really work, but yet he's wearing a mask.

67
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.950
<v 1>That's kind of like that's, there is shades in that.</v>

68
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:32.990
There's like the gross droplets, gross droplets.

69
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.790
And if you're in a low risk location, like what's his motivation to like,

70
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:43.140
why would he profess masks if he thought.

71
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.340
<v 0>Well, because that's, they don't work part.</v>

72
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.820
The narrative is everybody needs to mask up. But why? Like, well,

73
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:50.900
because it makes people feel safer.

74
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.340
A it helps people get back to work B and it obviously is providing some benefit.

75
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.380
Something's listen, this,

76
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.690
my take something's had happening because the flu cases are down solo. Oh yeah.

77
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.690
So is that because of people wearing masks,

78
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.770
is that because of social distancing?

79
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.050
Cause everybody's kind of freaked out and staying away from each other for so

80
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:10.690
long, washing.

81
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.570
<v 1>Their hands everywhere they go getting, having, having Purell every, I.</v>

82
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.650
<v 0>Don't think that's at every spot. I don't think that's it because it's a,</v>

83
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.330
you're talking about something that's airborne. It's well.

84
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.120
<v 1>For them, but for your, to get a cold, you know, your hands and touching your,</v>

85
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.200
all those things, all those.

86
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.760
<v 0>Things. Yeah. Maybe, but I there's something,</v>

87
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.880
something there's very well likely something to masks that

88
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.520
maybe we weren't aware of. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so even what he's saying there,

89
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.880
yeah. That it might just keep out gross droplets. Yeah.

90
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.480
But isn't it at all about like viral load?

91
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.390
Because like that's the thing they say about a hospital worker.

92
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.150
It's like hospital workers when they're, they're exposed to so much. Right.

93
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.750
When it's over that overwhelming and they really get sick. Yeah.

94
00:04:49.751 --> 00:04:52.310
They get like a heavy, so, so maybe that's what these masks are good for.

95
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.030
What is this? They ask and direct mask. Yeah. Get that.

96
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.830
There you go. Um, which are the protective measures?

97
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.380
Any one should take against the new virus do masks work.

98
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:07.060
He said the vast majority of people outside China do not need to wear a mask.

99
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.580
Read the Fauci approved response.

100
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.780
A mask is more appropriate for someone who's infected than for people trying to

101
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:14.020
protect against infection.

102
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.260
<v 1>Right. Well,</v>

103
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.100
I mean what's but like what's my whole thing with all of this is it's been very

104
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:22.890
confuse using we're all,

105
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.650
every governor's making decisions everybody's around the world is trying to

106
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:30.010
figure out and calling a lockdown or calling not a lockdown.

107
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.290
Everyone's like unlimited information,

108
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.810
trying to make the best decisions that they can. Yeah.

109
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:37.330
Like I don't think that as a governor of a state,

110
00:05:37.331 --> 00:05:40.170
you're making a decision to screw up the economy on purpose.

111
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:45.680
I don't think that I don't think Fauci is talking about mass to like

112
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.880
harm people. You know what, what I mean, like I,

113
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.880
I feel like they're just have limited information and are trying to muddle their

114
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.440
way through the best that they can, like what.

115
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 0>That's not the real problem is the mass thing. It's a small problem.</v>

116
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.560
The real problem is this gain of function, research. This is the,

117
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.720
the very research that they were doing, where they were reducing up,

118
00:06:04.721 --> 00:06:05.554
what is gain of function.

119
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.120
They were juicing up these viruses to make a more infectious and they were

120
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.000
practicing Uhhuh, like trying to use, uh,

121
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.440
I think they used human lung tissue and trying to get the virus to be

122
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.110
more the, the idea is with, I mean, I'm gonna butcher this for sure.

123
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.710
But I think the idea is when they're doing this research,

124
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.470
they want to find out what makes these viruses more infectious and they were

125
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.710
doing it on the original SARS as well. Yeah.

126
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:35.430
Which has like a 10% fatality rate. Wow. It's very scary.

127
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.620
Wow. This stuff is less than one. That stuff is way worse. Yeah.

128
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.140
And by doing this gain of function research,

129
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.780
they run the risk of people getting sick.

130
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.980
We just found out a couple of weeks ago that in November of 2019 three

131
00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:54.780
workers from the lab and Wuhan got sent home and

132
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.210
are sent to the hospital rather really ill with coronavirus like symptoms.

133
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.930
And this was before they had COVID 19 tests, right?

134
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.890
Uhhuh &lt;affirmative&gt; this people got sent home.

135
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.250
I believe one of the guys' wives died Uhhuh from COVID and they

136
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:13.770
think this was the initial infection. So these people in the lab got sick.

137
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.823
So all this time,

138
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.440
while they were trying to dismiss this lab outbreak &lt;affirmative&gt; that had been

139
00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:22.280
hidden from us that these three people in the lab got sick.

140
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.240
The fact that Fauci had something to do with that gain of function,

141
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.201
research and funding,

142
00:07:28.201 --> 00:07:31.360
that gain of function research that had kind of been hidden from us. Well,

143
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:33.680
that makes it seem Josh Rogan exposed that, but.

144
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.160
<v 1>That makes it seem like Fauci is like putting on scrubs and walking down the</v>

145
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:41.590
halls of that place. You know what I mean? Like is Fauci really like in there?

146
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:43.310
Like, you know what I mean? Like, are.

147
00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.143
<v 0>You defending Fauci?</v>

148
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.310
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; you know? Yeah. Like, I don't know. I think that he's been put up as a,</v>

149
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.470
someone we can take our fears and anger and, and throw it at. But is he, like,

150
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.990
he may be part of like, you know, these things are huge.

151
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.820
Like there's a big board of people that decide what they're gonna.

152
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:03.180
<v 0>Research and you gotta read these emails. You gotta read these emails and read.</v>

153
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.300
<v 1>Read. So do you think that he's evil? Do you think that.</v>

154
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.260
<v 0>He's? No. I'm not saying that. So what do you, what are you saying? I think,</v>

155
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.140
I think someone up Uhhuh.

156
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.780
I think they're trying to cover up the fact that they up. Oh, okay.

157
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.060
I think the whole reason why they've been saying that this thing came from

158
00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:19.260
nature, it's a natural spillover is I,

159
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.210
I don't think they're saying that because that's the most likely scenario.

160
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.210
I think they were saying that because they up right now and they,

161
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.650
they didn't want everyone to know that they up.

162
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.210
And I think having the position of power and having the position of authority

163
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.010
that he had, he could say it, it,

164
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.770
no indication just came from a lab.

165
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.680
<v 1>Who, who is they? Who up? Like who, what is this? Well, the.</v>

166
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.640
<v 0>The lab in Wuhan for sure. up.</v>

167
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.040
<v 1>Okay. So who runs that lab?</v>

168
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:48.720
<v 0>Well, I don't know,</v>

169
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.320
but I do know that the NIH funded an organization,

170
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.080
they gave money to an organization which gave money to that lab.

171
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.760
That that's the official story. Got it.

172
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.320
And this is the story story like that ran.

173
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.880
Paul talked about Uhhuh when he was grilling Fauci.

174
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.560
This is also what Josh Rogan talked about. Right?

175
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:09.320
He's a journalist that investigated all this. What Josh,

176
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:12.040
what Rogan was saying was that during the Trump administration,

177
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:14.830
everything was so chaotic that they just kind of,

178
00:09:14.831 --> 00:09:16.190
they were able to restart this,

179
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.030
this kind of dangerous research that Obama had put the breaks on Uhhuh Obama.

180
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.990
Apparently like, what the are you doing Uhhuh? Like, why you,

181
00:09:22.991 --> 00:09:25.270
why are you making viruses more deadly? Oh, really?

182
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.350
<v 1>Stop Uhhuh. &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah.</v>

183
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:31.830
<v 0>And then Trump was let Trump was over there going on number one, I'm the best.</v>

184
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.660
And they're like, I got an idea. Let's start that research back to fly.

185
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:36.870
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

186
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.620
<v 0>Virus force. I mean, it's interesting because, uh,</v>

187
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:44.380
some that's interesting news organizations are ignoring it completely. And, uh,

188
00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.460
other organizations are attacking it's that's when you see like,

189
00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:50.260
whether or not the news is really the news,

190
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.220
because you see the difference between the way the left wing news is covering

191
00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.220
it, which is a lot of 'em are just out and out ignoring it.

192
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.970
You and then the right wing news coverage.

193
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.410
They're constantly bringing up these emails, right.

194
00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:02.730
Pulling 'em out and saying hashtag fire Fauci and all this.

195
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.730
<v 1>Different. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's the thing it's like, once you start,</v>

196
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:10.170
once you start, um, calling out like, this is our side thing,

197
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.410
like I saw the,

198
00:10:11.411 --> 00:10:15.970
there was a headline in the new Yorker or the New York times that said why

199
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:21.240
it's important to why it's so important to figure out whether this lab

200
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.200
theory is correct or not. Yeah. And it was like,

201
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.720
that was kind of the first time I saw it in those,

202
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.640
in those papers.

203
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.000
<v 0>Of like, oh no, it was in news. It was in Newsweek couple months ago. No,</v>

204
00:10:33.001 --> 00:10:34.520
but I'm saying that was like the first that.

205
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.640
<v 1>The first crash fired. Yeah.</v>

206
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.633
<v 0>Yeah. Cause you saw, I mean,</v>

207
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.910
you see it on the cover of Newsweek when they start to consider it again. Yeah.

208
00:10:39.911 --> 00:10:40.350
Yeah. But it.

209
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.070
<v 1>It was political Trump. Yeah. It was totally.</v>

210
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.150
<v 0>Political. Trump was such, he was such a polarizing figure.</v>

211
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:48.230
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that? And people hated him so much.

212
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.550
And anything that guy said mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; everybody was like, him.

213
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.350
Let's go the other way. Right. He said,

214
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.550
it came from a lab that it definitely didn't come from a lab.

215
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.660
<v 1>Yeah. Well that's the right. That's the boy that cried Wolf syndrome. Right.</v>

216
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.980
It became like, exactly. He kind of did that to himself. He,

217
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.020
he just keeps saying such crazy that everybody was just and making and

218
00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:10.100
calling out everybody and yelling &lt;laugh&gt;.

219
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.460
<v 0>Meanwhile, Fauci just wrote a book. So he is releasing a book on this now, uh,</v>

220
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.140
making money off of a book. Oh yeah.

221
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.530
And he's also the same guy that told us we would never shake hands again.

222
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:21.570
I think.

223
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.810
<v 1>He's adorable though. He's little,</v>

224
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.370
he's got like a little like a bro kind of thing.

225
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.410
<v 0>Going, I got an action figure. Somebody sent me a pouchy action figure. Yeah.</v>

226
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.090
With a masks on it has a mask on sitting on my desk. He's.

227
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.490
<v 1>Adorable. He's funny. He put him out there. He's like, you know,</v>

228
00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:41.560
there's like all look, I would love to know what that will like. Okay.

229
00:11:41.561 --> 00:11:44.920
So if we're trying to get into the truth of it, which is what we need. Right.

230
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.720
We need to know.

231
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.520
<v 0>Well, obviously you and me are not gonna get into the truth of it.</v>

232
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.440
<v 1>Well, please. I'll, let's just,</v>

233
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.240
you could tell me the fact right now and I'll forget it by the next subject.

234
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.280
&lt;laugh&gt; but if they're trying to figure that out,

235
00:11:55.281 --> 00:11:56.800
like who is behind Wuhan,

236
00:11:56.801 --> 00:11:59.720
like who is making those decisions to do all this stuff? Like,

237
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.200
and how far is that a global thing? Like, is the us a huge part of it was,

238
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.960
was Norway really involved? Like who, well, they have a bunch of.

239
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.080
<v 0>I don't know what it is, China, apparently that do this kind of work. Yeah.</v>

240
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:13.710
And they do, uh, different kinds of work at different kinds of labs.

241
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.230
And the real fear is that in like some labs in the world, mm-hmm,

242
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.910
&lt;affirmative&gt; some places in the world, they do weaponized virus work. Good.

243
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.030
Which means terrifying. That's terrifying,

244
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:28.630
which terrifying they did that in Russia for, we actually covered that on this,

245
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:30.830
uh, sci-fi show that I hosted years back. Oh yeah.

246
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.540
Like covered the idea of weapon viruses. Oh. But the thing that they told me,

247
00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:39.100
when we went to, uh, the CDC down in, uh, Galveston, Texas,

248
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.900
they have this big building where they house basically every terrible disease

249
00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:46.100
known to man big thick walls. Oh my God. Ventilation systems.

250
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.780
And everyone's wearing space suits and me and Duncan are high as wandering

251
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:50.700
around this place. &lt;laugh&gt;.

252
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:52.420
<v 1>You.</v>

253
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.810
<v 0>Brought Duncan. Yeah. Me and Duncan went down there. Oh, that's great. And uh,</v>

254
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.370
the guy was saying that what he's really worried about more than anything is the

255
00:12:59.371 --> 00:13:01.490
things that come from nature. He's like Uhhuh.

256
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.770
We could worry all day about weaponized viruses and he goes,

257
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.050
but the possibility of that is low compared to the possibility of something

258
00:13:09.051 --> 00:13:12.490
jumping from nature, which is very high catch new episodes.
