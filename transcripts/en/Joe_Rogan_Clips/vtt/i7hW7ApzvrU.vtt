WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>The Joe good experience. I got to go there more. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.840
I was starting to come there. And where, in fact,

3
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:08.600
you were nice enough to bring me up. Oh yeah.

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.730
I meant to come there more disease. A lot of people in the back of that store.

5
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:18.560
I got stories. I mean stories. Now people pay both there.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.450
Do you kind of sin? I got Kennison his first spot at the store.

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.860
You got him his first spot. Yeah. Like I told Mitzi, Tommy went on stage. Yeah.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.060
I met him in business. Uh. Long tie, 80, 80.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.600
I didn't have a gig. 83, 84.

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.090
<v 1>That's crazy. Because 86 he was famous. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.490
<v 0>What happened was this? So he'd already been teed up for Mitzi to watch,</v>

12
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.090
but I had set up the, I told her to watch him.

13
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.500
I met him in Houston and he was kicked out of the comedy workshop in Houston

14
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.090
because of the would say on stage, because he had been running his, you know,

15
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.740
tent show of faith healing with his brother bill. And, uh,

16
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.610
they would, they told me some real up stories about they would do.

17
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:08.930
It was a bit charlatan and a bit trying to help people,

18
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:13.400
but also talking about Jesus quite a bit. And,

19
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
um, he, he was cynical about it,

20
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:21.770
but also very confused, very conflicted about it, about what, what is it?

21
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.970
Because is dying on, on the ground.

22
00:01:25.971 --> 00:01:29.210
Supposedly he looked up at the sky and was talking to God.

23
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.830
That's what bill tells us when I met him. Carla Bo says.

24
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.100
<v 2>Carla bolt was there. Carl was there. Yeah. Carl was there when it, yeah.</v>

25
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.790
<v 0>That's a whole complicated, uh, non, uh,</v>

26
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.830
non-story right now because it's a heavy starch. It's very heavy. Yeah.

27
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:49.700
Their story is really very good. I was around. Yeah. I was around for all of it.

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.500
I was there in the building for those six, seven years. So what happened was,

29
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.700
um, I met him. You would have had the same response. He goes,

30
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.400
they won't let me work here. I met him at the comedy workshop,

31
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.570
meet me at one in the afternoon. He shows me, he posted,

32
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.501
he shows me this,

33
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:11.480
a telephone pole and he had put a picture of himself on it and he

34
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:12.770
kept putting up. They kept taking down.

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.950
He was in the Houston Chronicle on the front page of the arts and entertainment.

36
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.480
And he dressed himself because they banned him from the club and a diaper,

37
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.680
um,

38
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.450
and a crown of thorns and blood coming from the crown of thorns down his face

39
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:30.260
with his eyes rolled back in his head and said that he had been persecuted just

40
00:02:30.261 --> 00:02:32.930
like Jesus from playing the comedy works.

41
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.720
<v 3>But it's pretty.</v>

42
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.880
<v 0>Heavy, you know?</v>

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.320
And he had made it quite a name for himself and had a following there.

44
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.050
And when I don't know what to do, man, I want to come out to LA.

45
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.450
<v 4>And I went well, I'll, I'll help you out.</v>

46
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.330
<v 0>Um, and I was playing the laugh stop in Houston.</v>

47
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.800
<v 2>Right? Never Oaks. Yeah. I used to work that place. I liked it. I did, uh,</v>

48
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.730
get him Howard.

49
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.440
<v 4>Um, um, who was the owner? Um, out, uh,</v>

50
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.890
oh, I'm trying to remember. Anyway, this is our first dead air. Great. Yeah,

51
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.080
I'm trying to remember what happened.

52
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.910
<v 0>What happened was Sam, I sat next to Mitzi in her booth.</v>

53
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.100
He got on stage and he did the whole bit before he had done the young comedian

54
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:24.090
show that I was on with that Rodney did Rodney's first young comedian show.

55
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.110
And it was the whole thing about, you know, the, the kid in the,

56
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.610
whenever they do those world vision commercials with a starving kid in his

57
00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:36.330
famous, the most famous, one of the most famous things that any comedians done,

58
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.310
which was just a truism,

59
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.150
which is the cameraman can give them a sandwich and starving kid.

60
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.650
<v 2>Get out of the desert,</v>

61
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:47.070
go to the word of the food is that's a bit that I use in a conversation with a

62
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:50.700
guy. It was a weird conversation. There was a guy who wrote a book on comedy.

63
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:55.680
He was teaching a comedy course at a university and he was sitting here talking

64
00:03:55.681 --> 00:04:00.600
to me. And he said that the best comedy always punches up,

65
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.941
I think is there,

66
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:05.880
there was a time when people really believe that nonsense like that there was a

67
00:04:05.881 --> 00:04:10.380
formula to comedy and that comedy should always attack the large power

68
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:14.040
structures and that the small people should be, you know,

69
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.980
elevated by communists. So he's sitting here telling me this. I go,

70
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:18.180
that's nonsense. I go,

71
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.050
one of the greatest bits of all time is literally about starving children. Yeah.

72
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.160
There's no listening to Carlin no further down that you could punch.

73
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.850
One of his other great bits was about dead people getting in the.

74
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.840
You remember that the bit about homosexual negrophiliacs who would pay money to

75
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:35.220
be with the freshest male corpse.

76
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.330
Those are two bits where you're punching down as low as you can.

77
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.590
Someone's dad died and there's this guy's, um, it doesn't,

78
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.030
it doesn't get any there's no further. We can punch down. I use upstage.

79
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.230
<v 0>In the main room and he was doing a bit where, uh, he says,</v>

80
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.530
this is what happened in my marriage. And he would unplug the mic is my Dick.

81
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:59.520
You know, without even he did not need a mic to prove the point,

82
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.370
but he would lay on the, on the ground with his girth.

83
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.340
And he would pretend that he was having sex with his wife from behind.

84
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.970
And he goes, this is what happened to my marriage. And she, as he says,

85
00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:12.450
I'm trying to her. And he's like, she's like, we got to fix the fence.

86
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.630
<v 3>And he goes, shut the up. I'm tried this.</v>

87
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.180
And it needs a new coat of paint.

88
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.110
<v 0>Can't do you know? You can't do that now? Really? I mean, you could,</v>

89
00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:26.010
if you were Sam.

90
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.730
<v 2>He could do it again. He couldn't do is alive. Now he could do it. First of all,</v>

91
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:30.810
he was uniquely.

92
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.610
<v 1>He was.</v>

93
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.850
<v 2>Uniquely qualified for that kind of comedy because you,</v>

94
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.720
he was short and he was fat and he was going bald and wore a bra.

95
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.130
<v 0>And the long coat.</v>

96
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.100
And he was hanging out with all the rock and roll and porn people. Yeah.

97
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.730
Well the coat.

98
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.820
<v 2>He came on stage, like he was a child molester or something. Yeah. I mean,</v>

99
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:52.590
that was, look at that. Look at that picture. That's him and bill Hicks. Uh,

100
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.860
I loved, wow. That's crazy. Picture bill was.

101
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.060
<v 0>The sweetest, most timid guy it's below.</v>

102
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.500
<v 2>His nails done there. So he's got nail Polish on that's going on with tips. Oh,</v>

103
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.880
it's the shadows. But that was Sam was a sweetie then.

104
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.630
So when you see him then, I mean, when you go on stage he's,

105
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.640
that was part of why it worked. You know, it wasn't like, you know,

106
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.240
if he was John Malaney and he had that act, you know,

107
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:22.100
handsome and slim that you.

108
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.200
<v 0>Know, now that to pull off, right.</v>

109
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.360
<v 2>You had to be, you had to look like you got over. He looked like he got over.</v>

110
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:29.600
And he.

111
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.800
<v 0>Did. He did. And he did. And he was doing faith healing shows.</v>

112
00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:36.130
And they told me a story where he had been,

113
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.400
I wasn't going to tell it, but it's weird. So they're healing people.

114
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.720
So this they're in some godforsaken place. I don't know where,

115
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.880
and he goes, come up here and we're going to, we're going to heal you. And like,

116
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.560
uh, a seven foot tall guy with drawstring pants and a t-shirt.

117
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.830
He was said, he was like, Lenny from mice and men, there was,

118
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:01.270
he was mentally impaired.

119
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.770
He said he was going to come up and he was going to do the whole thing with them

120
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:09.340
and get out the spirit and all that. And as he's guys coming up,

121
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.620
he's runs up to the stage. And he so tall,

122
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:14.830
he hits his head on a beam and he splits his head open,

123
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.500
but he doesn't fall down. Bill.

124
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.320
His brother will tell you the story and the guy's pants fell down.

125
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.990
And he had the biggest Dick in the world.

126
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.850
And so his head is gushing blood and his Dick is swinging. Right.

127
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.770
And he's going, oh, young Frankenstein, um,

128
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.490
Peter Boyle and it's horrifically upsetting.

129
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.280
And the way I it's been told to me,

130
00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:43.450
I don't know if these stories whispered down the lane is that they went back to

131
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:48.130
the same place after a while the guy came back and he had some other

132
00:07:48.131 --> 00:07:51.820
mishap. I don't want to say he hit his head again, but he fell.

133
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.500
He was the same guy. Just try to have a redo to get healed.

134
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.490
I mean, I don't know. What's more embarrassing. Well,

135
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:04.180
if your head gets split up and, but the whole room can see, you've got a giant.

136
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.990
Maybe it's a blessing and a curse. I don't know. There's.

137
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.970
<v 2>Probably a few gals that hit them up after that.</v>

138
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.990
<v 0>But drawstring pants means it's not a whole lot of cleanliness down on the junk.</v>

139
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.273
Well, you could wash them up.

140
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.540
<v 2>If you're a girl we're looking for a big Dick. I'm like, there it is.</v>

141
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.070
<v 0>Or a guy looking for a big pig or maybe a guy you can trick in a you. Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:25.630
That would be the move.

143
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.350
Or you can play like you do with a bat in baseball.

144
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.770
What happens to that? I guess the first.

145
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:35.740
<v 3>The top it's that? It's that?</v>

146
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.730
<v 2>I think that sounded good. I can't do I can't and I can't roll my R's either.</v>

147
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.380
<v 0>But then the answer to Kennison how quick he popped was after that set,</v>

148
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:47.920
like a week later, Rodney came in to see him and I'd known Rodney.

149
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:50.380
Rodney liked me. I like you, man. I met him at the, in LA Jolla.

150
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.920
He came up to me. You're funny, man. You're ju you're never going to be happy.

151
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.330
You got a fast mind. You're all up, man. You're never going to be happy.

152
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.110
And he was trying to clean up at LaCosta and he comes in, he goes,

153
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.110
I got can't do it, man. No booze, no Coke, no pot, no pills. I can't.

154
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.670
<v 3>Do it. And he's with two women. And, uh, and we.</v>

155
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.620
<v 0>And I hung out with them all weekend. He stayed at the,</v>

156
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.330
he kept coming to the condo and hung out with me and Kennison he saw Sam

157
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.340
and I love this guy. So I do the young comedian special on HBO.

158
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.100
I had a great set right before Sam,

159
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.430
I had a 15 minutes at Sam had a 15 minute set.

160
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.170
I was in it for three and a half minutes.

161
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:32.520
Sam was in it for 15 minutes because it was a,

162
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:37.440
it was a monumental. It was. And then a year later he was in back to school.

163
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.250
Yeah. So that's why it was a three-year deal with him. That's crazy.

164
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.160
And he was a sweetheart. When.

165
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.600
<v 2>I was 19,</v>

166
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.230
I worked as a security guard at great woods center for the performing arts in

167
00:09:48.231 --> 00:09:51.710
Mansfield, Massachusetts, and Rodney was there and he was backstage.

168
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:56.090
And I was like, I didn't get a chance to meet him. But I was backstage.

169
00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:59.330
It was like a hallway. It's hard to know if this is a real memory.

170
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.810
Cause when you're 19, your brain is mush. And it was so long ago.

171
00:10:02.811 --> 00:10:04.160
And I got hit in the head a lot, but there,

172
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.120
I remember they were talking about how he didn't have any pants on.

173
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.540
<v 0>He had a, a bathrobe. Yeah, balls out.</v>

174
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.440
<v 2>I remember him pacing back and forth and uh,</v>

175
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.200
looking down the hallway. I know I definitely saw him at least once.

176
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.120
And I definitely saw him on stage with a bathrobe on,

177
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:21.850
but I remember looking down the hallway, seen this guy.

178
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.000
I'm like how crazy he doesn't have any pants on and he's going to go on stage

179
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:31.010
like this is, and then him up there just didn't give a. I mean, didn't give,

180
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.640
had no to give. He was a movie star.

181
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.630
<v 0>Is he coming at 58? By the way, it was caddy shack. That's how long it took.</v>

182
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.910
<v 2>And apparently smoked a load of pot backstage.</v>

183
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:49.070
And when I was to show my wife and just, just murdered it,

184
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.180
I mean one punchline after another punchline and people don't know the story

185
00:10:53.181 --> 00:10:56.570
about him, quit doing comedy for years and became an aluminum siding.

186
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.620
<v 0>He was born. Jacob Cohen changed it to Jack, Roy,</v>

187
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.360
and then a club owner called him Rodney Dangerfield. That's how he was named by.

188
00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.740
Wow. What club? I don't know. I don't know.

189
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.950
But he had a rough go. It is rough ago.

190
00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:17.720
He had the no respect thing was if you're going to pick a brand catchphrase,

191
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:20.600
it wasn't a catch phrase. It was his mantra. Yeah.

192
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.350
<v 2>Yeah. Well that, that, that made him, you know, I got no respect.</v>

193
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:28.850
I'll tell you no respect at all. I have started doing that. He would.

194
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.230
<v 0>Have loved you like loved you because of the.</v>

195
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.600
He always said, and I've said this before,

196
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.420
so I'm sorry if anybody has heard me say this,

197
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:43.370
but he always said the key man is you just go like a tank, like a tank.

198
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.100
Cause nobody wants you to make it. Everybody's trying to stop you.

199
00:11:46.101 --> 00:11:50.270
You just go like a tank, them all. Just go like a tank. Cause he had come up.

200
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.210
It took him so long to get anywhere and he would go on tonight show. And there,

201
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:58.870
if you look at any of these clips that they're running all over the internet,

202
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.210
it's killer and Carson's hitting the desk and it's just

203
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.163
it's real special.

204
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.630
<v 2>Well, he was a special guy and the store was special too because it showed that,</v>

205
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.060
you know, he was trying to make it and it fell apart. And then he took a long,

206
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.620
did he take like 10 years off?

207
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.570
<v 0>It was aluminum siding was there.</v>

208
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.860
<v 2>Many years. And then he came back and became the biggest movie.</v>

209
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.690
<v 0>Star. But he couldn't, it,</v>

210
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:29.130
it took him to 58 and they put them in Caddyshack and a lot of the jokes were

211
00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:33.720
his and then a lot of them, I mean, it was, you know, Harold Ramis and stuff.

212
00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:34.554
So it was.

213
00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.650
<v 2>Genius movie and those movies were so good.</v>

214
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.830
<v 0>Murray in that Chevy was great. And everybody's great in.</v>

215
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.890
<v 2>That. He's in the classroom and kinnisons teaching them.</v>

216
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.470
<v 3>Yeah. Oh yeah.</v>

217
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:53.700
<v 2>[Inaudible] played a off tilt. Vietnam vet who was screaming.</v>

218
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.160
He just wrote him into it too. That's a great movie. Back to school,

219
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.340
a great movie.

220
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.850
<v 0>And easy money was really great. Yeah.</v>

221
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.110
<v 2>Oh, he had some classics man. Caddy shack. He had some classics. He was awesome.</v>

222
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.580
I officiated his funeral.

223
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.230
<v 4>Oh man.</v>

224
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.810
<v 0>It was pretty, pretty intense. Uh, to put him away.</v>

225
00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:20.250
I was with him in the, uh, emergency and the, uh, sorry, I got a little, uh,

226
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:25.020
in the, uh, uh, intensive care. He was in a coma.

227
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.003
So I'd go in.

228
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.220
<v 2>Until he passed 84. That's amazing.</v>

229
00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:31.920
He did all that Coke and he made it to 84. He.

230
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.580
<v 0>Stopped doing Coke. He just liked pot, but he did a lot of Coke.</v>

231
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:40.410
Why did he stop? I think about 10 years before he died, still amazing.

232
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.040
<v 2>74 Years old doing Coke going. I've got another 10 years. I'll tell you what.</v>

233
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.570
Hm I can't how do you stop? No booze, no Coke, no pot. No pills. Yeah.

234
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:49.770
Okay.
