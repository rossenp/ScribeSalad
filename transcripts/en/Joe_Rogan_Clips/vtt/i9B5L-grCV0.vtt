00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 1>You know, that was why not buy Greenland, why not buy Greenland?</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.420
And then when that came out, what's wrong with that? We bought Alaska. Well,

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:12.570
we leased it Alaska. So yeah, we were supposed to give it back, but we,

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.200
we didn't.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.510
<v 0>It seems like Greenland would be a good place to scoop up,</v>

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.060
especially as things get warmer. Right? Yeah.

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.923
<v 1>Exactly. And the.</v>

9
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.300
<v 0>Tweet that he made when he put the Trump tower,</v>

10
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.360
I promise not to do this and have a giant Trump tower in the middle of the

11
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:28.260
Greenland. I was laughing my off. I'm like you love or hate.

12
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.520
That is hilarious.

13
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.730
<v 1>His trolling skills are, are top-notch. They're very good.</v>

14
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.050
They're they're fantastic. Oh.

15
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.250
<v 0>With people when he starts calling people crazy or it gives him a nickname,</v>

16
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.970
like it's so good because like he, it sticks. Oh.

17
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.410
<v 1>Yes. I mean,</v>

18
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
part of me wants to see a Trump button race next year, just for that reason.

19
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.920
It's just because the, the abuse will be unbelief. I mean,

20
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.340
not that I'm encouraging that necessarily, but just as a spectacle,

21
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.210
it's going to be unbelievable.

22
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:01.170
You can tell that he he's salivating at the idea of, of bi-modal.

23
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.890
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.720
Biden to me is like having a flashlight with a dying battery and

25
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.850
going for a long hike in the woods.

26
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.860
It is not going to work out. It's not going to make it.

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.833
<v 1>Yeah, no, he's.</v>

28
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.430
<v 0>He's so faded.</v>

29
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.380
<v 1>He, you know,</v>

30
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.370
he has his moments on the campaign trail where he'll be speaking and you

31
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:25.590
know, these guys do the same speech over and over again,

32
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:29.100
so they can kind of do it on cruise control. But every now and then he'll,

33
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.390
he'll stop in the middle of it. And this look of terror comes over. Like,

34
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:37.320
where am I? You know, what town am I in? You know? Like he, he,

35
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.450
he confused. He thought he was in Vermont. Uh, when he was in New Hampshire.

36
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.200
I'm sorry. Yeah, he was, he got those states confused with like,

37
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.260
what's not to love about Vermont. He was in New Hampshire. Uh, you know,

38
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.920
that can happen obviously, but it happens to him a lot, but he's.

39
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.110
<v 0>Okay. Clearly old. Yeah. You know what I mean? He's not much older than Trump.</v>

40
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.630
Right. But he needs to get on the same pills.

41
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.340
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Actually that thing, we should get a go fund me to by smashing.</v>

42
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.600
<v 0>If they just filled him up with steroids and just jacked him up with</v>

43
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.180
amphetamines, how to go in after Trump,

44
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.900
because I really think he needs something like that. He,

45
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.930
whatever he's doing on the natch, it's not working. Right. Yeah.

46
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.870
<v 1>Yeah. He's too tired. He needs a little bit of enhancement. It's not.</v>

47
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.860
<v 0>Going to work. If he, if he gets the nomination, the Democrats are. I just,</v>

48
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:30.060
I don't see. I don't see him. I don't see him with standing.

49
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:33.630
The barrage to Trump is gonna throw at him. Trump's gonna take him out.

50
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:37.980
Like Tyson took out Marvis, Frazier just got, it was a bad mind. It was a bop.

51
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.500
That was a bad fight. It's going to be that kind of fight. Right.

52
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.110
He's just got a bomb on him. Doesn't have a chance.

53
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.810
He can't stand with that guy. He doesn't have a chance to,

54
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.020
he's also to impress with himself.

55
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.620
<v 1>Yes. He's too used to people differing. Like.</v>

56
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.170
<v 0>He thinks like the things he says,</v>

57
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.590
make sense and are cool and are profound when they're just bland.

58
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.510
He just serving bad meatloaf. And he's like Tata. And you're like, no,

59
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.410
this is bad, man.

60
00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.930
<v 1>Yeah. That's how he got to be. Vice-president by being just bland enough, right.</v>

61
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.050
To, to get whatever constituency Obama was trying to get.

62
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:18.220
But you saw that exchange when he called Trump an existential threat earlier

63
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.750
this year. And Trump basically, he just went off on him. You know, Joe,

64
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.560
Joe's a dummy is not the guy who used to be like, you know, yeah.

65
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.760
That's going to be every day, you know, every minute of every day.

66
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.420
And then other people.

67
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.300
<v 0>We're going to chime in. Cause they love it. People love piling on. Oh yeah.</v>

68
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.040
And his fans, oh my God.

69
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.300
The he's the king where people never had a representative before.

70
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:44.140
There's a lot of out there. Like, ah, where's my guy. Right. Then finally, bam,

71
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.790
look at this area's made it to the white house. Holy.

72
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.800
I can be an. Now the president's an. He wants me to be an. Lock her up,

73
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.390
lock her up, lock her up. Yeah. Totally call that.

74
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.090
I mean that that's going to wear on a guy. I mean, if.

75
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.370
<v 1>You've been doing one of Trump's rallies, no chance.</v>

76
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.830
<v 0>I can't, I have to wear a rubber nose.</v>

77
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.850
<v 1>I've covered them. And they're unbelievable. First of all,</v>

78
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.510
the t-shirts are amazing.

79
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.920
You know like Trump 20, 20, your feelings. You know what I mean? Like,

80
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.970
or Trump as the Punisher, you know, it's like the Punisher skull with the thing,

81
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:26.350
like it's, it's a, it's it's amazing in the crowds.

82
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.120
It's like totally out of idiocrasy.

83
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.940
<v 0>Is there a Punisher skull with a Trump wig on it? Yeah. Oh my goodness.</v>

84
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.863
I'm going to have to get one.

85
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.880
<v 1>I mean he's there's there. Oh, the t-shirts are.</v>

86
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.810
<v 0>We have one JP knows such a loud laugh.</v>

87
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.930
Oh my God. It's a red, white and blue American flag.

88
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.770
Skull Punisher style with a Trump, Trump wig on it. So I saw that.

89
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.100
<v 1>I need that chair. I saw it. Wasn't the one red, white and blue one.</v>

90
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.630
It was the blue, it was the one with the black. And I saw that on my God, uh,

91
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.750
on like an eight year old kid. Right.

92
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.110
It was like a mother with her little kids in the Trump Punisher.

93
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.170
<v 0>But do they sell that shirt on Amazon? Can you find out the shot?</v>

94
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.240
I'm sure it's being sold everywhere is now. Oh my God.

95
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.650
I know God he's people.

96
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.290
<v 1>Cool. I mean the, the, the merchants, he is,</v>

97
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.440
he's the most t-shirt president in history. I mean,

98
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.780
Trump 2020 grabbing by the again, like, boy, I mean,

99
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.670
they, they like embrace that. It's the, the,

100
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:43.600
the trolling aspect of all of it is like the fun part for his crowds.

101
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.190
What they get off on is how, how freaked out,

102
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.730
you know, quote unquote liberal audiences are by their appearance,

103
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:54.520
their attitude and everything. And they lean into it. You know what I mean?

104
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:59.090
Which is, which is interesting, you know,

105
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:03.470
that kind of like group comradery thing that you don't really find that on the

106
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:05.420
campaign trail, on the democratic side, it's different. I mean,

107
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.120
it's a different vibe entirely, but yeah, it's crazy.

108
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.950
<v 0>Well, it's dumb. And that's,</v>

109
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:14.060
that's the thing that he sort of like captured is this place where you can be

110
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:18.920
dumb. Like it's fun to be dumb and say, grab her by the. Like everybody knows.

111
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.050
That's kind of a dumb thing to say publicly, of course,

112
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.730
but you can say it there because he said it, yay. You know, build that wall,

113
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.450
build that wall. Yay. Right? Like it's like, it's this chance to like,

114
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:34.160
shut off any possibility of getting over like 70 RPM.

115
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.480
Like you were going to cut this off at 70. There's no high function here.

116
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.810
I'm going to cut it off at 70 and just let it rip. Right.

117
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.710
<v 1>Yeah. No, totally, totally. And,</v>

118
00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:48.620
and it's funny the way you say that, uh, they, all,

119
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.320
everybody knows. It's a dumb thing to say. Right? So like,

120
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:53.990
I would talk to people at the crowds and you know,

121
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:58.130
I'll talk to like a 65 year old grandmother and you say,

122
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.250
do you agree with everything that Trump says? And like almost the last,

123
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:04.550
they all say, well, I wish he hadn't said this particular thing. Right.

124
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.610
But they're all there chanting, you know what I mean? Like they're all into it.

125
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.760
And the crowds are, they're so huge.

126
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.960
Like I was in Cincinnati and I was late to one of his events and I made the

127
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:18.230
mistake that I couldn't drive in because they blocked off all the bridges,

128
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:20.840
if you've ever been there. Right. I was in the Kentucky side.

129
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.010
So I had to walk like three miles away and like walk over a bridge.

130
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.900
And I thought I was going to be the only person there.

131
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.030
And it was like something out of a scifi movie.

132
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.950
It was just like a line of manga hats,

133
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:35.480
like extending over a bridge all the way into Kentucky, like a mile down a road.

134
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.630
I mean, they had to turn with thousands of people to get into this event.

135
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.370
It was, it was incredible. And that people that see it was like 17 or 18,000,

136
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:47.870
it was the, you know, the, um, uh, I forgot what they would arena.

137
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:49.530
That is it's the, it's the indoor one.

138
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.140
<v 0>The size of those places.</v>

139
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.010
He's the only one that could pull those kinds of crowns period. There's no,

140
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.900
no one, no one can do that. You know.

141
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.010
<v 1>Bernie and Warren have had big crowds. Bernie had a,</v>

142
00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:05.630
he had a 25,000 person crowd in Queens a couple of weeks

143
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:07.820
ago. You'll see crowds that big,

144
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.270
but Trump's crowds are just dating back to 2016.

145
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.380
They're just consistently huge everywhere. And, uh,

146
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.581
and again,

147
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:20.570
this gets back to what I was saying before all the reporters saw this and they

148
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:24.860
all saw that Hillary was having real trouble getting four and 5,000 people into

149
00:08:24.861 --> 00:08:27.710
her events. And so we all, you know, we were all talking to each other, like,

150
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:31.010
that's gotta be in a thing that's gonna, you know,

151
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:32.720
play a role in the election eventually,

152
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:35.030
but nobody kind of brought it up or they, they explained it.

153
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.260
<v 0>Well, I think they felt like if you discussed it and brought it up,</v>

154
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.400
that somehow or another, you,

155
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.290
you were contributing to Trump being Trump

156
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.070
winning.

157
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.903
<v 1>Right. But that's a,</v>

158
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.770
that's a fallacious way to look at it because covering up the reality of the

159
00:08:51.771 --> 00:08:54.860
situation, I think created a false sense of security for Democrats.

160
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.560
And they thought they were going to win by a landslide. Right.

161
00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:00.110
That's what everybody was saying, but it wasn't true. I mean, there were,

162
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:05.010
there were serious red flags throughout the campaign for Hillary and people I

163
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.600
think were too afraid to,

164
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.330
to bring up a lot of this stuff because they didn't want to be seen,

165
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.790
it's helping Trump, but that's not what the business is about.

166
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.080
We're not supposed to be, you know, helping faculty facts. Don't have, you know,

167
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.050
political indications. We're just supposed to tell you what we see.
