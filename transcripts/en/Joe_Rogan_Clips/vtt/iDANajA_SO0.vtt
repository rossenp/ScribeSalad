1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You're going to need fat. If you don't,</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:07.020
you're going to get fatigued, let's get, it'll start with you.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.410
And that's one of the reasons why I got really into tallow and really started

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.900
eating a lot of bacon and things.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.051
<v 1>Like,</v>

6
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.710
why do you think there's such like a national misconception that fat's bad for

7
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.380
your body? Cause I hear that from a lot of people, like, I don't want to eat it.

8
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.160
It's fat.

9
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160
<v 0>Oh, they were told that for the longest time they were well, first of all,</v>

10
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:25.020
there's real evidence that sugar and,

11
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.320
and these companies that made sugar,

12
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:30.470
paid scientists to with data,

13
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.770
to put heart disease and all these, uh,

14
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.970
problems that people are having with clogged arteries to push that off on

15
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.420
saturated fat. And to take that away from,

16
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.750
from sugar and sugar, sugar is terrible for you.

17
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.460
Sugar in that form is so unnatural that in the form of meat

18
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.230
is very natural.

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.560
It's what human beings have been eating since the beginning of time. Yeah.

20
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:55.400
Monounsaturated.

21
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.440
<v 1>Polyunsaturated, saturated fats, all pretty good for you.</v>

22
00:00:57.441 --> 00:00:59.560
Just like stay away from trans fat. Well.

23
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.930
<v 0>Unsaturated fats that come from vegetable oils,</v>

24
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.890
like I think it's called linoleic acid is terrible for you.

25
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.100
Not only is it terrible for you, there's real evidence that it makes you hungry.

26
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.860
That like you're, you're eating it and there's no nutrients in it.

27
00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:16.280
So your body gets hungrier. Look throughout human history.

28
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:20.390
There's never been a time until recently where people got oils

29
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.470
directly from plants in large quantities like that. You know,

30
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.240
if you got oil from plants, it was like oil from avocados, like natural,

31
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.620
or you got your oil from, you know, beef, fat or chicken fat or things.

32
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.150
That's natural for human beings, right? These saturated fats that are natural,

33
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.310
um, your body knows what to do with them.

34
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:41.990
Your body does know what the to do with.

35
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.660
<v 2>Canola oil. No, it, it,</v>

36
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.270
your body's like what the is your body gets.

37
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.870
<v 0>A hold of like some raw honey, your body knows exactly what to do with it,</v>

38
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.460
but your body gets a hold of like corn syrup and that kind of. It's like,

39
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.240
what is this? It just doesn't make sense to your body.

40
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.070
And I think we've gotten into this processed food thing and processed

41
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:08.550
food is almost entirely like if you,

42
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:11.030
if you it's, first of all, it's a human,

43
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.630
it's a new human creation and it's, uh, it's,

44
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.500
it should never be your first choice. Your first choice should be natural foods.

45
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.120
And your first choice should be, look, apple steak,

46
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.670
all that that's normal. You can eat that. That's easy.

47
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:28.280
Your body knows what the to do with that. But you know,

48
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.720
you get into like seed oils and all these like really heavily processed seed

49
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.051
oils.

50
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:37.130
Like there's real evidence that that is a giant part of what's wrong with the

51
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:41.360
health of Americans today is these ultra processed vegetable oils.

52
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.520
They're terrible for you, but it.

53
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.600
<v 3>It doesn't seem to me like that's a stretch in logic, right?</v>

54
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.750
So for just the American diet in general,

55
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.350
for us to look at the traditional food pyramid and say, well, that's.

56
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.980
Ultimately, you know, if grains and ultimate in foods,

57
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.500
sit at the cornerstone of your entire diet,

58
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.290
you're going to have some issues you can kind of look around and you don't even

59
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.820
have to be a rocket surgeon to figure that out, right? It's like, holy.

60
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.250
Obesity is an epidemic in the United States.

61
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.610
We're eating a ton of processed food and all the guys that I know that are

62
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.920
healthy or eating whole foods for the most part.

63
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.210
And it's not because you have more discipline or because you have more access or

64
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.044
wealth.

65
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.880
I know a ton of guys that are not very wealthy that eat whole foods and they're

66
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.100
feeding and certain windows,

67
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:34.300
and they're still in the military still doing incredibly difficult missions.

68
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.820
And they're really healthy. So when I look around, I say, well, okay,

69
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.750
if you stick to whole foods and you limit your amount of caloric intake,

70
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.810
we're not dealing in a high, you know,

71
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.290
high intellect thought process here. It should be pretty easy.

72
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:54.130
But I think what people want is they want their easy button right there.

73
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.470
Like see.

74
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.110
<v 0>Jack in the box, you pull in and you get a burger. You're like, oh,</v>

75
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.670
now I feel better. But meanwhile,

76
00:03:59.671 --> 00:04:04.350
you just forced some into your system and your system's got to burn off all this

77
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.850
that you poured in there.

78
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.300
But there's even foods that people think are healthy that are not really good

79
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:13.860
for you. Like for instance, white rice is better than brown rice. Yes.

80
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.020
Like people think of white rice, like, oh,

81
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.700
I'll have brown rice and being healthy.

82
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.600
<v 2>So brown rice, it's gotta be one of the biggest misconceptions out there.</v>

83
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.690
That stuff. There's arsenic in that. But it's brown. Yeah.

84
00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:26.760
It's not like grains,

85
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.470
but this is terrible for you. Like there's.

86
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.760
<v 0>A reason why Asian cultures for a long time have been getting rid of that,</v>

87
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:37.860
outside that husk God, the Japanese.

88
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.020
<v 1>Got it right with food. I'm telling you the sushi,</v>

89
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.050
white rice seaweed all day.

90
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.410
<v 0>Yeah. Well, there's a lot of countries that figured it out.</v>

91
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.420
We're just not one of them. We're like ultra processed seed oils,

92
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.530
sugar, corn syrup, preservatives,

93
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.170
gallons of preservatives, glyphosate on all our plants. Yeah.

94
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.860
There's also evidence that like animals and I've been getting into this,

95
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.870
the animals that eat, uh, these, uh, ultra processed foods,

96
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.770
then you eat them like animals that eat like ultra processed corn.

97
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.150
And then you eat that animal.

98
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.050
Like you're getting some of the from the corn and some of the from that,

99
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.670
all these seed oil acids, you're getting these things in your body too. But.

100
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.750
<v 3>That, that makes sense to me.</v>

101
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.610
It makes complete sense to me when we look at what they're eating

102
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.760
and then you're eating them, for sure, like,

103
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:37.260
there's really done a direct or you're not stretching and connecting a lot of

104
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:40.890
complex thought there in the sense of when people are trying to sell me on the

105
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:45.120
idea, like, no, it's great. Don't worry about it. It's like, no, man,

106
00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:48.390
like those chickens are eating our snack and they're packed in, you know,

107
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.820
right on top of each other, on each other everywhere.

108
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:54.330
Like I'd rather have a free, free range egg. You'd rather have that.

109
00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:57.530
I'd rather have free range chicken. It's no offense to however you to eat,

110
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:02.120
but it's just a preference of eating. It's pretty easy. I think that the,

111
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.100
the argument comes from maybe corporate impact in

112
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.960
marketing where they'll just Americans will consume it without

113
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:12.890
thinking and go, well,

114
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:16.330
it's good because Jack in the box told me that it's organic. If there's any.

115
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.650
<v 0>One thing in this country where there's a massive</v>

116
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.090
lack of understanding in terms of like the, the,

117
00:06:25.091 --> 00:06:28.210
the way people perceive what's good and what's bad.

118
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:32.470
It's nutrition because there's so few doctors that really know what the they're

119
00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:34.960
talking about. There's doctors out there that will tell you,

120
00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:37.450
you don't need supplements. You don't need supplements. You need a healthy,

121
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:39.880
balanced diet. Right. And then you look at them, they got a gut.

122
00:06:39.881 --> 00:06:42.220
They look bloated. They look like they're dying.

123
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.260
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

124
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.410
They're free from September 1st in December 1st,

125
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:52.840
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

126
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:56.530
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

127
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.520
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

128
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.350
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
