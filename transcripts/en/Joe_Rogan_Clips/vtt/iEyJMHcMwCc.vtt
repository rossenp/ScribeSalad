1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080
<v 0>Hey, Hey Joe. Thanks for, for being here, man. Appreciate it. It's my pleasure.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.080
And honor. And, uh, on the day where bill Cosby goes to the pokey,

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.080
crazy sad story that, uh, sad for some people happy for others,

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.320
sad that he's only going away for.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.880
I wonder if that's a death sentence for a man at his age, essentially.

6
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:21.910
It is right. He's like 81 or something like that. It'd.

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.230
<v 1>Be weird if justice took into account like your health status and awarding</v>

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.070
status. Right?

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.470
<v 0>I think they have done that though.</v>

10
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.950
Didn't they do that with that guy who was speaker

11
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.123
Hasser,

12
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.950
who is speaker of the house who is convicted for molesting a large

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.580
number of boys when he was a wrestling coach. Oh yeah. Do you remember that,

14
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:46.220
man? Yeah. Yeah. 15 months, 15 months. Imagine,

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.540
I mean, that's, that's pure insanity. It's in a wheelchair when he was going.

16
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.260
Yeah, it could have been well there's, there's no way.

17
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.420
If he was a 25 year old able-bodied man who had done the exact same thing,

18
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:01.380
he would've gone to jail for 15 months for, uh,

19
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.450
admitting to molest a large number of kids

20
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.010
who were under his care when he was, he was a wrestling coach. Right.

21
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.850
I think so that sounds right. Yeah.

22
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.690
<v 1>Yeah. Oh, he was the guy the movie was made of no, he.</v>

23
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.530
<v 0>Was a different guy now that was DuPont. Okay. DuPont was not a child molester.</v>

24
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.890
He was just a psychopath who, uh,

25
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.000
hired a wrestlers to come live with him and wrestle with him. Yeah.

26
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.120
Remember that? Yeah. Yeah. I know one of them, the,

27
00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:35.960
one of the, the main guy, the movie, they, they, uh, the, the, the two brothers,

28
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.680
uh, Dave and Mark Schultz. Fantastic. Uh,

29
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.710
wrestlers who were completely is represented in the movie.

30
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:47.270
They made him out to be like involved in this weird gay relationship with him

31
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:50.430
and doing cocaine and all, they, they added all sorts of to that movie.

32
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.150
Very weird. How they do that. Screenwriters.

33
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.950
<v 1>You gotta dramatize.</v>

34
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.270
<v 0>It. I guess.</v>

35
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.750
<v 2>His sentence wasn't for child abuse. Why that's,</v>

36
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:03.580
why it wasn't that it says, that says the judge said it would've been higher.

37
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.060
He would've gotten more. If the, uh,

38
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:09.460
statutes didn't run out the limitation for accidents in the 1960s and seventies

39
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:12.460
ran out. So the judge noted the punishment for such a conviction.

40
00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:13.420
Would've been far worse.

41
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.860
I think he actually got convicted for bank transactions, keeping stuff secret.

42
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.060
Oh, wow. Yeah. And had to pay fines.

43
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.860
<v 0>Statutes of limitations. Yeah. Mm.</v>

44
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.170
So we were talking about bill Cosby that, uh,

45
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.690
psychology professors and experts were obviously

46
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.490
stating that he had some sort of problem.

47
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.730
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it's weird cuz the media will, um,</v>

48
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.610
have a certain narrative they wanna promote and they'll sort of find the

49
00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:45.240
psychologist will say the thing fits that. Yeah. Right.

50
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.640
So I think most clinical psychologists would say, I've never talked to the guy.

51
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.400
I'm not gonna try to diagnose him from a distance. Right. I,

52
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.600
I have no idea what his condition is or what his issue is,

53
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.440
but then there's a handful who are willing to kind of stick their necks out and

54
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.800
say something. And man,

55
00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:04.760
it's embarrassing to be a psych professor for that reason because you're,

56
00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:09.120
you're always kind of being represented publicly by the people who are kind of

57
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.280
being least professional. Yes. About those kind of diagnoses.

58
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.040
<v 0>That is a real problem today. Isn't it like in, in terms of, uh,</v>

59
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.230
identity politics, this,

60
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.190
this inclination to draw conclusions and to lean towards one

61
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:28.230
side or the other, instead of just looking at the actual situation objectively.

62
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.550
Yeah. And if you're not talking to him, I mean, I'm assuming bill,

63
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.990
Cosby's a terrible piece of as a human being.

64
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.110
That's what I'm assuming by looking at all this,

65
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.030
but I've never talked to the man. I,

66
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.900
I don't know what kind crazy he's got going on in his head,

67
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.180
but if all these women are telling the truth and seems super unlikely that

68
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:48.500
they're all lying. Yeah. I mean, wizard like there's over 50 of 'em right.

69
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.660
With the same story.

70
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.660
<v 1>Yeah. Well he's got a deep dark streak that's for sure. Um,</v>

71
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.020
I mean the weird thing is though a lot of people who are successful have a

72
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:02.050
little bit of that dark streak, they have a little bit of that sociopathy.

73
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.130
Like they can kind of step back from normal human relations and they can

74
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.170
either turn it into, you know, abuse and exploitation like Cosby did,

75
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.210
or they can kind of civilized themselves. Right.

76
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:19.130
And they can harness that to, to do something that's good. And,

77
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.360
and where they're kind of using their ability to take a different viewpoint on

78
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.280
things yeah. To, um,

79
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.520
analyze human behavior or invent things or, or, you know,

80
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.360
propose new policies or whatever. And um,

81
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.320
so I think that kind of dark streak, you know, if you,

82
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.350
that you have to recognize it and, and kind of tame it and work with it.

83
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.510
And the people who do I think can often do great things for society and the

84
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:51.670
people who don't end up in jail.

85
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.910
<v 0>Well, this is one of the reasons why I wanted to bring this up to you as an</v>

86
00:04:55.911 --> 00:04:57.310
evolutionary psych professor,

87
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.060
looking at the human mind and looking at behavior patterns and what what's

88
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:05.380
clearly some sort of, I, I,

89
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.140
I hesitate to call crime and addiction,

90
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.620
but it seems like an addictive pattern that he has,

91
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:15.260
that there's a comp compulsion to doing this to people.

92
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.660
That's not as simple as he wants women to have sex with him.

93
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:21.460
They don't want to have sex with him. So he draw,

94
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.650
I don't think it's that simple. I think there's some getting away with it thing.

95
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.090
There's gotta be some he's better than everyone thing because he's, you know,

96
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.530
he's royalty in the,

97
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.170
in terms of like Hollywood in terms of show business,

98
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.890
in terms of standup comedy, he's always been treated as royalty. I mean,

99
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.640
he's been allowed to Essent criticize.

100
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:47.200
Anyone who wants is it's rarely, is there a rebuttal to the,

101
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.760
the things that he says and you know,

102
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.720
he's been criticizing the black community for its use of bad words and for its

103
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:56.920
use of sexually explicit language and,

104
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.760
and depictions and meanwhile, the entire time he's raping people. I mean,

105
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:02.960
it's amazing.

106
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.680
<v 1>I think one thing that might happen is if you've got this public image as being</v>

107
00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:09.560
like squeaky clean family values,

108
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.880
and you've got the burden of kind of being a moral exemplar like that, you know,

109
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.070
just like, um, tele right. Or anybody who,

110
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.470
who has a big religious following, like the pressure to be good all the time,

111
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.390
I think can kind of tip people into this. Right. The thrill of transgression,

112
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:29.830
I imagine could be quite, quite kind of addictive.

113
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:32.750
And I think that's a real danger.

114
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.620
And I think that's that kind of hypocrisy is why would be really

115
00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:40.500
careful about kind of idolizing anybody yeah.

116
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.900
To that degree kind of morally and, and putting that burden on them.

117
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.580
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I, I could only imagine like being an evangelist,</v>

118
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.740
being someone who, who preached about the word of God, but meanwhile,

119
00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:58.290
having this weird thing, like, uh, do you remember what was his name,

120
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.330
Ted? He,

121
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.250
he ran a giant church in, I believe it was Colorado.

122
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.570
And the entire time I used to have a bit about him the entire time he was

123
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:14.410
smoking meth and having sex with gay prostitutes and all the wilds going on

124
00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:14.680
about,

125
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.800
it's always the guys who go on about how awful gay people are that are secretly

126
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:20.240
gay. It's so common.

127
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.400
<v 1>There's a little research on that. I mean, it's not definitive,</v>

128
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.640
but it looks like a lot of.

129
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.080
<v 0>Ted Haggerty, like Haggerty, film Haggard. Yeah. Haggard.</v>

130
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.960
<v 1>Cause a lot of people, a lot of guys who are pretty like outspokenly homophobic,</v>

131
00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.960
and then like you put them in a,

132
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.470
a sex research situation and see what I actually Rouses them.

133
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:42.310
Like if you show them straight or gay porn, right.

134
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:46.110
And you have a plasmo graph and you, you sense what a what's the graph?

135
00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:48.950
What is it Theisms graph? What is that sense? Is blood flow and penis?

136
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.030
<v 0>Oh boy, I need one of those. I need one of those.</v>

137
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:55.630
Just have it in the background of every podcast. When you come do the podcast,

138
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.150
you gotta put these electrodes on your penis.

139
00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:01.060
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then we are just gonna talk about Japanese vomit porn

140
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.380
and &lt;laugh&gt; tentacles.

141
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.300
<v 1>Well Theisms graphs. Don't lie. Cuz graphs.</v>

142
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.700
<v 0>Don't lie. &lt;laugh&gt; not the heart. The heart lies. Not those plasmo graphs.</v>

143
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.640
&lt;laugh&gt;.

144
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.420
<v 1>So yeah. The, the people who are often, you know, most hostile to something.</v>

145
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:22.290
Yeah. Have some, some little issue inside that is creating some conflict.

146
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.930
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, it only makes sense. The, the,</v>

147
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.930
the conflicted thoughts of the human being who has this ideal of who they'd like

148
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:31.930
to project and what they'd like people to think they are,

149
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.690
who meanwhile has this thing below the surface that is literally everything they

150
00:08:36.691 --> 00:08:40.280
despise and everything they rally against. And that is their true name. Nature.

151
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.280
Yeah. God, it's gotta be the awful feeling. I mean,

152
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:49.520
I've known several guys who are closeted gay men and it's,

153
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.320
it's a awful existence. They,

154
00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:56.360
they just live in this perpetual state of just angst and

155
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.120
unease. And I, meanwhile, God,

156
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.160
I just think for the most part, especially if you live in an urban environment,

157
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:07.720
most part people don't give a anymore. Yeah. You, you,

158
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:10.960
this is almost a self-imposed prison and the people that do give a,

159
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.280
they're the real problem. You know, the,

160
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:15.990
the people who are not get who really care if someone's gay,

161
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.950
unless they're trying to do a cause behind you, like, why do you care?

162
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.750
<v 1>Yeah. I look, if somebody wants to be in the closet about their,</v>

163
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.670
their sexuality, like they want to be discreet yes.

164
00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:31.590
For professional reasons or because investors would panic or whatever. Mm. Like,

165
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:32.510
that's totally cool.

166
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.820
But I think it is hard to be authentic to yourself.

167
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:42.060
Like it's okay to sort of acknowledge I have this sexuality or these

168
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.900
Preds and, and it's up to me to kind of harness them and deal with them and,

169
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.340
and manage them. And if you want to do that privately that's, that's cool.

170
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:52.300
We should have that freedom. Yes. Um,

171
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.930
but if you don't work out those little demo ends and if you can't acknowledge,

172
00:09:56.931 --> 00:09:59.970
what's authentic. I think that's where you get these problems.

173
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:00.970
Like the Cosby case.

174
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.650
<v 0>Yeah. And I,</v>

175
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.890
I believe there's a difference between discretion not wanting to discuss your

176
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.530
sexuality and out and out hypocrisy. Yeah.

177
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.970
These are completely different thing. It's one thing, like you said,

178
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:15.170
like say if a guy's a CEO, it's a major corporation and he happens to be gay.

179
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.680
He's just not interested in all the political nonsense and all the social

180
00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:21.160
nonsense that goes along with discussing that. Yeah. He's like,

181
00:10:21.161 --> 00:10:25.160
I'm just gonna keep it discreet. That makes sense. Like, why should he have to,

182
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.600
but if he lies to his friends, you know.

183
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.440
<v 1>Like, or, or if he goes on the attack and media. Yes. That is yes.</v>

184
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.960
<v 0>That damnation hail fire. Yeah. We are so strange.</v>
