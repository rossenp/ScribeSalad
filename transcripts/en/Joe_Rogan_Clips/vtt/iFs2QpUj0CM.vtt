00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I don't wanna do it anymore.</v>

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.440
And even saying that sounded crazy to me. She was like, she was just real quiet.

3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm thinking like, why is she not saying nothing? I was like,

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.240
I don't think I'm gonna do this anymore.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.120
And she said something she had never said previously, typically she's like,

6
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:20.240
babe, look, it's not time. Come on. You gotta get up.

7
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:22.310
I'm know you feel this way. I know you're by. But come on.

8
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.910
I feel like you still got time in the sport. First time she ever agreed with me,

9
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:29.670
she was like, I think the decision has already made Dre. I was like, what?

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.710
I think the decision has already made. She said,

11
00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:34.390
I've been looking at you throughout this whole day.

12
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.310
And some of the stuff you've been saying,

13
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.390
and I've never really seen you like this. She said, I think it's already made,

14
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.420
I took that out, bro. I started making phone calls. Wow. Called,

15
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.180
called my lawyer. Who's you know, one of my good friends, Josh Dubin. I said,

16
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.420
Hey bro, I think that may be it for me. And he had been wanting me to be,

17
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.100
you know, done. He was like, if you feel that way, bro, I'm gonna support you.

18
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.740
Call my manager the next morning. And it took us. So I went, I went,

19
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.660
I went that weekend and called the fight. We held off on the announcement.

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.690
My lawyer just told HBO like, look, he's going through some things. We're good.

21
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.370
Give us a couple days. So I got through that weekend and he said,

22
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.170
do you still feel like that come Monday morning? I was like, bro,

23
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:13.370
I think I'm done long story short. Uh,

24
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:16.410
we ended up announcing it September 21st. So it was like a two week period.

25
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.730
We were trying to keep it under wraps,

26
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810
but I was undoing all the stuff I was letting the necessary, people know,

27
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:25.600
rock nation, HBO, everybody, you know? And um, the night before I announced it,

28
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:29.680
man, me and my good friend, um, who's a director. Uh, he's also directed my doc,

29
00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.640
uh, Deontay Thompson. He, um, we put together this video.

30
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.160
It was like a legacy video where I had my young son,

31
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.520
my middle son and my oldest son. And those were like, those were like, you know,

32
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.320
that was me at that point in time in my career.

33
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.270
And we did this whole video that I was gonna announce my retirement with.

34
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.510
And um, and I actually have the doc that I'm working on right now is about this.

35
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:54.230
Like why did the best fighter at the world of the world at that time walk away

36
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:58.950
from the sport on top shot that video out, man, the my retirement bro.

37
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.950
And the response was just overwhelming. You know, it was overwhelming.

38
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.580
Like I just couldn't believe the amount of people that were reaching out and,

39
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.580
and it was, it, it was like good and bad.

40
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.660
Like it was good cause I was getting support, but it felt like somebody died.

41
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:13.580
Like I felt like I died, bro. &lt;laugh&gt;, I'm looking at these resting peace,

42
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:16.500
like not literal resting pieces, but like the comments were like resting peace.

43
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:20.980
Like bro, are you, I couldn't man. I'm what like war not you man.

44
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:23.180
Oh my God man. And it was just,

45
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:26.170
it was like just this huge reaction and

46
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.690
it was overwhelming. Um, and in the two years that followed,

47
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.530
like I said at, at the beginning of this podcast,

48
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.370
harder than I thought it was gonna be one of the hardest,

49
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.450
if not the hardest thing I've ever tried, had to do. And still like,

50
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.240
I still have to do like it a daily decision to be like,

51
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.200
I'm not doing it no more,

52
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.360
but one of the most rewarding man and it was a necessary evil.

53
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.720
And I hope that one day, man, the young guys can look up one day and say, man,

54
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:58.400
I'm gonna do the Andre award. I'm done. No. I mean, so I, you know, I've,

55
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.040
I've proposed in, in my.

56
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.520
<v 1>Previous book that, uh, we have an anxiety set point that, um,</v>

57
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.521
you know,

58
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:10.440
that let's say you're worried about something and all of a

59
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:12.000
sudden that gets resolved.

60
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.480
I just makes room for the next thing to work with. So, you know,

61
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.350
we each kind of fill that void because our brain is, you know,

62
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.110
we've developed a brain that has a certain kind of set point for everything it's

63
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:28.670
doing. And that just makes room for, you know, to fill that, fill that up.

64
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.670
If you're an anxious person, you probably will always be somewhat anxious.

65
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.310
So there's no magic bullet. That's going to take that out.

66
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.540
What you have to do is attack the process from knowledge of how it all

67
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.374
works.

68
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.180
And that requires that we have a more sophisticated understanding that we're

69
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.203
than, uh,

70
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.220
is possible from simply observing behavior because behavior does not tell you

71
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.260
necessarily what's on the mind. Behavior tells you how the, the,

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.610
the brain has responded. But you know, just to go back to the,

73
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.610
the fear threat example, um,

74
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.850
when let's say I, uh,

75
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:12.690
bring you into the laboratory and show you a picture of something

76
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:17.370
like a, a blue square, uh, my colleague glyhelps who used to be at NYU,

77
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.640
who is now at Harvard, did experiments like this. Uh,

78
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.720
and every time the blue square would come on,

79
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.680
the person would get a mild shock to their finger.

80
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.680
And so then she would present the blue square subliminally. That means,

81
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.880
you know, really quickly with the, you know, something that follows it,

82
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:34.800
the kind of mass that,

83
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.360
and that prevents the information from getting into the conscious mind. Uh,

84
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.670
and so the person, so I didn't see anything,

85
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.790
but if you put the person in an imaging machine F MRI

86
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.390
and, uh, image what's happening, that stimulus that threat,

87
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.190
the blue square gets to the Amy amygdala, turns it on the heart, begins to race,

88
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.790
palms or sweating. Um, but the person has no fear.

89
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.140
Hmm. The person doesn't know it's there. And doesn't experience fear.

90
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.220
The amygdala is not about fear.

91
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.860
It's about detecting and responding to danger in order to be afraid that

92
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.940
has to reach your C consci mind so that you can experience

93
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:21.500
it as a state of this autoeticic consciousness. The,

94
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.530
that we're talking about a self involved consciousness,

95
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.570
that's hard for people to separate. Yeah, well, but the idea that.

96
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.570
<v 2>There's a, a physical response, but that your mind's not unaware.</v>

97
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.210
<v 1>Of it. Right. But when you understand that, that's why you become to understand.</v>

98
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:38.850
That's why the medications are not working there targeted to work on these

99
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.970
underlying systems in rats are mice,

100
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.880
but that's not where we are experiencing our anxiety. And then he.

101
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.960
<v 3>Just starts pointing at his face.</v>

102
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.040
And then all his friends around him are pointing at him.

103
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:54.200
And the whole place was just staring and waiting and watching and wondering what

104
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:57.680
the hell's gonna happen. So like a, him, we filmed it before.

105
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.560
This is pre- Instagram put up on YouTube. It's like, I gotta do this.

106
00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:04.800
Every show. This is incredible. And then six months later,

107
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.840
people started coming out with cake me signs.

108
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.520
&lt;laugh&gt; six years later, look at this. Okay, here we go.

109
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.600
So six years later, like I've,

110
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.190
I think I've caked over 15,000 people now &lt;laugh&gt;, you know.

111
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.750
<v 2>Oh my God. Geez. Look at her, go crazy. You hit it right in the mug too, dude.</v>

112
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.580
Perfect shot.

113
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.110
<v 3>I'll tell you. I mean, you know, it just practice makes perfect, you know,</v>

114
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.980
&lt;laugh&gt;.

115
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 2>Yeah. You've thrown 15,000 cakes. I get you get a, you get a feel for her.</v>

116
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:34.190
Look at her. She's dancing. Yeah. Wiping it up. Let.

117
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.540
<v 3>Me see one more time. &lt;laugh&gt; this is like, uh, that was ultra. Oh.</v>

118
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.940
<v 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

119
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.460
<v 3>We have a cake rider. We have very specific cakes at our, you know, uh,</v>

120
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.060
at our show you have a, it's a, it's like a special Aoki cake. What is in it?

121
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.100
The strange thing is there. There's like, not as much cake as you would think.

122
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.100
It's just like frosting it's just so it just explodes everywhere.

123
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.300
<v 2>So it's less bread. Yes.</v>

124
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.050
<v 3>So like less carbs, more sugar. &lt;laugh&gt; well, you,</v>

125
00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:04.810
you diabetic just get out of the front row, please. &lt;laugh&gt;.

126
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.730
<v 2>What a crazy thing for people to enjoy too.</v>

127
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.730
Cause caked in the face lady was having a good time that.

128
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.411
<v 3>That's okay.</v>

129
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:16.410
That's the most important thing at the end of the day is like my cake, me.

130
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:17.243
<v 2>With a bulleye.</v>

131
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.640
<v 3>Okay. This is very normal for me to see &lt;laugh&gt; you know,</v>

132
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.960
like in some cases there's like 50, 50 people with signs up, you know? So, oh,

133
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:26.120
that's.

134
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.920
<v 2>So crazy. Look at that cake face one of the upper, oh, I want cake in my.</v>

135
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.160
<v 3>Face. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. I mean, it's just a, it's a signature part of the show.</v>

136
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.720
It's fun. It's exciting. Cause.

137
00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.590
<v 2>They closed it off to the public. Yeah. And it got 0% on rotten tomatoes.</v>

138
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:45.870
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they then opened it to the public and it got 99%.

139
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.370
Of course.

140
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.590
If that doesn't show a crazy disparity between mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; first of

141
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:54.510
all, the idea that you're gonna suppress it, like you're gonna say it's 0%,

142
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.390
so no one's gonna watch it. And we're gonna shut Dave Chapelle down.

143
00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:00.660
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he's canceled. him. But people love him. You can't.

144
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.580
<v 4>Cancel someone who doesn't care, man. Well, you.</v>

145
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.620
<v 2>Can't cancel Dave Chappelle. No you can't. But on top of that,</v>

146
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:07.860
like the,

147
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.940
how would they not understand that someone is going to know that you're not

148
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:16.220
opening it up to the public? Yeah. And that once it does get open to the public,

149
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:19.970
you're gonna get a massive whiplash, a backlash where people are gonna to come.

150
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.930
And even if they didn't wanna vote on it, now they do. Yeah.

151
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:25.410
And now they're gonna give it a hundred percent or 99%.

152
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.890
<v 4>I knew I had to watch it when I saw how all the media channel,</v>

153
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.730
many of the media channels that I really dislike and do not respect

154
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.250
were coming so hard at it and saying, oh no, you don't need to watch it.

155
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.160
And all this, I was like, oh, this means I absolutely have to watch it.

156
00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:44.960
The guardian game in the UK gave it one star. And then I saw vice saying like,

157
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:48.040
don't watch it, uh, VX saying, don't watch it. I was like, okay, this is,

158
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:51.600
this means that I have to watch this. This is gonna be good. And I wasn't.

159
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.020
<v 2>Disappointed. Well,</v>

160
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:56.720
the influence of a small group of relatively small group of human

161
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.680
beings that are in charge of these media conglomerates is it's really

162
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:06.720
astounding and that they, it's not just opinion.

163
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.640
Right? It's like, they're,

164
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:12.840
they're trying to get people to behave and think the way they do.

165
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.070
It's not just, yeah, it is activism. Yeah. And, and it's, it's also

166
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.510
it's undiguised activism. Mm it's very transparent activism. Mm it's.

167
00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:25.150
In opposed to journalism,

168
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.790
I really wish there was a place where we could go where we can get

169
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.950
100% unbiased information in news. Yeah.

170
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.780
And we can get an honest perspective of both sides.

171
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.580
This side believes this mm-hmm and this is why they believe that.

172
00:09:39.581 --> 00:09:40.580
But this side believes that,

173
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.740
and this is why they believe that it's very hard to do mm-hmm and if you have a

174
00:09:44.741 --> 00:09:45.574
podcast,

175
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.780
one of the things that's really interesting is if you even talk to someone who

176
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.380
has an opposing point of view of yours or who is right wing or

177
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.530
who maybe has questionable ideas,

178
00:09:57.070 --> 00:10:01.690
you are somehow platforming them and supporting their idea and then supporting

179
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.810
some alt white alt-right ideology. And.

180
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.650
<v 5>Because this is not an, a representation of reality. Oh, okay.</v>

181
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.410
And anything that deviates from reality is reality that has filtered through

182
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:18.960
your senses and art at its highest is exactly that

183
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.160
if this was an exact depiction of reality,

184
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.000
it would be a photograph and I don't need the artist. Hmm. Okay.

185
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.440
So even photographs that take you to a slightly other kind of dimension

186
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.120
as you gaze upon them, it's more than what was actually going on at the time.

187
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.510
And that's, that's art take into the craft of photography.

188
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.870
That's why you like it. That's, it's one of the reasons why,

189
00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:42.270
plus I think it was the very first

190
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:48.070
painting where its title is the background.

191
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.070
Think about that. This could have been called, uh, you know,

192
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.500
in the full painting. Obviously this is a, a, a snippet. Yeah. Yeah.

193
00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:00.380
So there's a town there, there's a Cypress tree. There's a church steeple.

194
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:01.940
It could have been called Cypress tree.

195
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:03.220
It could have been called sleepy village.

196
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.180
It could have been called rolling Hills,

197
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.060
but no it's called starry night and everything in front of it,

198
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.380
everything in front of it is just in the way.

199
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.500
And how often do you paint something where the title is the background?

200
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.530
That that's my point. And in this particular case,

201
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.850
the background is the universe. And so, so for me,

202
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:28.890
this was a pivot point in art and it's uh, 1889,

203
00:11:28.891 --> 00:11:32.730
which is recent given the history of, of paintings. And you know,

204
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.970
that go all the way back. So yeah, there, there it is.

205
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:36.970
Is that your favorite painting ever?

206
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.080
<v 2>I had.</v>

207
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.880
<v 5>Have to say yes.</v>

208
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.240
<v 2>It has to be, you have a vest and a phone call &lt;laugh&gt; if it's not,</v>

209
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:43.074
what are you doing?

210
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.680
<v 5>And I,</v>

211
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:50.560
I have four or five ties that have this painting on them in different ways.

212
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.400
Yeah. So, well, what's put that. I'm all in.

213
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.000
<v 2>I'm all in. What's interesting is.</v>

214
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.440
<v 5>That the town is, wait, wait, have you seen starry Knight in bacon?</v>

215
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.680
Somebody did look at, dig it up on the screen. Somebody did it in bacon.

216
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.040
It was just CR &lt;laugh&gt;. Oh.

217
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:05.840
<v 2>God. How weird.</v>

218
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.120
<v 5>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. So that's weird. Yeah. How.</v>

219
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.600
<v 2>Weird go back to the original one please.</v>

220
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.550
&lt;laugh&gt; what's interesting about the original one is that the town is

221
00:12:16.551 --> 00:12:20.070
realistically depicted. The trees are recognizable as trees.

222
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.550
If you ever saw a sky that looked like that, the end would be here. Yeah.

223
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.910
<v 5>E exactly. Plus that swirling is not wind and it's not clouds because if it was,</v>

224
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.580
if it was clouds, you wouldn't see the stars. Right. Well start, uh,

225
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.740
it's how he felt. That's all I can tell you, by the way, that is a real evening.

226
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.100
So that's sorry. It's not even, even it's early morning. The Crescent moon,

227
00:12:41.101 --> 00:12:45.820
when it's that orientation means this is before sunrise and that white object

228
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:49.060
lower on the horizon. That's sort of glow. That's very likely Venus.

229
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.180
And that enables us to trace what's over what set of weeks

230
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.210
this painting was actually, uh, painted.

231
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:05.930
<v 6>I.</v>
