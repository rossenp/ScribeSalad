00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.840
Do you think that much like this country is an experiment in self democracy?

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.680
A very recent experiment. When you look at human history, right?

4
00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.080
Absolutely hundreds of thousands of years that we've been human.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.360
There's really only been a couple years, a hundred years of this.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.120
That's do you think that that's maybe the lens that we should look at?

7
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:23.310
Something like democratic social through? Not that it can't work,

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.750
but that it hasn't been implemented correctly.

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.230
<v 1>Before. That's exactly. That's why we gotta get beyond the ism.</v>

10
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:31.390
You're absolutely right. See what makes, uh, uh,

11
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:34.590
not just the United States has been democratic experiments all around the world.

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.830
Various circumstances.

13
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.430
We become central stage because we become a world power

14
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.900
that understands itself as a democracy with all the contradictions that go hand

15
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.300
in hand. With that begin as a settler colonial enterprise still got slavery.

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.380
Patriarchy workers don't have the right to engage in

17
00:00:55.381 --> 00:01:00.300
collective bargaining in the United States until the 1930s Argentina had

18
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:03.850
in the 1830s are the team is not known to being on the cutting edge for social

19
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.650
justice. &lt;laugh&gt; love you down there in Argentina &lt;laugh&gt; but they know that,

20
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.490
but they had collective bargaining. Why?

21
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.610
Because our Robert barons and our power elites were so powerful. Mm.

22
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.331
You see,

23
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.610
Rockefeller and company had private militias that were bigger than a lot of

24
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:23.000
public armies mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to make sure workers were not able to engage

25
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:24.720
in collective bargains in San Francisco,

26
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:28.800
just yesterday at the Commonwealth club, which is now lodged in,

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.440
in the longshoreman's association, which is fascinated.

28
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.840
Commonwealth is well to do ruling class Harry Bridges,

29
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.200
longshoreman strong union, Jack London,

30
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:41.200
another great socialist there in Oakland. Right.

31
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.150
And what would each trying to do?

32
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.230
They were just trying to ensure that ordinary people gain access to jobs

33
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.470
with a living wage mm. Decent education.

34
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:54.110
This is one reason why I I've spent so much time with my dear brother,

35
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:55.070
Bernie Sanders. Right?

36
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:59.870
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because it's a democratic project that simply says how

37
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.420
come poor children can't have access to some of things that the children of the

38
00:02:04.421 --> 00:02:08.460
well to do have they have the same value. And of course, as a Christian, for me,

39
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.900
they have exactly the same value. Right? So how will they get it?

40
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.740
Well, here comes socialist movements that say,

41
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.500
first thing they wanna do is we're against child labor laws.

42
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.850
That's that's the jungle that's Upton Sinclair. Mm he's.

43
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:27.370
A socialist tried to be governor of California. Right. And what were they doing?

44
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:29.570
What were, what, what were these, these capitalists doing?

45
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.010
They're hiding these kids at six years old, seven years old,

46
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.490
they were dying at 30.

47
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.010
There were no laws against child labor and working seven days a week.

48
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:43.970
So the labor movement brought us the weekend. And I'm not talking about the,

49
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.640
from Canada. &lt;laugh&gt; God bless him.

50
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.280
I'm talking about the two days we have off,

51
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.080
because if we didn't have that from the socialist movement and the labor

52
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
movement they'd have been working young kids seven days,

53
00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:01.080
they did that year after year, decade after decade, that's greed. Right?

54
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.160
That's that's greed. There's no accountability. You see.

55
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.080
<v 0>That's where that whole idea of the let the market decide falls apart. Exactly.</v>

56
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:10.800
Because the market just wants profit. Right?

57
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.900
<v 1>Absolutely.</v>

58
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.920
And that doesn't mean that markets cannot be used in democratic ways,

59
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.280
but they need to be ethical, but they gotta be ethical.

60
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.550
You got to have some accountability and regulation and child labor laws were

61
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.550
very important at breakthroughs at that time. But there are other, you, you had,

62
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.750
you need to have laws to make sure the water was clean and the food was

63
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.350
regulated and clean and.

64
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.030
<v 0>So forth. There's a narrative that you get from poor people often,</v>

65
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.180
or P people that are lower middle class that are against the concept of

66
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.060
socialism, because they equate it with people that want a free ride.

67
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.660
That's right. They, they equate it with people that don't wanna work hard.

68
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.980
That's right. And how that, that's a,

69
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.660
it's a strange narrative when you consider all the things that we talked about

70
00:03:53.661 --> 00:03:55.020
already, like the,

71
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.860
what we need with the fire department and the police department and all the

72
00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:03.410
different ways that socialism does form utilities and all the different ways

73
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:07.570
that socialism does form a, a part of our, our culture and our community.

74
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.810
Why do you think that that is this narrative and how,

75
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.850
how does that narrative get reshaped? Because that narrative of that,

76
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:17.810
the only reason why people want socialism is because they want a free ride.

77
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.500
Right.

78
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.920
<v 1>Right. Ooh, that's a wonderful question. But one is that, um,</v>

79
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.681
you have to first,

80
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.600
we have to listen very closely to our right wing brothers and sisters

81
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.720
and conservatives and mids because oftentimes,

82
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.801
I mean,

83
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:37.520
they're human means like anybody else and they've had their own arguments.

84
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:40.040
I don't think they have strong ones, but they have their own arguments.

85
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:40.711
Mm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

86
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:45.630
So the first thing you'd say about that is what makes you think that the well

87
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.150
to do don't have free rides?

88
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.710
What is inheriting wealth all about?

89
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.910
<v 0>Well, inheriting wealth is free ride. Absolutely. It's.</v>

90
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.670
<v 1>All it is. What is free? The connections. So getting into the prep schools,</v>

91
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.020
the Ivy league schools and so forth, even though they work,

92
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:06.020
it's still a kind of free ride. Yes.

93
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.620
So if they're preoccupied with this issue of being a free ride, you, you,

94
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.500
we tell them, let's make sure that people do work hard.

95
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:20.060
Yes. And sacrifice, and therefore in some way deserve what they have. Now,

96
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.250
if just based on principle,

97
00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.490
the upper echelons of American society would be indicted. Yes.

98
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.090
Deeply indicted.

99
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.370
And it's not a matter of hating the rich cause I don't believe in hating anybody

100
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:38.050
individually. I hate greed. Yes. I hate injustice. I hate white supremacy.

101
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:41.250
I hate anti-Jewish prejudice. I hate anti Palestinian prejudice.

102
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.320
I hate patriarchy and so forth.

103
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.440
But the human beings where these ideologies filter through are still

104
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:51.680
human beings. Yes. You see what I mean? So that's the beginning of it.

105
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.320
Now of course, part of the question here is, has to do with, uh, they'll say,

106
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.640
well, we wasted this money on the poor. He said, well, wait a minute,

107
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.200
Donald Trump just passed a

108
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.040
$750 billion military budget. Democrats voted for it too.

109
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.320
How much waste is in the military?

110
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.030
Why is 60 cent of every $1 come outta the federal bullet budget

111
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.630
tied to the military?

112
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.870
Why is there no close oversight and accountability of it?

113
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.110
How come American people don't know about the full countries that we are bombing

114
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.190
or assisting other countries in bombing. And we can go right down. Pakistan,

115
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.300
Afghanistan, absolutely. Molly,

116
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.980
Niger, Somalia, um, Iraq. I mean,

117
00:06:43.981 --> 00:06:45.740
you can go on and on and on. Right?

118
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.820
How come we don't know about the 4,800 military units, 587 around the world.

119
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.740
We got us special operations in 128 countries.

120
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.180
Only 197 in the world. Right?

121
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.610
What about the soldiers who die hardly any talk about it?

122
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.330
What about the innocent people? We kill hardly any talk about it.

123
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.930
What about the drones that we still dropping and not always on

124
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.090
military combatants, but innocent people almost.

125
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.450
<v 0>Primarily on innocent.</v>

126
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.400
<v 1>People. Sometimes even disproportionately.</v>

127
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.560
Those are precious people too. Yeah.

128
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.720
And they have the same value as anybody in Ethiopia, America, Chicago.

129
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.880
<v 0>But you feel the drones are particularly insidious because it doesn't even seem</v>

130
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:35.000
like it's really happening because it's a robot doing it. Absolutely.

131
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.853
And it's done.

132
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.990
<v 1>Distance remotely, no human sensitivity.</v>

133
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.163
<v 0>At all.</v>

134
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:45.150
Apparently the PTSD that suffered by those remote drone operators is pretty

135
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.150
profound too. You can understand.

136
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.150
<v 1>That. Yes. You can deeply understand.</v>

137
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.670
And yet no serious public conversation about it in the little tell you I was on

138
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:57.670
the plane the other day. And, uh, the pilot says, uh,

139
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.540
I hope you all are able to take a few minutes of your time because we've got a

140
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:06.580
family outside, waiting for the body of someone just killed in Afghanistan,

141
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.300
an Italian family in Chicago.

142
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.900
One of the saddest things you ever wanna see in your life, man,

143
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:16.380
is a family lined up and they bring in the body out and you say to yourself,

144
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:22.130
how come there's no public spotlight on

145
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.330
that? And you see, when I was growing up in the sixties,

146
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:30.170
Walter Kranky Vietnam, we saw the bodies.

147
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.210
<v 0>Well, during the Bush administration,</v>

148
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.290
they made it illegal to take photographs of flag draped, coffins.

149
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:39.930
That's exactly. Which is unbelievably insane. That's.

150
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.520
<v 1>A exactly right. And continued under Obama and company, you know? And you say,</v>

151
00:08:44.521 --> 00:08:48.160
well, wait a minute, they they're paying this ultimate cost.

152
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.760
And the, uh, they changed the narrative and the tears of the, the families.

153
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.480
And they can't even put a public spotlight on it. Yeah, my God.

154
00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.760
And then of course they lie to us as well.

155
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:05.400
Our drones are not in any way killing civilians and they end up killing an

156
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.920
American and they have a press conference the same day in economic compensation

157
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.560
for the family, the rest of their life. I agree with that.

158
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.150
But what about the drones that are killing folk in Yemen and Somalia and

159
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:21.950
Pakistan and Afghanistan? Oh, they deny they're even killing them. Yeah.

160
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.470
You say quit lying. That's John Brennan and company.

161
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:28.270
He was in both Bush and Obama administration. You see,

162
00:09:28.271 --> 00:09:32.710
how do we keep track of those in the name of what democratic accountability?

163
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.980
That's not socialism. Socialism is democratic accountability,

164
00:09:37.981 --> 00:09:40.660
but there's been socialism without democratic accountability.

165
00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:43.660
And what do you get? Tyranny? That's Soviet union and company.

166
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.540
But when you get capitalism with no democratic accountability, what do you get?

167
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.380
You get a predatory capitalism with gross wealth inequality,

168
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.930
and everyday people to masses of porn, working people fighting for.

169
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.250
<v 0>Crumbs. And there's also this denial of it. Amongst the most patriotic.</v>

170
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.690
They don't want to consider it.

171
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:08.010
They don't wanna factor it in to what we think of when we think of America.

172
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:09.610
The great, no, you don't. You want,

173
00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:11.730
you don't wanna factor in those innocent people, which I,

174
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.970
what was the last time we checked? It was in the 90%, right. Of people that,

175
00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.840
that are killed by drones are actually innocent. It's,

176
00:10:19.841 --> 00:10:21.400
it's some insane number.
