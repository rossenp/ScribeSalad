00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 2>The big change in my life was when I learned how to breathe.</v>

3
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.640
I start to bring in more spiritual possibilities, more mental possibilities,

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.360
because what is interesting about the, the,

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.560
the breathing aspect is the brain and the,

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.310
and the heart are the only organs who can give

7
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.390
and receive information. The other organs, liver,

8
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.350
kidney, they don't cannot do that.

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.830
But when you get upset with something mentally,

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.710
you bring information to yourself immediately.

11
00:00:35.711 --> 00:00:39.230
Your brain's responding your heart too. When you get depressed,

12
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:43.660
immediately feel in your heart and your heart show you, you said,

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.900
show you is immediately connection.

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.500
And what is amazing about that is the lung is the practical aspect

15
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.460
within you are able to control or, or help your,

16
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.140
your brain and also help your heart.

17
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.810
So through the proper breathing,

18
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:06.530
you can control your heartbeats through the proper breathing.

19
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.490
You can control your mindset and get calmer, control your panic control,

20
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.130
your courage, control everything you need in the mental aspect.

21
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.450
And also spiritual hope. Faith, visualizations,

22
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.080
all the elements in your brain.

23
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.400
All the elements in your heart can be much better guided,

24
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.320
much better help through the lungs.

25
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.080
If you don't know how to involve your lungs in your brain, in your breathing,

26
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.320
you, you, you are not able to, to, to favor your,

27
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.870
your brain and your heart, the way supposed to be.

28
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.910
<v 1>It's kind of amazing that everybody breathes,</v>

29
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.750
but a relatively small percentage of people know how to breathe correctly. Yes.

30
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.590
<v 0>You born, you get slap on your butt</v>

31
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.150
and you think you live in well and you breathe for life. It's not like that.

32
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.620
The first learn you learn about breathing is to move the upper body,

33
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.380
the upper part of your lung.

34
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.620
<v 2>If you don't learn, if you don't PRS,</v>

35
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:17.940
you're never gonna use the DIAP pragmatic breathing,

36
00:02:17.941 --> 00:02:22.540
which involves the full capacitor of your lungs. So the diag,

37
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.410
when you, how you move your diaphragm efficiently,

38
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.250
you fill up your lungs in a different way. So if I breathe right

39
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.743
or wrong,

40
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.090
either more or less oxygen up to me, the way I use the diag or not.

41
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.960
So when I learned how to use that, I'm able to help my body and whatever needs,

42
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.320
mental, spiritual, or physical.

43
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.400
<v 1>When you, uh, that famous scene in choke,</v>

44
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.320
when you're moving your stomach around or the drums beating, it's,

45
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:00.040
it's really crazy. I love people. People love that scene. Yeah.

46
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.960
Because you're using that control of your diaphragm.

47
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.760
How did you learn how to do that?

48
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.400
<v 0>The &lt;inaudible&gt; he taught you.</v>

49
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.233
<v 1>To do that. He taught me. Yes.</v>

50
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.400
And how long did it take before you could move your stomach like that?

51
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.120
I know it's not as difficult can do that too, right? Yeah. It's.

52
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.280
<v 0>Not as difficult. You can learn this in no time.</v>

53
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.510
You just need the righteous because it's all about it is a quick learning.

54
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.363
You know, it's just,

55
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.390
you have to put some attention because when you learn how to breathe,

56
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.030
you start adding oxygen to your life.

57
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.030
You can stay five, seven days without food, five days without water,

58
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.230
but five minutes without the air, you dead.

59
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.460
So when you know how to hyperventilate, it's like double your life.

60
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.740
Three point your lifetime because you not get tired as you want. What do you.

61
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.940
<v 1>When you say hyperventilate, what do you mean by hyperventilate?</v>

62
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.220
<v 0>I'm here come right. If I do this,</v>

63
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.420
I breathe. If I wanna go dive,

64
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.810
I need to hyperventilate. So I need to &lt;laugh&gt;

65
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.610
Because I,

66
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.850
I increase the circulation of oxygen in my body and I increase the blood,

67
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.290
the oxygen on the cells.

68
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.200
So I do hyperventilation for a little while and I triple the of time.

69
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.280
I gonna be under the water.

70
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.160
Another important thing for people to learn about breathing is the idea

71
00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:30.000
of inhale.

72
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.520
They inhale is not the cause is the solution. So what I,

73
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.230
what if I need a full lung, a full breath? I don't wanna just do,

74
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.790
if I want a full breath, I first need to.

75
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.830
Now I have a full breath, because if I just start from here,

76
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.750
I already have 30% of air inside, which is not, we doesn't empty enough.

77
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:03.660
So in order for me to put it all in a hundred percent of

78
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.060
good air inside my liveness,

79
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.260
my attention has to be on the exhale.

80
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.860
Now I'm ready to get there. The effort,

81
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.180
the strength on the muscle. If I need to be, get a big biceps,

82
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:26.170
I need to curl. If I need to have a strong breeding system,

83
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.810
I need to Excel. They inhale is natural.

84
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.570
Some people, they feel tired. I need their, they go against the, the, and,

85
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.330
and against the, the, the flow, because they try to bring in,

86
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.040
which is already Claus of fabric. More. I need air more like,

87
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.033
oh my God.

88
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.720
So my liveness, my focus is to take the bad gas out of me,

89
00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.400
the good gas coming. Naturally. Some people say, I need air. They need the air,

90
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.680
but they're already full of bad gas. So,

91
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.680
and that's make a big confusion on the, on the right way to the gas commun out.

92
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.600
So my organization in my brain is to put the bad gas out of me.

93
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.040
So when I train consistently,

94
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.990
If I'm not effective on the exhale, I'm not gonna be effective on inhale.

95
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.750
And the liveness of my, my muscle system is the contraction.

96
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.180
The contraction is the di pragmatic breathing, pH that's the contraction.

97
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.500
If I do a curve for get like strong biceps, that's the contraction.

98
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.180
When I do this, I relax contract.

99
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.540
So contract relax.

100
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.780
So, and that's giving me a,

101
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.130
a different edge to understand clear everything around me.

102
00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:59.050
Watch the.
