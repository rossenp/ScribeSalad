1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>Well, the Joe Rogan experience it's to protect freedom,</v>

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:08.940
or if you're a slave trader it's to rescue the Africans from terrible lives in

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:12.840
Africa and bring them to the comfortable plantations. Um,

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.210
that was actually an argument. Oh yeah.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100
The slave trade had at complete rescue narrative.

6
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:24.240
I'm talking about the British slave trade here, because that was,

7
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.440
that was the first really intense campaign of industrial denial.

8
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:33.330
I could find the BR the British dominated the slave trade in the 17 hundreds

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.060
and the hay. Uh,

10
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.170
they faced a very powerful abolition movement at the end of that century,

11
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.520
which was really going to the public and saying, look at how brutal this is.

12
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.950
They had witnesses, they had the torture devices,

13
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.530
they had all kinds of evidence. Um,

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.230
and the British were really responding because they,

15
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.930
even though they dominated the slave trade, you know,

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.970
th they had this notion of themselves as civilized and,

17
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:01.320
and promoting freedom and being very humane.

18
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.360
So this was starting to really affect the industry.

19
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.480
So the traders and the planters got together, they formed a slave lobby.

20
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.280
They had a very organized campaign in response. It was a slave lobby.

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.800
There was a very powerful slate lobby. I mean,

22
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.720
the thing about the slave trade was you had people invested in it from

23
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:23.610
the Royal family down to the local bakers, uh,

24
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.640
to many members of parliament. I mean, it was a widely accepted,

25
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.050
fully legitimate industry so that the abolitionists really had their work cut

26
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:35.040
out from, for them. And they had all this evidence,

27
00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:37.860
the industry comes back and they, they knew they couldn't just say, oh,

28
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:38.820
it's not so brutal.

29
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.500
They actually came back with this complete counter narrative, which was,

30
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.760
we are rescuing these people that, that there,

31
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.900
the Africans are eager to be purchased.

32
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.270
They actually try to market themselves as how fit they are for, for work.

33
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.290
They enjoy that crossing across the Atlantic. There is singing,

34
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.760
dancing games of chance. And when they get to the plantations,

35
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.090
it is incredibly comfortable. They get comfy little houses.

36
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.330
It's like a cradle to grave welfare state.

37
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.110
They don't have to worry if they get sick, we take care of them. We feed them.

38
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.280
Um,

39
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.810
and they're doing way better than those poor peasants back there in Britain or

40
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:23.370
those poor miners or those people working in the, in the new factories. So,

41
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.510
uh, that was, that was part of it. Then the next part of it was that they,

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.000
they said that if they had left them in Africa,

43
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.250
if you didn't continue this trade,

44
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.640
all of these prisoners of war would be massacred,

45
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.230
or they would be eaten by cannibals, or they would die of famine.

46
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.750
So they were, this was a rescue narrative.

47
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:44.370
And here's the really clever part of this,

48
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:48.360
because if you believe that you are rescuing them,

49
00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.510
or if you persuade other people, I'm not suggesting the industry believe this,

50
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.300
but if you can persuade people that you are rescuing them,

51
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.830
the flip side of it is that abolition would doom them.

52
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.580
You would be shutting the gates of mercy on mankind, uh,

53
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.040
because as one, one trader put it,

54
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.160
the house of is really the,

55
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.120
the house of freedom to them. I've may have missed spoken that a little bit,

56
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:16.550
but it was a truly Orwellian quote. And, and,

57
00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:18.270
and so that way you,

58
00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:22.300
you translate abolition into inhumanity,

59
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.160
into brutality and,

60
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.690
and you portray the continued slave trade as a way to, to save these people. Oh,

61
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.260
one, one quote was great that if you were to free the slaves and,

62
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.160
and by the way, at this point,

63
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:35.950
they weren't actually talking about freeing the existing slaves,

64
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:38.020
just stopping the flow of new slaves.

65
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.180
But one of the quotes was that freeing the slaves would be cramming Liberty down

66
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.540
the throats of people incapable of digesting it.

67
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.570
Wow. Yeah.

68
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.520
<v 1>So this was the first example that you found of industry that was</v>

69
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.200
working to try to distort the perceptions of reality

70
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.330
so that they can continue what they're doing. Right.

71
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.980
<v 0>And, uh, you know,</v>

72
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:06.270
they did a lot of other things that we've seen modern industries doing. They,

73
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.260
they, you know,

74
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.970
I mentioned the reference to the poor peasants and they also talked about,

75
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.090
you know, how would you like it Britain, if,

76
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.930
if people came in and started telling the peasants and the soldiers and the

77
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:23.580
sailors that they had rights, uh, you know, so basically this kind of, you know,

78
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:25.050
help us, or you are next,

79
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:28.650
your whole class structure is going to collapse that kind of an argument. Um,

80
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.090
and then they had an argument about basically failing to make a distinction

81
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:37.230
between their industry and their interests and the whole country, or rather,

82
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.951
you know,

83
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:41.970
kind of an early version of what's good for the country as good for GM and vice

84
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:45.030
versa. They said, if you abolish this trade,

85
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:47.940
it means universal bankruptcy for the kingdom.

86
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.100
It means Britain is not powerful anymore.

87
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.000
It means Britain becomes a province of France. Uh,

88
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.900
it means in the sugar islands that the slaves will massacre the,

89
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.850
the whites exterminate the whites and in, or maybe make the white slaves. Um,

90
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.140
so they basically just created this incredible slippery slope that every,

91
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.550
that any kind of reform, or certainly abolition of this industry would,

92
00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:12.390
would be disastrous for the entire kingdom.

93
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.800
<v 1>So how well documented is this in terms of like the influencers, like who,</v>

94
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:19.020
who started this, like, and th is it,

95
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.300
was there like open discussions about how to spin this in

96
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:26.790
a way that it's going to get people to think that slavery is a good thing?

97
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.000
<v 0>Well, I don't know about internal discussions within the industry.</v>

98
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.410
What we do have are lots and lots of books and pamphlets,

99
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.970
because this was all done in writing. We also have some hearings and we have,

100
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.900
uh, parliamentary debates. They were recorded, not, you know, verbatim,

101
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:44.160
but people try to write them down.

102
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:47.340
And so we have some version of what was actually said in these debates,

103
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.560
in the various hearings, there were parliamentary hearings.

104
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.690
So there's actually quite a lot of evidence of the arguments being made in

105
00:05:54.691 --> 00:05:55.620
their own words.

106
00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.410
<v 1>So, and then this was primarily in Britain.</v>

107
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.950
<v 0>Right? Right. And this is, well, that's what I'm talking about here.</v>

108
00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:05.980
Obviously there was the, we had our own abolition movement here.

109
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.850
<v 1>Right. That's what I was going to ask. You did those same arguments, uh,</v>

110
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.100
did they actually get presented in the United States?

111
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.590
<v 0>Some of them did in the United States,</v>

112
00:06:14.591 --> 00:06:19.450
it was different because of course you had an entire society built around

113
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:22.180
slavery. And I read one,

114
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.070
one reference when historian saying that about half of the defenses of slavery

115
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.170
came from the clergy.

116
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.450
It wasn't quite the same sort of clearly he hears an industry and here's an

117
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:36.280
audience that they're talking to. Um,

118
00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:39.580
so that's one of the reasons I didn't focus quite at all, really on the,

119
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:43.390
on the American debate of it was from clergy. That's what this, this, uh,

120
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.400
historian said. I, I didn't dig into those. I did, by the way though, find one,

121
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.781
uh, source.

122
00:06:49.781 --> 00:06:53.680
And now I don't remember if he was a plantation owner or something else who

123
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:58.030
described, um, the called slavery, you know,

124
00:06:58.031 --> 00:07:00.660
basically a way to make people as happy as can be and,

125
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.760
and called it the ideal of communism, which was funny.

126
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.530
Cause you don't even think of communism of that debate is existing. This was,

127
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.750
would have been an 18 hundreds now. Um,

128
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.080
but he was saying that the north is exploiting.

129
00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:15.850
These workers not taking care of them,

130
00:07:15.851 --> 00:07:19.490
but in the south week we take care of them. We make them happy as.

131
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.740
<v 2>Well. Jesus. Yeah. So.</v>

132
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.120
<v 1>Is this a pattern that existed before that, like, is this, is there, uh,</v>

133
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.570
is there any evidence that there was something, I mean,

134
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.360
it seems like whenever people start to make money doing something,

135
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:36.700
whenever a corporation, particularly a corporation, right?

136
00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:40.660
Because there's this diffusion of responsibility in a large group of folks and

137
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:42.730
they have this, you know,

138
00:07:42.731 --> 00:07:46.180
this obligation to earn money for all the people that are involved in the

139
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:47.014
corporation.

140
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.040
So they start rationalizing their decisions and then twisting things around.

141
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.290
But is this, uh, is this something that can be traced back before then?

142
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.710
Is this an, an, a natural human trait, this kind of deception?

143
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.910
<v 0>Well, I can't specifically answer whether it can be traced before then because I</v>

144
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:07.750
didn't try to trace it. Um, but I would not be at all surprised, uh,

145
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.280
because I do think it's a natural human trait. Um, I mean, I, uh,

146
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.050
one of the issues that I,

147
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.650
I started to struggle with on this book was deciding to what extent are people

148
00:08:17.651 --> 00:08:22.150
lying? And when are they actually deceiving themselves? And I realized early on,

149
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.720
there was just no way to write this book if I was going to try to parse that

150
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.290
out.

151
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.640
And I also decided it doesn't matter that much because I think these are really

152
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.040
very much intertwined. Um,

153
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.640
and they're both equally destructive and they're both, I think,

154
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:41.320
equally responsive to these kinds of external circumstances that we create

155
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.310
in corporations when we form corporations and we put them into them into a

156
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:48.700
marketplace. So I do think it's part of human nature. Um,

157
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.620
I do think we've created this system that brings this out in people and really

158
00:08:53.621 --> 00:08:56.010
encourages it in in many ways. I mean,

159
00:08:56.011 --> 00:09:00.390
you mentioned the diffusion of responsibility and that is huge because

160
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.680
we do know,

161
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.970
and I dip into the social psychology and here not a ton of it because

162
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.440
that science is still relatively new and kind of, you know,

163
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:13.020
a little bit thin compared to the environmental science that I,

164
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.410
that I talk about, which is very, very deep. But, um,

165
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.460
we do know that when you, when you diffuse responsibility,

166
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:24.390
it makes it very easy for people not to feel responsible for the harm that's

167
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.810
done. So if you've got a corporation, of course you have division of labor.

168
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.930
You also have division of management from ownership.

169
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:34.980
So if you're a lower worker and you're told to lie about something or cause some

170
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:39.030
harm, well, you're minding your own business and you, and you let the,

171
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.230
your boss take responsibility. If you're the boss, uh,

172
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:48.030
you're focused maybe on your employees and certainly on your

173
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:51.480
shareholders. So if you're lying about something or causing harm,

174
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.560
it doesn't necessarily feel like a personal selfish act of deception.

175
00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:59.240
It probably feels like an act of loyalty and responsibility to your

176
00:09:59.241 --> 00:10:03.110
shareholders, shareholders, air holders, aren't going to care or no,

177
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:07.220
because first of all, they're far away usually, uh, they,

178
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.270
they don't really know what's going on. They have maybe just a temporary,

179
00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:14.570
transactional interest in what's going on. They just bought the stock.

180
00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:17.090
They want to sell it quickly and make some money. So,

181
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.650
so you don't really have anybody there who feels really responsible for this,

182
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:23.060
that there was a definition of, uh,

183
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.470
of the corporation from the early 20th century in something called the cynics

184
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.820
dictionary as an ingenious device for obtaining

185
00:10:31.821 --> 00:10:35.630
personal profit, without personal responsibility. And,

186
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.520
and of course that is exactly what we intend from corporations because they are,

187
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.920
we, we grant limited liability to the shareholders and that's why it's that

188
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.120
it's that protection from risk that people are willing to pool their capital.

189
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.080
And, and that sort of very key to, to the very idea of, of a corporation.

190
00:10:54.081 --> 00:10:55.790
And then of course the, uh,

191
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.770
the focus on profits means that you are constantly focused on, uh, on money.

192
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.490
And, you know, at every, in, in the most short-term way,

193
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:09.200
not even long-term profits, which would be a narrow enough focus. Um,

194
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.900
but then there's a lot of other things to add to it. Uh,

195
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.470
you you've got competition, um, by definition,

196
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.430
certainly if you're in competitive markets, we want there to be competition.

197
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.000
So that means you are already in a kind of tribal mindset. Uh,

198
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.960
and you've got the etiology of the marketplace, which, you know,

199
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.230
we can go back to Adam Smith, the invisible hand, and,

200
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:34.760
and basically the notion that if you can pursue your own self-interest in the

201
00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:37.880
marketplace will automatically convert that to public good.

202
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.200
And that does work in a lot of cases and probably worked a lot better in the 17

203
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.034
hundreds,

204
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:48.170
but when you've got these enormous organizations that have

205
00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:52.940
incredible market power and these very new risky technologies often,

206
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:57.640
uh, it, it is much harder to, to be confident that that's going to work.

207
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.550
And then more recently we've seen that,

208
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.600
that idea that you don't have to worry about the social consequences of your

209
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:09.310
commercial action, uh, just get intensified. We, we had, you know,

210
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:10.870
Milton Friedman in 1970,

211
00:12:10.871 --> 00:12:15.430
writing this very persuasive article saying that the only real

212
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.241
objective,

213
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:20.470
the only legitimate objective of a corporation is to maximize shareholder

214
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:20.981
profit.

215
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:24.400
And if they're talking about protecting the environment or doing any of these

216
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:28.170
other things, that's socialism and, and that's the legitimate and the,

217
00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:32.800
and that really did, uh, sway a lot of people that movement really move forward.

218
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:35.860
And then it got more extreme in the nineties. And,

219
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.250
and in the 21st century where you've got this,

220
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:40.930
this strain of,

221
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.430
of intense faith in market forces that was

222
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:50.410
manifested by Alan Greenspan at the fed by the Koch

223
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:53.110
brothers, David Koch has passed away. So,

224
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.060
so now Charles Koch and the network of influence groups

225
00:12:58.061 --> 00:13:01.480
that he created the think tanks, the free market groups,

226
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:06.000
these different academic groups. So, you know, one of the things that I,

227
00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:10.570
I tried to trace a little bit in the book is talking about the rise of the

228
00:13:10.571 --> 00:13:14.200
consumer movement and the environmental movement in the sixties and seventies,

229
00:13:14.201 --> 00:13:17.650
and people saying, wait a minute, we need corporations to,

230
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:19.930
to be aware of these problems.

231
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:23.830
And we need government to regulate corporations to make sure that our cars are

232
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:28.750
safe and our ozone layer is not destroyed. Uh, but then starting in 1980,

233
00:13:28.751 --> 00:13:31.210
when Reagan is elected, you suddenly see those,

234
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:35.370
those concerns replaced with a concern regulation and,

235
00:13:35.371 --> 00:13:38.860
and really a backlash that, that, you know, has, has come and gone,

236
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:42.430
but basically intensified over the years. And, and now of course,

237
00:13:42.431 --> 00:13:44.680
we have a situation where, you know,

238
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.500
not only do we have a government unwilling to regulate,

239
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:52.390
but we have one that is rolling back critical regulations that were put in place

240
00:13:52.391 --> 00:13:54.550
by previous administrations.

241
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.040
<v 1>And of course, influenced by these very corporations to do that.</v>

242
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.780
<v 0>Absolutely. And I mean, it gets,</v>

243
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:04.530
it gets kind of complicated here because if you think, for example,

244
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:07.650
about Charles Coke and Coke industries, it's based in oil refining.

245
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:12.630
So that is very much based in the fossil fuel industry, but, but,

246
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.640
uh, the Koch network is very ideological, passionately ideological,

247
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.060
um, and they just happened to coincide with, with being in the,

248
00:14:21.061 --> 00:14:22.290
in the fossil fuel industry.

249
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.880
But you have a lot of other groups that have received money from oil companies

250
00:14:26.881 --> 00:14:30.810
from the coal industry. So it gets kind of integrated. Um,

251
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.480
I do try to not treat them all the same in the book.

252
00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:35.220
I try to kind of differentiate and,

253
00:14:35.221 --> 00:14:39.240
and you really do have a difference between the, the kind of Coke perspective,

254
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:42.360
the coal industry perspective, the oil industry perspective,

255
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:45.420
and then all of these little free market groups, actually,

256
00:14:45.421 --> 00:14:46.890
they fit more around the Coke side.

257
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.000
<v 1>But they all seem to have one thing in common that they're rationalizing and</v>

258
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:55.910
their actions because they want to continue to make profits regardless of the

259
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.700
impact on the environment or the people. Exactly.

260
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:03.710
And this that's a weird thing about just the idea of a corporation itself.

261
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.030
It's almost like a diabolical vehicle for, for allowing people to do things,

262
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.260
you know, to, to, to be able to do something and say, Hey,

263
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:16.190
we're going to do this as a collective and therefore, no,

264
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.160
no individuals are responsible for the results of the collective.

265
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:22.190
Particularly if you're not the one who gets to decide what gets done,

266
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.610
you're just taking orders and you're just doing your job and your job is

267
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:28.670
segmented and it's all compartmentalized. So you're not,

268
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.350
you're not dumping anything in the river bomb.

269
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.480
You don't have to worry about that, but, uh,

270
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.000
I like your new car and that's a beautiful house that you got,

271
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:36.800
you bought with the profits of poisoning lakes.

272
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.670
<v 0>Well, that's, that's exactly it. In fact,</v>

273
00:15:39.671 --> 00:15:44.590
I suggest in the book that if you were a super villain and you wanted to create

274
00:15:44.591 --> 00:15:49.420
a society that would ultimately destroy itself by imposing huge

275
00:15:49.421 --> 00:15:51.760
risks on each other and on the planet,

276
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:57.010
you would probably create something that looks a lot like our current

277
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.020
corporate dominated global economy in the sense of these organizations that

278
00:16:02.021 --> 00:16:04.380
amplify your self interest,

279
00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:07.360
that diminish your sense of responsibility,

280
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.580
that amplify all of your biases.

281
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.240
You'd have a justifying ideology to make it all seem fine.

282
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:18.160
You would have the responsibility so diffuse that nobody would really feel too

283
00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:19.720
badly about it. Uh,

284
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.400
and you give these folks incredible political power,

285
00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:28.930
including constitutional rights so that they could dominate your democracy so

286
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:33.580
that they could basically corporations can do whatever is legal

287
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.900
used to not be that way.

288
00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:37.900
They could do whatever they were authorized to do by their charter,

289
00:16:37.901 --> 00:16:38.860
and then they'd have to stop.

290
00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:42.250
So they'd get the permission to build a canal and then they,

291
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:43.960
and then they'd be done and go away.

292
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.010
Eventually we made them immortal and they could do whatever they wanted,

293
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:49.690
as long as it's legal.

294
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.190
And then we gave them a huge amount of power to determine what actually is legal

295
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.080
by influence our democracy. I was.

296
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.921
<v 1>Going to ask you about that. Like,</v>

297
00:16:56.921 --> 00:16:59.830
what is the birth of the limited liability corporation? Like when,

298
00:16:59.831 --> 00:17:02.260
when did all that occur? Well, they go.

299
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:04.960
<v 0>Way back. I mean, during the slave trade, they were,</v>

300
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.210
they didn't necessarily call them that,

301
00:17:07.211 --> 00:17:11.590
but they were essentially owned by shareholders. And so they would,

302
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.710
you know, pool their capital. So it was very similar. We've had corporate,

303
00:17:14.711 --> 00:17:18.160
I mean, actually corporations are centuries old. If you go back to, I think,

304
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:19.780
some early universities and things,

305
00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:25.330
but we w we didn't have kind of general purpose corporate laws in this country,

306
00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:28.060
I think until mostly in the 18 hundreds.

307
00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:31.150
So when we first formed this country, um,

308
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.450
you would have to go to the legislature. There were only a couple of,

309
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:39.400
of significant corporations around, even at the time of the founders.

310
00:17:39.401 --> 00:17:42.690
And so that's why you really don't see corporations in the constitution.

311
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.420
They're not mentioned because they weren't very powerful when they did get more

312
00:17:46.421 --> 00:17:49.620
powerful. You know, you have some quotes from some of the founders saying, oh,

313
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:52.650
this is, this is a little scary. Uh, and then of course,

314
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:56.570
they became very powerful in the 18 hundreds. You end up with a gilded age. And,

315
00:17:56.571 --> 00:18:01.230
and so then you have folks like Teddy Roosevelt who are saying,

316
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:03.660
wait a minute, you know, this is a creation of law.

317
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.510
And so we get to determine how much power it has.

318
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.710
And he responded with the kind of trust busting movements,

319
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:15.210
breaking down some of the really big old trusts. Um, and, and that was,

320
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.040
you know, probably the first big pushback where, where the government said,

321
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.350
wait a minute, you corporations are too powerful.

322
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.560
We're going to try to reduce that power. Um,

323
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:30.510
and then I think the next big phase of that would have been in the depression

324
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.440
where you have the, the new deal coming in and saying, okay, banks,

325
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:37.020
you just wreck the economy. We're going to regulate you.

326
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.500
We're going to give workers more rights. We're going to create social security.

327
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:42.090
We're going to do all kinds of things that,

328
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.720
that diminish corporate power over the democracy.

329
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:48.660
And then it happened again in the sixties and seventies.

330
00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.400
And what I think is that, is that it might be about to happen again,

331
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:58.710
given that there is now so much concern about corporate power,

332
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.690
uh, you know, citizens United influence over our democracy. Um,

333
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.610
people worried about concentration of wealth at the very, very tippy top. And,

334
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.210
uh, obviously people were that we are unable to deal with climate change.

335
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.580
<v 1>And, uh,</v>

336
00:19:13.581 --> 00:19:18.440
another factor would be the power of social media corporations to influence

337
00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:21.830
elections, to influence public discourse. Um,

338
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.170
they seem to have kind of snuck in,

339
00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.100
in a way that was really unexpected and people didn't see it coming right.

340
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.310
<v 0>Well, I mean, that's actually the pattern. People never see it coming.</v>

341
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.810
All of these chapters pretty much begin with some kind of a discovery

342
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.220
and some industry races in there and takes advantage of it. I mean,

343
00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.054
even slavery,

344
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:44.210
the discovery would have been the new world and this enormous commercial

345
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:46.580
opportunity, if you can just get the workers in there to,

346
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.480
to grow the tobacco and the cotton and the sugar. Um, but,

347
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.770
but so you'd have the discovery.

348
00:19:51.771 --> 00:19:54.560
You have an industry springing up to take advantage of it and,

349
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.880
and making a lot of money and, and changing social norms along the way,

350
00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.380
then problems are emerging. Obviously it was slavery, they were inherent,

351
00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.010
but problems will emerge other people outside the industry,

352
00:20:07.011 --> 00:20:10.670
discover those problems and pay attention to them, draw attention.

353
00:20:10.671 --> 00:20:13.190
And then eventually you get to a law.

354
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.880
Now that's kind of an artificial ending because you have to make sure that law

355
00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:19.760
gets enforced. But, but in almost all of these chapters,

356
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.950
you get to some form of government action where they say, no,

357
00:20:24.951 --> 00:20:28.280
you can't do that anymore. We, we stop this industry, we ban this product,

358
00:20:28.281 --> 00:20:31.580
or at least we're going to try to tweak your behavior. Um,

359
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:35.120
but that process, first of all, it takes a long,

360
00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:39.350
long time and enormous damage can be done in the meantime. Um,

361
00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.900
but that process doesn't work.

362
00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:46.460
You don't even get your you're somewhat happy ending if the industry has become

363
00:20:46.461 --> 00:20:48.040
so that,

364
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.880
that it determines whether it gets regulated or not.

365
00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.500
And it blocks those regulations.
