WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>Uh, but now they're talking about you possibly fighting TJ Dillashaw for the</v>

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:06.820
bantamweight title? Uh, yeah.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 1>Yeah. I mean his.</v>

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.160
<v 0>Talk, this talk, you know, you just hesitated and you know, they come in.</v>

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.590
<v 2>[Inaudible] it's not just talk. He wants it.</v>

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.390
<v 0>Yeah, no, I'm sure. Um, where's that at right now? Because, uh, there's a,</v>

7
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.230
there's going to be a card in January out here and it was just announced.

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.690
<v 1>Oh, well, when did, uh, what.</v>

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.890
<v 0>What date was that? It's the same night as the fade or Ryan Bader fight,</v>

10
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.300
which me off because I wanted to go see that fight. Yeah. January 26. Yeah.

11
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:40.260
That fight is going to be at the forum and the, uh, UFC fight,

12
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.520
I think is at the staple center or maybe Anaheim, Anaheim,

13
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.600
Anaheim, Anaheim, and the pond. Oh, okay. Both here.

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.950
Both here in California. Well, just 20 million in California.

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.130
Plenty of people go around. Yeah.

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.460
<v 1>Audience. Yeah. We've we've uh, I think there's been talks, but it's been,</v>

17
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.770
you know, you know, we, I don't think Ali,

18
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.730
my manager has really truly like actually sat down and talk with the UFC.

19
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.890
I think, I think everybody wants to do it though.

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.360
<v 0>Well, it's one of two things is going to happen there, right? It's either. Um,</v>

21
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.330
I mean, now the DJ has gone to one, um,

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.280
Demetrius Johnson just left the UFC and went over to one FC in a one FC

23
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:21.450
for people who have no idea.

24
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:24.510
What we're talking about is a gigantic organization in Asia.

25
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.480
They are literally the equivalent to the UFC in Asia.

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.810
And although many people in America are not aware of them.

27
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.500
They don't know who they are. They're a huge organization overseas,

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.830
absolutely gigantic. And they do a fantastic job.

29
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.390
They have real high level fighters. Uh, Ben Askren was their champion.

30
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.740
He was undefeated over there and he had, I think at least one fight,

31
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:49.530
maybe two fights left in his contract. I forget how many,

32
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.290
and they made a deal and the deal was,

33
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.770
they take mighty mouse and we get Ben Askren.

34
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.470
And so that's where it's at right now. I love the deal. I love it.

35
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.450
I love the idea of it. I mean, um, I feel like mighty mouse, you know,

36
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:04.410
he, um,

37
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.330
he loves the idea of starting new and a new organization and you

38
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:11.910
know, they're gonna, Hey, that.

39
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.770
<v 2>Nice. Yeah. All these fly with.</v>

40
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.620
<v 0>Exactly. And he also likes the mentality that that</v>

41
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:27.150
organization is operated with, which is, um, respect for the martial arts.

42
00:02:27.151 --> 00:02:31.050
They're not into this, you know what we saw with the Conor McGregor? Khabib,

43
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.780
Nurmagomedov fight all the trash talking and all the,

44
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.290
all the stuff that you're seeing that was becoming more and more prevalent in

45
00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:41.250
the UFC. You, uh, you don't see that at all at one FC.

46
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:43.560
And that's something that, uh, mighty mouse very happy.

47
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.960
<v 1>Yeah. I think first, I think congratulations to the Ben Askren. I think he's,</v>

48
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.223
um.

49
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.670
<v 0>Everybody's in trouble. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.930
It's a lot of are in trouble and can ask her to get the whole view. You're like,

51
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:56.040
why can't I get up?

52
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.920
<v 1>Yeah. But Nashville is one of those guys that he's very,</v>

53
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.600
he's a very confident,

54
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.230
and he's a very dangerous human being because he knows that he's going to be

55
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:10.150
very confident about. And, um, I've always told people, I says, Hey, do the,

56
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.570
maybe the best in the world design that UFC man. There's some do,

57
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.690
but I didn't even have Ben Askren that will take you down.

58
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.490
That will take people think could, Bebes a controls. Good up top.

59
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.170
You wait till you get a, you know,

60
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.130
four time NCA finalists to time and see a chap on top of you.

61
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.290
That was an eight Olympian, his teammate and an Olympian. I mean,

62
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.160
the dude is the dude is he's a bad match of for anybody, Joe, anybody.

63
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.250
<v 0>No. Ben asked her in it. I mean, there's a reason why he's undefeated.</v>

64
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.000
And he hasn't been hit in several fights. He was detailing women.

65
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.860
The last time he got hit, you know,

66
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.180
I had him on the podcast because I wanted to let people know about him. I mean,

67
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.290
I've been a big fan of bet.

68
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.260
Fan of Ben astrons from back when he was a belt or champion.

69
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.980
And if you watch his fights and belt or against chorus, cough, and, and Lima,

70
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.380
Lima's a beast man. And he just dominated them, just country,

71
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.850
Lima people up. Man. Lima is a dangerous, dangerous cat.

72
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.510
And Ben Askren just whoop, oh, you're on your back again. Look at that.

73
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.830
You can't get up and you take him punches, you know? And he's a,

74
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.690
it's just a different caliber of wrestling. And I've said it many, many times,

75
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:21.430
and I bet I'm sure you believe it as well.

76
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.160
It's the most important skill for MMA is wrestling.

77
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.650
It's it dictates where the fight takes place. If you want to stand up, you get,

78
00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:31.150
the guy can take you down chocolate Del style.

79
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.590
And if you want to go to the ground,

80
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.870
you're the one that gets to dictate where the fight takes place.

81
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:38.080
That's if you're the superior wrestler, I mean, it's the,

82
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.320
the best base for MMA. I really believe that.

83
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.290
<v 1>And especially a guy like Ben, cause I think Ben knows that his,</v>

84
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.370
his strikings not that good. So he just relies on this is,

85
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.540
this is what I know.

86
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.020
I do a better than anybody and I'm going to control this and you're going to

87
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:54.340
know how I'm going to do it. You know?

88
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:56.770
So that's what I told him to expand that screen.

89
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.990
<v 0>Dangerous. He's so dangerous. I mean,</v>

90
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:03.640
a real bad fight for him would be someone that can figure out how to keep it

91
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:07.180
standing like Jay hair on gave him a real tough fight in Bella tour.

92
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.690
Cause Jay Heron is good wrestler and kept the fight standing.

93
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.060
I forget what his take on that fight was. We talked about it on the podcast,

94
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:19.510
but I don't think he was too happy with his training for that fight.

95
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.980
But you know, someone like Tyron Woodley, who's also a very good wrestler.

96
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.490
Who's a very dangerous striker would be a tough matchup for them,

97
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:30.400
but they're really close friends and training partners.

98
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.000
<v 1>Yeah. Well this is another thing too on the flip side is like, uh,</v>

99
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.120
Tyron's been wrestling him since for years. I think.

100
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.800
So he knows what the Ben Askren experience is, you know? And that's scary. Yeah.

101
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.350
I mean, people would be lucky to, you know,

102
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.170
kind of take them down if you really want to give it no take downs. He wouldn't,

103
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.610
he just wouldn't let people take them.

104
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.670
<v 0>Yeah. Pettis was talking about it, you know, he's saying, listen,</v>

105
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.950
it was back when Pettis was a champ. He said,

106
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:56.320
if I was forced to fight Ben Askren, he goes,

107
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:58.280
it would be a terrible fight for me.

108
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.730
He's like that guy just take me down and beat the out of me.

109
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.510
<v 2>That's what he does. If Ben was to win a belt,</v>

110
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.370
the 2008 Olympic team would have five belts. Henry gets to DC has to,

111
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.540
and, and Ben Askren we'd have one that's five UFC belts. If,

112
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.780
if he came into the UFC and won the belt, his teammates.

113
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.890
<v 0>Well, they are going to open up eventually the 165 pound division,</v>

114
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.940
which is what Ben is shooting for. Ben would like that division. Um, you know,

115
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.920
and if he said that if he had 1 65 and Tyra and kept the welterweight title,

116
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.933
that'd be great for him.

117
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.690
I just don't see the UFC doing a five pound weight difference when all the other

118
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:40.430
weight differences are so huge. I feel like the smart move would be 10 pounds.

119
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.660
Every, every spot, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75,

120
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.280
like move 70 to 75. Like when the UFC had a light heavyweight division,

121
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:52.250
initially that the division was a 200 pound division.

122
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.880
When Tito Ortiz first won it, I believe it was 200 pound division.

123
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.080
And then they raise it up to 2 0 5 and I think just,

124
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.910
and they needed a 1 95, 2, I really believe. And it probably a 2 25, you know,

125
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:07.490
I think that would, that would round it all out,

126
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.560
which probably will all happen eventually.

127
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.760
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting to see how that, uh, how that unfolds.</v>

128
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:16.280
But as of now, it's man, Ashkin,

129
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.190
she's going to be fighting for the belt pretty soon.

130
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.540
<v 0>Well, he's calling out Darren till he wants to fight Darren. I love,</v>

131
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.860
I love that fight. That is, that is a classic striker versus grappler matchup,

132
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.760
especially after tiring, just smashed him. I mean,

133
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.200
tiring in the hype train for Darren till we learned a lot about Darren.

134
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.830
Darren is a sensational Stryker, very, very dangerous striker,

135
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.510
but keeps his hands low, keeps his chin up high. And you know,

136
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.460
Tyron has proven himself to be really dangerous, even against elite strikers.

137
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:51.920
You know, you look at the Wonderboy fights. I've said this time and time again,

138
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.980
you look at those two fights wonder boy is known as being one of the best

139
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.340
strikers to ever compete in the UFC. He's got a crate.

140
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.200
I think it was 57 and O as a Kickbox or something spectacular like that amazing

141
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:08.120
striking skills. But yet Tyron hurt him in both fights. Both fights.

142
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.960
Tyron was the one who landed big shots and had Wonderboy badly hurt.

143
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.810
And then you look at the same thing with Darren,

144
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:18.920
till Darren Till's known as being this unbelievable striker, tiring clips,

145
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:23.540
him drops him and then strangles him. So, you know.

146
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.980
<v 1>It, it, it, it all changes with MMA. These guys can be, these guys can be, uh,</v>

147
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.900
the best, even the best wrestlers.

148
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.480
Like sometimes it doesn't translate to the sport. Like it takes a,

149
00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:37.880
a special somebody to adapt to the sport. I mean, not just the Rustler. Yup.

150
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:42.830
And I think Tyra has, has adapted to his time to his right hand. Uh, you know,

151
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.680
man, if you're able to take out two strikers like that, you're the real deal.

152
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.570
<v 0>He's unquestionably the real deal. I'm fascinating to see, uh,</v>

153
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.420
whether or not neuroma Medoff and, um,

154
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.300
Ben Askren go at that. That to me,

155
00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:02.010
I had a fight that I really, what are you saying, Floyd, man,

156
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.060
thanks for stopping all that nonsense. I just,

157
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.860
this is what we were talking about is not going to happen.

158
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.590
He has the same agent, listen that ain't gonna happen,

159
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.080
but Khabib is much more of a grappler than he is or than he is a striker.

160
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.510
I mean, Conner is a striker that sort of made sense. If you want.

161
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.660
<v 1>Talk about levels. I think, uh Ben's I think Ben's par be the better,</v>

162
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.340
the better grappler.

163
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.880
<v 0>UNO. knows. That's what I want to say. No.</v>

164
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.860
<v 1>But there's there's levels like,</v>

165
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.380
even though like they don't give black belts in wrestling there's there's

166
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:35.520
there's levels to that.

167
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.470
And I think Ben Ashlynn was one of the greatest folk star riders of all time.

168
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.500
Like that's how dangerous he is. Yeah. He's putting the best,

169
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.650
the best kids in the world and pretzels and submissions.

170
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.190
They just wouldn't get out of his, he's like a bowl constricted.

171
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:55.020
<v 0>He's stunning in his ability to control guys like you. Like what the, man,</v>

172
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.830
like chorus, Goff. I mean, and Lima are two great examples.

173
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.680
Cause you look at those guys in Bella tour and they just smash people,

174
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.300
but Korskoff has one of the craziest spinning back kick knockouts I've ever seen

175
00:10:06.301 --> 00:10:10.050
in my life. He sent this dude flying through the air. Do you see that?

176
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.600
Like a couple of fights ago in the grand Prix,

177
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.750
you see that it's nasty.

178
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.410
He hits this dude a spinning back kick and literally like launches him into

179
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:22.710
space and then smashes him when he goes down to the ground. I mean,

180
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:24.660
you look at what Lima has been able to do to people.

181
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.020
When the Roy McDonald fight was a very close fight. Look at this, watch this,

182
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.640
we'll get this boom. He lost that dude.

183
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.700
Is that in Boise? I don't know where that was, but so chorus, cough,

184
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.370
you know, if you watched the chorus cough fight with,

185
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.210
with Ben Askren and it's a mauling it's it's,

186
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.830
it's just a guy just getting up. That's what that fight is.

187
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.110
Ben Askren just dominated him. Like absolutely dominated them.

188
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.840
See the dude tried to jump back and landed.

189
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.310
It landed right as he was in the air out Chihuahua.

190
00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.220
<v 1>Yeah. And knowing Ben and this and this got never got a punch off of Ben.</v>

191
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.120
<v 0>Total domination. Same as the Lima plight, Lima crushes people.</v>

192
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:16.020
Man lean was one of the scariest strikers. I mean, and he knocked out, uh,

193
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.630
cough. I mean Lima smashes people.

194
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.290
But when you see Lima against Ben Askren, I mean,

195
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:25.590
obviously it was a younger Lima. I mean, he's got more experience now,

196
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.860
but the difference was so stunning. What do you, what is this?

197
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.260
Saskatoon Lima. No, it's not. No, no. It was the two Chinese guys, bro.

198
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:38.160
This is not Askren and Lima. You got to trust me.

199
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.280
This is not asking Lima either.

200
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.860
I'm sure the videos, but I said it was Joe being a bully. You got to trust me.

201
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.780
Those dudes are not the same guy, Joe, you lose your.

202
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.000
<v 2>Patience. That it is.</v>

203
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.700
<v 0>There it is. Oh yeah, man.</v>

204
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:06.460
I mean just the way he manhandled them. Like his wrestling is just,

205
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:09.190
you see guys that are used to defending take downs,

206
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.840
then they find themselves on their back and you say, holy, man. I think he.

207
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.760
<v 2>Did get up kicked here. And his nose.</v>

208
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.590
<v 0>Got broken. Oh yeah. He got cracked. I mean he, Lima is a monster,</v>

209
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:25.120
man. He's a super dangerous striker and he's huge for the weight class.

210
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.170
You stand next to Lima. You like Jesus. How do you make one 70? He strict.

211
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.010
<v 2>And he doesn't end up in a jacuzzi at the hotel. I'm sorry.</v>

212
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.110
<v 0>Yeah, no, he's, he's struggling to make that weight. He's a big guy, but anyway,</v>

213
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:43.060
point being Ben Askren, uh, at one 70 super, super interesting flight.
