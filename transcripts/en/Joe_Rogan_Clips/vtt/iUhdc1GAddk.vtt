00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. This is a lot of it is this right?</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.300
So people are feeling a certain way and they're not,

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.970
they're not feeling like this girl that wrote all lives matter.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.530
Do you think that was her clandestine way of showing that she's all about white

5
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.920
pride? You know what I mean? Now she was thinking, Hey, everyone matters.

6
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.020
She's probably having some nice thoughts. Right. You know,

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.820
she's but then all of a sudden, no, this chick is evil right. For doing this.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.650
And I think there's a lot of that.

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.940
I think there's a lot of people that I think most people are pretty sane.

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.910
I think most people are pretty reasonable. I think, you know,

11
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.240
anybody looking at at the George Floyd case is like, yeah,

12
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.810
that's completely wrong. That's disgusting. It's horrible. Tane is to watch.

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.390
I haven't heard anyone say anything other than that.

14
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.790
So how are we just getting so completely divided on this whole

15
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:55.410
thing and start attacking people, start attacking each other just over, over.

16
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:57.830
Absolutely. That's a good point.

17
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.180
<v 1>Because this is literally a case where no one is saying,</v>

18
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.810
there's nothing wrong with that. Cop did no one, no one zero people,

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.680
zero people, but yet everybody's still at each other's throats.

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.760
<v 0>Zero people have, have stuck up for that guy in any way.</v>

21
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.540
<v 1>Even law enforcement, no law enforcement people saying, you got to understand,</v>

22
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.130
this is how you control a man.

23
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.690
You got to lean on his neck for about eight minutes, 40, 40, 45 seconds.

24
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:26.230
46 seconds. No one say. And.

25
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.100
<v 0>Unfortunately what? You know what, w you know what they're saying?</v>

26
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.170
They're saying defund, the police, they're saying no more choke holds.

27
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.140
Right. Which I think is crazy. It's crazy. Yeah.

28
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.910
If you want to get someone to be under control and you can't choke them,

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.200
you know what you have to do.

30
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:46.370
You have to hit them in the head with a Baton seven times,

31
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.490
and you got a risk given and brain damage permanently injuring them.

32
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.730
If people know what they're doing. I mean,

33
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.060
obviously if people know what they're doing, oh, we'll put a choke on,

34
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.820
but they'll wake up. They'll be cuffed. We're all good.

35
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.180
<v 1>Yeah. Obviously, but you know,</v>

36
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.210
it's the people that are doing it wrong is the problem.

37
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.650
The people that shouldn't be doing in the first place, it's untrained people.

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.280
But if you're, if you're a,

39
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.170
you're a cop and you're in a fight for your life and you can't use choke holds,

40
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.710
that's crazy insane. You're going to get shot and killed,

41
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.390
or somebody else is going to get shot and killed.

42
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:21.620
Someone's going to take your gun. Yep.

43
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.330
<v 0>And, and the, the idea of defund the police and I, I, I understand the premise.</v>

44
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.860
Okay. And this is once again,

45
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.540
where many people that say defund the police, they don't mean, Hey,

46
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.640
just get rid of police. Of course, there's a,

47
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.350
there's a fraction of people that are saying defund.

48
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:38.870
The police means we don't want any more police anymore.

49
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.720
There's a portion of people saying that there's some people that are saying,

50
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:46.250
well, if we defined the police, we can relocate some of that money.

51
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:48.590
And we can do, you know, better schools.

52
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.530
And we can put money into the infrastructure inside these neighborhoods.

53
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.180
But here's the problem. You know what? The police need more than anything else.

54
00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:00.250
They need money for training. And the way the police are set up,

55
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.590
they do the most ridiculously minuscule amount of

56
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:08.980
training for what their job is. So, as you know, I was in the seal teams.

57
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.530
We train for 18 months, 18 months,

58
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:18.300
we were trained to go on a six month deployment cops. They train,

59
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.280
they get like two hours or four hours of combatives

60
00:03:23.281 --> 00:03:24.114
training.

61
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.210
<v 2>A year, a year.</v>

62
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.290
<v 0>That that's, that's complete insanity in sound. It's complete. And sanity,</v>

63
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.810
the thing I've been saying is cops should train one fifth of the

64
00:03:39.811 --> 00:03:42.420
time. One fifth of the time, you should be training.

65
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.220
Whether it's two hours a day, four times a week,

66
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.530
or whether it's one day a week where you're going to go,

67
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:49.650
and you're going to go through scenarios, you're going to do combatives.

68
00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:51.360
You're going to work with simunition.

69
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.710
You're going to do deescalation drills because it's really hard. I mean,

70
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.530
being a cop is I think is the hardest job in the world. And by the way,

71
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:01.110
they're not gonna have to worry about defending the police because no,

72
00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:02.610
one's going to want to be a cop anymore.

73
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.060
Who is going to be fired up to be a cop right now, who's going to think,

74
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.190
you know what? When I grow up, I want to be hated by entire,

75
00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:13.110
you know, by a massive portion of the country.

76
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.130
I want to be viewed as someone that's, uh, that kills innocent people.

77
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.540
Th th th the recruiting in cop for, for police is going to go down so hard.

78
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.970
It's going to be ridiculous. It's going to be ridiculous.

79
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:24.990
And then who you getting there?

80
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.980
You're going to get people that are worse level people,

81
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.880
worse level humans are going to show up to be cops. So the training piece,

82
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.780
they should do very, very scenario driven training, right?

83
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.840
Where you come into a room and this isn't like super expensive stuff.

84
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.900
Either you come into a room, there's a person there.

85
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.850
They appear to be compliant. You ask you, you learn how to talk to them.

86
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.760
You very quickly learn that. Instead of yelling them out of the,

87
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.360
out of the gate, you say, Hey, man, what's going on? Hey, what's your name?

88
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.450
You know, what's going on? Or we got a call. Here is everything okay?

89
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.340
You just immediately deescalate. Then you learn what to do when they're not,

90
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.860
when they don't respond the way you want them to respond,

91
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:11.790
then you learn what to do when they start to do something drastic.

92
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.730
What's the best thing for you. And you play through these scenarios.

93
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.350
It's just like jujitsu in the fact that what makes you did so good,

94
00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:20.131
what makes you just, you're good.

95
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:23.010
As we can go hard against each other over and over again,

96
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.100
and not really get hurt, not really get killed. So you get really good at it.

97
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.500
That's what you need to do in training for police.

98
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:31.290
You need to go through these tough scenarios over and over again.

99
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.610
Cause you do get better at it. You do get better at it. You become,

100
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.710
you learn how to mentally detach and not get emotional and realize that there's

101
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:45.270
other things that are happening when you see them. The George Ford case,

102
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.910
uh, a couple of other cops too.

103
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.130
I think two of the other guys were complete rookies, right?

104
00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:52.140
They'd been on the force for a very short period of time.

105
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.880
No one in that group of four, obviously you got the killer himself.

106
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.660
He's, he's actually conducting the act,

107
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:02.870
but all the other guys are not paying attention. They're,

108
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.720
they're all emotional themselves. Hey, stay back. And,

109
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.570
and they're probably watching him saying, what's the why isn't that guy moving?

110
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.010
And they're just caught up in it.

111
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.820
Whereas if someone would have showed up on the scene or one of those guys had

112
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.370
been through some good training in their life, they would have said,

113
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.853
what's happening here.

114
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.370
Hold on my partner over there has been on this guy for two minutes.

115
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.040
He's not moving anymore. I'm going to walk over and say, Hey man,

116
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.810
let me take over. I got this D go over there to decompress. This takes training.

117
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.460
You have to train people. And I got,

118
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.610
I saw this over and over again in the seal teams training guys,

119
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.050
you get a young kid.

120
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:39.080
That's coming through training for the first time and they go into a room and

121
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:41.900
they're getting shot with simunition bullets or there's someone yelling and

122
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.160
screaming or that we'd put, we'd put Arabic women come and walking out of rooms.

123
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:48.170
We'd have people get blown up with wounds.

124
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.910
We would do this to them over and over again. So they realize, okay,

125
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.130
I can just got to relax. I got to take a step back.

126
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.180
I got to detach from this situation so I can process what's happening.

127
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.120
And I can make a good decision. Because as I said earlier,

128
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.790
no one is making a good decision. When they're panicked,

129
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:08.810
when they're freaked out, when they're scared as a jiu-jitsu guy,

130
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.250
when someone puts hands on you, you're not actually scared. Right? They're like,

131
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.100
oh, okay. I know what to do here. If you don't know jujitsu,

132
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.570
if you've never had someone grab you before,

133
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:22.460
or you haven't had someone grab you in 17 months or

134
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:25.790
14 months, no, one's laid hands on you. Cause you got a badge and a gun.

135
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:28.760
So people, when you tell them to do something 95% of the time they go, okay.

136
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.070
Yeah, I don't want to get in trouble. But then somebody grabs you.

137
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.820
You're instantly you're your emotions are spiked. Your adrenaline spiked.

138
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.890
And the only way to overcome that is through consistent training.

139
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.080
That that happens on a regular basis. You can't just train somebody one time.

140
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.110
It's like ring rust. You know, you can't just train somebody one time and oh,

141
00:07:48.111 --> 00:07:50.870
now I don't need a train anymore. No, you need to do continuous training.

142
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.120
So that fact right there, we,

143
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.780
if we want to re if we want to help the police through these situations,

144
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.070
we need to invest more money into them. We need to get them better training.

145
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.350
We need to pull them out of the field to train

146
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.720
and pull them out of the field to decompress because

147
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.130
you ever done a ride along. No like you, whether you, you doing a ride along,

148
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:18.860
whether you're going into any situation where you're thinking you could be

149
00:08:18.861 --> 00:08:21.200
killed. And even if it's just a remote chance,

150
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.790
but you're doing that all the time, all the time. And you're hearing,

151
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:28.580
you're seeing on the news you're oh, you're hear this. Oh, your buddy got shot.

152
00:08:28.581 --> 00:08:32.600
Your buddy got whatever this other guy got, you know, take his gun taken away.

153
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.500
Like that stuff happens. That stuff happens. People get killed. I mean,

154
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:37.334
there's been,

155
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.800
I think there's been 31 cops killed this year.

156
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:47.270
31 cops killed this year. And uh, a lot of those, well,

157
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.780
that's not including, you know, like a car accident or COVID,

158
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:54.950
there's been a bunch of either COVID but just people that have been engaged with

159
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.880
guys and they got killed. So you're a cop. When another cop gets killed,

160
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.700
you're thinking that could be you. So that's your mindset.

161
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.540
And that mindset builds in that mindset builds. And you're working 10 hour days,

162
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.260
and you're working 12 hour days, and there's no training and there's no breaks.

163
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.560
Where do you end up? Right? Where do you end up?

164
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.770
You end up being a little bit paranoid. You end up being a little bit angry.

165
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:19.380
What happens when you get into a fight with your wife? You know,

166
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.940
it's like all these things, you add them together. It's a freaking hard job.

167
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.320
And from a, from a, like an entire

168
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.120
systemic way of training and recruiting and,

169
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.770
and keeping police ready to do their job,

170
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.550
whatever that job entails because let's face it.

171
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:45.240
Most of the time that in job entails, well, I guess most of the time it entails,

172
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.570
Hey, I'm going to go have a bad,

173
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.170
I'm about to go have a bad relationship with another human being.

174
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.290
That's what's about to happen, right? Whether I'm pulling you over, whether I'm,

175
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:55.470
I've been called to your house because you were yelling and screaming and people

176
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:57.870
heard your wife screaming or whatever, that's, what's happening.

177
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.760
I'm showing up in a bad relationship.

178
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.670
You don't like me and I already don't like you. That's where we start.

179
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.610
That's where we start. So we've got to train people for that.

180
00:10:05.611 --> 00:10:08.970
We also got to train them for all the times that they go into help people save

181
00:10:08.971 --> 00:10:11.160
people that the first people on the scene at car accidents,

182
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.740
people are bleeding out. We got to train them for that.

183
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.460
And then they have to also be trained for, Hey, this is a bad guy.

184
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:20.370
That's going to, this is the guy that you just talked about at a gas station,

185
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.670
with a weapon that wants to kill a bunch of people.

186
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.910
You gotta be prepared for that whole spectrum as a police officer.

187
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.200
And yet we send them to a three month long police academy and then we send them

188
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:35.070
out in the street. And that's what they do day in, day out, day in, day out.

189
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.650
<v 1>It seems to me that they need to be vetted too much better than they are now.</v>

190
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.680
Just like the seals like you can't get through buds,

191
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.320
unless you are a superior human being.

192
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:52.300
You have to be able to tolerate a bunch of that most people are going to fall

193
00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:55.060
apart during. And this is, this seems to me,

194
00:10:55.061 --> 00:10:59.830
that is a great way to weed out people that just don't

195
00:10:59.831 --> 00:11:00.664
have it.

196
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.520
<v 0>Yeah. There's one thing that's interesting,</v>

197
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:07.590
just from a physical perspective,

198
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:12.690
most police departments don't even have a minimum physical requirement to

199
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.900
continue to be on the forest.

200
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.470
You have to be at a certain level to graduate from the academy,

201
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.370
but oftentimes there's no standard beyond that. Yeah.

202
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:22.820
<v 1>I've seen cops before the real, like, this is hilarious.</v>

203
00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:26.510
Like what is going to stop someone from closing the distance on you? Like you,

204
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.250
you ain't getting to that gun. Yep.

205
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:33.380
<v 0>But the mental aspect is stuff that you can get better at.</v>

206
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.880
Yes, you can get better at it, but you only get better at it through training.

207
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.540
Right. And you only get really comfortable through training a lot.

208
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.800
And yet we put these people in these horrible positions over and over and over

209
00:11:45.801 --> 00:11:49.260
again. And we get, we don't give them the proper training. And.

210
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:53.710
<v 1>Now there's this politicians that because of the current social climate,</v>

211
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.070
they're encouraged to want to defund the police.

212
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.570
That's a great way for them to get brownie points from their

213
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:04.480
constituents. The people want the police to funded,

214
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:08.980
which is why it's the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my life. It's,

215
00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:12.400
it's so crazy that this is actually gaining steam to the point where in

216
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:14.980
Minneapolis, because they're trying to quiet down the mob.

217
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.300
They've actually gone ahead and done it.

218
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.320
What the is Minneapolis going to look like in a year from now?

219
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:23.790
It's going to look like mad max. I mean, it's be crazy. That's.

220
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.640
<v 0>Going to be, it's going to be crazy. It's going to be, uh, you know,</v>

221
00:12:26.641 --> 00:12:29.820
criminals will go there to commit crimes. If there's no,

222
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.510
if there's no police there, are you crazy? By the way, it's Jocko energy.

223
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.840
<v 3>Drinkers, the that's very legit. Right?</v>

224
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.511
<v 1>Um, yeah.</v>

225
00:12:39.511 --> 00:12:43.320
I just don't understand where they think this game ends and I don't think

226
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:46.380
they've planned it out. They're not playing chess. The, the other.

227
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.550
<v 0>The other thing that you, you know,</v>

228
00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:51.060
you're talking about this brownie points for the politicians and,

229
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:56.160
and there's brownie points and there's people trying to

230
00:12:56.161 --> 00:12:59.010
create sides. It's my side versus your side.

231
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.440
And that's a completely political thing. Right?

232
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:06.300
And all that does is increase the divide between

233
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.200
the police and the civilians. And,

234
00:13:10.201 --> 00:13:15.000
and this reminds me a lot of, of a counterinsurgency, right?

235
00:13:15.001 --> 00:13:17.760
So counter-insurgency the insurgents are, you know,

236
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:20.610
bad guys inside of a country. The country's not bad.

237
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.770
There's some bad guys in the country.

238
00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.760
So what you have to do is you actually have to go out and build relationships

239
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.980
with the good people inside that country so that the good people

240
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:35.910
inside that country can help you get rid of the bad people.

241
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:40.260
What happens if you go out and this, so this is Ramadi Iraq.

242
00:13:40.261 --> 00:13:41.700
This was about my last deployment to Iraq.

243
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.630
There's a bunch of just totally normal, good people,

244
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:49.290
Iraqi people that are living in the city of Ramadi,

245
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:51.720
what do they want to do? You know, what they want to do?

246
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.800
They want to send their kids to school. They want to run their little market.

247
00:13:55.801 --> 00:13:58.470
They want to do whatever that, whatever is that they do.

248
00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:01.290
That's what they want to do. They have the same goal as a normal family.

249
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.320
They're just a normal bunch of people. And inside that group of people,

250
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:06.710
there's a bunch of bad people. And these are insurgents.

251
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:07.770
Some of them are foreign fighters.

252
00:14:07.771 --> 00:14:11.070
Some of them are foreign regime elements from Saddam, but they're bad.

253
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:16.110
And they want to create chaos and mayhem. So Americans, we go in there.

254
00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.440
If we go in they're super heavy handed.

255
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.310
And while I go to capture or kill one bad guy,

256
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.540
I kill or maim, a couple of those normal civilians,

257
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:32.220
what happens? Well, a couple of those normal civilians, family go, wait,

258
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.770
you guys, aren't good. You guys are bad.

259
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.800
You guys just killed my brother and he didn't do anything wrong.

260
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.660
And then we do it again. And then we do it again. And then we do it again.

261
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.550
And each time that we do this,

262
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.500
where we're creating more animosity from the local populace, who, by the way,

263
00:14:49.501 --> 00:14:51.560
like I said, they're just not good normal people.

264
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.080
So what we had to do is really focus on going out and

265
00:14:57.081 --> 00:15:01.790
building relationships with the local populace. How do we do that?

266
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:05.150
And one of the things I, this, this happened after I left,

267
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:08.180
but you remember the surge that took place and they sent a bunch more troops

268
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:09.014
over there.

269
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.930
Part of the reason that they sent that surge and part of the reason that that

270
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:14.870
was allowed to happen was because the battle of Ramadi,

271
00:15:14.871 --> 00:15:19.700
where I fought went very well. And since it went well, people said, well, maybe,

272
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.130
maybe we can pull this off. So they sent more troops.

273
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.420
And one of the directives that general portray us gave

274
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.160
is he said, there can be no more drive by counterinsurgency.

275
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.420
And what he meant by that was when you go to a neighborhood,

276
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.770
you can't just drive through the neighborhood in your home V in your Bulletproof

277
00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:43.430
Humvee with your windows up, drive through show of force, and then leave that,

278
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.010
that doesn't work. What you have to do is stop your vehicles.

279
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.640
You have to get out, you have to talk to the local population.

280
00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:49.850
You have to ask them what's going on.

281
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:51.380
You have to ask them if they need anything,

282
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.040
you have to build relationships with the local populace,

283
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.790
the good local populace that just wants those insurgents out of there.

284
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.820
And that's what I don't see happening.

285
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.770
And the more we increase this divide between the police and the civilians,

286
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:08.840
the worst that's going to get.

287
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.670
And so the police have to start doing a better job of outreach of, Hey,

288
00:16:13.671 --> 00:16:15.740
w you know, I asked you if you did a ride along,

289
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.670
they should be offering ride alongs all the time until the total local kids,

290
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:24.050
17 year old kids, 15 year old kids, Hey, come and see what my job is like,

291
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.130
come and help me out that 15 year old kid, he knows who the bad actors are.

292
00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:32.480
He knows who the good kids are. You know, bring that kid along on a ride along,

293
00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:35.630
let him see what it looks like from your angle. Get out, meet the parents,

294
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:36.800
meet the families.

295
00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.900
That's where we're failing to build relationships between the

296
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:42.950
police and the civilians.

297
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:47.030
And that causes that that causes these problems.

298
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.210
<v 1>I think you're a hundred percent correct,</v>

299
00:16:49.211 --> 00:16:52.510
but I don't hear anybody repeating what you're saying. That's,

300
00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:55.930
what's terrifying to me. I think everything you're saying is logical.

301
00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:59.470
It makes sense. It comes from experience. I don't hear anybody saying this.

302
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.240
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And well,</v>

303
00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.730
I think maybe it's because people just don't recognize what's happening.

304
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.140
Cause they're too in it. Right. They're too in it. They're,

305
00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:10.390
they're wrapped up in it. And, and, and that's another part, you know,

306
00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:13.780
I talked about recruiting, who you recruiting, recruit those kids,

307
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.640
recruit those kids,

308
00:17:15.641 --> 00:17:19.840
but you have to build a relationship with them before you can add before

309
00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:23.980
anyone's going to go into the police and look the, I think it's the,

310
00:17:23.981 --> 00:17:25.450
I think at the LA police department,

311
00:17:25.451 --> 00:17:29.620
if you look at the LA police department compared to the racial makeup of LA,

312
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.640
they they're pretty equivalent and they're pretty equivalent on purpose.

313
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.700
They do that for a reason. So you got to get that.

314
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.440
You got to continue to build that,

315
00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:42.640
those relationships so that we talk to one another, you know,

316
00:17:42.641 --> 00:17:47.170
we actually communicate with each other because anytime, you know,

317
00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:50.070
I'm allowed to sit over here in my area and you're sitting there in your area,

318
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:54.590
we're building animosity. We build that kind of animosity between each other.

319
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.310
And now the littlest thing, the littlest thing, I mean,

320
00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:02.990
there was a woman that was killed in Minneapolis, like two, three years ago.

321
00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:05.060
Do you remember this one? Yes. Female

322
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.300
instructor called the police. The police called police to report a disturbance.

323
00:18:11.301 --> 00:18:15.740
Police showed up and there's no video, no footage. She gets killed by the cops.

324
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:21.440
She gets killed by the cops. It's insane that th that these things happen.

325
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:26.090
But we also have to remember what, like I said,

326
00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:30.170
what is a police officer thinking about and what kind of training and we give

327
00:18:30.171 --> 00:18:33.230
them and what kind of psychological screening to your point,

328
00:18:33.231 --> 00:18:36.410
what kind of strike? And it's not just one time psychological screen screening,

329
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.810
because guess what? People get burnt out.

330
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.390
And it happens at different times to different people.

331
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.580
You take 35 guys in combat.

332
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.920
I've got some guys at the end of a six month deployment there.

333
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.170
You know what they're telling me, can I stay longer? I'm doing fine.

334
00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.450
You get one month into that deployment.

335
00:18:50.451 --> 00:18:52.240
And you've got other guys that are saying, Hey,

336
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.730
do you need anyone to head home early? Right? That happens.

337
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.630
So you think in a police force of a thousand people or whatever size your police

338
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.160
forces, you're going to have some people that are steady, mentally stable.

339
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.290
They can deal with it. They can,

340
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:09.620
they can get be an officer involved shooting today and tomorrow they can go back

341
00:19:09.621 --> 00:19:10.910
to their job and be perfectly fine.

342
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.770
There's other people they can never work again.

343
00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:14.120
After they're in an officer involved shooting,

344
00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.100
what kind of investment are we making into this psychological health

345
00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.310
of police and look, uh,

346
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:26.330
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm sitting here just putting it all on the police

347
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.050
because every three one is playing a role in this.

348
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:32.600
And one of the things that you need to get as well as

349
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.560
how to get arrested, right?

350
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.060
It should be a public service course on how you should get arrested.

351
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.630
This is what you should do. If the cops are pulling you over.

352
00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:47.870
If the cops ask you, if the cops approach you about something,

353
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.560
here's what you should think. One of the things you should think is, okay,

354
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.300
this cop may not be bad. This cop may be looking out for my welfare right now.

355
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:57.770
That's a great hopeful thought.

356
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.820
The other thing that you have to think is kind of worst case scenario.

357
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.350
This cop might be agitated.

358
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.560
This cop might be looking for somebody that fits my description. This cop,

359
00:20:06.561 --> 00:20:09.320
my buddy just been in a fight with his wife. He might've just lost a partner.

360
00:20:09.321 --> 00:20:13.160
There's a million bad things. Use that scenario in your head.

361
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.500
Use that scenario in your head to, to,

362
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.240
to contemplate how you're going to interact with a police officer, which is,

363
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.690
you know what they're looking at. They're looking at your hands. You know why?

364
00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.660
Because that's where the threat comes from. The threat comes from your hand.

365
00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:29.540
So when you're making quick movement with your hands, don't do that.

366
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.500
Listen to what they say, move, move slowly. When you move,

367
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.950
this should be public service. The police should be putting out, Hey,

368
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.920
if you interact with the police, we hate to have to say this.

369
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:42.920
But since our police sometimes are in bad situations,

370
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.880
here's some things we recommend and we highly suggest, and we beg,

371
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.760
we beg that you do this. We beg because what happens to these cops?

372
00:20:51.761 --> 00:20:54.160
When they kill somebody, what happens to them?

373
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.670
Their lives are totally destroyed. Well, that.

374
00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:00.180
<v 1>Was the thing about that guy in Minneapolis. He'd already killed people.</v>

375
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.260
He'd already been involved. And I think it's at least two shootings.

376
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.120
And he had more than a dozen complaints against him. Yeah,

377
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.900
not good. I mean, it's obvious by the end, by the end result,

378
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.150
that's the type of guy he was,

379
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:18.990
it's pretty obvious by the fact that he was able to do that to a man.

380
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.030
The guy's literally calling out to his dead mother. You know?

381
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:24.930
I mean the, the,

382
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:27.780
the type of man that can stay on someone's neck while they're doing that,

383
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:32.070
when all that guy did was have a counterfeit $20 bill, that's it?

384
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.580
<v 0>This is where, when you talk about psychological screening and that,</v>

385
00:21:37.581 --> 00:21:39.270
that's why I'm saying it has to be,

386
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.760
it has to be constant because people, people change.

387
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.890
Right. And red flags, I mean, w w like you said, hindsight's 20,

388
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:51.960
20, we're looking at this case now we're going, oh, who the hell?

389
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.010
Lets this guy continue to police. And by the way, interestingly enough,

390
00:21:56.011 --> 00:21:58.470
if you talk to internal affairs at police departments,

391
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.570
the vast majority of the complaints that they get about other about police are

392
00:22:03.571 --> 00:22:08.430
from police. So they comply, they report each other. That's little known fact.

393
00:22:08.431 --> 00:22:12.420
Most of the, most of the reports don't come from the civilians out there saying,

394
00:22:12.421 --> 00:22:15.150
Hey, this happened, or that happened most of the time. It's cops saying, Hey,

395
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.830
this guy was out of line here.

396
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.330
<v 1>Well, that's, that's a good sign. This, it just,</v>

397
00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.510
it doesn't look rosy when I'm looking at the future. I don't,

398
00:22:23.511 --> 00:22:26.850
I don't see a way during this climate.

399
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.010
Well, what.

400
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:33.960
<v 0>What scares me the most is I don't see a way if we don't talk to</v>

401
00:22:33.961 --> 00:22:38.490
each other, that that's where there's no solution. Because, you know,

402
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.570
look for every 10 viral video that you see of a,

403
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:46.440
of a cop hitting somebody with a Baton or a rider,

404
00:22:46.441 --> 00:22:49.470
throwing something through a window for every 10 of those viral videos.

405
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.570
There's another viral video that has, you know, the guy with the free hugs.

406
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.560
T-shirt on, that's out talking to the cops and saying, Hey, you know, I get it.

407
00:22:58.561 --> 00:23:00.840
And they're communicating with each other and talking,

408
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.860
and when you communicate with it, it's just like a hostage rescue,

409
00:23:04.861 --> 00:23:06.690
basic technique. You want to humanize,

410
00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.090
you want to humanize instead of de-humanized.

411
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.930
And right now we're just dehumanizing each other completely.

412
00:23:12.931 --> 00:23:17.160
And that's what scares me more than anything else is if we can't talk to each

413
00:23:17.161 --> 00:23:18.600
other, because look,

414
00:23:18.601 --> 00:23:23.580
you take the most hardened soldier in war. Some, you know,

415
00:23:23.581 --> 00:23:27.270
some bad-ass soldier, that's done four deployments, six deployments, whatever.

416
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.400
And you put them into a room with a kid and a mom on Iraqi kid and her mom or an

417
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:35.940
Afghan kid and mom, and you put them in that room and say, Hey,

418
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.310
sit here for 15 minutes and find out what they're about.

419
00:23:38.311 --> 00:23:41.930
Here's an interpreter that, that guy's going to come out of there going, yeah,

420
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.850
I get where they're coming from. And same thing, vice.

421
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.780
You take a hardened jihadist and you say, Hey,

422
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.240
talk to this guy over here about what he's trying to do inside your country.

423
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:51.970
But just, just,

424
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:55.490
just talk to him when you open up the communications and are you going to get

425
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:57.590
some extremists on both ends? Yes, you will.

426
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.820
So maybe I shouldn't have said the most hardened a soldier in the most hardened

427
00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:02.720
cause you know what?

428
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.520
The most hardened soldier becomes a killer becomes a killer that, that happens,

429
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.900
happens all the time. You know, I, I, I shouldn't say it happens all the time.

430
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.470
It happens from time to time. That's how you get the me lie massacre.

431
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.290
It happens that the whole, most hardened jihadist,

432
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.260
they're not going to change their mind. They're not going to come to any,

433
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.530
any rose colored view of America,

434
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:30.050
but barring those total extremes, you've got people,

435
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.580
you've got a few other human beings.

436
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:35.330
And if you can get them to talk to each other, they can find consensus.

437
00:24:35.331 --> 00:24:38.750
They can find common ground, but if they're not talking to each other,

438
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.630
then we don't move it, make any progress.

439
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.290
And what to your whole kind of point about what's happening right now,

440
00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.030
there's less and less communication between people open communication.

441
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:55.100
Because if you, if you talk to, uh, someone and they say, the cops did this,

442
00:24:55.101 --> 00:25:00.080
this and this, and you say, oh, okay, explain to me what happened.

443
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.940
Tell me what went down. And then you say, Hey,

444
00:25:01.941 --> 00:25:05.540
let me tell you what it's like for B, for a cop, being a cop. When he sees that,

445
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:07.040
when he sees something going on, you know,

446
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:11.840
how many domestic violence cases happen and the person shows

447
00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:15.740
up and they're, they're getting assaulted by both parties.

448
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.070
So maybe that's what you're this cop was thinking when he showed up and

449
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.540
saw your mom in this situation and did this to your dad, right?

450
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:30.410
Th like this is real conversations, but we don't, we don't have them.

451
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.810
And not only we don't have them, it seems like,

452
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:38.360
it seems like there's forces that are actively trying to prevent us from talking

453
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.070
to each other from sitting down at a table and saying, Hey man, what,

454
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:47.950
tell me what's going on. Yeah. Who wants,

455
00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.300
who wants the country to be divided?

456
00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:51.280
It's the people that you're talking about earlier that, that,

457
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:55.060
how do they score points? How do I score points with this group?

458
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.760
How do I score points with the other group? It's by making,

459
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.920
making everything as divisive as possible. It's, it's, it's horrible to watch,

460
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.150
man. It's sickening to watch.

461
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:09.280
<v 1>I was reading a whole series of tweets where there's a journalist that was</v>

462
00:26:09.281 --> 00:26:11.560
talking about how, um,

463
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.460
cops shooting black men is a real problem.

464
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:19.600
But another real problem that's not being discussed by this black lives matter

465
00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:21.700
group is black on black crime.

466
00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:26.050
And how do we stop all the murders that are taking place in Chicago? And this,

467
00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:30.220
this is something that should be discussed. And this guy was getting attacked.

468
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.870
And one of the, one of the, uh,

469
00:26:31.871 --> 00:26:35.050
another journalist is literally tweeting at him saying,

470
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.290
you have been told not to discuss this,

471
00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:44.040
but yet he ignores the, the, these that, that,

472
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:48.870
that he should not discuss is a very real issue that

473
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.320
as if somehow or another bringing up another issue,

474
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.900
that is also a problem diminishes the original issue of this guy getting killed

475
00:26:57.901 --> 00:27:02.100
by cops. Which of course it doesn't. Yeah, but this,

476
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:05.550
the idea is that there's problems. There's real problems.

477
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.710
It's not just the cops killing these people. There's there's look,

478
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.270
the cop killed this guy in Minneapolis. He didn't do anything in Seattle.

479
00:27:15.271 --> 00:27:17.730
How the did that happen in Seattle? Well,

480
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:20.900
it happened in Seattle because of this reactionary world where,

481
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.380
where one person does something somewhere, it gets through social media,

482
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.470
it gets through the mainstream media. It becomes this,

483
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.510
this huge inflammatory subject. And then the next thing you know,

484
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.820
windows are getting smashed. Things are getting lit on.

485
00:27:35.821 --> 00:27:39.180
Fire cars are getting turned over, blocks are getting taken.

486
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:40.620
And that's where we find ourselves.

487
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:49.040
<v 0>I think it was May 29th. There was a cop killed.</v>

488
00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.870
I want to say in Texas.

489
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:56.750
And he was killed when they rolled into a scene, they got, they got a call, Hey,

490
00:27:56.751 --> 00:27:59.960
suspicious person running through the neighborhood. They roll up on the scene.

491
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:05.450
They start a couple of a few cops are now searching for this guy and they

492
00:28:05.451 --> 00:28:08.870
see a building with an open door. They go, okay,

493
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.020
let's maybe he's in there. Let's go clear this building with an open door.

494
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.080
They go in this building with an open door there, shots fired.

495
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.510
One of the cops killed one of the other cops. So just, you know,

496
00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.100
friendly fire death

497
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.070
that right there, if you,

498
00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:32.330
if you take that and you just extrapolate that over how hard it is to be a

499
00:28:32.331 --> 00:28:33.164
police officer,

500
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:38.300
that you can be going into a building and you shoot a one of your friends

501
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.060
because you think they're bad.

502
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:47.120
That is a real problem. That's how hard this job is.

503
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.400
My point is, that's how hard this job is.

504
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.710
<v 2>But we.</v>

505
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.160
<v 0>Have to do a better job of explaining that we have to do a better job of</v>

506
00:28:55.161 --> 00:28:59.870
explaining how hard this job is. As far as the, uh, Hey,

507
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.790
don't talk about black on black violence. I was trying to,

508
00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:09.500
I was talking with my podcast borough, echo, Charles,

509
00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:14.030
who's a black guy, and we were talking about that. And I said, you know,

510
00:29:14.031 --> 00:29:18.710
I think it might have a little bit to do with this if you are,

511
00:29:18.711 --> 00:29:23.330
if you're watching UFC and there's two guys that are fighting and

512
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:27.110
the round ends, like just, just at the end of the round,

513
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.490
all of a sudden the referee comes in and like punches. One of the,

514
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.110
like just, just more Ty kicks a guy in the head and knocks him out.

515
00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:42.520
Everyone will be completely utterly outraged about this because of course

516
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.950
that guy wasn't in the game. What the what's that guy doing? Right.

517
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.800
So I think there's a little bit of that. That's that's the,

518
00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.760
the referee is supposed to not do that.

519
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.660
And when you see a cop, the thought is, Hey,

520
00:29:55.690 --> 00:30:00.370
that guy's like that guy's a viewed as a referee that guy's not

521
00:30:00.371 --> 00:30:04.690
supposed to be doing this. So I think that is kind of where some of that, that,

522
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.180
that outrage comes from, because this is a cop.

523
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.000
This isn't supposed to be happening here. This guy has no,

524
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.940
not supposed to be killing people. Right. And he did.

525
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:19.470
<v 1>This also that the cop is just a person who has this extraordinary</v>

526
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.790
power. Yes. Extraordinary responsibility to right.

527
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.510
What's terrifying to me is that w w when I'm looking at this idea to defund the

528
00:30:27.511 --> 00:30:30.510
police, and then, uh, I'm thinking like, what are these,

529
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.530
what are these neighborhoods look like? If you wind up doing that,

530
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:39.750
and then how do you get back out of that? W what do you do refund the police.

531
00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:43.590
Do you do ramp it up and do it better next time? I mean,

532
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:48.060
this is a long process. You're looking at a lot of trial and error here over,

533
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.170
you know, perhaps multiple years before they figure out what, what they up.

534
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:56.310
<v 0>Yeah. And I know there's some, there's some city,</v>

535
00:30:56.370 --> 00:31:00.150
I think it's in New Jersey that Camden, yes. That completely disband,

536
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.420
dismantled their police. But then they rebuilt a new police department. And,

537
00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.740
and I actually get that, like,

538
00:31:04.741 --> 00:31:09.420
you could get a department that was so completely and utterly corrupt that you

539
00:31:09.421 --> 00:31:10.860
said, you know what? We're getting rid of all of them.

540
00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.790
<v 1>Did you ever see cocaine, Cowboys? No great documentary.</v>

541
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.850
But one of the things it talks about is the corruption during the cocaine era of

542
00:31:17.851 --> 00:31:18.684
the eighties,

543
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:23.520
where the entire graduating police force the entire from the police academy,

544
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.830
the entire graduating year,

545
00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.550
everyone was either murdered or went to jail for corruption.

546
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:32.010
<v 2>Everyone, the.</v>

547
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.610
<v 1>Entire graduating class. That's how bad it was. Yeah.</v>

548
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:40.320
<v 0>So if you have that kind of view of that kind of problem, you might get,</v>

549
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:42.570
you might want to dismantle that police force, you know,

550
00:31:42.571 --> 00:31:45.120
what happens in the seal team? Sometimes, sometimes there's a platoon.

551
00:31:45.121 --> 00:31:48.300
That's so bad that they just, they just dismantled the whole platoon.

552
00:31:48.301 --> 00:31:50.760
How often does that? Very rarely, but it does happen.

553
00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.880
<v 4>Really. Yup. And what causes something like that usually they're, well.</v>

554
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.090
<v 0>The problem is bad leadership. It's always bad leadership.</v>

555
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.350
Cause you can take a bunch of knuckleheads and you give them a good leader and

556
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:05.250
they'll do, they'll do fine. So it's always comes down to the leadership.

557
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.120
So sometimes they'll replace a leader, but if the,

558
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.850
and usually when they replace a leader, you'll watch,

559
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.970
the platoon will turn around almost instantly because someone steps in and says,

560
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.270
all right, here's what we're doing. Here's how we're doing it. And they,

561
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:19.290
they make that change.

562
00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:23.850
But sometimes you have just like a bad platoon and they say,

563
00:32:23.851 --> 00:32:25.950
you know what? You guys are done. Okay.
