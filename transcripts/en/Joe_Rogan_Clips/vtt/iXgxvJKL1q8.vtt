00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.160
it seems like that's one of those things that once you get through,

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.560
and once you get through buds and once you get through hell week,

4
00:00:08.561 --> 00:00:11.920
and once you get through all the difficult physical tasks and you actually

5
00:00:11.921 --> 00:00:12.754
become a seal,

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.720
how many people maintain that sort of Goins Jocko

7
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.270
level of discipline and keep training constantly.

8
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.230
And how many people do the bare minimum?

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.670
<v 1>It's hard to say. I, um, there are people who slip.</v>

10
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.430
<v 0>What are the requirements once you, once you've gone through.</v>

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.110
<v 1>All that. There's very few. And I can only speak from when I was in,</v>

12
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.470
in 2013, the, I left the last day of June to 2013.

13
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.220
So if it has changed since then, um, I don't know anything about it. It,

14
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.860
but you know, the Navy, obviously it's, you're a Navy seal.

15
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.380
So you're governed by the United States Navy.

16
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.940
They make you do a P R T a physical readiness test, which is running pull ups,

17
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.340
pushups, sit ups, and a swim,

18
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.260
I think because we're seals and, um,

19
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.900
your wife could meet the standards.

20
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.210
My 11 year old daughter could probably meet that.

21
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:03.930
They're not crazy is what I'm saying. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. So the bar,

22
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.810
if you trip over the bar at that point, like you, you, you know,

23
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.370
your hamstrings don't work or it just, you suck. Um, and,

24
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.850
but there are varying levels.

25
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.850
There are people who are very like the individuals that you're talking about.

26
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.810
And then there are others that will let it slip and they slip a percentage point

27
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.760
over over time. Um, there's some, you know,

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.890
obese, disgustingly, overweight seals, not many, um,

29
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.570
and everything in between.

30
00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:36.210
So it'd be hard to be for me to give you like exact numbers on that.

31
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.410
I would say more guys trend towards the Jocko Goins realm,

32
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.720
um, because it's a self critiquing community. In most ways,

33
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.920
it's like working inside of a Parran tank and if there's a drop of blood and

34
00:01:47.921 --> 00:01:50.080
they're just like, yes, I'll eat you now.

35
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.400
We're very hard on each other for sure. Now.

36
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.720
<v 0>How much, how many of them are involved in martial arts?</v>

37
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.800
<v 1>Uh, again, hard to say,</v>

38
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:05.910
because I know it has drastically changed since I was in the amount of,

39
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.110
so I was telling before I sat down with Henry, uh, Gracie yesterday,

40
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.190
and we were just talking about a lot about his interaction with law enforcement

41
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:14.870
and how they got started. And it was with the Rodney king rides. Actually,

42
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:15.391
I didn't know that,

43
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.910
but that's when they started interfacing with law enforcement. Really? Yeah. Uh,

44
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:23.230
he had his, uh, dad, uh, um,

45
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.340
the generation before they started sitting on a panel, you know, talking about,

46
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.820
uh, I think essentially combatives with the, you know,

47
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:34.020
hand on hand type stuff with the LAPD, but that's where it started.

48
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.940
And it's grown since then when I went through, um,

49
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.780
I don't remember much discussion of martial arts at all.

50
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:45.610
There was prisoner handling or, you know,

51
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.570
detaining people and cuffing them determinating point would be to get their

52
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:52.130
hands behind their back and flex cuff them. We didn't use metal handcuffs.

53
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:54.610
We would use tie ties, you know, just cuz they're, you can put a lot,

54
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.320
you can slide 'em in your gear and just easily cinch on them. But, uh,

55
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.240
I think that it has drastically changed since I have been in it.

56
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.800
And I think a lot of that though is driven by individuals. I mean,

57
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.040
I'm sure you see it. Uh, I mean I'm,

58
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:13.280
I feel so stupid being late to the game to jujitsu. Um,

59
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.200
and I know that it is definitely,

60
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.240
I don't wanna say invading all of those communities,

61
00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:20.550
but might be a good term infecting. It's just, it's,

62
00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:22.870
there's a ground swell from guys who are learning on their own.

63
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.830
So it's increasing, but it was not prevalent when I was in,

64
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.030
unless you were an individual practitioner doing it on your own or had a buddy

65
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:30.864
that would do it with you.

66
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.110
<v 0>Really. That's interesting. I would've assumed that it would've been, uh,</v>

67
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.710
a core part of training,

68
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.060
like from the beginning to build character and to understand what happens if you

69
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.660
do lose your gun or if you do are in a situation where you don't have a weapon.

70
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.061
<v 1>Well,</v>

71
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:50.780
there's not a lot of situations in real life that you can point back to from my

72
00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:53.220
community where that has happened. And quite frankly,

73
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.820
ego gets into the way and you'll hear guys say things like, well,

74
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.970
why do I need to, uh, do bro, I don't need to go hands on with anybody.

75
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.210
This is all I got right here. Right? And that's purely just ego.

76
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.330
And what ends up happening is, is,

77
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.410
and I was talking with Heather about this yesterday and I have a much better

78
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:15.210
understanding of it. Now you can elicit actions from people.

79
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.970
If you don't know what you're doing,

80
00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:19.410
if you do have to go hands on and you're trying to detain somebody,

81
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.040
but you're asking about how much I weighed, right? How much gear I had. So I'm,

82
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.320
I usually would float somewhere between 2 0 5 to two 15 when I was in.

83
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.720
So add 80 to 90 pounds on top of that. And now I'm kneeling on your back, right?

84
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.360
And, but I don't understand weight distribution. I don't understand leverage.

85
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.960
I don't understand the way that the joints move that well.

86
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.320
And you're trying to comply.

87
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.750
I'm applying so much weight to you that it's forcing you towards a fight or

88
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:46.950
flight situation. And you can, you can

89
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.510
increase the deadly deadness of these situations

90
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.470
unintentionally and get yourself into a position where you might have to take

91
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.790
somebody's life, but they didn't deserve it.

92
00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:02.300
It was actually your fault because you drove them to that point because you were

93
00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:06.460
not Judi judiciously, applying the pressure that you needed to. Well.

94
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.420
<v 0>You see that with police,</v>

95
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.620
when you watch videos of cops trying to detain suspects,

96
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:12.220
and then they lose controlled situation.

97
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.980
And it's purely because they don't have an understanding of how to control a.

98
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.100
<v 1>Person. They run out of tools. I have a ton of empathy for law enforcement.</v>

99
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.890
If you're out on this streets and you have verbal commands,

100
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.930
then a taser and maybe a pepper sprays in there somewhere.

101
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:28.050
I don't even know if they still use that.

102
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:32.010
But then your next resource is a gun and you rapidly go through all those

103
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:32.410
options.

104
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.330
I understand how those situations occur and I'm not trying to justify them in

105
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:37.210
any way whatsoever.

106
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.490
But I understand what happens when you reach the limits of your tools.

107
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.040
And you're left with what you think is a threatening situation.

108
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.160
<v 0>Henry has some great videos of breaking down. What goes wrong with, uh, police,</v>

109
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.000
when they're trying to detain someone, I mean,

110
00:05:50.001 --> 00:05:53.320
it's oftentimes two and three on one and they wind up getting killed.

111
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:57.400
There's there's videos of guys having a suspect on the ground and a suspect

112
00:05:57.401 --> 00:05:59.320
who's not trained in martial arts. Yeah.

113
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.400
But unfortunately the cops aren't either and they're doing these stupid things

114
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.640
and hitting this person and trying to control 'em. And then the guy gets out,

115
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.440
gets to his car, pulls out a gun and kills them.

116
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.040
And I I've watched a video like that.

117
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.240
<v 1>Recently. So the guy who got me into jujitsu was a sheriff. And, uh,</v>

118
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.150
I actually just, the only reason I started is because I wanted him to shut up.

119
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.710
I had known him for like a year and he was like, and for me,

120
00:06:25.711 --> 00:06:28.030
it's like the harder you push that at me. I'm like, I'm not doing it ever.

121
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.790
I don't care. Oh, you like carrot cake. I'm never having a piece of carrot cake.

122
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.310
I will not have a piece. So we are at my house,

123
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.660
drunk downstair is at the bar. And he was like, you know,

124
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.900
we were standing there drinking.

125
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.060
He tried to put me like a standing head and arm trying. He's like,

126
00:06:42.061 --> 00:06:44.660
this is how I would choke. He was like, if you start right now,

127
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.300
you'll never tap me. He was a four strip white belt at the time.

128
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.380
Got his blue belt shortly after. Oh, that's hilarious.

129
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.420
<v 0>If you start right now, you'll never tap me. So.</v>

130
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.900
<v 1>He claims he didn't say this, oh, that's that funny. He said it.</v>

131
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:58.730
So I went to a class like the next day and, uh, and fell in love with it.

132
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.370
And he got pulled into and started jujitsu because a buddy of his got into

133
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.250
near life or death fight where I live up in Kalispell.

134
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.130
Sheriff's department doesn't have that many people on shift and a response time

135
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:13.970
of 20 to 30 minutes is possible. For sure.

136
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.730
So this guy goes out and he's in the fight for his life in like two feet of snow

137
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:17.850
in the wintertime. Oh Jesus.

138
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.800
And I think one of the first things that happened was his radio got ripped off.

139
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.560
That's a problem, right? If you need to call for backup. Yeah.

140
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:24.920
But fortunately they had procedures.

141
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:28.280
Like I guess if you check in and then for a certain period of time,

142
00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.920
like if you don't people start moving their car in the right direction,

143
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.280
start coming to you. If you don't check in, in a longer period of time,

144
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.920
you know, the lights and sirens come on. So other people came, he was okay.

145
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.390
And he just got his brown belt, not too long. He's a Savage. What.

146
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.350
<v 0>So what happened to.</v>

147
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.670
<v 1>Him? The, obviously I wasn't there, but, um, it was,</v>

148
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.030
he pulled somebody over for a particular reason. I don't know what it was.

149
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:52.750
And this is an interesting thing too,

150
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:56.590
that I've come to understand better developing friendships with law enforcement.

151
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.300
You know, they, they come up to a car and they're just,

152
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.820
they're doing a stop and it's another touch point for their day.

153
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.940
But somebody in a car might be in the back of their mind thinking, oh my God,

154
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.900
like I have a misdemeanor or a felony.

155
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.700
I might be going to prison for the rest of my life.

156
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.580
So two very different head spaces as they converge. Uh, in this instance,

157
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.220
I believe there's a pistol that was in between the driver's seat,

158
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.330
a little center console. The individual went for it.

159
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.650
It somehow they came out of the car and it just became a scuffle at that point.

160
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.450
And they fought until other cops arrived and basically dog piled on the person

161
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.890
and ended it. And it was over,

162
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.410
I believe they were at that for like 10 to 15 minutes. Geez.

163
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.010
And for people who don't understand how hard it is to go that hard for 10 or 15

164
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.320
minutes, I mean.

165
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.840
<v 0>Well, if they weren't in shape and that guy was that.</v>

166
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.720
<v 1>Would've been death. So he, um,</v>

167
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.000
found jujitsu, he just got his brown belt. He's awesome.

168
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.200
But he started my buddy who made that comment. And then I have started,

169
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.480
they'll do defensive tactic stuff.

170
00:08:58.481 --> 00:09:00.640
I've helped him out twice where I'll just go and I'll be a role player.

171
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:01.281
And I'll just, you know,

172
00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:04.040
lay there on the ground and put my hands underneath my chest and they have to

173
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.000
try to cuff me. And it's an eye opening experience. I mean,

174
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.280
I've been at this for 18 months. I'll be the first to tell you, I don't know.

175
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.200
I'm at the point now where I'm starting to realize how little I actually know

176
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.510
blue belt now. Correct. Yeah. Um, and it's it,

177
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:19.990
it's like a foreign language.

178
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.230
Like I can kind of see a little bit of the alphabet,

179
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.910
but don't even think for a second that I'm trying to put together words yet.

180
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.470
Let alone sentences. Yeah. And so I'll go. And you know, I did,

181
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:33.270
I was the role player for, uh, two of those and it was interesting.

182
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.900
I saw some of the same stuff where you can, I elicit responses for people.

183
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.420
Like I was, I was resisting, but not a crazy amount.

184
00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.580
And then the amount of pressure that they started to like apply to me,

185
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.420
grabbing fingers and pulling my fingers back. It, it almost to me,

186
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.740
like I wanted to ramp it up just like anybody else would. So there,

187
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.930
without that skill or without, at tool, in their tool belt,

188
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.890
you, you run outta options. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's,

189
00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:03.010
they mean they have a dangerous job, very at it, as it is.
