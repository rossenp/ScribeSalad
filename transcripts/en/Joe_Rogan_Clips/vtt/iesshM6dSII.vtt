00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I'm like,</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.510
there's this thing about Kevin Spacey and the, uh,

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.700
they made the text available of this guy who Kevin Spacey was touching his Dick,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.870
going back and forth. It was girlfriend, bro. They were laughing about it. Okay.

5
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.120
And they're trying to make it seem like this is evidence that they were,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.970
that he was scared and they, Kevin Spacey was sexually abusing them.

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
They were like, oh my God, he's gay. He's gay. He's touching my Dick. He's gay.

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:25.560
He's unzipping my pants. He's gay.

9
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.480
This guy was texting his girlfriend while Kevin.

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.200
<v 1>I mean his. He's so gay. He's so gay.</v>

11
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:34.290
I think he must be gay because I'm him in his mouth now, bro.

12
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.760
<v 0>They released all the text messages, but they didn't release some of them.</v>

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.500
And the mother said that she deleted a lot of them that are related to his frat

14
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.760
boy, like behavior.

15
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.180
What does that probably jokes about getting his Dick sucked by Kevin

16
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.240
[inaudible].

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.080
<v 1>That's hilarious.</v>

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.530
<v 0>Yeah. No, there's some deception going on. I think, um, you know, I'm not, uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.230
obviously I'm not a lawyer, but uh, I think,

20
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.650
I think they're trying to make some money. That's what I think it's horseshit.

21
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.430
I don't think this 18 year old kids worried about this 800 year old man touching

22
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.780
his deck or you flat line. That guy just popped in the face. When you're 18.

23
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.810
He'll punch the out of some 65 year old pervert.

24
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.760
<v 1>Come in. Unless.</v>

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.780
<v 0>He's a small fellow. I don't know if he has no idea about his physical stature,</v>

26
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.050
but if I was 18, some guy was kept grabbing my Dick. I put them asleep

27
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.540
at night.

28
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.580
<v 1>The first thing you do at 18, you're like, I'm going to fight you, dude.</v>

29
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.240
I'm like.

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.120
<v 0>You're not going to me, man. What is the messages?</v>

31
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.290
Start with the accuser texting. Like he's hanging around me in the bar.

32
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.100
He's got my number and asked me to come out with him. The girlfriend replies,

33
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.370
are you kidding? And then sends two other messages saying what?

34
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.540
And then he says, sounds like he's hitting on you.

35
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.370
The man types. I think he is. And then he's grabbing my leg and expletive.

36
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.300
Oh my God, you can't say

37
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.160
goes away to say I'm not gay adding.

38
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.900
But I think Spacey is the accuser continued texting saying that he was being

39
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:03.990
touched inappropriately like eight times later adding.

40
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.880
And then he invited me to his house.

41
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.570
Hey pro tip pro

42
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.700
[inaudible]. You're a Dick. You gotta tell him to stop looking at it

43
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.533
 once. Does he say the guys? What.

44
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.153
<v 1>The expletive.</v>

45
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.920
<v 0>Is? I saw.</v>

46
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.870
<v 1>This. I saw this have.</v>

47
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.920
<v 0>Fun too much. I was going.</v>

48
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.840
<v 1>To get to that. Jesus Christ. You reached down my.</v>

49
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.170
<v 0>Pants. What the is happening? Have fun, but not too much fun.</v>

50
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:32.610
If you know what I mean. Jesus Christ. He reached down my pants help. No,

51
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:37.500
this is Kevin ducking. Spacey, the canvas. She the auto text up.

52
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.490
He's gay.

53
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.110
<v 1>He's buying me another drink. Oh.</v>

54
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.220
<v 0>My God, babe.</v>

55
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.140
<v 1>He's gay. I think I want to hang.</v>

56
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.940
<v 0>This kid is gay. What the.</v>

57
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.620
<v 1>Are you talking about? Why are you.</v>

58
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.160
<v 0>Choosing your rights that he got autographs and a hell of a story?</v>

59
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.420
<v 1>Come on man. Opportunistic opportunity.</v>

60
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.350
<v 0>Maybe, maybe it's not gay. Maybe he's just a kid having a good time.</v>

61
00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.293
And it does.

62
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.350
<v 1>This is not a lot of people that get sexually assaulted, have time to text.</v>

63
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.440
Okay. I'm just saying he's, he's having fun playing.

64
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.770
<v 0>Enjoying the fact that it was Kevin Spacey doing to it, to him for sure.</v>

65
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.230
But it doesn't sound to me in any way. Like he was threatened.

66
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.440
It sounded like he let the guy touch him and maybe he should be accused of blue

67
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:15.430
bond. Mr. Spacey.

68
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.580
<v 1>Did Spacey get a nut? Does it say that at the end.</v>

69
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.090
<v 0>That you think that he was flirting with him a little bit, clean them on,</v>

70
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.860
keep Kevin Spacey around. He thinks.

71
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.693
<v 1>It's funny.</v>

72
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.300
<v 0>It's up. The whole story is up. If Kevin Spacey really did do it,</v>

73
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:32.470
then it's up that we're joking about it. And if Kevin Spacey didn't do it,

74
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:33.131
then it's up.

75
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:35.770
This guy is trying to set him up because he just wants to make money.

76
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.220
And he's ruined and Kevin Spacey's life. But Kevin Spacey's life was already in.

77
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.940
<v 1>Trauma. Trump spiral. There's a lot. It's a.</v>

78
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.830
<v 0>Lot of that grabbing. This was a nice lady to incident.</v>

79
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.740
<v 1>That was one, one of many. But it's a different.</v>

80
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.980
<v 0>Thing. If you look at that story after you read those texts, you go, oh,</v>

81
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:53.020
this is a different thing. This isn't like,

82
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.290
he's like trying to force some guy into a bathroom, bludging them and them up.

83
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.960
<v 1>They're partied there, partied out, having a good time. He said,</v>

84
00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:00.010
they're buying us another drink.

85
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.420
<v 0>Yeah, he is hanging around. Yes. He's not being forced against his will.</v>

86
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.860
There's no one that's holding him there.

87
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.810
<v 1>Yeah. If you got your good Dick grab once and he didn't want it,</v>

88
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.720
you don't let it happen. Seven more times text someone.

89
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.380
<v 0>And everyone's like, look, the victim is crying for help.</v>

90
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.290
<v 1>Yeah. And he texts someone. He just grabbed my Dick.</v>

91
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 0>It's a, it is, this is what men have to really truly understand.</v>

92
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.250
It is so much different when a guy like Kevin Spacey. And again,

93
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.910
I don't know what this guy looked like, but I'm gonna assume it was me at 18.

94
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.690
Right?

95
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.670
A normal cool dude who does no athletic stuff.

96
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.370
I'm strong at 18. And I, I'm not worried about him.

97
00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:41.350
Raping me is what my point is. Whereas a woman,

98
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.340
if a guy's doing that and the guys cornered you and fear, there's fear.

99
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.920
You literally worried this guy could rape you.

100
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:50.730
I hope he's not that guy that would rape me. The kind of guy. Right.

101
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.110
Because women don't know if you're the kind of guy that would rape them.

102
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.960
Because look at Ted Bundy, man. He was a handsome guy. Yeah.

103
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.590
And girls would just go with him because they thought, oh, he looks good.

104
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.610
He's fine. He, no he's killing them. Right. So girls legitimately,

105
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.170
you have to worry about that work guys.

106
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.470
Don't so even this guy with Kevin Spacey,

107
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.470
if he didn't like what Kevin Spacey was doing,

108
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.340
there's no indication that he said it to him. Right? So not in those tasks.

109
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:18.880
He's probably thinking we're going to party. I'm touching this. Guy's Dick.

110
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.210
He ain't saying. He's just texting his friends. Good. Tell your friends,

111
00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.580
want to your mouth. Tell your friends. I want to.

112
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.630
<v 1>Your friends to bring.</v>

113
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.290
<v 0>Those, those guys to bring the whole team. I'll all of them.</v>

114
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.870
He's probably thinking he's going to have a good time.

115
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.300
Cause this guy's not saying anything. Right? Meanwhile, this guy's texting.

116
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.740
This guy. Never does he say, Hey,

117
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:39.100
I told him to stop touching my deck and he won't leave me alone. No.

118
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.770
<v 1>It doesn't say that. He invited me to his house. We're ready to party.</v>

119
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.980
<v 0>I had to push him away from me. I was going to him up. But I guess he's drunk.</v>

120
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.240
I'm coming to you baby. Cause I love,

121
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.440
you know that LOL he's jerking me off his mouth.

122
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.710
<v 1>He says be careful, have fun. Which is like, you're out for the night.</v>

123
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.680
I guess she even told him that being gay is okay. She said,

124
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.800
are you trying to tell me something? Being.

125
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.510
<v 2>Gay is okay. That's when he responded. I'm not gay.</v>

126
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.500
<v 0>LOL that all the first part for other kids. Not scared now. Okay.</v>

127
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.980
This idea that he should get money because he was getting sexually assaulted.

128
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.210
No you're getting hit on. And you're all at a,

129
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.050
an establishment that serves drugs,

130
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.790
the drug that reduces inhibition better than any drug, alcohol, alcohol.

131
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.890
And you're accepting this drug from this guy.

132
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.630
Who's already touched your Dick seven times. Okay.

133
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.460
<v 1>Knowledging it by the way. Not this isn't like a,</v>

134
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.040
I didn't know what's happening is dictating. LOL.

135
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.280
His Dick is in my. Whoa. What, what was happening? Do you think.

136
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.370
<v 0>That Kevin space should be, should be able to Sue him back countersuit.</v>

137
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.260
<v 1>For that? For defamation of character? Just.</v>

138
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.093
<v 0>For being a.</v>

139
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.200
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.970
<v 0>Just Sue as being a. Like if there.</v>

141
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.080
<v 1>Was a court of honor.</v>

142
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.250
<v 0>And like, well you could, uh, judge Santino, um,</v>

143
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.290
please welcome this case. Uh,

144
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.830
Mr. Spacey touched his boy's Dick over and over again and continued to buy them

145
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:53.840
drinks. And the man never said no,

146
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.690
but he texted his girlfriend over and over again.

147
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.110
Then later on sued Mr. Spacey for sexual assault, your thoughts.

148
00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.720
<v 1>Young man. You're guilty of being a.</v>

149
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.770
You must serve time as a BA.

150
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.880
<v 0>Okay. Then the question is, is there a real issue with him being 18?</v>

151
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.890
Where like he's legal, maybe he's legal, but maybe he's like bewildered.

152
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.630
Like he doesn't know what to do.

153
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:22.010
He's maybe never been around a famous guy like Kevin Spacey before he doesn't

154
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:25.190
know how to tell a guy to get off of him and doesn't have experience being

155
00:07:25.191 --> 00:07:28.770
around gay guys. Or maybe he's never had a guy try to them, but he doesn't.

156
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.150
<v 1>Playing into the game. The text all say that he's playing. Oh, he's told you,</v>

157
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.100
me and him. We're going to, maybe we're going to hang out with him.

158
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.510
He's doing this game. He's playing.

159
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:39.500
<v 0>Okay. Immaterial. You're harassing the witnesses. They could work.</v>

160
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.120
<v 2>At the bar. Something was he doing at the bar?</v>

161
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:43.310
<v 0>Uh, sucking. It was a gay bar.</v>

162
00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.310
<v 2>Was eight. 18. Is that a bar? I think he worked there.</v>

163
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:47.150
<v 0>But.</v>

164
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.080
<v 1>He lied to them. And just.</v>

165
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.810
<v 0>Age 23, that was another part of the problem.</v>

166
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.570
The kid lied and told seven Stacy.

167
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.780
He was older than he was the plot thickens.

168
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.580
<v 1>So there's bars. You can go into under 21.</v>

169
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.620
<v 2>I know you can be in there. I'm just saying like, what was he doing?</v>

170
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:02.510
Just hanging out, having fun. Or was he working?

171
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.460
<v 1>He did say he's going to buy us drink. That's what.</v>

172
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.810
<v 2>I meant with bus boy. And like,</v>

173
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:09.710
he just kept walking by him and he kept grabbing his Dick every time I'm looking

174
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:10.450
at it. I don't see.

175
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.830
<v 0>Well, we don't have to keep talking about this,</v>

176
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.600
this poor fella that didn't want to run into Kevin Spacey. And,

177
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.160
but it was a financial opportunity and he had to capitalize, which can happen.

178
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:20.540
He's going to go to jail. No.

179
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:21.950
<v 1>No, no.</v>

180
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.120
<v 0>These guys gonna get any money.</v>

181
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.570
<v 1>Yeah. The kid hush money is, yeah, he'll get it.</v>

182
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:27.703
<v 0>How much does he want?</v>

183
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.190
<v 2>He got him drunk and then the sexually assaulted him at that bar.</v>

184
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.460
<v 0>He worked there. So he said he worked there as a bus boy. Okay.</v>

185
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.900
<v 1>Written people with wealth, always get off. Like what's her name?</v>

186
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.810
The USC Lori Loughlin. And that's up man.

187
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.900
<v 0>And they get off the last season of house of cards.</v>

188
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.520
Nobody gave a about it. There was.

189
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.070
<v 1>A big billboard billboards and everybody's like, oh, okay.</v>

190
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.150
<v 0>It was a four year consideration. What is her name again? Uh.</v>

191
00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.830
<v 1>Re uh, Robin, right? Yeah.</v>

192
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.600
<v 0>Robin Wright. She's amazing. She's amazing.</v>

193
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.400
<v 1>Actresses we've ever had.</v>

194
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.810
<v 0>Alive. She needed him to play off. He was ultimate evil. That Lee was,</v>

195
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.850
was turning her Mori. Well, they killed her boyfriend. Spoiler alert. Yeah.

196
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.920
Burrow row. And in the movie, by the way in the show, he's doing a lot of gang.

197
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.083
Like hand-in-hand.

198
00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.020
<v 1>The whole show he's doing. He does get, he gets his Cox library or some.</v>

199
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.030
<v 0>As a lot of crazy. It's a crazy, which is why I loved it. And it was amazing.</v>

200
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.680
And you needed a dirty, crazy. Like Kevin Spacey to pull that character off.

201
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:32.670
For sure. Look,

202
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:37.770
part of you knew he knew what it was to be a crazy.

203
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.870
That's like part of how he pulled that roll off. You bought it. Okay.

204
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:47.220
This is not Ron Howard pretending to be banging dudes and

205
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.800
getting his Dick sucked and all that stuff. Best roles.

206
00:09:49.801 --> 00:09:52.050
He's playing a crazy guy. Yeah. He's crazy. Yeah.

207
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.960
Always mean it's also why he's such an amazing artist,

208
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.580
but that doesn't give him a license to victimize all those people that know

209
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.090
when, after that we're sport, it's not, not justifying.

210
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.650
But what I'm saying is it's amazing how someone who is up like that can

211
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:12.240
produce, you know, like this kind of art where like,

212
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.780
as an, you, you like, he makes a show, right?

213
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:20.610
The show a big part of what it was because you bought this guy as this crazy

214
00:10:20.611 --> 00:10:21.990
tormented twist.

215
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.230
<v 1>Absolutely. I mean, it was, he was so he was so eloquent at it.</v>

216
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.830
He S he was unbelievable. It was just looked. It looked so natural.

217
00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:32.010
So real that's probably cause it was real right. A hundred percent. I mean,

218
00:10:32.011 --> 00:10:34.950
you know how many people in America you say for years, you're like Kevin,

219
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:38.340
Spacey's gay and the business has known about it and they go,

220
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.360
you're out of your head.

221
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.680
<v 0>I do a spit take this way.</v>

222
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.880
<v 1>You don't know he's gay, but how many people in America were like, no, he's not.</v>

223
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.020
<v 0>He's not, he's not.</v>

224
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.853
<v 1>Gay.</v>

225
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.920
<v 0>Nuts, California. Everybody thinks.</v>

226
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:53.670
<v 1>Everybody's good.</v>

227
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.950
But that's the problem is because there's a perception perception.

228
00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:57.840
And in the show, him playing this character,

229
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:01.950
who's also art imitating life balancing on this world of hiding a big secret.

230
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.840
It was just so close to home. It was crazy.

231
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:06.630
<v 0>So good when she fell in love with that artist,</v>

232
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.290
she's so good with them in New York and there's pictures of them together.

233
00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:14.290
And it's like, wow, this is crazy, crazy.

234
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.930
<v 1>Watch them naked in bed in some great grades and loft.</v>

235
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.640
<v 0>And so he needed them together after they kicked him out. Like what? The day.</v>

236
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:22.950
<v 1>Was too strong when they were together. It was amazing.</v>

237
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.320
<v 0>And the episode one that I watched, the old one that I watched,</v>

238
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.950
everybody looks super nervous. Everybody looked, it looked like super.

239
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.510
It just looked all. What do you mean? What do you mean?

240
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.200
Just looked off the show looked off was like, they knew Jesus Christ.

241
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:35.040
I just fired.

242
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.410
<v 1>Kevin Spacey. Never going to watch it. I even on camera. They're like,</v>

243
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.830
so we'll just continue this game. It was just.

244
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:41.250
<v 0>Weird.</v>
