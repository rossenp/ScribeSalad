00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.200
<v 2>Well, that's Dr. Carl Hart's argument as well. He, he prefers heroin.</v>

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.573
<v 1>Yes. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.240
<v 0>Just have you been paying attention to all the controversy of about his new book.</v>

5
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.320
<v 1>Course? Really interesting. It is really interesting. I mean, I,</v>

6
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.120
I read a cover to cover. It's great. I love that guy. Me too.

7
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.920
<v 0>He's so brave. Like the way he talks about things to,</v>

8
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.590
for the guy to be a professor, her at Columbia,

9
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.870
and to just be openly stating I, I enjoy heroin and it makes me feel good.

10
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:31.230
It makes me compassionate, you know? And, and he, he uses pure heroin.

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.270
He likes to sniff it.

12
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.190
<v 1>It's tremendously brave. And I, you know,</v>

13
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:39.510
I was working on my show for such a long time and you're doing it in isolation

14
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.780
and then it comes out and you're wondering what P people think of it.

15
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:42.381
So I was name,

16
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:46.220
searching myself and saw some Reddit thread of all these people kind of

17
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:48.660
insulting Carl Hart. And I just felt like,

18
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.540
I think the average person doesn't get it.

19
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.060
I don't think they understand exactly how brave Carl Hart is. Yeah,

20
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:58.180
because I have traveled around the world. I've interviewed countless academics.

21
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.050
I've been in academic circles throughout my life drug use of the sort that he

22
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.010
describes is extremely common. It's extremely common.

23
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.010
But being honest about it is incredibly rare and is commendable. And,

24
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.370
and if more people were like him,

25
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.610
I think a lot of these stigmas would be reduced. And I've even heard people say,

26
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.520
well, how dare he reduced the stigmas associated with these things?

27
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.920
That's cruel. If you reduce the stigmas, you're hurting people.

28
00:01:26.921 --> 00:01:30.800
They should be stigmatized. No, they should not be stigmatized.

29
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.880
Maybe they shouldn't be encouraged.

30
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.320
But if you find yourself in that sort of situation, you shouldn't be ashamed.

31
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.880
You should see it as if anything, a medical problem or a social problem.

32
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.390
Not something that you need to be hated for.

33
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.270
<v 0>Right. Cause we're not, we don't hate people for being alcoholics. Right.</v>

34
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.910
We praise them for their sobriety.

35
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.430
Like when they get through 90 day chip or whatever they get, you know,

36
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:56.110
people say they don't, they look at you like, you know, you're,

37
00:01:56.111 --> 00:01:59.310
you're some sort of a fool because you couldn't handle a alcohol. They go, oh,

38
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:03.980
he was an alcoholic. But he sobered himself up. Good for him. Oh yeah.

39
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.323
Yeah. You don't.

40
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500
The heroin use is just so stigmatized and I'm not a heroin user.

41
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.660
I haven't used heroin, but I did have a morphine drip. Once when I had a,

42
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.260
a surgery, it was awesome. Oh my God, I kept hammering that thing.

43
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.580
You press a button to give you a morphine drip. I had knee surgery and uh,

44
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:24.250
I was in the hospital and I was on this perpetual motion machine.

45
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.130
You ever seen one of those &lt;laugh&gt; cause I had an ACL reconstruction, Arteric,

46
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:32.810
cruciate ligament. It's a big injury. They take a piece of your patella,

47
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.090
tend in a piece of your shin bone and a piece of your knee.

48
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:40.490
And they open you up and screw 'em and drill in place pretty painful.

49
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.530
And so while you're lying in bed,

50
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.320
my knee is on this thing is going like bending and straightening my knee over

51
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:48.154
and over and over again.

52
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.880
And I'm lying in there and they give you a drip and anytime you want,

53
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.040
just press that button and you get a little drip of morphine and I'm going bang,

54
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.440
bang, bang. And it's just, ah,

55
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.080
I felt so good. I felt so good. I was like, oh, now I get it.

56
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.280
Now I know why people like this. And morphine's basically heroin. Right? Pretty.

57
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 1>Close. Extremely close. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I get it morphine. I.</v>

58
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.640
<v 0>Get it. Yeah. It's probably awesome. But for him, you know, he's,</v>

59
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.230
he's talking about pure heroin, small amounts. He understands it.

60
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.590
He's a chemist, you know? I mean, he, he really gets it. You know,

61
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.750
he's a research scientist. He understand, you know,

62
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.790
he was a complete straight lace guy.

63
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.950
Wasn't doing anything until he was in his thirties.

64
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.670
<v 1>Yeah. I know. Pretty crazy story. It is a crazy story.</v>

65
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.460
And what I really appreciate about what he does is I think that there's a lot of

66
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.700
perhaps justified insecurity in the world of drugs.

67
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.580
So people have been oppressed for such a long time that they need a

68
00:03:49.581 --> 00:03:53.060
justification of some kind I'm using psychedelics because it's religious,

69
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.940
I'm using psychedelics because it's medical,

70
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.460
it's a therapy I'm using psychedelics because it's traditional. It's part of my,

71
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.850
my religion. I'm using psychedelics for this reason or that reason.

72
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.610
It's very rare that people will just stand up and say,

73
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.690
I'm using these things because that's my freedom. Yeah.

74
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.890
I don't need to justify it.

75
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.410
I don't need to say that I have chronic back pain and it's treating it and I

76
00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:19.690
should be allowed to treat my pain. It doesn't matter. It's just my choice.

77
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.720
It as an adult, even if it's bad for me, it's my choice as an adult. Yeah.

78
00:04:23.721 --> 00:04:25.960
And it needs no justification like, like whiskey.

79
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.080
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, whiskey celebrated and it's on television.</v>

80
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:33.800
You can watch ads for whiskey during TV shows, it's like,

81
00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:36.720
celebrate it, have a glass of whiskey. And I like whiskey,

82
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.950
but you drink a lot of whiskey will you up. And we don't care. We,

83
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.550
we we're just accustomed to it. It's become a part of our culture.

84
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.230
So it's a traditional use. It's, it's sanctioned by the government.

85
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:51.950
You got a nice tax stamp on it. And so we're okay with it. But.

86
00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.070
<v 1>All these patterns I just described emerged during prohibition as well. Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.430
So you, so alcohol is prohibited. So you have medical whiskey.

88
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.980
You have, you got a prescription from the doctor for whiskey cuz it's, uh,

89
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:04.500
it's good for.

90
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.540
<v 0>Your nerves. It's one of our sponsors Buffalo trace.</v>

91
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:08.980
They've been around longer than the United States.

92
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:13.220
They've been around since 1773 and they made whiskey during prohibition.

93
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:16.980
They're still running. They're the longest running, uh, distillery in America.

94
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.620
And they made whiskey for medicinal purposes during

95
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.850
is kind.

96
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:27.330
<v 1>Of hilarious. And of course we see it with cannabis as well. And I get it.</v>

97
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.530
I understand why people are doing this because it remains very controversial.

98
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.330
And so you want some kind of justification,

99
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.930
but you should remember at the end of the day that no justification should be

100
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:39.610
required. Right. And if you get too lost in the justification,

101
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.970
you might forget why you're doing it in the first place.

102
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.840
Like an analogy that I've been thinking about for years.

103
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.120
Like this is kind of like a long analogy.

104
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.000
So it's gonna be like a one minute analogy, but like it would be,

105
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.920
it would be like if, um, in the sixties,

106
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.000
people started listening to music for the first time and they decided

107
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.080
that it was associated with the counter culture anti-war movement.

108
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.990
Um,

109
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.240
some people were listening to music too loud and causing irreversible damage to

110
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:13.280
their hearing. And so medical doctors said, okay, this is clearly a problem.

111
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.310
This person is deaf. As a result of listening to music, we've gotta regulate it.

112
00:06:17.311 --> 00:06:19.910
We've gotta prohibit it to protect people cuz it's a problem.

113
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.791
And then on top of that,

114
00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:23.670
there's an added advantage that because everyone is gonna continue listening to

115
00:06:23.671 --> 00:06:24.170
music,

116
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.510
we can selectively prosecute the people that we want to because it's a little

117
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.030
crime that everyone is committing.

118
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.750
And then that keeps going for years and people continue listening to music and

119
00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:36.710
playing music and they create their own biases where they say,

120
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.380
it's okay to listen to music.

121
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.420
It's just as long as you don't perform it or record it, it's all right.

122
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.780
As long as you're just a listener and then eventually some

123
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.740
scientists get together and they all say that they've never listened to music

124
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:52.260
before, because if they had, it would somehow bias their understanding.

125
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.500
And that would be terrible. So they've never listened to music before,

126
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:55.500
but they've looked at old,

127
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.090
pre-prohibition inform in on music and they've decided scientifically that it is

128
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.330
in fact very good and can be used as a medicine.

129
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.010
And then everyone embraces it as a medicine and says, oh,

130
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.850
I just listened to music today. It was so wonderful for my anxiety.

131
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.450
It was really fantastic. And that would be great. And that would be good.

132
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:13.450
And that would be a way to make music legal again.

133
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.730
But it also would entirely miss the point. Yeah.

134
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:20.120
That music doesn't have to be a medicine. And to be clear,

135
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.440
you could do these studies with music. Music is a medicine.

136
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:26.280
There is music therapy. I'm sure you could design a,

137
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.560
a study where music treats neurodegenerative diseases or music

138
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.040
treats depression. I guarantee it. And you could get positive results and you,

139
00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:39.230
you could then say that music is a medicine, but know what?

140
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.790
It doesn't need to be a medicine. Right. And I just want people to, as,

141
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:48.190
as much as I enjoy this new

142
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.350
medicalization and the decriminalization that's taking place,

143
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.550
I just hope people remember that it doesn't need to be any of those things.

144
00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.060
And this history of justification is T ultimately something that we are

145
00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:02.740
doing because we're afraid,

146
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.340
afraid that to acknowledge the fact that we should be free to do whatever we

147
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.020
want, regardless of whether or not it's good.

148
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.540
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. Well said, so, I mean, you could use that for anything, right?</v>

149
00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:16.620
You could say that about exercise. You could say that about running.

150
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:17.780
You like to run. Well,

151
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:20.370
there's been medical studies that show that running bad for your knees.

152
00:08:20.371 --> 00:08:21.690
You should stop running. Oh.

153
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.523
<v 1>Yeah, yeah.</v>

154
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.770
<v 0>Yeah. What the? &lt;laugh&gt; like, we should outlaw CrossFit.</v>

155
00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:29.250
You know how many people up their back tear, shoulders for CrossFit. Well,

156
00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:31.650
we need to stop CrossFit. Well, you could say that about anything.

157
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:36.330
And the problem is a lot of what you get when you have people telling people

158
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.930
to not do things is people that don't have any experience in those things,

159
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.160
telling people not to do them and whether they're drugs or whether they're

160
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.320
physical activity or whether they're,

161
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.360
there's a lot of different things that people do that you could racing cars,

162
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.480
you could deem them detrimental. And, uh,

163
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.440
I am a proponent of freedom and I don't think there's any, all knowing all,

164
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.680
seeing being that's wiser that understands the correct way for all human

165
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:06.960
beings to move forward in life and the, the correct decisions to make.

166
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.240
There's no father figure.

167
00:09:08.241 --> 00:09:12.320
There's no godlike human being out there that can guide us the correct way that

168
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.230
it's not there's pros and cons. Everything that you could abuse,

169
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.630
almost everything you do. You know, like if you, if you show that people,

170
00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.470
if they jog a little bit every day, it actually turns out to be good for you.

171
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.750
But ultra marathons, we have to outlaw because, uh, these people,

172
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.590
or they're getting Rado myosis, they're, they're,

173
00:09:30.591 --> 00:09:34.830
they're out diet Coke. They look terrible and they're dying. They're like, no,

174
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.100
like you gotta be able to do whatever you wanna do.

175
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:39.860
You're a human being and you are finite, no matter what,

176
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.340
it's not like if you die, the, uh,

177
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.740
entire world suffers some irreversible loss and,

178
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.420
and millions of people starve to death because you decided to run a hundred

179
00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:53.820
miles. That's no, it's you and your life do what you want.

180
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.930
Whether it's some Mo marijuana or running a hundred miles or

181
00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:03.370
doing whatever the you want. And unless we embrace that, we're,

182
00:10:03.371 --> 00:10:06.530
we're going to see more of this nanny,

183
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.490
state nonsense that we've been dealing with since prohibition in this country

184
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.090
and we're dealing with it right now.

185
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:17.000
There's a lot of things that will never kill you that are illegal cannabis

186
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:18.000
being one of the big ones,

187
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.280
