WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.120
<v 0>The excess max, this one right here. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:02.121 --> 00:00:06.440
But I'm so sour on apple because of what they did with the batteries.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.550
Yeah.

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.240
That was such a dirty thing to me because everybody had always suspected,

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.800
like my friend, Brian was always like, dude,

6
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.600
I'm telling you when the new phones come out,

7
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:18.320
your old phone starts moving slower. I'm like, dude, that's a conspiracy.

8
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.910
That's all horse. Yeah. Like your phone's just old bro.

9
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.510
But then when I found out that it was real mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I was like,

10
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.670
you &lt;laugh&gt; and to.

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.070
<v 1>It's the problem, pretend the problem was the way they didn't tell people.</v>

12
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.910
Like they could have just avoided like the whole, whatever, like PR we wanna,

13
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.870
whatever you wanna call it by just telling people, look, this is what we do.

14
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.340
When your phone's getting older, we need to preserve either the CPU or battery.

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.980
So we need to either voltage down the CPU or save your battery,

16
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.300
pick one and give us a choice.

17
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.140
They didn't tell us until people started suspecting things and they had to make

18
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:54.620
a statement and then it looked kind of dirty and like hidden it. I don't buy it.

19
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.380
<v 0>Yeah. I think it's a trick to try to get you to buy new.</v>

20
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.860
<v 1>Phones. I don't, there's no way they didn't think about that. Yeah, of course.</v>

21
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:00.300
There's.

22
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.650
<v 0>No chance about it. About that. Yeah. Why else would they do it that way? Why,</v>

23
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.730
why else wouldn't they just let the battery be slower or let the, the,

24
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.810
the CPU be slower.

25
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.690
<v 1>And the best part is they give you the choice now. But if you never look for it,</v>

26
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:13.730
you'll never find it.

27
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.050
And they definitely still default to saving your battery by under clocking a

28
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:20.210
chip. So your phone will still slow down.

29
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:22.440
If you don't know where to find that option in the sales, soon.

30
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.640
<v 0>As the new phones come out, basically.</v>

31
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.120
<v 1>Your &lt;laugh&gt;, it's just dirty. It seems pretty dirty. Yeah, because it's.</v>

32
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.280
<v 0>The thing that everybody always suspected, oh,</v>

33
00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:34.760
everybody always suspected there was some sort of, uh, engineered obsolescence.

34
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.800
And they're, they're doing this on purpose to get you to keep buying the newest,

35
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:41.240
latest and greatest. But I wanted to like go, nah,

36
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.470
apple on apple. Wouldn't do that. I.

37
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.070
<v 1>Mean, they're your friends, they paint this picture. That's really up upright.</v>

38
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.150
And like, we want you to have the best experience. Yeah. As long as possible.

39
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.430
Sure. Which involves not replacing your battery,

40
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.910
which means we'll just slow down your phone just a little bit. Yeah.

41
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
So that it's, it lasts longer and the battery can keep up. Makes sense on paper,

42
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.780
but on.

43
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.140
<v 0>Paper. Well, there's a lot of things about apple that I really like.</v>

44
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.300
I really love the, the OS. I really love it. I mean, it's,

45
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.740
it's just so much better than windows,

46
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.100
but their keyboard sucks so bad on their laptop. It's just, oh.

47
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.933
<v 1>The laptop. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.860
<v 0>Clicky. It just doesn't, it doesn't feel good. There''s got shallow travel.</v>

49
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.490
There's all, all these issues with, I switched to a Lenovo.

50
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.930
I went with a think PADD okay. Just for, for standup. I have to write a lot.

51
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.210
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I found out that I've way slower,

52
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.890
like maybe 10 words per minute slower. Huh? Like it's,

53
00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:37.850
it's a real issue because it's like,

54
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.210
you make a lot more mistakes with those little shallow clicky things. Yeah.

55
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.880
And with the Lenovo, you have a, a much, you have much more travel.

56
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.640
It's much easier to touch type. It just feels better for me.

57
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.680
But that bus me out. It's like, why can't they get that? Right. Like you,

58
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:56.920
you're making these things for creative people. Right? That's your whole thing.

59
00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:58.320
It's like think different, you know.

60
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.000
<v 1>That's another thing I kind of got like.</v>

61
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 0>It it's again like what apple tries to portray themself as versus what you're</v>

62
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.800
actually experiencing. If you never listen to apple and you get the new laptop,

63
00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:10.120
you're like, wow, this keyboard's worse. Yeah. This sucks.

64
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.200
Why is this keyboard so shallow and mushy. Yeah. Uh,

65
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.360
and then you're supposed to listen to apple and they're like, well,

66
00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.830
we made it quieter. We, it thinner. So the laptop's thinner now.

67
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.071
Uh, and they'll,

68
00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:24.390
they'll give you all these reasons why they did what they did and they're,

69
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:26.470
you're supposed to go. Oh, okay. Yeah. That actually makes sense.

70
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:31.230
Maybe this is better, but your experience often says the opposite.

71
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:35.510
So that's why people like to not listen to what apple says and just evaluate it

72
00:03:35.511 --> 00:03:38.150
without listening to that, which is particularly for writers,

73
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.020
for someone who writes, uh, and you write on a regular basis,

74
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.980
you want a comfortable keyboard and you know, I've,

75
00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:48.500
I've constantly searched for the best keyboard.

76
00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:50.620
And right now I think it's probably the think PADD,

77
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.100
but I've heard great things about the razor, the razor pro mm.

78
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.860
Which is the really large gaming one.

79
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.530
It has a mechanical keyboard for the first time ever on a laptop. Yeah.

80
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.010
And that's supposed to be really good. I have.

81
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.610
<v 1>Tried the blade and I've tried, what I'm using right now is the surface,</v>

82
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.410
the Microsoft surface laptop too. And that's got a pretty good keyboard. Yeah.

83
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.250
It's travels a lot. It's back lit.

84
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:16.010
And then the actual laptop part itself is not metal. It's got like,

85
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.570
alconara like you might see inside a car, like a soft touch on the laptop.

86
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.320
I I' in my backpack. Yeah. So, oh.

87
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.960
<v 0>Pull that out. Go grab that. Let I'll grab that. It's kind of Al Canara. Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:27.760
Like fakes, suede. Yeah. Like what you've seen in car. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

89
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.800
That'ss the craziest I've ever heard in my life. Al Canara yeah. Um,

90
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.680
the razor pull up, uh, that razor blade pro too. If you get a chance,

91
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.870
we'll look at the surface first, cuz he's gonna go that,

92
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.870
but the razor blade pro it's also,

93
00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.350
it's an enormous laptop and it has the, yeah, that's it right there.

94
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.310
The razor blade pro is so big and wide that it actually has the mouse

95
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.910
on the side, like a track pad. This is it. Huh? So that's.

96
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.630
<v 1>The surface laptop too. Oh.</v>

97
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.563
<v 0>Wow.</v>

98
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.700
<v 1>How weird? The keyboard's pretty good. It's.</v>

99
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.420
<v 0>Like a polished aalconar. Ooh, that feels good.</v>

100
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.180
<v 1>Yeah. It does the question though. Whenever you see that material is like,</v>

101
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:12.140
if I'm putting my palms on that all the time, how long will that last?

102
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.100
Will it start to like thin out and look kind of worn after a while?

103
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.500
Or will it stay looking like that? I hope it does.

104
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.610
And also the whole laptop's matte black, which is, I've think that looks dope,

105
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.130
but that's also usually a fingerprint magnet.

106
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:27.930
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when you carry around like a matte black thing,

107
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.210
you get like all this, this grease on it or whatever, carrying it.

108
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:33.210
So like that's a challenge for that laptop, but I love it.

109
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.410
<v 0>The other thing about the difference between the keyboard on this versus</v>

110
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.880
the keyboard on, uh, what I have is I have the, uh,

111
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.920
Lenovo carbon X one mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and what I really like about this is

112
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:52.000
that there's, they're not flat. They have like a little bit of a,

113
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.360
like a dip to them. So your fingers sort of sit in them a little bit. Yeah.

114
00:05:57.361 --> 00:05:58.600
There's like a little bit of a.

115
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.160
<v 1>Yeah. That's smart. I wish more so like you kind of it's easier. Oh yeah.</v>

116
00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:05.520
It's easier to touch type when you have yeah, exactly. Like the spot. Yeah.

117
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.200
<v 0>Why don't people figure that out?</v>

118
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.600
<v 1>I think all of it is just, you get used to it. Like there is a,</v>

119
00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:13.000
there's a Google tablet that came out recently with the $200 keyboard,

120
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:17.670
accessory that has circular keys and slightly

121
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.190
concave, but like typing on it was fine. And like they claim like, oh yeah.

122
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:23.030
Once you get used to it,

123
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.910
like the surface area of the key being circular makes it easier to type faster

124
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.390
after a while. Huh? I dunno if I buy that yet, but maybe if you.

125
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.350
<v 0>Were a secretary and you really.</v>

126
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.030
<v 1>You're really used to the circular, it looks like a typewriter.</v>

127
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.190
When' you just look at it. Hmm. Which.

128
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.220
<v 0>One is pull, pull.</v>

129
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.180
<v 1>That thing up. That would be the Google. Oh, what do they call it?</v>

130
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.900
Something tab. It came out like the same time.

131
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.900
The pixel three and their naming is weird with them, but it has a, yeah,

132
00:06:48.901 --> 00:06:53.180
basically a, a surface like, like $200 keyboard, magnet, accessory.

133
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.220
You can prop it up at any angle and it goes from a tablet to a laptop with this

134
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.810
or dock. Huh. And then it's, uh, it's kind of interesting,

135
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.050
but the circular keys, I found weird that.

136
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.810
<v 0>Aalcontara on the handrest feels amazing. Yeah. Makes that's really nice. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.490
I think I get used to that. I.

138
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.850
<v 1>I I've been using a MacBook pro for so long. Like I, the contrast is like, I,</v>

139
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.730
I was really used to like having metal and like metal feels premium and good.

140
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.440
So like it's not gonna wear down. Um, but I, I like this a lot actually. Well.

141
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.200
<v 0>What metal doesn't feel good though?</v>

142
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:26.600
Is on your hands when you're sitting on it for a long time.

143
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.000
If you're writing edges, the edge. Yeah. The.

144
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.560
<v 1>Edges. Yeah. They kind of got the edges right. Where like they wrap the,</v>

145
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.040
the material around to the sides. Yeah. And MacBook pro is literally sharp.

146
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.900
Yeah.

147
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.680
<v 0>It cuts you kind.</v>

148
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.200
<v 1>Of, if you put your hands on the edge for too long.</v>

149
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.350
<v 0>Lenovo is carbon fiber. Nice. So this whole thing is, uh, it's not cheap though.</v>

150
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.030
No, it's not cheap. Yeah. It's in comparison to, uh, a Mac laptop though.

151
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.630
It's it is. And there's way more options. That's the other thing with a Mac,

152
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.950
you get like a 13 inch, you get a 15 inch,

153
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.670
you get a touch bar or you get nothing. Yeah. What's the matter Jamie pixel.

154
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.740
<v 1>Slid. I just had it there. The picture changed.</v>

155
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.953
<v 0>Oh, these.</v>

156
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.460
<v 1>That's what it's called though. Pixel slate. There it is. Oh.</v>

157
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.460
<v 0>There it is. Favorite name. Okay. So those are the keys. Huh?</v>

158
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:12.100
Those are circular keys. And that sort of connects to the tablet. It's.

159
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.380
<v 1>A great accessory. Like the, the magnet on the back. Like,</v>

160
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:18.180
I don't know if you've seen a surface, the tablet with the little kickstand,

161
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.130
you kind of have like a couple apple notches where you can adjust it.

162
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.170
And I think the new version has infinite adjustment, but this is the same thing.

163
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:28.050
Like there's a magnet in the back of the surface or the, the pixel slate.

164
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.850
&lt;laugh&gt; that lets you adjust the tablet to any angle, watch videos, type,

165
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.610
whatever. Apple's.

166
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.450
<v 0>The only company that makes keyboards that I know that had it better in like</v>

167
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.360
2012 than they do in 2018. If you get a 2012 MacBook,

168
00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:44.720
you go, Ooh, this is kind of better. &lt;laugh&gt; there's more travel.

169
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.520
<v 1>Yeah. You might think it's like an upgrade if they went backwards. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

170
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.440
<v 0>That's I agree. Goofy. &lt;laugh&gt; what the kinda agree.</v>

171
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.600
I don't know how they did that. Yeah. They're so design oriented. I mean,

172
00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:58.000
everything looks stellar.

173
00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.480
<v 1>That's what it is. Apple has been, uh,</v>

174
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.920
not a victim of their own desire to make great design,

175
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:11.280
but they often very often make compromises sometimes to the detriment of

176
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.710
how good a product can be to make it look better-hmm classic example was the Mac

177
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.310
pro the little circular trash can looking Mac pro that came out yeah.

178
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:23.470
2012 or something like that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, they kept,

179
00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:27.110
they made all these promises. It's this sleek, modern workstation.

180
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:31.830
It's gonna have the Zion chips and big GPUs. And I loved it. Uh,

181
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:34.270
but it only had one fan for a six,

182
00:09:34.271 --> 00:09:39.260
7,000 workstation and they constantly overheated and would

183
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:41.900
throttle. And eventually it was a nightmare.

184
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.060
<v 0>For them. Wasn't that? Something that was going on with the latest laptops,</v>

185
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:47.660
with the latest MacBook pros. Oh yeah. Yeah. Same.

186
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.580
<v 1>Thing. Yeah. Same thing. They made the, the, I nine the core I nine,</v>

187
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:51.820
they put in this super thin laptop,

188
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.300
they made this laptop so thin and they kept the fan speed. So low,

189
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.370
gotta be quiet. Very question. So they,

190
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.850
they just throttled the CPU down,

191
00:10:00.851 --> 00:10:03.890
so it wouldn't get so hot that they had to kick up the fans that high. So.

192
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.090
<v 0>The actual performance,</v>

193
00:10:05.091 --> 00:10:08.890
even though the CPU was more powerful was not as good as the last model. Right.

194
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:09.730
That's which.

195
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.930
<v 1>Was to make it look good. Exactly stupid. So yeah,</v>

196
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:17.360
Apple's been a victim of their own like desire to make so beautiful times.

197
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.280
<v 0>And then they got by huawe cuz Huawei came along with the mate book</v>

198
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.880
and the mate book pro is really a better version of the MacBook come'm into.

199
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.720
<v 1>It. Yeah. They.</v>

200
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.120
<v 0>Nailed it. There's no, bezzless the way that webcam pops up from the, the,</v>

201
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.040
that found.

202
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.950
<v 1>Interesting. I don't know if, how it's angles. It's like up your, no, exactly.</v>

203
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.030
It's like on the table level of wherever you're sitting. Yeah.

204
00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:42.750
Kind of looking up at you. That's very odd. But yeah, there's,

205
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:45.230
there's a lot of great things about that, but I pull that thing up.

206
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:49.470
<v 0>Mate, book pro wallwe, but meanwhile, it's probably spying on you all day long.</v>

207
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.710
Yeah. The thing sending information to the Chinese government. Yeah.

208
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.310
<v 1>Wawe's reputation's not so hot.</v>

209
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.660
<v 0>Um, they just found some spy chip and there's cell phones.</v>

210
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.340
<v 1>Oh, you're talking about the, uh, well,</v>

211
00:11:00.341 --> 00:11:03.540
there's a couple things that just happened with, with chips in hardware.

212
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.740
There's another thing about, uh, Bloomberg report. Did you see that? Yes.

213
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.380
Of, uh, the chips that came from all these, this,

214
00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.460
this server company or this company that makes it chips that sells to all these

215
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:19.850
big companies like app and, and major major companies.

216
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.330
And now everyone's compromised and Apple's like, Nope, not true.

217
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.570
Definitely not true. Don't say that. Of course not us. Yeah. No,

218
00:11:26.571 --> 00:11:29.410
a hundred percent. Not us &lt;laugh&gt; but like, yeah. That's,

219
00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:30.690
that's a really weird story.

220
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.090
<v 0>Look at this mate book. Like the bezels,</v>

221
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.400
they're almost nonexistent that you challenge gorgeous website &lt;affirmative&gt; if

222
00:11:38.401 --> 00:11:39.040
you're, if you're.

223
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.360
<v 1>Or a gorgeous laptop brother, if you're waawe and you make that,</v>

224
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:46.160
now you have to convince people to switch from the MacBooks that they love to

225
00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:49.600
that. Yes. Just on looks alone. They could probably do it.

226
00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:51.440
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but then there's all the other features like,

227
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:56.360
well it doesn't run maculas S 10 do I have iMessage? Right? Do I have no,

228
00:11:56.540 --> 00:12:00.520
all these other things that I like about my Mac, this huge touch pad, right?

229
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.240
<v 0>Um, well it does have a huge touch pad.</v>

230
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.560
<v 1>Yes. But I I'd say to this day,</v>

231
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.040
still apple has the best laptop touch pads. The multi-touch stuff.

232
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.080
<v 0>The battery life's supposed to be excellent as well. Right? Yeah. How.</v>

233
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.070
<v 1>How that chart, that chart was perfect. Cuz that's like all these X's for yes.</v>

234
00:12:16.071 --> 00:12:18.070
We have great design. We have better ports.

235
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:21.230
You only have USBC on a little MacBook pro we have full size USB.

236
00:12:21.231 --> 00:12:22.064
We have all this stuff.

237
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.870
We'll give audio to the MacBook pro it's got bigger speakers, whatever,

238
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.430
but we have a better battery life. We have all this better, lower price,

239
00:12:28.431 --> 00:12:28.970
all this stuff.

240
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.740
And you still have to reconcile with what people love the out their MacBook

241
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.140
pros, which is Maccos 10. Well.

242
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:40.700
<v 0>There's that. But there's also, people love having an apple product that too.</v>

243
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.660
They do love that. Yeah. They love like if someone, if you could.

244
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.900
<v 1>Put an apple logo on a Huwe, I wonder how many they could sell it.</v>

245
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:47.700
Probably be a little better. Sell.

246
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.620
<v 0>The out of them. Yeah. Well, you know,</v>

247
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.380
some comic has a joke about texting a girl and the text message comes.

248
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.130
I can green you go. She's poor. &lt;laugh&gt;.

249
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.970
<v 1>Cause it's the true thought people have. Yes.</v>

250
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.450
<v 0>People want iMessage. Like if you're,</v>

251
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:05.370
if you're messaging someone and you find out it won't send an iMessage,

252
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:08.930
you'll only send a text message. Like, oh, it's weirdo. They have a flip phone,

253
00:13:08.931 --> 00:13:09.520
like some weird.

254
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.250
<v 1>Cave person. I've been on the other side of that. Like I carry an iPhone,</v>

255
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:15.200
but I don't. I text people on my Android phone. So I've never been on the, uh,

256
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.440
judging side. But I, I wonder about that every day. Like really?

257
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:22.560
What does it matter? Like I text you with a green bubble,

258
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.840
which apple decided first of all, to differentiate iMessage versus text message,

259
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.600
which is hilarious. Um, what, who cares? Like the, well.

260
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.720
<v 0>Does matter, the loop does look.</v>

261
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.270
<v 1>Better. It I'm sure they, it to, they I'm sure in a software update,</v>

262
00:13:36.271 --> 00:13:38.230
they tweaked that green to make it look extra harsh.

263
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:40.510
<v 0>Well, you know what it is is they figured out,</v>

264
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.710
they figured out with pool tables a long time ago, like pool tables,

265
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.150
the cloth generally is green. Right?

266
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:50.070
&lt;affirmative&gt; but when they started playing in professional tournaments,

267
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.990
they realized that blue cloth is actually easier on the eyes and you could do

268
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.460
differentiate, differentiate the edges better.

269
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.100
So a lot of like really high end professional matches are played on blue cloth.

270
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.100
Now that makes sense. It's like a light blue sky. Blue cloth.

271
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:09.980
<v 1>Yeah. I've seen. And that's I guess, because of the way your eyes work. Yeah.</v>

272
00:14:09.981 --> 00:14:12.220
Like something about primary colors and the cones.

273
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.500
And you're more contrast sensitive to blue, something like that. I don't know.

274
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.010
I, well.

275
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:16.811
<v 0>Something about the way,</v>

276
00:14:16.811 --> 00:14:21.770
the way white contrast with green is not quite as pleasing as white contrasting

277
00:14:21.771 --> 00:14:22.770
with blue where,

278
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.090
but it could be the apples with you with the green &lt;laugh&gt; they give you some

279
00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:28.290
vomit green, make.

280
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:32.210
<v 1>It some brown color next year. Yeah. What the color of the app is green.</v>

281
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.310
<v 0>What.</v>

282
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.130
<v 1>Why wouldn't they make it blue? I message the app.</v>

283
00:14:35.131 --> 00:14:37.400
That button you to open it is green. It's a green.

284
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.680
<v 0>Why not make it blue? That's really true. Yeah. What the?</v>

285
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.160
That's a very good point, Jamie. Hey &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Why did they do that's still?

286
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.640
Why would it be green? When you're sending blue messages, apple,

287
00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:53.000
he dorks Steve, Jobs's dead. You guys are.

288
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.560
You don't know what you're doing design. Um, but the, the mate book,

289
00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.360
other than that, it's supposed to have a better keyboard.

290
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.320
It's supposed to have a keyboard. That's probably similar to that surface book.

291
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.560
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's supposed to have better battery life. Beless yeah.

292
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:08.360
Bezoless touchscreen touchscreen.

293
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.200
<v 1>Higher resolution.</v>

294
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.510
<v 0>But you got to deal with windows 10, which is a little bit of a pain in the.</v>

295
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.790
I gotta admit it's like the updates are almost daily.

296
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.630
There's something going on with firmware or something going on with this or

297
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:21.670
that, or I've.

298
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:22.950
<v 1>Gotten used to it mostly though,</v>

299
00:15:22.951 --> 00:15:26.470
because most of what I do on my laptop is pretty web-based.

300
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.310
So I'm just living in Chrome or safari or whatever. Right.

301
00:15:29.311 --> 00:15:30.590
So it's not a big deal, but then yeah,

302
00:15:30.591 --> 00:15:34.380
once I have to go out and I'm gonna go in light room and do some photo work and

303
00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:37.980
then like suddenly I'm digging through files and I'm in windows and it's then

304
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.820
you start to yeah. Feel like you're different. Yeah.

305
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.660
<v 0>When you, first time you have to update a driver. You're like, what is it? 1996.</v>

306
00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.380
Yeah. The is going on here. Updating drivers.

307
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.340
<v 1>I try to avoid that. Oh.</v>

308
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:55.050
<v 0>It's just they're though. Like, it's way better than it was five years ago.</v>

309
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.690
Yeah. You know, five years ago you would look at windows. You'd be like,

310
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.410
this is like some archaic. Pixelated.

311
00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.730
<v 1>Came from Vista to windows seven to windows,</v>

312
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:08.690
10 Vista was kind of that nightmare. And then they kind of have worked upwards.

313
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.210
<v 0>Since I started with the windows 95,</v>

314
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.160
I used to make my own computers back in my hardcore video gaming days. Nice.

315
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.720
I used to go to fries, electronics and get motherboards and the box and fans.

316
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.600
And.

317
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.640
<v 1>I started that online.</v>

318
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.720
So I never went to a physical computer store to buy parts,

319
00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.200
but I would have to do the whole like cross,

320
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.480
cross referencing what's compatible with what online and then put together a,

321
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.110
a whole list and then just buy it. And then nine boxes show up and like,

322
00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:39.110
hopefully they all work. Yeah. But yeah, it was the same experience.

323
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.950
<v 0>Yeah. And SLI video cards and connecting them with that cable.</v>

324
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.190
<v 1>And all that stuff. You ever mess up in break one. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

325
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:50.550
up makes you, but fixing, it makes you feel like you did something. Well,

326
00:16:50.551 --> 00:16:50.830
there's.

327
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.940
<v 0>Something going on when you're like the jumpers for the motherboard and you're</v>

328
00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:58.580
moving stuff around and it's, it is, it was cool. Yeah.

329
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.540
And then once you actually got online with a computer, you made yourself,

330
00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:03.700
you're like, this is yeah. Something about this.

331
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.380
And I remember when you used to be able to do that with apple,

332
00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.460
you used to be able to buy clones.

333
00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:13.460
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, my, so I way back in the day, still in high school,</v>

334
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.690
I had a Dell XPS, like seven 30, I think it was called this huge desktop.

335
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:21.330
Where again, you could like take this CPU cooler out, put a new one in,

336
00:17:21.331 --> 00:17:24.890
it was modular fully. And then apple also made this huge desktop,

337
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.970
this power Mac mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or I don't know what it was called at the

338
00:17:27.971 --> 00:17:30.930
time, but it was again massive. You could take the graphics card out,

339
00:17:30.931 --> 00:17:33.810
put a new one in, you could take the Ram out, take the CPU.

340
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.960
But it was like this, this weird system where like,

341
00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:39.360
they were on like decks and you had to like trunk,

342
00:17:39.361 --> 00:17:43.280
like take this big metal slot out and then do the CPU there and then put it back

343
00:17:43.281 --> 00:17:47.200
in. Yeah. It was really satisfying to like change the hardware and like, yeah,

344
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:49.920
I did that. And then you put it up and it's like, that's exactly right now.

345
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:52.040
It's got eight gigs around. Yeah. There's some, especially.

346
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.440
<v 0>I don't know. I think it's a man thing too. Men like changing.</v>

347
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.120
<v 1>Carburetors, the mechanical fields. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

348
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:02.280
That's probably a lot to do with the two. Yeah. That's it? That thing. Yeah.

349
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.240
I remember that sucker one generation after that, cuz that whole,

350
00:18:05.241 --> 00:18:08.320
that it had like basically like elevator levels to it,

351
00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.350
like at the top level and on the bottom level and on the hard drives and the

352
00:18:11.351 --> 00:18:14.470
power supply and the top, like all that stuff. And you can mess with that.

353
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:15.790
If you go over someone's.

354
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.670
<v 0>House and they have that now you're like, what the is.</v>

355
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.230
<v 1>Wrong with you? But that's the thing about like that was the most accessible,</v>

356
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:25.030
modular desktop apple ever, ever made.

357
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.540
And now they're making this promise again, like, all right, we listened,

358
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.900
we know that little trash can,

359
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:34.300
Mac pro was not good thermally or design wise for anyone.

360
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.300
So we're gonna make a modular professional desktop Mac pro again,

361
00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.980
that's what they said. And it's gonna be next year sometime.

362
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.700
And I keep picturing that.

363
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.820
I picture them going back to the roots of like a real bonafide desktop.

364
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.730
Cause right now the most powerful I, or Mac you can get is the iMac pro.

365
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.810
And you can't even update the Ram in the iMac pro really?

366
00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:59.250
You can't update anything about iMac pro really? Yeah.

367
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:00.610
What you buy is what you get.

368
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:05.650
If you buy a $7,000 iMac pro you will have that spec forever.

369
00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.240
Apple doesn't want you opening anything in that thing. So when they say, yeah,

370
00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:15.160
we're gonna make a modular updateable real well designed apple

371
00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:18.720
desktop. I'm like, I really hope they're doing that. Like ex.
