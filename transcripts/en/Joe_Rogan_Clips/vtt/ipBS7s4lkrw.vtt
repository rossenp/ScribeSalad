00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I knew about you before this happened,</v>

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.280
but then I really kind of got on board with you when someone was trying to get

3
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.800
you fired from Boston university. And I remember Boston college, Boston college,

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:16.800
sorry. And I tweeted it and I was like, right. Like what, what is this?

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.800
This is craziness.

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.110
<v 1>So it's a woman named Amy Siskin who Don don't know,</v>

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.910
other than that incident.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 0>Where, and you had a disagreement about something it wasn't. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:30.270
And it wasn't toxic. It wasn't hostile. I didn't think what you said.

10
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.510
Didn't I didn't explain what you said and what she,

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.310
what she had said that you disagree with. So.

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.590
<v 1>We may be able to even find the tweet, but she tweeted something,</v>

13
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.510
the gist being, um,

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.780
&lt;affirmative&gt; that she would not be supporting any candidate in 20,

15
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.820
20 who's white or male. I think that that was the gist of it.

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.780
And I responded I'm going from memory here.

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.140
The gist was something like isn't that the definition of racism,

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.660
you're sort of preemptively excluding someone from consideration on the basis of

19
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:04.010
race. And in that case, gender, if, if it was white and male,

20
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:05.170
there it is right there. Uh,

21
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.250
there it is support will not support white male candidates in the D primary,

22
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.210
unless you slept through midterms. Women were our most successful candidate.

23
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:16.690
Biggest them vote getters in history, Obama oh eight, Hillary 16,

24
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.330
white male is not where our party is at.

25
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.280
And it is our least safe option in 2020 me. &lt;laugh&gt; right. So I said,

26
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.160
isn't there something not progressive about preemptively,

27
00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:29.520
dismissing a candidate based on their race and gender.

28
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.680
I feel like there's a word to describe that as a progressive,

29
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.880
I won't be jumping on board. Yeah. So.

30
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.040
<v 0>Yeah. Well you, you basically didn't even say it's racist, right? You,</v>

31
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.600
you said there's a word to describe that. Yeah.

32
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.440
And that's a very polite way of disagreeing with someone. I,

33
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.390
it was polite and she tried to get you fired.

34
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.150
<v 1>Yeah. She contacted as far as I know, so, okay. I don't,</v>

35
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.950
I'm going by what she said.

36
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.870
She said she contacted Boston college and told them not to allow me to teach

37
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:59.790
there. That's insane. And Boston college, since I'm just an adjunct,

38
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.310
I'm not on staff when I'm not teaching.

39
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.820
Like during the three months of the semester I'm employed there and the other

40
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:07.600
nine months, I'm not.

41
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.420
So I think Boston college said he's not currently employed here. And I, I,

42
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.180
I think that that's basically as far as it went,

43
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.300
but I did talk to some other faculty there who were aware of the thing that was

44
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:20.134
going on.

45
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.290
<v 0>That's a crazy thing to do. Hmm. Just,</v>

46
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.970
I think so it's a nasty mean thing to do too. Like what,

47
00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:30.410
what someone can't disagree with you. And it's a very good point.

48
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.170
I think she probably got upset because you made a very good point and tweets

49
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:36.730
started coming her way. And a lot of people,

50
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.970
they read those comments and people get toxic in those comments. Yeah. Random,

51
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:45.000
strange people that you don't know. And then you're forced to, you know,

52
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.680
look at their opinions and their criticisms and their insults. That.

53
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.720
<v 1>Incident started me down the path of drastically limiting my social media</v>

54
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.120
use. Good for you. &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah. Uh, I mean that, that was the beginning.

55
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.400
And then it became, I mean, you know, this way more than I do,

56
00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:05.800
because I think on all platforms you have roughly 10 times the following that I

57
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:10.720
do, no matter what you do post or whatever, if you look at what the feedback is,

58
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.280
it's extraordinarily toxic and horrible negative stuff that is only a

59
00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:18.120
distraction to what I'm trying to do. And.

60
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.230
<v 0>Most it probably isn't. But I, I had an Naval on yesterday.</v>

61
00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:23.030
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Naval around camp. Yeah. And, uh,

62
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.270
one of the things that he brought up that's so, so huge.

63
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.990
It's so true is that you can have 10 positive things,

64
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.310
but that one negative will outweigh the 10 positives in your mind. You mean in.

65
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.510
<v 1>Your mind? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

66
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.500
<v 0>Especially if you're a person who's self critical or self, uh, objective,</v>

67
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:42.700
you're analyzing your behavior. Was that good? Was that bad? Right?

68
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.140
And then you read that one bad comment. Are they right? Yeah.

69
00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.820
You don't read all the people that say you're great. Oh, brilliant. Loved it.

70
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.700
Yeah. you. Loser. Oh.

71
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.540
<v 1>Yeah. Loser. Absolutely. I mean this,</v>

72
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:53.220
when I announced I was gonna be doing your show.

73
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.820
If you look at what the comments were almost all, this is awesome. Great.

74
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.130
Left. W talking to Joe Rogan, go get 'em David.

75
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.850
This is such a great opportunity. Can't wait to watch you face plant. Oh Jesus.

76
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.250
And that's the one where I'm like, man, are they right?

77
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:10.730
Like &lt;laugh&gt; am I gonna face?

78
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.563
<v 0>Am I in a faceplant.</v>

79
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.450
<v 1>So I don't know. I'm just trying to limit the amount that I'm on. Social media.</v>

80
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:17.210
Don't one thing I am doing though, because I mean,

81
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.040
my show is in part as successful as it is cause of social media. So it, I,

82
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.960
I can't ignore that. Right, right. You don't have to engage.

83
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.240
I don't have to engage. And I also can just say,

84
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.760
I will check our networks in the morning. Then I'll spend the whole day,

85
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:33.400
I'll do my show. I'll do what I need to do.

86
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.520
And then before I sign off for the evening, I'll check it.

87
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.800
And that's it idea because.

88
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.960
<v 0>What if you read the worst right before you eat dinner or go to bed? Well, no,</v>

89
00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:40.910
it'll be like 5:00 PM.

90
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.850
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

91
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.470
<v 0>So you have five hours to have five hours.</v>

92
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.830
<v 1>To cool off. Yeah. Yeah. And, and it's way better. And weekends I'm almost,</v>

93
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.270
I mean, people are like, David, you're still tweeting on the weekends.

94
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.750
A lot of those are like prescheduled tweets where I'll just sit and schedule

95
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:56.310
some stuff and I am trying to stay off it. And it's been really great. I mean,

96
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:57.050
it's been a fantastic.

97
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.790
<v 0>We looked at our phones yesterday. Uh, we did a sober October podcast with, uh,</v>

98
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.380
my four friends. Yep. We looked at our phones to look at phone usage and I,

99
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.500
I use my phone four hours a day on my phone, four hours a day. I'm like average.

100
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.300
That's a lot. What.

101
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.220
<v 1>App did you use to measure it? It's something.</v>

102
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.660
<v 0>On your iPhone. Oh, okay. Yeah. You have a, a Android.</v>

103
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.220
I'm sure they have a similar thing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Four hours of screen time.

104
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.820
I'm like, Ooh, that's not good. They're adding it.

105
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.930
<v 2>To the, a computer too. So it's gonna combine,</v>

106
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.010
you'll know how much you're looking at all screens.

107
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.850
<v 0>Soon. Yeah. But what if you're writing? Well, gonna count that count. Yeah,</v>

108
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.570
sure. But work staring at the screen. That's how I work. Hey, that's.

109
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.370
<v 2>What argument you guys are making for the phone yesterday.</v>

110
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:35.970
<v 0>That's Berts argument, but yeah. Well Bert's,</v>

111
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.690
argument's not good cause he doesn't even write. That's ridiculous.

112
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.520
<v 1>One thing I did that actually is useful is I used to have my social apps on the</v>

113
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:47.280
home screen and Cal Newport and some others have said, you got,

114
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:50.320
you gotta get rid of those. He actually advocates getting rid of the,

115
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:54.600
the apps all together so that you have to go on a computer and choose to go to

116
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.360
facebook.com or Twitter. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I, I haven't gotten there yet,

117
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.480
but even just removing them from the home screen makes me significantly less

118
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:05.720
likely to even pull them up. It's it's two clicks. Yeah.

119
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.280
To swipe up and scroll over to the app. Right.

120
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.840
But even just getting 'em off the home screen keeps me off of them

121
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:12.120
significantly. That's.

122
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.280
<v 0>Smart. That makes sense. Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.830
I need a certain amount of access to those things with my business. Right.

124
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:23.670
So scheduling shows and things along those lines, but yeah.

125
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.630
It's not good for you. I mean, I think one.

126
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.550
<v 1>Of the biggest realizations is that people don't really miss</v>

127
00:06:30.551 --> 00:06:32.910
you that much. They don't hear from you for a couple days. Yeah.

128
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.510
Like that's one of the things where the idea of needing constant

129
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.020
comes from sort of like a slightly narcissistic point of view where like,

130
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.220
people are going to notice if I don't tweet for,

131
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.780
from Thursday night until Monday morning or do anything like that. Right, right,

132
00:06:46.781 --> 00:06:48.580
right. Right. And they, they really don't. They don't know.

133
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.140
<v 0>They don't don't there there's a lot of other people to pay attention. Yes.</v>

134
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:53.940
There are, there are a few people that tweet on you that,

135
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.100
that are kind of crazy and that want to hear from you all day long. Yeah.

136
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.970
But they'll get used to it. They'll get used to you. They will vanishing.

137
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.130
<v 1>And I don't know. I mean, Cal Newport has, have you had him on no, I haven't.</v>

138
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.450
He wrote deep work.

139
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:10.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then more recently he wrote digital minimalism and he

140
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:13.410
goes into detail about just the effect of, uh.

141
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.090
<v 0>He's gonna write it down my phone, but it feels SAC &lt;laugh&gt; to put that as a,</v>

142
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.410
take.

143
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.200
<v 1>It out right now. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,</v>

144
00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:22.320
he goes into detail about this stuff and just about, you know, the,

145
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.000
we need more uninterrupted periods of concentration for what, what.

146
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.520
<v 0>Is, uh, the book called again? Deep work.</v>

147
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.600
<v 1>Deep work, and then digital minimalism. And they're both.</v>

148
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.840
I interviewed him recently. Really just solid, very solid stuff. Awesome.

149
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.550
<v 0>Yeah. Um, what were we just about to get into? Oh, so we were into this,</v>

150
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.310
this woman, Amy Siskin.

151
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.270
Did you reach out to her when she did that and privately? Yeah, no, no.

152
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.350
Did you reach out publicly? Uh,

153
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.830
well you did publicly declare that she tried to get you fired, right? Yes I did.

154
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:53.843
Did she respond?

155
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.830
<v 1>I don't know. Cause she blocked me &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

156
00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.660
<v 0>Oh God it. Yeah. She blocked you over that. &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.</v>

157
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.020
Jesus. That is so sensitive.

158
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:10.300
What, what is Twitter for, right? Is it just to fall in line?

159
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.740
Is it just to agree with everything someone says with no questioning whatsoever?

160
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.380
<v 1>What's extra interesting about it is she blocked me on Twitter,</v>

161
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.850
but then I treat my Facebook profile basically as public.

162
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.770
So I post stuff on there. It's the same, whether you're friends with me or not.

163
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.690
And I had posted something totally innocuous about,

164
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.450
I was at a restaurant or drinking an espresso on it.

165
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:34.291
I don't even know what it was.

166
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:38.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; she showed up there and commented that she had called

167
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:41.040
Boston college and told them I not to, you know,

168
00:08:41.041 --> 00:08:42.520
not to hire me or to fire me or whatever.

169
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.760
<v 0>On a post about you having an espresso. Well.</v>

170
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.320
<v 1>It was just a personal, personal post. Right.</v>

171
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:52.200
But the point is she determined that the exchange was worthy of blocking me on

172
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:53.034
Twitter.

173
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.560
But then she came to my personal Facebook page and said,

174
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.280
I'm calling Boston college and telling them to fire you.

175
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.160
<v 0>There's a word for that. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

176
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.000
God it's. So there might be a few there's a, a gang, but there's a big one.

177
00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:11.360
Yeah. There's a four letter one.

178
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.910
&lt;laugh&gt; I just don't understand why someone would want to do that to someone.

179
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:16.950
Why, why can't you disagree? Why can't you?

180
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.030
And she's just upset that you pointed out a glaring problem with what she was

181
00:09:22.031 --> 00:09:22.864
saying.

182
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.110
<v 1>Yeah, I apparently, and you know, the thing is I don't, I, the,</v>

183
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.390
the way I operate, I don't think even necessarily that she's a bad person. I,

184
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:34.190
I just assume that she has, you know, some emotional thing going on.

185
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.580
She could have had its terrible day.

186
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.980
As far as I know someone near and dear to her died that day. I.

187
00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.820
<v 0>Am. If someone near and dear to me died, I wouldn't go to you wouldn't.</v>

188
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.700
<v 1>Necessarily be on Twitter.</v>

189
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.020
<v 0>I wouldn't your Facebook or FOAs about you drinking an espresso. Fair, fair.</v>

190
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.460
Tell people I try to get you fired. But my.

191
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.260
<v 1>Approach is I just, I really do assume most people are pretty good people.</v>

192
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.250
And even when we have disagreements,

193
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.650
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I tend to give the benefit of the doubt that if we could

194
00:09:59.651 --> 00:10:03.930
only talk the way we're doing, yes, we could figure out 95% of the disagreement.

195
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.810
I agree with you. Maybe not all of it. Right. Agree. But most of it,

196
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.530
so I don't begrudge her. I mean, yeah, I don't, I,

197
00:10:09.531 --> 00:10:12.330
she behaved in a way I wouldn't behave, but who knows what she had going on?

198
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.530
You know? I, I mean it's.

199
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.560
<v 0>Yeah. Well, it didn't get you fired. So it's not the, that bad,</v>

200
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.120
but if it did that, would've been.

201
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.240
<v 1>Horrible. It would've been a different situation. Yeah.</v>

202
00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:21.640
Would've been probably a good publicity.

203
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.800
<v 0>Yeah. It probably would've helped you a little bit.</v>

204
00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:25.440
I think so you get excited about that. I like you.

205
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.960
<v 1>Well's funny your eye, the reason I'm,</v>

206
00:10:27.961 --> 00:10:31.360
I'm thinking back actually to a conversation I had at the time where someone

207
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.040
said to me, uh, if you do get fired, it's the best possible thing.

208
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:38.390
That'll right. It, it would just be fantastic.

209
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:41.710
And it didn't cause I wasn't actually employed there at the time. That's the,

210
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.390
the irony.

211
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.390
<v 0>Of it. Well, this is the thing, the, the falling in line, the,</v>

212
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.990
the no room for deviation from the ideology. Sure. This is a,

213
00:10:49.991 --> 00:10:52.110
this is a giant issue that I have with both,

214
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:55.750
both parties it's and I think it's one of the reasons why people were in these

215
00:10:55.751 --> 00:10:57.420
parties to begin with. I,

216
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.820
I don't necessarily think that people have clearly thought out every single

217
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.740
aspect of whatever party they align with.

218
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.420
I think they fall in line and they adopt predetermined pattern or behavior that

219
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:11.380
seems to be attractive at the time.

220
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.380
And then they fall in line with whatever that party is saying. Yeah.

221
00:11:14.381 --> 00:11:18.050
I think that is a giant percentage of people. When someone Devi from that,

222
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:22.530
like you did someone who is also clearly a progressive and clearly a left wing

223
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:27.250
person and you're criticizing something and very, very politely.

224
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.450
And that, that she just goes haywire over that.
