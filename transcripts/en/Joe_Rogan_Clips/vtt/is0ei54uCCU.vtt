1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. China's scares the out of me. You know,</v>

2
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:08.760
I was watching a video the other day of the week are Muslims and what they're

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.240
doing and rounding these people up and forcing them on trains. It's like,

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.220
it's terrifying. It's like, what are they doing?

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.330
And they have no accountability. They don't, they don't. No, no.

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.210
<v 1>No. G G literally has set himself up.</v>

7
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:22.460
We talk about Putin is saying himself as president for life.

8
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.570
And she literally has set himself up as president for life. Now, now,

9
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:30.170
if the Chinese economy, you know, go sideways in a big way, you know,

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.090
all bets are off, right. And he may not be as stable as he's been thinking,

11
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:39.830
but he spent years now, uh, strengthening and, and, uh,

12
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.540
um, building up the Intel apparatus within China, you know,

13
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.970
for his own purposes. Um,

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.110
and further moving away from this idea that somehow China was going to have a

15
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.470
rule of law. Right. I think that doesn't exist there. I mean,

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.660
they over the people of Hong Kong and we hardcore could have cared less. Right.

17
00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.840
We were all, everybody was all upset and angsty and protesting about Hong Kong.

18
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.840
And, oh my God, we got, we stand United with the Hong Kong protesters.

19
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.130
And then we got, you know,

20
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:10.850
up our own asses because we're all rightly so worried about the pandemic and,

21
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.990
you know, oh, a guy with an election coming in November and, you know,

22
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.060
while we're all looking that way, you know,

23
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.170
she saw an opportunity and just them over. Right. And there's.

24
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.720
<v 0>No consequences for us citizens. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.050
<v 1>Yeah. That's just the, and there's really no consequence. I mean,</v>

26
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:31.000
so far anywhere this, uh, you know, a few, you know, talks of sanctions and,

27
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:35.530
and, you know, some, but it doesn't mean anything.

28
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.210
<v 0>Essentially use the pandemic to decide,</v>

29
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:42.020
to impose the same sort of restrictive laws that they have in the rest of China

30
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:45.740
with Hong Kong, where Hong Kong used to be under British law.

31
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.770
And then was it 97 and transferred over to China? Yeah.

32
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.400
<v 1>And it was going to be 2047 was kind of that, that was the,</v>

33
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.870
the playing field they had in Hong Kong up until 2047.

34
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.100
<v 0>Goofy deal. Did they negotiate where they gave it up in 97? So stupid.</v>

35
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.770
<v 1>Well, uh, yeah, I mean, they, they, they roulade, they, yeah, they didn't,</v>

36
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.710
they really didn't have an option. So they felt that they were,

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.720
they were negotiating as best they could. Um, I, there was a sense, I think, uh,

38
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.010
at the time that look,

39
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:20.270
we either do this and guarantee some runway for the people of Hong Kong with

40
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:24.410
some, uh, pseudo democracy, a democracy, or, you know,

41
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:27.590
I'm trying to just going to say, you get the hell out. And it's ours.

42
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.710
I don't think China would have done that because look, they, they,

43
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.270
they need Hong Kong as a legitimate financial capital. Right.

44
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:36.620
But I think what's going to happen now,

45
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.770
given what they've just recently done is, you know,

46
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:42.410
they're going to turn Hong Kong at best into a,

47
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.520
a pass-through for hard currency basically. And you know,

48
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.910
you're going to see a lot of people moving out. Um, not just, you know,

49
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.300
not just ex-pats and, and, and, you know, financial institutions.

50
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:57.920
You're gonna see a lot of, of, uh, of the more, um,

51
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.500
successful, um, and, uh, uh, educated,

52
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.280
uh, Hong Kong citizens who are running businesses there who have been running

53
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:10.780
businesses, they're saying, it. It's not worth it. Um, and so, you know,

54
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:13.990
I think, uh, the Chinese, the China Chinese regime,

55
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.720
I think has probably themselves over in a way, but it's just an indication of,

56
00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:22.430
of she's mindset, right? He doesn't, he doesn't really care. And,

57
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:26.050
and it's just like their buildup of military capabilities in the south Pacific,

58
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.190
uh, their work in, in cyber activity, um,

59
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.070
they're are continuing hoovering up intellectual property.

60
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.430
It's not going to stop, you know, I mean,

61
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:41.290
now if it's better that we do make an effort, it's better that we do, you know,

62
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.220
uh, put sanctions on them for a variety of reasons, including the Wiggers, but,

63
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.360
uh, will it change overall? Will it change their, their behavior? Probably not.

64
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.750
<v 2>Yeah. It's so weird. So.</v>

65
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.870
<v 0>Weird to watch it happen. It's just, it's, uh, it's,</v>

66
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.840
it's something that people weren't really terrified of 10 years ago.

67
00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:00.000
They weren't worried about China taking over the world,

68
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.130
but now it seems like it's a real possibility.

69
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.650
<v 1>Yeah. And in fact, they weren't, it wasn't that they weren't worried about it.</v>

70
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.740
They were looking at China, like, you know, it, it, it's,

71
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:10.110
it's a great marketplace, you know, this is where we need to be now.

72
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.390
And you could argue the tech companies still do that. Right.

73
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.313
And the tech companies,

74
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.850
they don't look at China as a threat to national security.

75
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.420
They look at China as a, as a, as an opportunity. Right. And they,

76
00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:24.870
they always have, so that explains in part, you know,

77
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:29.190
sort of their behavior towards, uh, the China Chinese regime.

78
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.370
Um, but yeah, make no doubt about it.

79
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:37.230
They she's got his eyes set on being at the top of the food chain. So,

80
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.230
you know, we can either deal with it or we can pretend it doesn't exist.

81
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.890
<v 0>You think they're going to ban more companies the same way they ban Walway?</v>

82
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.180
<v 1>Um, well, it depends on what happens in November. Right. Um, I guarantee you,</v>

83
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.230
the Chinese government would like to see Biden win and then, oh yeah,

84
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.190
absolutely. I mean, if, if, if, you know, as would, you know,

85
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.710
for their own reasons, um, I think, you know, and this was people,

86
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.300
people who,

87
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.870
who subscribed to the Trump as Putin's puppet will scoff at this idea, but look,

88
00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:12.630
the Russians, I think, would prefer to see Biden win as well. Right. I mean,

89
00:05:12.631 --> 00:05:15.900
they can get back to business as usual. Uh, probably ease up on the sanctions.

90
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.880
Um, you know, the, the left,

91
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.330
the hard left anyway has been very successful over the years at this,

92
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:26.130
this Russian narrative. Right. And, um, and fine, it worked for them.

93
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.170
You know, it spent three years in this, in this, uh, in pushing this,

94
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.590
this particular narrative. And, and, but I think, I think overall the Chinese,

95
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.670
the Russians, they would prefer to see someone like Biden come in. Uh,

96
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:41.820
I think they feel like it would be, uh, a more, uh,

97
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.320
collegial approach from the white house, uh, less confrontational.

98
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.840
Um, and I think that's just where we're at. Look, I mean,

99
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.940
you know, uh, bill, uh, bill gates, Bob gates, uh,

100
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.540
used to be the director of the agency. Right.

101
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.740
And he worked for a couple of administrations. Um, and yeah,

102
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.850
he said it himself, that Biden's never been on the right side of,

103
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.290
of a foreign policy decision. Right. So that's one area where, again,

104
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:15.170
going back to what we talked about earlier is, you know,

105
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:16.640
if he's going to choose a vice-president,

106
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.440
I'd rather he choose somebody who's got as much national security and foreign

107
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:23.150
policy experience as possible.

108
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.880
Cause I think that's one area where he's going to be lacking,

109
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.490
even though he says, oh, I've worked in foreign policy all my life.

110
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.180
It doesn't mean anything just because you were there doesn't mean you've got

111
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:34.550
good judgment or right. You know, anyway.

112
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.260
<v 0>What do I know? Do you think that the,</v>

113
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.200
the policies that Trump's put in place for China are actually beneficial to

114
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.240
United States? I think it's a good step. Yeah.

115
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.940
<v 1>I do. I do, because it's put them on the back of the China. I mean,</v>

116
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:50.450
it's put them on the back foot, right. That's not a bad thing. Uh,

117
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.120
made them a little less sure about, you know, what they're doing.

118
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.060
They've had to think about things a little bit more. They have yeah.

119
00:06:56.061 --> 00:07:00.290
The sanctions. Um, I wish that we would sanction them hard for the Wiggers.

120
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:04.280
I wish we would sanction them very hard for what they've done in Hong Kong. Um,

121
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.970
I'd like to see that happen. I think what we're seeing now though,

122
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:11.770
is obviously the pandemic has deflected a lot of attention and also, uh,

123
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:15.440
you know, the closer you get to any presidential election, the less gets done.

124
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.490
You know, it just,

125
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.400
so I don't know that anything meaningful is going to happen over the course of

126
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:23.930
the next handful of months. Um, and who knows what the going to happen in,

127
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:24.680
in November.
