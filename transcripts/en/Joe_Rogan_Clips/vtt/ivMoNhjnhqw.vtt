00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 1>Experience. Rebel Wilson is committed to losing weight.</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.200
She's lost a ton of weight and people are mad at her.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.440
<v 0>Are they really? Yeah. They're mad at her because.</v>

5
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440
<v 1>She's, they like her being big.</v>

6
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.160
They like her being big because she's big and I'm big and everyone's big and

7
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.440
it's okay to be big. And I heard it's healthy to be big. And so like,

8
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:21.670
people are criticizing her for losing weight. Oh, they're Adele as well.

9
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.230
Oh really? Yeah. They said Adele.

10
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.390
They they're angry that Adele lost weight because they love the fact that she

11
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:29.430
was this huge musical superstar and she was obese.

12
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.670
<v 0>And so she wanted to take care of her health. She's trying to be healthy,</v>

13
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.710
live a little longer. And then you're.

14
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.370
<v 1>You're turning.</v>

15
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.710
<v 0>On us. Well, she became a role model for certain people, I guess. And they.</v>

16
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.500
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; be own bottle for you to get healthy. We can all get healthy. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.860
Come on, stay away from Tom's bread. &lt;laugh&gt; eat only meat.

18
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.780
<v 0>Just don't eat it all the time. You just don't eat this all the time. Yes.</v>

19
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.460
<v 1>Well, I didn't gain any weight this weekend. Yeah. I didn't gain any weight.</v>

20
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.180
I ate all that. And then, uh, I fasted Sunday night Uhhuh &lt;affirmative&gt; until,

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.100
uh, Monday I went to yoga Monday morning. Didn't eat, um,

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.450
until right before my first podcast and, uh, I didn't gain any weight at all.

23
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.810
That's great. Yeah, but you.

24
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.130
<v 0>It's moderation moderation.</v>

25
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.170
<v 1>It's it's eating like over. But what was interesting was the pains back pain,</v>

26
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.330
knee pain. What is that? It's inflammation. It's inflammation, right? Your,

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.970
your body does not want to have to process all that stuff. And they,

28
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.880
that may be the root for many people of a lot of causes of pain and discomfort

29
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.360
is just inflammation, heavy diet, right. Sugar, right.

30
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.753
Sugar is a big one.

31
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.480
<v 0>So if you get all of that out of your system, your body can,</v>

32
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:37.800
what go to work on the stuff it has to go to work on.

33
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.360
<v 1>Yeah. You get all that outta your system and your body doesn't experience</v>

34
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:43.790
inflammation, your food. Right.

35
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.350
And if you're eating food that like, you know, grass fed beef, you know,

36
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.230
or in my case, elk, you know, or, I mean,

37
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.310
I'm sure vegetables are not bad for you. I just did it to try to find what,

38
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.310
so I just did it to try to find out what it's like to only eat meat. Right.

39
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.070
And when you have no carbohydrates,

40
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:03.980
one of the things that's most amazing is that they're is no crashing.

41
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.380
You would eat and you don't feel any different after you ate,

42
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.340
other than the fact that you don't feel hungry, right? Like you don't crash,

43
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.580
right? There's no ups and downs and peaks and valleys.

44
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.180
My energy levels were amazing. Really that.

45
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.900
<v 0>How quickly extra energy, how quickly?</v>

46
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.620
<v 1>Two weeks in two weeks in two weeks in, I noticed I felt amazing. Really?</v>

47
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.250
And that was shedding with weight. I was shedding a lot of weight.

48
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.170
I think I was like seven pounds down. Two weeks in, geez.

49
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.330
Now I'm 12 pounds down. 12 ish, something like that.

50
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.850
I was 1 93 this morning. I was weighing about 2 0 5 before I started this diet.

51
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:37.400
Really?

52
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.330
<v 0>Yeah. Wow.</v>

53
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.130
<v 1>Man. I feel a lot better, like a lot better. Really?</v>

54
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.010
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So what would you, what would you recommend?</v>

55
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.000
Would you recommend people just do that? Or do you think you.

56
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.520
<v 1>Moderate think that for people who have an autoimmune disorder, there are,</v>

57
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.320
I do believe there are certain people that have an adverse reaction to some

58
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.720
plants, right? Some foods that's what an elimination diet is all about.

59
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.000
It's like trying to find out what are the things that bother you. Yeah. What,

60
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.080
but for me, it's like, what I did is I just took a lot of multivitamins.

61
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.760
I took a, a bunch of different vitamins and nutrients supplements.

62
00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:12.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; on top of this carnivore diet. So I'm only eating meat,

63
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.840
but then I'm taking all the essential vitamins and amino acids.

64
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.840
And I'm also taking fish oil.

65
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.590
So I I'm covering all my nutritional bases bases. Right.

66
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.510
But I'm not doing it with food. I'm not doing it with plants.

67
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.470
I'm only eating grass, fed meat and then I'm or, or, uh, elk.

68
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.950
And then on top of that, I'm, I'm taking fat from like bacon, like bacon.

69
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.100
I need it fat because elk in particular is very lean. Really? If I'm eating elk,

70
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.500
if I eat grass fed beef, I'm fine. But with things like elk,

71
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.860
you really do need some extra.

72
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.860
<v 0>Sources of fat. If you don't have fat, would, would you start to feel bad? Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.260
<v 1>Your body doesn't like it. No. Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:53.860
Your body does not want a low fat diet with low carbohydrates.

75
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.660
It's there's a thing called rabbit starvation. Have you ever heard of that? No.

76
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.850
People got that in Antarctica. I, it was Antarctica in the cold,

77
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.210
cold climates where they were, uh, shooting rabbits and eating rabbits.

78
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.570
And they were literally starving to death.

79
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.410
Even though they were eating all these rabbits,

80
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.170
cuz the rabbits have no fat on 'em. So they're only eating this lean protein.

81
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.850
Right. But with no fat at all and you start feeling like. Yeah.

82
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.450
Different explorers have found that too. That yeah. You know, when they,

83
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.360
you know, were in places and trying to eat only the,

84
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.720
the foods that they could harvest off the, the land they're eating animals.

85
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.600
Like they had to take in fat. If you don't take in fat, you feel really bad.

86
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:29.880
Yeah. Yeah.

87
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.920
<v 0>So a little bit. So you could balance it. So would you say</v>

88
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.920
maybe 80%?

89
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.710
<v 1>This is what I would say. Try it. Just try, just try it. AVO diet,</v>

90
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.950
try it straight out. Right.

91
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.670
And I think you'll be amazed at how good you feel now. Here's the thing.

92
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:48.790
Is that a honeymoon thing?

93
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.070
Like what is it like if you extend that to 90 days or um,

94
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.310
you know, 365 days is that you're gonna feel like eventually. Right?

95
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:01.340
Is it gonna start breaking your body down? Right. I don't know.

96
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.260
I only have experience in 30 days,

97
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.740
but in my experience in 30 days it was enormously beneficial.

98
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.940
<v 0>You did say something in your post about a explosive diarrhea.</v>

99
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.660
<v 1>It needs to have a new name.</v>

100
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.220
&lt;laugh&gt; diarrhea's not strong enough for what I was experiencing for real. Yeah.

101
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:22.050
It was like someone was tapping into, uh, like an oil, like an oil. Well, geez.

102
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.203
I have pictures.

103
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.490
<v 0>Pictures. So why was that happening?</v>

104
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.050
<v 1>Um, well I talked to Dr. Sean Baker. He wrote a book on the carnivore diet.</v>

105
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:33.410
He's a physician, that's a carnivore diet advocate.

106
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:36.090
He's been eating this way for two years. Two years. Yep.

107
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.850
And he seems to think that it has to do with the colon adjusting to the fact

108
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:41.450
your body doesn't have any dietary fiber.

109
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.680
You're not taking in any rice or bread or anything.

110
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:47.360
That's gonna absorb the water. So your body's like your body's like,

111
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:51.200
what do I do with all this liquid? It's going out the. Woo.

112
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.280
<v 0>But how long did that last?</v>

113
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.640
<v 1>Around two weeks. Two weeks.</v>

114
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.680
Two weeks of rocket fuel coming outta your booty hole. Ah, geez.

115
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.200
But if you get through it,

116
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.960
you get through it and Toms is going through it right now. He is. Yeah, yeah,

117
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:05.481
yeah. He,

118
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:09.080
he sent me a text the other day saying this diary is astounding &lt;laugh&gt;.

119
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.893
<v 0>Oh no.</v>

120
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.240
<v 1>Oh astonishing. That's he said astonishing.</v>

121
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.200
<v 0>Oh, not coffee. Is it? Cause you guys both drink coffee.</v>

122
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.390
I I'm just asking just a general question. I mean.

123
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.670
<v 1>So you guys both intake a lot, bro. It could be kinds of liquids,</v>

124
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.870
whatever kinds of liquids are coming outta your butt. It's not normal.

125
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.670
I was really.

126
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.470
<v 0>Getting excited about trying this &lt;laugh&gt; but.</v>

127
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:31.630
<v 1>Here's the thing at the end of that, it all goes away. Right. I mean,</v>

128
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.150
at the end of two weeks, my body adjusted and now it's not a problem at all.

129
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.620
Really? Yeah. Not a problem at all now.

130
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.700
<v 0>So what's breakfast steak.</v>

131
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.980
<v 1>Or eggs? Sometimes like this morning it was uh,</v>

132
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.620
steak Uhhuh yesterday morning I ate six eggs, right? Yeah.

133
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.460
<v 0>Just, just wh those down mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; lunch. I.</v>

134
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.100
<v 1>Don't eat lunch. Don't eat lunch, usually eat two meals a day. Right?</v>

135
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.490
And then the second meal is usually steak. No, the steak either elk or,

136
00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.810
or a beef steak.

137
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 0>I think I've asked you this before, but when,</v>

138
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.690
whenever I think about these diet things,

139
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:08.050
I always picture my family looking at me while they're eating pasta or eating.

140
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.610
Like, did you feel like an outlier at dinner with your family or?

141
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.490
<v 1>No, they knew what I was doing. They'd made fun of me and. Right? No big deal.</v>

142
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.280
Oh. Would eat and steak eat steak again. Right? My.

143
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.120
<v 0>Kids are hilarious. Yeah. That's what I always, my kids mock me too. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

144
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.440
<v 1>That's good. That's healthy. Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know, they didn't mind. Yeah,</v>

145
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.840
no, no. Nobody bothered. My wife didn't care. Everyone knew I was doing it.

146
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.560
So it was, it was okay. Right? Yeah.

147
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.240
<v 0>Your wife's not like, come on, have ice cream with us. No.</v>

148
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.070
<v 1>Boy that'd be a problem if she was yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, if it looks so good,</v>

149
00:07:42.071 --> 00:07:46.990
like ice cream looks good. Yeah. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; no, um, it was, uh,

150
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.670
it was an eyeopener, but here's thing. Yeah. I'm sorry.

151
00:07:50.671 --> 00:07:52.150
Here's the thing about that. That,

152
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.590
that kind of stuff you kind of have to commit, right?

153
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:58.550
Like if you just say I'm gonna try to eat healthier. It's too loosely defined.

154
00:07:58.630 --> 00:07:58.750
I.

155
00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.580
<v 0>Know,</v>

156
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.460
I know I was doing the intermittent fasting and lost good

157
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:05.294
amount of weight.

158
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.980
And then it just kind of like plateaued and I feel like I'd like to be,

159
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:14.420
you know, like 10 pounds lighter and it's, I'm working out.

160
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.460
I'm doing all that stuff,

161
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.810
but I feel like it needs something to shock my system to go to.

162
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.570
<v 1>It. Nothing will shock your system. Like this car invo diet. Yeah.</v>

163
00:08:22.571 --> 00:08:26.050
Including your butt hole. &lt;laugh&gt; but you will lose a lot of weight. I lost,

164
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.770
I mean, I lost a legitimate 12 pounds of fat. Wow. Just fat.

165
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.770
My face got thinner. Yeah. Like when I was washing my face,

166
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.730
I would feel actually it feels a little fatter now because I went through

167
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:37.810
Disneyland. &lt;laugh&gt;.

168
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.730
<v 0>There's some Disney chunks, Disney.</v>

169
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:42.840
<v 1>Ice cream. I ate a lot of dessert. You just had bread.</v>

170
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.720
I actually not really any fatter, but, but joking around.

171
00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:47.760
Maybe I'm a little swollen. No, you look, you.

172
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.680
<v 0>Look leaner. Well.</v>

173
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.800
<v 1>I was real. I, I was, you know, I was getting fat. I was developing a, a gut.</v>

174
00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:54.320
Like we did this weigh in thing and oh,

175
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:57.800
so many people mocked me &lt;laugh&gt; I was getting a gut though. My,

176
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.960
my stomach was like hanging out. And also when we came in here to, uh, do that,

177
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.480
I had my FA it was December 23rd and my family was in town and we had eaten like

178
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.120
pigs that day. Right. I was, I was B loaded,

179
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.160
considerably bloated with food as well. Cause it was nighttime.

180
00:09:12.161 --> 00:09:14.440
We had a nighttime podcast. It was like 10 o'clock or something like that.

181
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.870
Right. It's pretty, pretty late podcast. Yeah.

182
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.830
Well we all took our clothes off and got on the scale. &lt;laugh&gt; um,

183
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.950
so I knew I was probably gonna do the carnivore diet anywhere,

184
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.590
but that was like, yeah, let's just do it. Let's just do it. Let's go.

185
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.790
There's like set it in my head. Let's just do it. Yeah.

186
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.870
So knowing that for the month of January, that was all that I was gonna eat.

187
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.231
Yeah.

188
00:09:32.231 --> 00:09:36.060
That's that really helps if you're gonna try to something mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

189
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.020
to have like a real solid schedule, like sober October,

190
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.140
another perfect example for me lent. Yeah. When we do sober October,

191
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.140
we have one month. No booze, no pot, no nothing. Yeah.

192
00:09:48.141 --> 00:09:51.380
There's something good about that. Where you have that month. Cause it.

193
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.820
<v 0>Takes it out, all that kind of mushy brain stuff of oh, but maybe I'll just,</v>

194
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.890
just now we're celebrating.

195
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.450
<v 1>Yeah. We need a certain amount of rigidity occasionally. Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.610
That's how you get done. Yeah. And uh, I mean, even if you are like writing,

197
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.850
if you said I am going to write every day for the month of February. Yeah.

198
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.810
You know, every day. Yeah. Like there's something to that. It's the routine.

199
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.450
Yeah. So something really beneficial.

200
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.970
I'm gonna write for one half an hour every day. If you do that. Yeah.

201
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.360
You get things done. It's really true. If you just decide,

202
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.120
I'm gonna go on a car, avoid diet for the next 30 days starting right now. Yeah.

203
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.240
And just count down on your calendar 30 days from now you'll lose weight and

204
00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:29.240
you'll feel amazing. Yeah.

205
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.520
I'm I just don't know if it's a way to eat all the time.

206
00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.040
<v 0>No, that's the thing it's like,</v>

207
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:37.150
it seems like an extreme thing that I would not be willing to maintain. Well,

208
00:10:37.151 --> 00:10:39.950
you're the bread mask. Well, that's the thing. You're the Salton of sour.

209
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.670
That's why I want balance. I'm always searching for the right balance.

210
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:48.070
<v 1>I think a great move is six days on one day off. That's what I think.</v>

211
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.110
Six days on a rigid diet. One day where you,

212
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.350
you look forward to eating bread and pasta, drinking,

213
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.220
whatever you want and you know, have an ice cream and one day.
