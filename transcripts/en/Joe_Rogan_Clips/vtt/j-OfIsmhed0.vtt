WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you carry it now? I have a concealed.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.040
<v 1>Carry. We're going to fix that. Okay. Like super fast. All right. Excellent.</v>

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.090
Good to hear. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.540
<v 2>You can. You can't be here. I gave you a concealed carry state.</v>

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.880
<v 1>Right? Open, carries down. Please. Don't do that. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.700
<v 3>It's like very, uh, antagonistic almost. Yeah. Uh.</v>

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.530
<v 2>But like that's, um, while I believe you have the right to do that,</v>

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.060
it's also one of those things that's like,

9
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.230
it's also dumb to do it from a tactical perspective. Right.

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.150
Why would you be sitting here with the thing that you want to protect you

11
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.770
expose to the whole entire world and telegraphing? Like, if I walk into a room,

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.270
that's like the first guy I'm like one you're probably useless. Two is,

13
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.470
um, I'm concerned about you not as an asset, but rather as a threat,

14
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.830
like there's, um, I don't, there's not a, if you went out to any,

15
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:55.190
any of the guys out here or any of my friends, they're like do open carry,

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.400
did like, no, that's dumb. How am I going to do that?

17
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.851
<v 3>Well, this,</v>

18
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:02.090
that thing that like I was getting into about the protest when people were

19
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:06.500
showing up at these black lives matter protest with a AKA's around their neck,

20
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.240
what are you doing? Okay. Jimmy.

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.620
<v 2>Times they have accidental discharged their weapon into the crowd.</v>

22
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.660
<v 1>Oh, I'm sure it's happened like a dozen times. I'm sure it's.</v>

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.060
<v 2>Heartbreaking. Cause like I respect that. They're trying to, like,</v>

24
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.930
I fully believe in protesting love, peaceful protest. I've been like that,

25
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.880
that kind of bravado of open carry in that sense where they're

26
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:32.090
like really, I think a freedom not exercised is a freedom.

27
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.950
That's going to atrophy and die. Uh,

28
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:36.890
one of the reasons why I love comedy is because, um,

29
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.950
you are pushing the limit of what people are comfortable with,

30
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.050
especially with the first amendment. You're kind.

31
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.030
<v 3>Of torn on open carry in that sense.</v>

32
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.320
<v 2>I think it's super dumb, but I like people exercising their freedoms.</v>

33
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.200
<v 1>Interesting. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. I see what you're saying though.</v>

34
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.120
<v 2>Uh, the right person, like I one, I would never be at a protest of,</v>

35
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.780
um, while I support it, I would,

36
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.080
I dangerous to be there right now. Um,

37
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.790
so I wouldn't the cost versus gain of what happens

38
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.370
at those peaceful protests. Um,

39
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.000
and then the thought of even open carrying is idiotic.

40
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.710
<v 3>I agree with that. Uh,</v>

41
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.170
I feel like showing up at one of those protests with a gun, like,

42
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.940
unless they're coming to you and trying to take your house or break down your

43
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:26.180
door, why do you have, why are you walking around with a gun?

44
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.270
Just know you're supposed to, if it's supposed to be a peaceful protest.

45
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.440
And the idea is like,

46
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.200
what if someone comes to try to disrupt that peaceful protest? Like,

47
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.560
but you were inviting them almost with that gun. Yeah. Yeah.

48
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.030
<v 2>I mean, w we had a, uh, a poor, um, kid killed here in Austin. Um,</v>

49
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.070
he had an AK and, uh,

50
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.780
poor Uber driver got in the middle of a protest and he's like, holy crap.

51
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.700
His, his, you know, when he dropped,

52
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:54.410
he had a drop-off and he went to go do another pickup and Uber like

53
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.690
automatically routes the way to go.

54
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:59.830
So he's following his little Uber route and he turns, he's like, oh man,

55
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:03.940
I'm in the middle of a protest. He's a soldier from Fort hood right here. And,

56
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.440
uh, he's concealed carrying in, in, in his Uber vehicle. And, um,

57
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.330
he gets stuck in the protest and the protesters to swarm his car. And this,

58
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.650
this, this kid that died, um, he's actually a really neat kid. Cause you know,

59
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:22.300
his, his girlfriend, um, was black and he's there to support her.

60
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.220
Um, she had a bunch of physical,

61
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.130
physical impairments and she was in a wheelchair. Yeah. I mean,

62
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:29.650
he's like a neat kid. You're like not smart.

63
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.830
He's open carrying at a protest, you know?

64
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.840
And you've seen kind of some inflammatory things beforehand,

65
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:39.040
but like I think his point and his purpose was really good and pure and like

66
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.260
trying to do the right thing. Right. Um,

67
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.340
but then he runs up to the side of a car and points a gun at an Uber driver that

68
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:48.550
is scared and confused and he get shot. Yeah.

69
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.720
Like that's the recipe for disaster. I saw.

70
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.120
<v 3>So many different versions of that story too,</v>

71
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.190
where people had twisted the facts. People had said he was unarmed people,

72
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.360
the guy who got shot. Yeah.

73
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.320
People were saying that the guy who did it was a white supremacist who drove

74
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:07.800
into the protest on purpose. There was so many edited.

75
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.620
<v 2>Where it looked like the guy was making a right hand turn and he like sped up.</v>

76
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.260
Cause he was trying to get around a person and they cut right there.

77
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:16.410
Cause it looks like the guy speeding up to go into the crowd. But super,

78
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:17.400
when you watch the whole video,

79
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.090
it's really obvious what that poor kid was trying to do. The driver. Um,

80
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.280
I saw a fascinating, um,

81
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.080
this PhD on communication broke down from the

82
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:32.790
initial release of the information of the story, how immediately started being,

83
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.850
um, distorted. Yeah. For, for two different sides.

84
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.150
Like I'm gonna leave out this detail. I'm gonna include this detail.

85
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.830
And by the time he got the game telephone, we were like, Hey, um,

86
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.070
here's this catchphrase. And by the time it gets all the way around the room,

87
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.950
it doesn't sound like any semblance of what it did when it started.

88
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.200
When you got to the final version,

89
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.300
I'm super enraged at one version and I'm super enraged at another version,

90
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.770
but neither of them are true. And like that,

91
00:05:00.771 --> 00:05:05.430
that's what every single issue is happening from defending the police to black

92
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:07.560
lives matter to Antifa. It's like,

93
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.000
can we just be reasonable and talk about what's really happening? We.

94
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.860
<v 3>Have some real good examples of what the worst case scenarios</v>

95
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:18.090
are in this country right now.

96
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:22.470
And one of us Portland like Portland is one of the best case scenarios of

97
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.230
completely unreasonable, ridiculous. That's going on every single day,

98
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.380
101 days approach. They've got that mayor up.

99
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:35.700
There is the most progressive mayor in the country. And they're like,

100
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.560
you resign, burn.

101
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.410
<v 2>Your house down and move out because they're going to burn this place down. I.</v>

102
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.680
<v 3>Tried to burn down his lobby. They were throwing fiery things into his lobby.</v>

103
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:45.660
They were lighting fires in front of the street, in front of his house,

104
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.380
having dance parties in front of his apartment building. So I was coming back.

105
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.640
<v 2>From Africa on an SFA mission, um, uh,</v>

106
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:58.310
security forces assistance, uh, like, uh, we,

107
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.320
the military go to places that have insurgents and we try

108
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:05.540
to legitimize the process of government.

109
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.400
So in counterinsurgency there's like all of these different missions from, um,

110
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.970
joint combined exercises for training to foreign internal defense,

111
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:17.900
to SFS security forces, um, assistance.

112
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.970
And I'm over there doing a counterinsurgency mission and I'm coming back and I'm

113
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:25.940
seeing the same kind of horrible,

114
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:29.440
dangerous recipe in Portland. You know, the,

115
00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:33.830
the same types of organization and

116
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:35.420
structure and,

117
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.400
and it's an insurgency is a charged idea

118
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.340
that, you know, insurgency as the DOD defines it is, uh,

119
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.780
an organized group trying to delegitimize or overthrow a

120
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:53.930
constitutional government. Like that's how the DOD defines it.

121
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.730
And I think if you went to almost anyone in Portland, they're like,

122
00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:01.670
what are you trying to do right now? Like, that's what they're trying to do.

123
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.070
Right? Like that's what they believe they're open about it.

124
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:09.050
W w which is all right. And that creates a really hard,

125
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.630
um, how do you combat that?

126
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.710
Cause you have to combat the grievances and the ideas you have to in is as

127
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:17.240
dangerous as it is.

128
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.490
Those ideas are like a cancer because when the

129
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.700
truth and information is being, uh, adjusted,

130
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.800
just like we talked about with the shooting here in Austin,

131
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.580
where you have two different versions and some people are in the echo chamber of

132
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:32.870
only hearing one side of it,

133
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.430
it just keeps radicalizing more and more and catching more momentum.

134
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.160
And then the reason that they're there is,

135
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.520
is so convoluted with, you know, if you're,

136
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:47.330
are you there for black lives matter or are you there, um, you know, to,

137
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:51.230
to fight systemic racism, are you here to like, what are you protesting about?

138
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.840
Like, I think you'd get a lot of different answers.

139
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.150
<v 1>Yeah. That's dangerous. Like.</v>

140
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.430
<v 2>Now, now, now you're just there to do damage.</v>

141
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.310
Like you're not really trying to do anything. That's good.

142
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.330
<v 3>It's also exciting. This is the other thing about it. When,</v>

143
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:09.340
when you're allowed to throw fire into the lobby of the apartment,

144
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:14.260
building where the mayor lives and no one stops you and you're out in front and

145
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:19.240
people are playing music and dancing and everyone's going black lives matter.

146
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.470
There's excitement to that, right. Something's happening.

147
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.500
And then when you're talking about people that are out of work, the economy is.

148
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.200
No one knows what to do. Everyone's scared.

149
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.740
COVID is killing a certain percentage of people you're you,

150
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:36.100
you can't do anything about it. There's no vaccines.

151
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.130
There's all this tension in the air. And then you have this movement.

152
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.590
And then this is the most exciting thing that's happening.

153
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.980
And then for people that don't have jobs and can't go anywhere,

154
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.250
what the do you want them to do? They're going to get sucked up into that.

155
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.760
Especially if it aligns with their political ideologies,

156
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.010
that they're a left leaning person. And they're like, look,

157
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:56.760
we have a real chance for real revolution here.

158
00:08:56.761 --> 00:09:00.180
And this is what they don't understand what I was talking about. Seattle,

159
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.640
you're doing the same thing that you would hate for people to do.

160
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.060
You're taking over businesses with force you're,

161
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.710
you're occupying land that you don't deserve. You're stealing buildings.

162
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.890
You're literally occupying buildings that other people built.

163
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.520
And then once you get there, you're establishing boundaries.

164
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.930
You're putting up barriers.

165
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.400
You have a police force that will attack and brutally beat people up for just

166
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.180
filming what they perceive as injustices or what they're going to put on the

167
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:33.360
internet. And then people get shot and you're calling the cops.

168
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.210
You call the police and ambulance is when people get shot there.

169
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.250
Do you know crazy? This is it's so poorly thought out across the board.

170
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:42.510
And if you do that,

171
00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.980
if you take over an area what's to stop people from doing that to you,

172
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.860
you've already set a precedent. You've already said,

173
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.240
we could do this with force.

174
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.260
We're going to move in with no law behind us with no court ruling,

175
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.770
with no reasonable discourse. We're going to move in with force.

176
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.380
And we're going to take over near with numbers and threats.

177
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.830
And then what's going to stop someone from doing that to you, nothing you.

178
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.160
You've already set a precedent. You've already said, this is how it's.

179
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.930
<v 2>Done. And then it's just chaos and anarchy. It just gets worse. Exactly.</v>

180
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.460
And the more violent and larger group will win. So from a,

181
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.490
the, the, the mission of counterinsurgency,

182
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.930
like how do you fight those ideas is stability and security, right? If we want,

183
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.560
um, to see positive change and, and, you know,

184
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.700
kind of destitute poverty stricken areas of the country, um,

185
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.860
urban areas where like, really,

186
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.280
you want to talk about systemic racism and you start looking at like Detroit and

187
00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:40.310
Baltimore and Chicago. Um, how do you fix that?

188
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.430
It's not fewer police officers. It's more police officers.

189
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.560
The way that you fix it is providing,

190
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.920
providing stability and security in an area so that then businesses can

191
00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:53.360
flourish. Capitalism arrives, more job opportunities, more wealth,

192
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:57.610
more education, more, um, like immediately in 10 years,

193
00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.850
you'll see the, the transformation of a block when, uh,

194
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.490
when a good business comes in and good things start happening.

195
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.850
That business can't go there. If it's dangerous,

196
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.170
if it's riding and it's looting.

197
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.520
So if you look at every one of the cities that had serious riots, um,

198
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:18.410
and you know, from like Rodney king, how bad those areas still are,

199
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.360
it takes like 50, 60 years. If they ever bounce back to come back from that.

200
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.040
So if you're like, yo go black lives matter, but then you're going in rioting.

201
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.360
You are absolutely condemning yourself to more poverty and then you'd go and

202
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.111
defund the police.

203
00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:36.230
And you remove the one thing that's going to provide stability and security out

204
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.370
in that area that will bring in commerce that will bring in business and jobs.

205
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.850
Like you're screwing yourself.

206
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.000
<v 3>It's just so hard for people to see that because it's a long game.</v>

207
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.290
And in the short term, they want justice and they're like, no justice, no peace.

208
00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:52.520
And they just want to light on fire.

209
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.320
And I understand that they're angry and I understand that sentiment,

210
00:11:56.321 --> 00:12:01.000
but it's no one's explaining that this is, this is how this plays out.

211
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.860
You're literally going to that area for a long time. Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:07.780
It takes a lot. And a lot of money is going to be,

213
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.180
have to be spent in order to bring it back.

214
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:15.150
<v 2>The money is a hard thing. Um, insurgencies are really cheap, you know, if,</v>

215
00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.320
um, if I wanted to ruin something, you know,

216
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.640
it doesn't take a lot of effort for me to destroy it for me to build and protect

217
00:12:23.641 --> 00:12:28.290
something that takes a lot of manpower's manpower and hours. Um,

218
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:33.360
insurgencies are also way more successful than a conventional type war.

219
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.830
Um, even if it's just war of ideas, not that we're in a civil war, thank God.

220
00:12:37.831 --> 00:12:41.850
We don't have like geographic lines that these radical groups could align

221
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:45.330
themselves with because then we'd be in a different problem. Um,

222
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.890
it takes not just manpower funding. Uh, you know,

223
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.460
like if you're going to flood say Baltimore with police officers,

224
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.650
that's a lot of money and it would take a long time for a business to

225
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.600
feel like it's safe and secure for them to go in there and start affecting

226
00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:08.430
positive change, opening, more stores, more jobs, more jobs, more wealth,

227
00:13:08.431 --> 00:13:12.960
more wealth, more education, more education, better schools. And then boom,

228
00:13:12.961 --> 00:13:16.230
we have a flourishing community where people can prosper.

229
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.440
Um, but it takes, you know,

230
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:22.890
one idiot with a Molotov cocktail to bring that all crumbling down again.

231
00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.310
<v 3>Yeah. And you're starting from scratch or below scratch.</v>

232
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.850
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And that's where we are. Yep.</v>

233
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.950
<v 3>I mean, this is a trying time for us in the weirdest of ways,</v>

234
00:13:33.951 --> 00:13:37.190
because I don't think anybody anticipated everything going this far south so

235
00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:41.480
quickly. It's not done. Oh, this is yours. What's that? Oh, my constitution.

236
00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.210
Back up. Yeah.

237
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.030
<v 1>I got the papers. Yeah. I got the, just how it is.</v>

238
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:50.900
<v 2>It's not for interpretation. It's just as it is. Oh, just.</v>

239
00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:55.790
<v 3>Amazing that these guys saw human nature and how it could be up</v>

240
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.820
and how they could ruin everything so far in advance.

241
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:04.820
<v 4>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

242
00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.000
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

243
00:14:08.001 --> 00:14:10.400
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

244
00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:14.120
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

245
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:18.110
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

246
00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.000
That's all we're asking you to just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
