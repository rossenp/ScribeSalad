00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So that's the crazy thing, right? Like you don't,</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.500
you're not just doing something, but you're also selling film.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.400
<v 1>Films. So you gotta like, you know, did.</v>

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.580
<v 0>They give you tips on how to film.</v>

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.980
<v 1>You filmed tips before you go out?</v>

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.230
I actually found like this wasn't everyone's experience,

7
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.040
but I found it was like kind of nice to have a camera because when I'd been like

8
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.580
for trapping in Siberia, it's like, you're just alone, alone,

9
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.390
and everything you do just feels like nobody's ever going to know about it.

10
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.180
You know, like you do all these cool things. And, you know,

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
I remember like I'd been out there for a few weeks and I came into like this

12
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.720
beautiful woods in Siberia, you know? And I remember being like, wow.

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.441
And then I was like, oh, weird.

14
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.470
That was the first time I've spoken out loud in like three weeks, you know?

15
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:43.950
So it was.

16
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.930
<v 0>Like just saying, wow. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.540
<v 1>Well, like caught my attention. Oh, that was my voice. You know? Like,</v>

18
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.750
and then of course your mind is really active, but it's just all in your head.

19
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.590
But on the show with the cameras, you know, it's like, you're constantly,

20
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.660
like [inaudible] talking about stuff and

21
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.740
it's like kinda made me feel like I wasn't quite as alone.

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.580
<v 0>When they tell you when they give you the camera equipment and tell you,</v>

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500
go out and film yourself. W how much battery life do you have?

24
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.120
<v 1>Uh, well, you get this big,</v>

25
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.050
like car battery size pack that you can recharge your batteries with.

26
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.790
And then they'll occasionally come on, like med checks to see,

27
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.950
make sure you're not too skinny or something like that.

28
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.050
<v 0>Yeah. Because they check on you.</v>

29
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.960
<v 1>It varies sometime around 10 days, ish or.</v>

30
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.710
<v 0>Something. Oh, he's dead. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.760
<v 1>Not yet. No. Fortunately.</v>

32
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.610
<v 0>They give you a bell to ring or something. Do you have a thing?</v>

33
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.390
<v 1>You have a thing that you like, it's the thing you would give up with? Like,</v>

34
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.410
if you were ready to tap.

35
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.030
<v 0>Out a red button, Garmin.</v>

36
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.720
<v 1>You can send texts on it. And then, uh,</v>

37
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.930
let's say you text them every morning and night and basically say I'm okay.

38
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.260
And so they know you're okay. If you don't do that, then they'll come.

39
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:56.730
Probably see if you're alive still.

40
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.570
<v 0>Oh, wow. Wow. And so what are they?</v>

41
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
I would imagine their show is entirely dependent. Not just on you succeeding,

42
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.380
but documenting everything that.

43
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.400
<v 1>I think that, I mean, they were very clear with us. Like the,</v>

44
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.740
you guys have to document everything.

45
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.010
We need eight hours of footage a day minimum, you know, like, wow.

46
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.990
And when you're out there, do.

47
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.220
<v 0>You have a solar charger?</v>

48
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.350
<v 1>No. No. So, but you know, it probably,</v>

49
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:26.610
wasn't a lot of sun up there that time of year, but that big battery block.

50
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.950
And then you got a lot of little packs battery packs,

51
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.610
and it's kind of what restricts, where you're, you know,

52
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.960
where you live is that you have a hundred pounds of gear. So.

53
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.490
<v 0>So when you're swinging an ax at this Wolverine, you've got all that on film.</v>

54
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.653
Yeah. It's.

55
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.300
<v 1>Yeah. Well, you can see me. It's like, I I'd like, cause I heard him comment.</v>

56
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:51.660
I heard him come in and cause my, my cans were a long ways away, you know,

57
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.880
a ways away. And it's like clinic. Like I was like, oh Jesus.

58
00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:58.770
I just ran out with my tripod and my camera set it on God. Cause he had a trail.

59
00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:01.720
So I generally where he'd be coming. So I just set my camera up,

60
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.960
put it in that direction and that's kind of where it came. So.

61
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.250
<v 0>It'd be a giant distraction. Yeah. That would make it. So, cause I know.</v>

62
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.560
<v 1>I missed the first moose because of,</v>

63
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.070
because there was a different moose that I had shot at that I totally missed,

64
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.270
but a big, giant dinosaur of a moose.

65
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.310
It was so cool to see. But uh,

66
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.510
I grabbed my bow and arrow and my camera and ran out there, set the camera up,

67
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.340
took my shot. And I was like, oh, I didn't grab my quiver. And so my first shot,

68
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:34.570
I misjudged the distance and drop the arrow between his legs. I was like, oh no,

69
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:36.760
I only grabbed water because I grabbed my stupid camera.

70
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.920
<v 0>Did he run when the arrow came near?</v>

71
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.210
<v 1>No, I like dropped between his legs. He looked around.</v>

72
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:47.110
I totally would've had time for another shot. It was a real kick in the pants.

73
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:52.090
So then I kind of took off trotted off and I was just like,

74
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.690
man.

75
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.460
<v 0>Did he know you were there? Was he aware of you?</v>

76
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.510
<v 1>Not too aware, like guys took a shot. He like heard it knew something was up.</v>

77
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.430
What had happened is I had set again,

78
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:03.910
like those cans up as a warning system and I heard him like in the morning hit

79
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:07.450
the cans and I figured that would just warn me.

80
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.250
What if something hit the cans,

81
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:11.560
it would wake me up and I could go out and try to hunt it.

82
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.930
What actually happened is he went through the cans,

83
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:18.520
scared himself and ran like perfectly in my direction and turned around and

84
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:21.640
looked at the cans, like broadside to me,

85
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.360
like I came out and it was just a perfect shot, but it was 40.

86
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.730
I paced it off afterwards 43 yards.

87
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.120
And he was such a big animal that I thought he was closer.

88
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.970
So I put them at like 30 yards guessing, you know,

89
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.630
and I missed my first and only shots. I was.

90
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.030
<v 0>Like, ah, did you call them in?</v>

91
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.530
<v 1>Yeah, I've been calling moose like every day. I would just pick berries.</v>

92
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.160
Call moose. Yeah. Good one.

93
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.830
Yeah. That's very good. I think they'd come get it.

94
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.400
<v 0>Your lungs. I learned that from my friend Mike Hockridge. Yeah. Um,</v>

95
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.780
now when you, when you're doing that, you're, you're waiting a long time. Right?

96
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.390
You're calling them and then you just shut.

97
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.670
<v 1>Literally. It was like, I'd find a good Berry patch,</v>

98
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.410
just sit there and eat berries and call and eat berries and call and uh,

99
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.090
yeah. And that's all I would do.

100
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:17.920
And honest and I think both the bull moose that I saw came

101
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.800
into that calling because it would always, but it would take them a long time.

102
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.100
So I'd like call all evening and then they would usually come in in the morning,

103
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:27.250
which was interesting. So it's not like they, they come from mine, but yeah,

104
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:28.960
they must've come from a long ways away.

105
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.110
They come like huffing and puffing all in the rough and stuff like that.

106
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.390
So cool. I can just hear him going.

107
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.300
<v 0>Yeah. They're so vocal. Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.321
<v 1>And it's nice.</v>

109
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:41.890
You can mimic their voice with your voice and the nice thing about moose. Yeah.

110
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.570
<v 0>Right. It's not like an elk you tube. Yeah. You can actually make the horny.</v>

111
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.690
<v 1>It always got to get.</v>

112
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.160
<v 0>Into it. And so will you in the, was it in the rut? Yeah. All lucky. So</v>

113
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.320
sign for them.

114
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 1>They want to give you a chance of getting something.</v>

115
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 0>Yeah. Now you shot that moose.</v>

116
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.920
How did the other people survive and how many people made it until?

117
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.360
<v 1>Well, just through toughness, you know, like just starving out, like dude,</v>

118
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.040
you know that you were pointing out. Yes.

119
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.150
Just catching a few rabbits here and there. You know, like, uh,

120
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.430
fishing is a big thing, you know? Like, uh, but yeah,

121
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.880
it was, it was nice to have the moves for sure.

122
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.600
I knew I had to, it was like that.

123
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.160
I'm not going to have a chance if it was starving,

124
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.380
I'd have been out of there so fast. Did anybody.

125
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.213
<v 0>Else get a moose?</v>

126
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.690
<v 1>No, I assume someone would, but I mean again with it recurve,</v>

127
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:39.020
it's pretty hard. Plus you haven't ever scouted your territory,

128
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:41.330
so you don't know how things are going? Uh,

129
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.280
because I was so focused on getting one right from the bat,

130
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.770
like right when they drop my helicopter off, it was like,

131
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:53.300
I went out and scouted, like where might moose come in? And no,

132
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.620
you can't take those. But I just,

133
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.160
I would just put my shelter where the wind would always be blowing my,

134
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:02.060
sent out to the sea, you know, out to the, and taking into account,

135
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:06.320
all those little things, you know, like, uh, yeah.

136
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.310
Building my shelter away from where moose might walk by so that I wouldn't blow

137
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:12.260
up a spot, you know, all that kind of stuff.

138
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.440
<v 0>So how did the other people, what did they eat?</v>

139
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.340
<v 1>Yeah, it was, I mean, a lot of.</v>

140
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.900
<v 0>I did them after it was like someone needs a 77 days before they quit.</v>

141
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.250
<v 1>72.</v>

142
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.870
<v 0>Or three, you go an extra.</v>

143
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.230
<v 1>Yeah. Because a storm came in and they couldn't get out there.</v>

144
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.850
Did you know about it? No. I had no idea. Oh, wow. Plugging along. So.

145
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.700
<v 0>Who the made it to 72 days? Uh.</v>

146
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.610
<v 1>It was a girl named [inaudible] and she,</v>

147
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.720
and another guy named Nathan made it, um, you know, this,

148
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.970
his shelter burnt down and I was kind of in for him.

149
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:47.270
Both of them made it right up to 71, 72 days.

150
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.030
<v 0>Shelter burned down. He said I'm not making another one. I mean.</v>

151
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.860
<v 1>It was cold at that point before he tested.</v>

152
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.290
<v 0>Yeah. Look at her, this is her. Uh,</v>

153
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.700
she caught something with her bow game pheasant or something. Oh.

154
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.530
And she said, she's happy. I think.

155
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.390
