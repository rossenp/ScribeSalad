00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Everybody has their own awakening, you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.600
and, and if some people may not have that in this life, you know,

3
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:14.240
they may never, they may never have that, that awakening, but some.

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.680
<v 1>People are burdened by their environment as well. Right.</v>

5
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:19.960
There's too much stress and anxiety and where you can't even say.

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.723
<v 0>And you don't have space.</v>

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.230
And that's why I even give a nod to the psychedelics in that respect. When,

8
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.150
when, if you don't have the ability to have that mental space,

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.430
there is something that can help have you have that, you know,

10
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:37.150
that insight that somebody who was, who was doing all the meditation,

11
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:40.870
because all you really need to do is feel it to understand why you need to do

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.740
yes. And, and that's why I was, I'm lucky that I was able to feel it.

13
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:50.060
So now it's nothing for me to meditate and, and go through all these, you know,

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.060
spiritual practice, because I know that it's something real,

15
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.020
but beforehand I was like, man, that is not real. Like,

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.740
I don't believe that man, like, oh, weird, you feeling energy, huh? Like, I,

17
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.170
I mean, I used to, I used to be one of those guys, but until I,

18
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.010
I went through it, I'm just like, you know, you don't have that understanding.

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.490
<v 1>Well, it's hard to see the result. You kind of have to trust the process.</v>

20
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.370
It's hard to see the result before you've experienced it.

21
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.050
You kind of have to trust the process, go through it. Then something for me,

22
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.130
for me, a big one is yoga. I'm,

23
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.120
I'm a big belief ever in yoga and not just for physical reasons,

24
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.480
for mental reasons. It helps me tremendously. And when I don't do it,

25
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm good. I'm good. Like legitimately I should do yoga twice a week,

26
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.560
cuz I'm really only good for about three days after yoga class.

27
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.400
Like I need to, to just really balance out if I was doing it three times a week,

28
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.190
the is not a thing in the world looking with me. Yeah. Inter mentally,

29
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.390
I'd be like, I'm fine. Be fine. See, I.

30
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.350
<v 0>I I've done. I've done the,</v>

31
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.670
the Biram yoga mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that was just so hot. I really couldn't.

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.270
I really couldn't focus. That's the key though. I know,

33
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:59.470
but that's that's but I wasn't, I wasn't where I am right now. Do it now.

34
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.790
So tell me, so tell me like, like when you, you go to Beram, you.

35
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.340
<v 1>Do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, my, my place is not affiliated with beaker anymore. Okay.</v>

36
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:11.660
Because he's uh, yeah. Got arrested for some scumbag he's he's,

37
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.420
&lt;laugh&gt; he's actually been arrested and I don't think he could come to America.

38
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.580
I think that's the thing. I think he's gotta like staying hiding, um,

39
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.850
that the thing about it at that guru life, that's the problem that it problem.

40
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.010
It really is a problem.

41
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.170
When any one person has that much influence over so many people,

42
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:32.210
particularly a male, having so much influence over females that worship him,

43
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.010
especially if you're a scumbag. And uh, he,

44
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.610
this is a thing about this.

45
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.730
He did not invent those postures and he didn't even invent that sequence.

46
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.640
He brought it to America and he popularized doing it in, in, in very hot rooms.

47
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.400
Uh, the benefits though, forget him,

48
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.320
take him outta the equation because there's so many people that practice it and

49
00:02:53.321 --> 00:02:55.920
they've had incredible benefits from it. It's,

50
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.240
it's really unfortunate that it's connected to this very controversial

51
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:04.760
individual because then people associate Biram yoga with this guy. That's been,

52
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.750
you know, uh,

53
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.280
accused of multiple sexual assaults and rapes and all these different things.

54
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.560
But you take that away from him as a human being and the people that practice

55
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.560
it, what they get from it. First of all,

56
00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:19.430
you know exactly what you're gonna do every day.

57
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:22.230
There's 26 postures and two breathing exercises,

58
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.270
one breathing exercise in the beginning, 26 postures,

59
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.630
one breathing exercise at the end. It's 90 minutes.

60
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.430
It's 90 minutes at 105 degrees and it's brutal.

61
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.910
And I did it right before I got here. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I do it. Uh,

62
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.990
I like to do it in the mornings. First thing in the morning,

63
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.230
I do it before I've eaten anything.

64
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.100
I go through a 90 minute yoga class or really like doing it that way.

65
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.620
And then at the end of the day, I have a couple different places that I do it.

66
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.620
I like to mix it up, but that hot yoga for me is the way to go.

67
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.700
Because first of all, it's I know the postures, they all,

68
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:56.220
they all serve a purpose in terms of like helping my body, helping my balance,

69
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.420
keeping my flexibility, strengthening my jaw.

70
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.650
There's so many really positive physical benefits from it. And then two,

71
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.610
the meditation aspect of it,

72
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.810
because no matter what kind of I have going on in my life,

73
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.850
if I just breathe and think about the exercise and then, you know,

74
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:16.530
my brain starts racing and I'll forget what I'm doing and I'll start thinking

75
00:04:16.531 --> 00:04:20.480
about other, but I bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, breathe,

76
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.360
just breathe. You're not going anywhere for 90 minutes.

77
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:25.240
You're locked in this room. Literally the door's locked when the class starts.

78
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.600
Oh wow. So I am just breathing and going through these.

79
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.200
And I know that I can get through it cause I've done it a thousand times before

80
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.280
just breathe and get through it. And there's a cleansing of like all the,

81
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.521
your brain.

82
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:42.510
There's like residual there's residue of like thoughts bouncing around

83
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:43.390
inside your brain. Yeah.

84
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.750
Anxieties and fears and regrets and anger and frustration and all this

85
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.550
that's in your head. That just gets in the way of clear thinking.

86
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.310
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it gets in the way of being able to see things in an

87
00:04:56.311 --> 00:05:00.390
objective beneficial way and to be able to see things the way other people seem

88
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:02.740
as well. Like sometimes I, I, you know,

89
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.340
I have a issue and I think a lot of people do that.

90
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.380
I don't see how other people are seeing things. I see how I see, I see things.

91
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:12.220
Right. And then I go, well, okay, let me, let me look at it from their way.

92
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.380
Let me just abandon. Oh no, no. Well they're wrong. That's wrong.

93
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.660
Abandon all that. And try to look at it from other people's ways.

94
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.490
I feel like what yoga does for me is that loud allows me to be free.

95
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.770
It allows me to clean up all my preconceived notions and clean out all

96
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.490
my misconceptions and just see things, see things for how they are.

97
00:05:31.491 --> 00:05:35.050
And I always feel better. Always see, I gotta try that. That's the best,

98
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.290
especially now that you're on this, uh, vegan diet,

99
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.890
I'm telling you you're on that path anyway, the yoga is,

100
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.720
it's just so good for straighten your head out, man.

101
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I always wanted to try to the Colina yoga.

102
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.840
That's the that's supposed to make you trip. Yeah.

103
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.640
I've had a bunch of friends do it. They say, I, my friend Denny he's,

104
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.960
he's done it and had like se and he's done DMT too. He's like, dude,

105
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.200
it's the same thing. That's what you said. You have full blown visions.

106
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.560
You have full blown psychedelic visions.

107
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.400
<v 0>Yeah. See, that's the thing like it, like when I like, when I do like, uh,</v>

108
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.840
the DMTs, I don't have, like, I don't have, uh, it's weird.

109
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.360
I don't have like those visions, those visions.

110
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.721
<v 1>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:16.830
That's because you're doing five methoxy Dimeo trip to mean the visions come

112
00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:20.870
from N N dime to me. Yeah. Yeah. Totally different thing. I've.

113
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.750
<v 0>Done. I've I've done that.</v>

114
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.270
<v 1>I've done that before that you've done. N N yeah. And you have no visions. Um.</v>

115
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.190
<v 0>No, I, I, I have visions. It's kind of like, uh,</v>

116
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.150
it's just like silly things though. Sometimes. Like I, like,

117
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.790
I I've seen like one time I did it.

118
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:37.780
I've seen like this half, like was like, uh,

119
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.500
I, I, I awaken I'm under place and I'm just with, uh,

120
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.900
these three massive beings, like tall as a building.

121
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.260
And they were like half human and they were half snake. And like,

122
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:53.820
I had a snake from the waist down and had,

123
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.970
and they were a human from the waist up, but had like a snake face. Whoa. Yeah.

124
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.530
And that's, that was one of the, the visions that I had.

125
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.930
What do you think that represented? I don't know,

126
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:07.090
but it was weird because during that experience, it was like, they were all,

127
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.010
like, I was all, three of them were staring at me and I,

128
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.410
and they were looking down and then one of 'em reached for me.

129
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.450
And then I started going up and then I started going around their body.

130
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.880
And then I went around the body. And then as I was going around the body,

131
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:25.160
every once in a while, I would see the face of, of, of it.

132
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.200
And it would like open up like a Cobra and then it would close,

133
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.880
but it wasn't scary. It wasn't terrifying.

134
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.480
And I went all the way up the body and it was like,

135
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.920
I was able to see from another angle,

136
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:42.470
like me up in the body. And, and then it like opened me up, like a,

137
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:46.630
like a, like a, a flower or something like that. It was weird.

138
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.990
And then my trip went like super, super fast. So.

139
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.910
<v 1>You definitely have had visions. Yeah.</v>

140
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.750
<v 0>I just can't can't quite make out like what it, what's it supposed to.</v>

141
00:07:58.750 --> 00:07:59.820
<v 1>Be? You what's this supposed to be?</v>

142
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.260
I had a bunch of giving me the finger the last time, a bunch of, uh,

143
00:08:04.261 --> 00:08:05.220
gestures like court.

144
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.620
<v 0>I haven't seen nothing like that, man. It was ridiculous.</v>

145
00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.500
<v 1>They're about, You all like,</v>

146
00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:13.620
like circling me like infinite numbers of, oh gosh.

147
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:18.300
Basically the feeling that I got was like, oh, I take myself too seriously.

148
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.450
And these gestures were just going, you. Like you don't like that.

149
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:27.650
You don't like when someone goes, you. No. So they were going, you.

150
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.330
And there was like, but they weren't saying the words,

151
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.650
but they were definitely giving me the finger,

152
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.890
but there was like an infinite number of gestures surrounding me going,

153
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.320
like giving me like this vibrating finger. It was, and I was like, oh, but,

154
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:42.640
but it was clear what they were saying like, Hey,

155
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.920
you take yourself too seriously. And then I was like, oh, you're right.

156
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.560
You're right. And wanted to help say you're right. They were like, no, at me,

157
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.640
like mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Oh.

158
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.520
<v 0>Okay. Okay. See, that's what I like. I like to be able to work like that's work.</v>

159
00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:54.960
Yeah. That's work right there. Like you went,

160
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.680
you went and you worked through something.

161
00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.720
<v 1>You know? Yes, yes.</v>

162
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.360
Which I think when you work too hard at something and you're trying to achieve

163
00:09:01.361 --> 00:09:05.520
something like, oftentimes you think very highly of yourself, like,

164
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:08.040
that's you like, I should, you know, my Netflix,

165
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.840
special's gonna be the I'm gonna, this is gonna be the best one I've ever done.

166
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.390
I'm gonna show everybody how good this is. And, and they were like, you.

167
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.550
And I was like, okay, all right. Yeah, you're right. Was like, you're right.

168
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.470
This is silly. That's like, I'm, I'm just alive for a certain amount of time.

169
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.470
And I shouldn't think that way. I mean,

170
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:29.510
I there's part of you that gets trapped in thinking that way,

171
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:30.910
because you're trying to do something,

172
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.750
but you don't have to think that way to do the thing. Right. You know, it's.

173
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.100
<v 0>I, so, so that's the thing like, um, like those visions and being able to, like,</v>

174
00:09:40.101 --> 00:09:43.660
when I did iowaska, I didn't have any visions, man. I didn't have anything.

175
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:48.420
Like I, I had, I had a, I got into a pretty, uh, pretty good space,

176
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.340
but I wasn't like,

177
00:09:50.341 --> 00:09:54.260
I didn't have like the typical teaching lessons everybody else has when they do.

178
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.210
<v 1>Something like that. That seems like you probably it a strong enough.</v>

179
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.370
<v 0>Dose. No, I, well, I did. I did, um,</v>

180
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.890
I did three large, two large cups. The thing is.

181
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.210
<v 1>With that. And I'm speaking just from people talking to me about it.</v>

182
00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:11.250
Cause I've only done the pure DMT. I haven't done the iOS scan. Oh,

183
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:12.011
you haven't done iOS scan.

184
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:16.880
People say that a lot of these people that are making it not make either,

185
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:20.040
they're not making it correctly or they're making a light dose cuz they're

186
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:22.760
worried about gringos going crazy and you know,

187
00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:24.520
and they don't wanna be responsible for that.

188
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.800
So I know people that have gone and they've had these experiences where they've

189
00:10:29.801 --> 00:10:30.521
done it with, uh,

190
00:10:30.521 --> 00:10:34.480
someone in America or someone who's done through a more commercial sort of

191
00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:38.110
organization. And it wasn't really that at strong or profound.

192
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.190
And then they went, did it with someone who was real. Someone was making some,

193
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.070
super high grade, you know, 97 octane. And that's what I need. That's.

194
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.670
<v 0>That's what I need. Cause I feel, I feel like after that I felt like, like,</v>

195
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:55.030
I must be, I must be broke, man. I like, like I, like, I must be, I must be,

196
00:10:55.550 --> 00:11:00.500
I must be broken. Like I can, like, I can't even feel the, the, the I Waka,

197
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.860
but it, it, it, um, it was, it brought like, it didn't,

198
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.020
it didn't give me the experience I, I wanted,

199
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.180
but it gave me the experience that I needed. Mm. You know? And that's,

200
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:13.460
and that's something that I, I got after.

201
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.940
I was like over the disappointment of it and was like, you know what?

202
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.370
I didn't get what on it, but I definitely got what I needed, you know,

203
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:22.330
because whenever you sit in circle and stuff like that,

204
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.610
it's always an amazing cathartic thing where you just kind of just like shed and

205
00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:28.650
just go through those emotions. Mm. Uh,

206
00:11:28.651 --> 00:11:32.770
just watching other people just be so raw with their emotions and just kind of

207
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.730
feeling that, you know, just, just through symbiosis,

208
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:40.760
you kind of like start to feel like the work come through you,

209
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:42.520
you know, that's, that's how I felt anyway.
