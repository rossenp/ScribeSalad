00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.000
when you see Jim's, you know, well,

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:09.120
when you see Jims like mine that have all this equipment,

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:09.954
all these different things,

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.200
do you look at that as like that's excessive or unnecessary? Joel.

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.400
<v 1>That depends. That all depends in the circumstances.</v>

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.520
We're talking about CrossFit generally.

8
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.990
Like we're talking about CrossFit gen CrossFit earlier. I think CrossFit gyms.

9
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.790
I love CrossFit gyms. I mean, they have a few things I think are not necessary,

10
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.630
but not so many, but they have a lot of great stuff,

11
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.070
high pull out bars and platforms and so on and so forth.

12
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:32.390
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; those are essentials.

13
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:34.750
But then beyond that is just whatever you add for yourself.

14
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.550
And without knowing your training needs, uh, your background,

15
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.860
I don't, I can't evaluate your gym. Right.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.020
But I can tell you that most people have too much stuff and that becomes

17
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:52.340
a problem of choices. Mm. So you come in, you have this and this and that.

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.100
So what are you gonna do? Right. You're just confused. What is it called? Uh,

19
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:57.540
the paradox of choice or something.

20
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.740
<v 0>Like that? Yes. Yes. Now what about injuries?</v>

21
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.890
You &lt;affirmative&gt; how often do you get injured from this kind of exercising?

22
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.050
<v 1>I've had a number of Rangers in my life, older contact injuries, like, you know,</v>

23
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.610
fractures and things like that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, they're not from,

24
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.250
they're not from lifting, from lifting things who, old tweaks,

25
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.610
all of them were tweaks. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but, you know,

26
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.330
tearing ligamentss by falling and things like that.

27
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.160
<v 0>No. So you've never had issues with tendenitis or yeah.</v>

28
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.440
<v 1>I've had a little, some of that. Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:31.320
Some of that doing training pullups too heavy and things like that,

30
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:32.070
things happen.

31
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.320
<v 0>What do you do to combat that? That's exactly what I got mine from. Sure. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.920
<v 1>Well, first of all, provided in the absence of medical restrictions,</v>

33
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:42.000
you just worked around things.

34
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.430
You find things to do that work the area without aggravating.

35
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.870
It mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's, that's, you know,

36
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.110
that's kind of the age old prescription for what you want to do. And,

37
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:57.070
but I'm telling you that a lot of things we do are allowing

38
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.750
a lot of people to get back in the game. People have been really injured before,

39
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.900
and I can tell you that the techniques we use are strong first ketable

40
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.180
techniques and some other techniques.

41
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.060
We have supporters amongst top healthcare professionals.

42
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.460
People like professor Stewart McGill, who is, uh,

43
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.620
top spine by meennist in the world and who works with the elite of the elite of

44
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:23.850
athletes. And also the most broken down people. Greg cook,

45
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.130
who's a top physical therapist, people like that.

46
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.130
So we have a very good track record of keeping people healthy.

47
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.690
I like this old expression from George,

48
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.930
the Russian lion Hacken Schmid strength cannot be divorced from health. Mm.

49
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.490
I think that's a great line. That's.

50
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.050
<v 0>A great line. Yeah. That's a great line.</v>

51
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.680
I specifically have something with my biison up tendon.

52
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.440
I think I got it from two things. I got it from training, uh,

53
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:50.840
doing a lot of chin ups, but also from archery cuz in archery,

54
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.960
you're extending mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as you're drawing back at the same time

55
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.520
and this particular muscle gets overworked. Cause.

56
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.960
<v 1>Well have uh, Dr. Mark Chang. I know, you know, doc help doc check you out.</v>

57
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.943
Yeah, yeah.

58
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.640
<v 0>Yeah. I'll talk to him. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, what about your diet?</v>

59
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.560
<v 1>I'm a anatomy of nutrition. I,</v>

60
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:09.600
and the only thing about it I' enemy like my and enemy of nutrition.

61
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.280
<v 0>I hate it.</v>

62
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.160
<v 1>Man. But you mean.</v>

63
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.433
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

64
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.160
<v 1>It's such a confusing thing I'm telling you in training,</v>

65
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.350
it's really kind of funny about training in like I do my thing. You do.

66
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.270
You're saying he does he saying, but we gotta it's cool. Right, right.

67
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.070
In nutritions, like it's the only way. Right. And uh,

68
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.590
there are so many different variables that, uh,

69
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.590
it's very hard to keep track of. And so I,

70
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:37.390
I just feel sorry for people in that field. I really do. It's.

71
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.900
<v 0>It's an awful thing. You have to constant only be reading papers.</v>

72
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.060
You have to constantly be studying and.

73
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.300
<v 1>It's still hopeless. Yes. It's it's just really hopeless. It's such a, you know,</v>

74
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.220
the body is a complex system, but I think this particular,

75
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.900
this particular silo is worse than others. Yeah.

76
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.740
It's just so nonlinear and it's just so difficult to figure this out.

77
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.420
Biological.

78
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.570
<v 0>Variability is so confusing too. With one person that die, it would be optimal.</v>

79
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:01.970
The other person, it would be terrible.

80
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.130
<v 1>You know, I think what we should do is focus.</v>

81
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:06.850
Whether it's in diet or in training,

82
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.170
we should try to focus on things that are more universal. So for example,

83
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.090
in terms of longevity, uh, Dr. Nick lane,

84
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:18.250
who's a miochondrial researcher. He made a very interesting point.

85
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.320
He said right now for longevity, these so many efforts are directed at, um,

86
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.240
the genetic engineering, manipulation, whatever fooling around,

87
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:31.840
trying to make this really, really customized. And he said, you know,

88
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:32.660
what's really interesting.

89
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.200
Why don't we try to focus on something that's been known to work,

90
00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.360
not just for any individual. It works for practic pretty much every species,

91
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.470
which is mitochondrial health.

92
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.550
And he says that if we find a way of extending,

93
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:48.230
the lifes spent 130 years old,

94
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.710
he's pretty sure it's gonna come from mitochondrial health. And, uh,

95
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.670
the stimuli for mitochondrial health are pretty much well known.

96
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.260
Well, there may be some more down the road in now. We do know. So for example,

97
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.420
in terms of nutrition, that's,

98
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.980
that's fasting in terms of exercise,

99
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.820
it is both aerobic,

100
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:17.100
steady state exercise and that type of work for fast fibers that I told you

101
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:20.020
about antiggltic training and, um,

102
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.690
there's cold. So those are the stimuli,

103
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.890
the primary stimuli for the mitochondria. So probably for nutrition,

104
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:32.650
the same thing, they should look for more things that work for everybody.

105
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.450
And then on kind of on the margins, try to fool around with, um, customization.

106
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.130
What.

107
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.130
<v 0>About you personally? What kind of diet do you fall.</v>

108
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.520
<v 1>Back? Some years ago I met a very interesting gen or H meler and he</v>

109
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.600
introduced me to, uh, his so-called warrior diet.

110
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.200
And I was not interested in any kind of a diet, any kind of a body cam changes.

111
00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.080
I'm just not into that kind of thing. But what attracted me is efficiency.

112
00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.560
He said to seed once a day and I thought, sure, I'll try.

113
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.680
And this was long before the current trabunent fasting

114
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.840
craze has begun. So I don't think or' is getting quite the credit he deserves.

115
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.750
So I pretty much just eat, eat a large dinner and don't worry about it.

116
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.910
<v 0>Do you snack at all during the day or anything? Nothing. It kills me, man.</v>

117
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.430
Really? Yeah. And this has always been the case with you. If you snack,

118
00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:24.590
it kills you or as you get older.

119
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.470
<v 1>Just no, since I started this, this way of eating.</v>

120
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.310
<v 0>So your body's acclimated to this one large meal.</v>

121
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.350
<v 1>It did. It did. And I just feel great when I do.</v>

122
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.670
<v 0>That, you gotta eat, slam a lot of calories down in one meal though, right?</v>

123
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.580
Yeah. Like what do you eat? A mostly of course.

124
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.820
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; no chicken. Just send to chicken. Say.</v>

125
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.740
<v 0>No to chicken. Just send no, why what's wrong with chicken? I just lame. I.</v>

126
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.620
<v 1>Don't like it. You don't.</v>

127
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.900
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; what don't you like about the taste or what it stands for?</v>

128
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.340
It's a weak bird. So it is a weak bird. Yeah. Can't even fly. Just, just.

129
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.210
<v 1>Say no, just say noted chicken. Really?</v>

130
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.570
<v 0>Yeah. Wow. What, what about fish?</v>

131
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.850
<v 1>Well, my wife makes me I'll eat it. &lt;laugh&gt; not, not outta choice.</v>

132
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.690
<v 0>But mostly meat. Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.210
<v 1>Yeah. But you understand what I'm telling is just personal choice is not,</v>

134
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:16.090
of course not professional recommendation. I understand.

135
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.320
I understand totally outta my, my wheel house.

136
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.880
<v 0>But what about vegetables?</v>

137
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.520
<v 1>Uh, vegetables, just kind of a necessary evil. You.</v>

138
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.160
I do eat them and what's.

139
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.000
<v 0>Necessary about them.</v>

140
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.080
<v 1>You know, this is an interesting point. Same doc Nick lane</v>

141
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.040
did some research and summarize some other research,

142
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.950
like why our fruit and vegetables good for you.

143
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.750
And the party line is the antioxidantss and they almost

144
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.030
convincingly concluded.

145
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:51.390
That's not the case because if you just try to

146
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.350
isolate antioxidants, just give it to people. They don't have the same effect.

147
00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.140
So the current theory it's quite, you know,

148
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.060
and it's very likely, it's true is, uh, the plant toxins,

149
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:07.940
uh, pretty much promote heroressis,

150
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:10.140
joressis pretty much resistance against stuff.

151
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.580
So it's pretty much mild doses of poison that you take to make yourself

152
00:08:14.581 --> 00:08:17.540
stronger. Mm. So that's most likely what these things are good for.

153
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:20.953
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.490
<v 1>But anytime you hear about antioxidantss this antioxidaccidents that it's,</v>

155
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.010
unless they're prescribed by a doctor to a particular patients, uh,

156
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:35.170
patient antioxidants, supplementation mightment cost cancer. Really?

157
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:36.370
So there's studies in that. Yeah.

158
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:39.770
That's just not something to shotgun or go to the pharmacy, buy all this stuff.

159
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.420
No.

160
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.280
<v 0>You should know exactly what you're taking them for and should be a specific</v>

161
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:44.860
that should.

162
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.480
<v 1>Be, you should gather recommendation prescription from your doctor.</v>

163
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.640
That is correct. Have.

164
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.560
<v 0>You ever, do you know anybody that follows a carnivo diet?</v>

165
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.120
What's a carnivo diet carnivore. Diet's very recent. Within the last few years,

166
00:08:56.121 --> 00:08:59.840
people are eating only animal products. Okay. And the,

167
00:08:59.841 --> 00:09:03.560
the great benefit that some people have had is people with autoimmune issues

168
00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:08.280
like skin conditions, eczema, things, along those lines, it seems to cure it up,

169
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.160
uh, people with, uh, severe arthritis. It's I mean,

170
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.710
by cutting all plant foods completely, uh,

171
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.710
some people with autoimmune issues have found, uh, great results.

172
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.470
Some people have found great results with depression,

173
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.270
but it's extremely controversial. And you know, uh,

174
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.990
it's also ideologically troubling for some people.

175
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.860
Some people don't want you to eat meat at all. So if you're eating only meat,

176
00:09:35.861 --> 00:09:38.060
this is terrible. You're sending a bad message. And.

177
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.740
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; you think that's funny. Okay. Well, it sounds like a fun diet man.</v>

178
00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:47.380
Sounds awesome. You, but I I'm completely unqualified to comment on that, right.

179
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:47.740
Yeah.

180
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.420
<v 0>But would you be interested in trying it, would I be.</v>

181
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.940
<v 1>Interested in trying it? I, when I see some more research on that,</v>

182
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:58.730
I might not that I'm a, a fan of vegetables or anything. So I'm, you know, I,

183
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.010
I would consider it. Yeah. You say.

184
00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:03.090
<v 0>Vegetables with disdain, you say vegetables, like you understand.</v>

185
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.290
<v 1>It's a necessary evil&lt;laugh&gt; you understand certain things.</v>

186
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:09.530
It's like your foam roller Joe, but I'm not, you know, you just do it. It's not,

187
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.690
you don't enjoy it. That.

188
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:12.130
<v 0>Thing next to you, that Tim Tam,</v>

189
00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:15.610
that's what I use instead of a foam roller that Jack hammer right underneath the

190
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:19.680
tribe pod. Okay. That's uh, that was invented by, uh,

191
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:23.520
MMA coach ferraa hobby. Okay. And, uh, cool. More effective.

192
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.120
So that's better than vegetables. Oh, quick too. Veget. Better than vegetables.

193
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.240
I don't know. Better than foam rower. I think so. But,

194
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.560
but that's what I'm saying. Like for a guy like you,

195
00:10:32.561 --> 00:10:36.480
that talks about vegetables with such disdain, I would think that I.

196
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.510
<v 1>It's a necessary evil. You understand?</v>

197
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.550
<v 0>But is, this is the thing I'm.</v>

198
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.270
<v 1>Not based, based on the current, not, well,</v>

199
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.030
the docs will tell you all this stuff about fiber and this and that.

200
00:10:44.031 --> 00:10:45.950
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's supposedly good. And again, that's,

201
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:49.510
that's not my specialty. Right. But this other point about heressis,

202
00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:51.830
which is again, building up your resistance. Yes.

203
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.150
Resilience to things mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it's very possible.

204
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.060
Vegetables are evil and the small, old doses of these evil make us stronger.

205
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.540
Small, small doses.

206
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.380
<v 0>Well little tiny, like a quarter of.</v>

207
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.460
<v 1>Your plate. Yeah. Well, it should be more probably, probably. I dunno. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

208
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.060
<v 0>It's just a funny subject with you. You have a, an interesting relationship.</v>

209
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.660
<v 1>I told you I'm a nanny of nutrition. I hate it. I, I just really hate it. I,</v>

210
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:17.500
I have a sympathy,

211
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.690
deep sympathy for people who are in that line of work.

212
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.490
<v 0>Now, do you supplement with multivitamins or creatin or anything along those.</v>

213
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:25.530
<v 1>Lines? No, I don't.</v>

214
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.250
And you knowreattin is definitely supplementation is not my specialty either,

215
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.650
but I can tell youreattin is one of those supplements that definitely has been

216
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:35.970
tested extensively and while not for everybody, it does work.

217
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:36.731
<v 0>For. Yeah.</v>

218
00:11:36.731 --> 00:11:39.480
So it's also been for a lot of people it' have been proven as a neutropic,

219
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:43.960
which I think is fascinating. So it's very enhances cognitive performance again.

220
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.480
<v 1>Out of my, I don't have cognitive performance, so.</v>

221
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:47.560
<v 0>You don't have any.</v>

222
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.360
<v 1>Cogniti. I don't have performance on not, not my thing. So &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

223
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.080
<v 0>Now what about vitamins? Do you take any vitamins? No, not there's.</v>

224
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.320
<v 1>There is, there is no evidence. And again, if,</v>

225
00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.400
if you would get a prescription from your doc that you're shortening this mm-hmm

226
00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.240
&lt;affirmative&gt; then you should, this is essentially not your wheelhouse.

227
00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:04.080
Absolutely not.

228
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:13.830
<v 2>Okay.</v>
