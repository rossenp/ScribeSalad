00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now people, maybe people don't know,</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.330
but you had been active and you fought up until about what, like two years ago,

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.903
2018. 18. Yep.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.050
So you decided you're done or were you a hundred percent done or were you just

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.800
a hundred percent done? A hundred percent. Tell me, walk me through this call.

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.070
How do you get this call to fight Mike Tyson? Well.

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.990
<v 1>Um, one of his guys was even calls McGee, TILs, McGee. My,</v>

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.590
my partner to tell me to call. So I call Aseem Azeem says, Hey,

9
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.280
Mike wants to come back. He wants to do an exhibition,

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.500
but he wants you to be his dance partner. Me. Yeah. I said, okay,

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.130
well, let's see what we can work out. I see yo,

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.330
we got a lot of different situations going on,

13
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:47.570
but they want to do it in a different format and they want to do it in a way

14
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:51.950
that you and Michael are taken care of and everything is good. Well,

15
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.630
that didn't try to be necessarily what the case was, but me being Roy Jones Jr.

16
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.370
And us being in COVID I'm like, you know what,

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.050
six weeks just right around the corner. He ain't been fighting.

18
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.860
I can get rid of I'm pretty sure I can get a little bit more ready than he can

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.790
because he's been inactive a lot longer than I have. So six weeks,

20
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.080
I know it was Mike texting.

21
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:14.900
He's big as heck and he's still Mike Tyson and he still can punch,

22
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.670
but six weeks is no way he can get prepared for this. So I said, you know what?

23
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.170
I take it. And I jumped on it. Well, lo and behold,

24
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:26.600
something happens and they changed.

25
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.870
<v 0>Now, why did they change it? What was the, did they give a reason?</v>

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.190
They said something about marketing.

27
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.060
<v 1>Something about marketing, but I don't really believe much of what was said.</v>

28
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.100
I mean, I just can't believe it. You know,

29
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:41.180
because we had a September 12th date before football season start. Um,

30
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.800
basketball may have started it, but people at home with nothing to do.

31
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.620
And that's why I was like, you know what? I wanted him when I was in my prime.

32
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.640
So why not take him now? I mean, 12, I mean, six weeks, that's easy.

33
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.850
Um, and they said, well,

34
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:58.850
we got more attention than we expected to get.

35
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:02.540
And this happened and that happened. So we want to move, man.

36
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:07.190
So I was thinking about it and um, Dean Tuma guy,

37
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.640
he posted something about the new date on my site.

38
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.130
And when he did that, they was like, well,

39
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:17.660
that means that you admitted that you agreed to it. I didn't, but okay.

40
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.580
That's how it goes. I'll be that guy, you know, I don't back out of nothing.

41
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.840
They ain't like, I'm scared of Mike Tyson. Cause he's Mike Tyson.

42
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.680
It's just that I know that in six weeks he had no chance to deal with me.

43
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.390
You understand me in 12 weeks? Well, he made it a little bit.

44
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.070
He'll have a better chance to deal with me,

45
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.620
but his chance is still going to be rough,

46
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.040
but it's going to be better than it would have been six weeks, six weeks.

47
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.113
He didn't have it. Okay.

48
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.260
<v 0>Now you get this phone call. You do, you just immediately start training.</v>

49
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.730
And when you immediately start training,

50
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:49.130
how are you ramping up for a fight like that?

51
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.520
<v 1>You know, it's like I heard Mike say something about when he started training.</v>

52
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.750
He was in the bed for a week.

53
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.780
I wouldn't be here for a week because I was going a lot already.

54
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.730
But I was a sewer person for a couple of days. Did.

55
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.590
<v 0>You? I mean, did it feel good to say, oh wow. I got a big fight coming up.</v>

56
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.610
I got a goal. We're back.

57
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.950
<v 1>I was excited. Yeah, because it's Mike Tyson. So it's like in most cases,</v>

58
00:03:10.951 --> 00:03:15.330
you'll say yes, I got a big fight on, on, on, on, on the road coming, you know?

59
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.010
But this time I was like, you know what?

60
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.300
Your buddy getting the little shape because you are going in there with Mike

61
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.450
Tyson. You don't know what, you don't know what Mike Tyson might come in there.

62
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.770
And do you don't know if you got to protect particular ears and Joe,

63
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.120
you don't know what he might do.

64
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.050
So what you better do is get in shape and be prepared for whatever Mike,

65
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.130
whichever Mike shows up.

66
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.470
<v 0>Yeah. When I read that it was going to be an exhibition.</v>

67
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:41.700
They weren't going to try and knock each other's out. I went the out. I mean.

68
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.730
<v 1>You think about it. Oh, it's an exhibition, but we got whoever asks gloves,</v>

69
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.650
but it's extra bits and exhibition, no head gear, exhibition judges.

70
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.200
I.

71
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.890
<v 2>Mean, it's still Mike Tyson and.</v>

72
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.903
<v 1>Exhibition.</v>

73
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.890
Mike Tyson who knocked Corey Sanders down in the first round of an exhibition

74
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.080
back in 2004. Correct. So what is your definition of an exhibition?

75
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.220
Because going to ring with Mike Tyson has nothing. Exhibition is about.

76
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.850
<v 0>He doesn't have that in him. When you watch him spar his.</v>

77
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.940
<v 1>Smartphone, nothing exhibition ish.</v>

78
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.760
<v 0>About it. Okay. Yeah. There were fights. Sparring was fights.</v>

79
00:04:17.761 --> 00:04:20.160
Everything he does is a fight. Yeah. He's.

80
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.950
Now you said that he was always kind of on your radar,

81
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.710
even back when you were the heavyweight champion, you beat John Ruiz.

82
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.791
<v 1>On the other person.</v>

83
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:29.970
I would have fought as a heavyweight really because he was the youngest

84
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:31.950
heavyweight champion ever. And to be honest,

85
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.600
I probably was the lightest who I started lighter than anybody that only junior

86
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:40.380
middleweight to ever go win the heavyweight title. So was smallest guy.

87
00:04:40.381 --> 00:04:41.190
They would come up and win the.

88
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.300
<v 0>Heavyweight title. How much did you weigh when you fought? Ruiz are 200. 200.</v>

89
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:46.134
Wow.

90
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.310
And so did you think when you were getting ready to fight,

91
00:04:50.311 --> 00:04:51.570
like what do you walk around that right now?

92
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.350
<v 1>Now maybe didn't I was then really? Yeah. Now I walk around like two 20,</v>

93
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.220
sometimes.

94
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.110
<v 0>Two 20. I've been up to two to one. So do you feel good at two 20 or do you do,</v>

95
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:02.310
would you like to be lighter?

96
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.910
<v 1>I'm at about two 10 now this is where I want to be it right there.</v>

97
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.180
Hands passes ever. Still a lot of mobility,

98
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.810
not too much weight on these knees. So I feel pretty good at two 10.

99
00:05:12.811 --> 00:05:14.100
So I think I'm gonna stay around this area.

100
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 0>Yeah. That's not much different than him because when he was in his prime,</v>

101
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:20.670
he was about two 15. I mean, he was a light heavyweight, you know,

102
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:23.820
for a lighter rather heavyweight explosive.

103
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 2>Yeah. Super explosive.</v>

104
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.130
<v 1>Hemingway. So it's like size and it doesn't really matter what Mike, I mean,</v>

105
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.630
it mattered with Reese because I knew I was going to push a little bit in the

106
00:05:33.631 --> 00:05:35.850
hole where Mike sides don't really matter.

107
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.980
<v 0>Now, when you decided to go up and fight Ruiz for the heavyweight title,</v>

108
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:44.520
did you think that was one and done or did you think once I win that title,

109
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:46.170
may belt defended a few times? Like,

110
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.140
what was your thoughts getting ready for that fight? So.

111
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.040
<v 1>As you know, me, I'm a man of my word. I try to be. And I said,</v>

112
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.100
I wanted to go do what Bob Fitzsimmons did,

113
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.020
but I was going to a little bit to it because I was also super middleweight

114
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:02.300
champion, which was a division that wasn't around.

115
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.190
When Bob Fitzsimmons did this in 1896, we were about this similar did,

116
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:10.280
was he wanted the middleweight title, the light hit with title,

117
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.930
the heavyweight title. And then he recaptured the light heavyweight title.

118
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.900
That's a big segment of the whole thing,

119
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.240
recapturing the light heavyweight title.

120
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.070
So if I go up and do what I did when they have a title and don't recapture the

121
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:29.360
light heavyweight title, I can't look you in my, in your eyes and say,

122
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.440
I deal with Bob Fitzsimmons because I did, I did a part of what he did.

123
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.560
But the hardest part is to come back from heavyweight, every capture,

124
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:39.590
that light heavyweight title. That's why I came back and did it.

125
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.530
But before I departed the heavyweight division,

126
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.460
I would have fought Mike Tyson because of where I told you earlier,

127
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.880
he was the youngest heavyweight champ of all times to me,

128
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:53.900
he was one of the most explosive entertaining guys you want to see because you

129
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:54.950
never know what he going to do.

130
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.480
And it's the same reason I'm going in with him right now because he's explosive

131
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.900
entertaining. And you never know what he's gonna.

132
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.750
<v 0>Do. I mean, both of you were in that NAS song, you know that song. Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.770
Mike Tyson is Roy Jones and that's a lie. Yeah. I mean,

134
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.370
they're very similar in that regard that you both were so dominant over your

135
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:18.820
divisions when you were in your prime, that those fights were like executions,

136
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.490
of course. Why didn't that fight take place back then?

137
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.460
<v 1>Because nobody ever saw me coming to heavyweight back then.</v>

138
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.790
And by the time I did it, he was already on his way out of boxing.

139
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.810
He already had the part. So people say, um,

140
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.540
I think they say someone told them that I was awful for,

141
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:37.810
to me in a fight with my tests and knew I wasn't. If I was over for me,

142
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.860
we'd been fighting. I mean, I tell people today, like they always talk about,

143
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.650
know what's going on with the zone and all these fighters. Listen, man,

144
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.230
if I was in today's time and I was Roy Jones saying

145
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.180
original as I am, if they told me Roy,

146
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.930
we will pay you 20 million per fight for five fights,

147
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.690
we get to pick the opponents. I said, matter of fact,

148
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.240
don't even worry about picking up on it. Y'all call me,

149
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.730
tell me what did I'm fighting? What? Wait, I'm fighting it.

150
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:04.750
And I don't care who it is.

151
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.120
Just tell me when I'm fight and what would I need to be? I believe it.

152
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.180
You understand me? That's who I am. So it was like, when they talk about,

153
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.480
I would've fought, I know if they would offer me for, to me in a fight,

154
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:17.470
if Mike would have just said, yeah,

155
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:18.760
I would have fought them for whatever we fought for.

156
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.200
That's how bad I wanted to fight him back.

157
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.990
<v 0>Then. It's people love to talk though. They just say lot of stupid.</v>

158
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.880
That doesn't make sense, but that's just,

159
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.890
that's people need something to talk about.

160
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.730
<v 1>But I'm just saying,</v>

161
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.850
I be wanting to clear it up because I was not offered money to fight Mike back

162
00:08:30.851 --> 00:08:33.220
then. I would have been, if I would have, I would have fought, might make,

163
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.040
then I wanted to fight my he's the only other way I would have fought it.

164
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:37.810
But that's what I was like, no, I'm not giving y'all the opportunity.

165
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:40.870
I'm first of all, I'm a small guy coming up to the heavyweight division. Right.

166
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:42.160
I don't belong up here. Anyway.

167
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.250
I just wanted to do what Bob Fitzsimmons did and prove I could do or see if I

168
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:46.480
could do it called sugar.

169
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:49.690
Ray Robinson tried to go when the light heavyweight title and he passed out.

170
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.973
Yeah. So he didn't win it.

171
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.950
So of course we always want to try or challenge ourselves.

172
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.210
I want to see what the Scott with Rufio cannot win the heavyweight title.

173
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.060
Am I really that good or as good as I think I am,

174
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.790
maybe I am this find out.

175
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.510
