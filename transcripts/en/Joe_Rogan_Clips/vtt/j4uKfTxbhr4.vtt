00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.080
<v 1>You wanna talk about fake meat? Sure. Yeah. A little bit.</v>

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.360
Let's talk about it's covered as much in the film, but it's, I think.

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.800
<v 2>It's important for someone like you that really understands it to talk about it.</v>

5
00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:15.160
So people get, this could be a standalone clip.

6
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.680
<v 1>So just for people who know who, who aren't aware,</v>

7
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:20.440
there are companies like impossible burger and beyond meat that are,

8
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.630
are promoting this idea of fake meat that tastes like meat. And,

9
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.870
but it's made typically from soy. So impossible burgers made ingredients or,

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.430
or GMO soy coconut oil, sunflower oil,

11
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:36.630
natural flavors beyond meat is P protein isolate, uh,

12
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.550
canola oil and refined coconut oil. Um,

13
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.340
so impossible burger is publicly criticized,

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.820
holistic land management or regenerative agriculture, and saying, ah,

15
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.620
it doesn't, it's not really that different. In fact,

16
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:52.700
sometimes the emissions can be even more than feedlot, um, beef,

17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.020
but there was a third party life cycle analysis, full life cycle.

18
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.180
So looked that the whole process, not just methane emissions from cows burping,

19
00:01:01.181 --> 00:01:05.170
but the whole process, um, at white Oak pastures,

20
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:08.850
which is a beef operation, it's a, it's a savory Institute hub.

21
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.330
So they're following this, the regenerative savory Institute practices,

22
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.570
and they found that their beef operation was a net carbon sink. So again,

23
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.410
it actually sequestered carbon from the atmosphere. It was not emitting carbon.

24
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.560
It was, uh, you know, carbon not, not neutral.

25
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:27.160
It was taking carbon out. Can.

26
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.160
<v 2>I pause you for a second? Cause this is something I forgot to bring up earlier.</v>

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.733
One, um,

28
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.720
thing that solves the methane issue with cows is just to add a certain amount

29
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.000
of seaweed to their diet. When you add a certain amount of seaweed to your,

30
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.400
to their diet, apparently it mitigates the methane, the methane issue. I.

31
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.470
<v 1>I don't know about that. Yeah. But I think that see.</v>

32
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.590
<v 2>If we could find that Jamie that's, um, something that was, uh,</v>

33
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:51.510
offered up as a response to, and I don't think it's a large amount of seaweed.

34
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.510
I think it's a fairly small amount of seaweed and percentage to the overall

35
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:55.190
diet.

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.390
<v 1>I think the amazing thing about the regenerative,</v>

37
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.030
the livestock or holistically manage beef though,

38
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:04.380
is it can actually restore grasslands. Yes, it can,

39
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.620
can restore the soil and improve the soil.

40
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:10.340
So you're not only producing this amazing nutrient dense bioavailable food

41
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:10.960
source.

42
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.660
You're actually improving the soil and helping to reverse this really dramatic

43
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.540
threatening problem that we're facing of soil erosion.

44
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.340
<v 2>Seaweed could help make cows burp less methane and cut their carbon foot hoof</v>

45
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.010
LOL diet supplemented with red algae could lessen the huge amounts of greenhouse

46
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.650
gases emitted by cows and cheap. If we can just figure out how to grow enough.

47
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.290
So, right. I guess that's.

48
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.170
<v 1>The issue. Then you have to wonder where those, how that, you know, what,</v>

49
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:39.770
what kind of energy is being used. So, so back to this, so this,

50
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.330
this life cycle analysis that white Oak pastures showed that, uh,

51
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.600
this holistically managed beef actually removes carbon from the atmosphere.

52
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.600
Now this was the same company that performed a lifecycle analysis for impossible

53
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.720
burger at, on their fake meat.

54
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.800
And what they found in that analysis was that the fake meat was, um, less,

55
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.720
you know, of a greenhouse gas emitter than, uh, feed lot beef,

56
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.880
but it was still actually an emitter.

57
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.200
Whereas the holistically managed beef was taking carbon out of the atmosphere.

58
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.880
It was the same company. So, you know, if we're gonna take,

59
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.270
give them credit for the, an analysis they did for impossible burger,

60
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.550
we have to give them credit for the analysis that they did for white Oak

61
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.550
pastures. Um, the other thing with impossible burgers.

62
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.750
So the primary ingredient is called soy leg hemoglobin or S SLH.

63
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.870
So this is a bioengineered protein additive that adds meat like taste and

64
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:40.420
color. It does not meet the basic FDA,

65
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:43.860
generally recognized as safe, the grass designation,

66
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:45.980
because it's not a food or even a food ingredient.

67
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.900
And there's a document that you can get.

68
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.500
I think it came with the freedom of information act. Uh, it's online.

69
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.540
I have the reference in my show notes and in the discussion in this document

70
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.930
with the FDA and possible foods and ended it up to a quarter of its team

71
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:04.770
ingredient was composed of 46, unexpected additional proteins,

72
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.090
some of which are unidentified and none of which were assessed for safety in a

73
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:12.770
dossier, impossible Berg put the product on the market,

74
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.570
despite admitting to the FDA privately that they haven't done adequate safety

75
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:19.450
testing. And according to these documents,

76
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.840
FDA believes that the arguments presented individually and collectively do not

77
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:29.360
establish the safety of S SLH soy leg hemoglobin for consumption,

78
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.120
nor do they point to a general recognition of safety.

79
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.840
<v 2>So they don't know what the it does.</v>

80
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.640
<v 1>What's in it, but it, but doesn't mean it's bad. Doesn't mean it's bad.</v>

81
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.360
Just haven't done adequate safety testing to,

82
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.870
in the opinion of the FDA to release this as a food product.

83
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.110
<v 2>The company that did the tests on this, uh,</v>

84
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:50.030
impossible burger versus the regenerative view, what is that company.

85
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.110
<v 1>Again? Qantas international. And.</v>

86
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.990
<v 2>So is the one, they're the ones who released the information for both studies.</v>

87
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.590
<v 1>Both Stu it was the same company that did it for impossible burger.</v>

88
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.980
And then they turned around and, and did it white Oak pastures,

89
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:04.260
and they found impossible. Burger is still emitting carbon,

90
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.260
whereas white Oak pastures is taking it out. Yeah, I think.

91
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.220
<v 2>That's, that's a, a very, very critical, um, point to make in.</v>

92
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.420
<v 1>This conversation. And, and there's a great, there was an,</v>

93
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.700
an article criticizing fake meat by this woman, Dana pearls, who's this,

94
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.810
you know, part of an environmental organization called friends of the or earth.

95
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:22.644
And she says,

96
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.010
instead of investing in risky new food technologies that are potential problems,

97
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.250
masquerading as solutions,

98
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.330
shouldn't we be investing in proven beneficial regenerative, agriculture,

99
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.850
and transparent organic food that consumers are actually demanding.

100
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.570
<v 2>The only issue that they would have with this is yes,</v>

101
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.480
but now you're talking about killing animals and we're absolutely more orally

102
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:43.840
and ethically opposed killing animals.

103
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.760
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, we go back now to this,</v>

104
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.760
this 2018 paper that I mentioned earlier that examined the impact of plant

105
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:56.680
agriculture on animal deaths and found 35 to 250 mouth deaths per acre,

106
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.680
mouse deaths, mouse, deaths, deaths of mice &lt;laugh&gt;.

107
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.560
And up to 7.3 billion animals killed every year from plant agriculture.

108
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.800
If you count birds killed by pesticides, fish deaths from fertilizer runoff,

109
00:06:10.801 --> 00:06:15.200
plus reptiles and amphibians poisonings from eating toxic insects from the

110
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:15.761
pesticides.

111
00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:19.790
What's the number &lt;affirmative&gt; 7.3 billion animals killed every year. So in.

112
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.270
<v 2>Agriculture of life,</v>

113
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.310
there's far more life taken by plant agriculture

114
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.790
than there is life taken by animal agriculture, even factory farming.

115
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.950
<v 1>Oh yeah. We're not killing 7.3 billion cows, right? So.</v>

116
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.340
<v 2>The question of is, do we value the larger animals more? Are they.</v>

117
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.140
<v 1>You know, our fish and insects, less significant life forms than mammals?</v>

118
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.700
Our small mammals like root rodents, less valuable than larger ones like cows,

119
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.580
is it better to kill many small animals for foods like grains and legumes,

120
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:58.170
which aren't very nutrient dense and don't meet our nutritional needs than fewer

121
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.250
large animals that are super nutrient dense. I mean,

122
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.650
I'm not claiming to answer these questions,

123
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.810
but I think there are questions that haven't been adequately raised and

124
00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:08.690
addressed in this ethical argument.

125
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.410
<v 2>They haven't even been breached.</v>

126
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.290
And that this is one that people dismiss offhandedly. This is,

127
00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.400
these are lies by meats to justify their, their consumption. Yeah.

128
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.120
But what you're saying is, and you know.

129
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.721
<v 1>And you,</v>

130
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.320
you could make an ethical argument that killing an animal explicitly to eat.

131
00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:29.840
It is ethically different than animals being killed as a sort of

132
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.520
side effect of plant agriculture. I'm not saying that that's valid argument,

133
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.560
but I've, I've heard that.

134
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:37.560
<v 2>Argument. I don't think it's a Val valid argument.</v>

135
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:40.390
Cause once you're aware of it, you're doing it the same. It's like, uh,

136
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.230
the argument that I've had with people when they say that, uh,

137
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.790
I don't kill animals, but I eat meat.

138
00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:49.990
Therefore it's better than what you do because I hunt and I say, no,

139
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.030
you're killing animal with your credit card seems backwards.

140
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:53.630
You're you're killing an animal. Yeah.

141
00:07:53.631 --> 00:07:55.350
You just get hiring someone to do it for you.

142
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.550
You you'll still go to jail for murder. If you hire someone to shoot somebody.

143
00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.700
Right. &lt;affirmative&gt; it's and.

144
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.420
<v 1>You're more disconnected from the whole process.</v>

145
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:05.220
<v 2>Yeah. It's, it's even more bizarre. It's the whole thing is very, very strange.</v>

146
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.340
Um, I think that's very important though, that you listed those, those numbers,

147
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.300
that data cuz that's irrefutable and it's one of those arguments that comes up

148
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:17.180
that they just wanna bury their hand head in the sand about if you're buying

149
00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:18.420
agriculture, unless you have,

150
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.530
unless you have your own organic farm where you are a hundred percent

151
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.610
aware of every single aspect from seed to plucking and cooking.

152
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.850
If you're not, if you're buying from large scale agriculture,

153
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:35.170
you are part of the death machine, right.

154
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.383
<v 1>That's right.</v>

155
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.520
And you're also part of the environmental destruction machine because disease

156
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.120
huge in industrial scale,

157
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:47.000
mono cropping operations are incredibly harmful for the environment. And if,

158
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:50.920
you know, if you, if you, again, like you think of like P protein, you know,

159
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.720
that's an incredibly processed food. Like the amount of, uh,

160
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.160
you know, first of all, just growing peas at the scale,

161
00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:01.960
you're gonna need to have the world's largest P protein company.

162
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.000
And then all of the processing that needs to happen from taking a P to a

163
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.680
isolated protein powder,

164
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.960
which involves fossil fuels and all kinds of industrial processes that is not an

165
00:09:13.961 --> 00:09:17.590
environment environmentally friendly process. So, you know,

166
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.630
is that better for the planet than having cows that are,

167
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.630
you know, being raised on, in, on land that couldn't be used for, um,

168
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.070
growing plants or other crop production and rotating the,

169
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.340
the animals in a way that restores grasslands and improves the health of the

170
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:40.100
soil that actually sequesters and removes carbon from the atmosphere that

171
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.740
again like Dana pearls was saying makes a lot more sense.

172
00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:47.740
It's a proven system than like scaling up industry to make more

173
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.700
powders. Mm.

174
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:50.290
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:55.260
Scaling up industry to make P powder and killing untold numbers of rodents.

176
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.770
<v 1>In the pro or, you know, birds and destroying natural habitats.</v>

177
00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:02.010
Cause if you clear a field for peas, it's not,

178
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.130
doesn't have the normal natural features.

179
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.530
You don't have the habitat for those animals anymore.
