00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How about lean on me? Boom, boom.</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.130
<v 1>Lean song. You know what to tell you?</v>

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330
I use that song as the background theme for my roasting of

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:15.120
Charlemagne the God, yo,

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
I just want to say I have famed solve for this joke. Yo, yo,

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.910
I hate solves some times in

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
life. I pray for him. Cause a slaughter Hill's son.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.170
<v 0>But why do you guys go at it so hard? I don't understand</v>

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.350
you brought it up.

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.840
<v 1>I didn't bring it up. I'll explain it up early.</v>

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.480
But I brought it up about explain it. I'll explain it. Joe,

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.530
Joe, Joe, listen, this was a day of frustration right here. Okay.

13
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.300
I've known this crew for some years, Joe. Angela,

14
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.350
you go back 20 years. DJ envy, go back 15.

15
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:58.290
We used to do hot 97 together. Charlemagne.

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.330
We worked at MTV's guy code together. Right? It's all love. We know each other.

17
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.540
Right. And then I used to go up there up there so much.

18
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:09.270
Cause I work at Caroline's on Broadway, you know? That's what you promoted.

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.780
So I go up there, they started just thinking they want to play pranks on me.

20
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.910
Right? Like, oh, we got a laugh. You know, one prank was um,

21
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.770
when he comes in, no one laughs at his jokes. All right, right.

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.390
This went by look just like this. One of them is like the Joe, when he comes in,

23
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.040
don't laugh at his jokes. Right. So I'd go in and I ain't try to be funny.

24
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.100
I'm just funny. And nobody laughed with anything and I'm like, John,

25
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:39.840
I'm thinking like this. I'm like, I know, I know the fixes on Joe, Joe. I know.

26
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.690
<v 0>He was suspicious, Joe, something.</v>

27
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.610
<v 1>Was wrong. Have you ever seen me in a room and nobody's laughing?</v>

28
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.350
<v 0>I can't tell you that.</v>

29
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.120
<v 1>No. Okay. That's pretty much everywhere I go. I'm just being honest.</v>

30
00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:57.690
So you're funny. I know I'm funny, but not even that, but my energy,

31
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.910
even if I'm not funny, my energy is, is good.

32
00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:02.850
I came in there trying to play it and I'm like, oh,

33
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.910
I'm about to tear everybody up in his room. I'm like, I don't hit women,

34
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.440
but you sh I'm gonna hit you with something. Right. And they like, ah,

35
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.650
we told them not to laugh. And I'm like, okay, little corny joke,

36
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.950
three or four other times I go, do they keep doing these jokes? And I'm like,

37
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:19.770
stop doing the jokes. Like

38
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.310
I know we're friends, whatever.

39
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.510
But at the same time I do have a resume.

40
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.880
I have done stuff. I continue to do stuff as much as they want to play.

41
00:02:32.881 --> 00:02:35.670
This is the reality of it. She feels like it's disrespectful. No,

42
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.500
it's a disrespectful way. Like anything you try to call me. Not funny.

43
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.150
You see me stand up. 6,500 people were ready to sit at musical Charlemagne.

44
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.440
You said out of your voice that Danielle, um,

45
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.770
I went to see radio city, music hall, uh, Chris rock,

46
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.800
Dave Chappelle and Danielle performed that night. He said, I love all of them.

47
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.200
And I had taken away. Now. He said, but Danielle, that night was on.

48
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.650
You saw that. You saw all this.

49
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.410
So you trying to say you corny,

50
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.280
which is the allergic word to a black comedian. You corny like no,

51
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.340
you trying to give the impression that I'm corny or that funny.

52
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.950
It's just a waste of time. And it don't make sense.

53
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.040
So now that we get a little joke stuff off,

54
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.260
now give me a real interview. You know what I mean?

55
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.550
That that's the only thing I say, get me a real interview.

56
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.950
<v 0>Okay. Did you, does he know? You feel like this?</v>

57
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.150
You ever talked to him off the air?

58
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.110
<v 1>Yeah. We talked about it, but what I'm saying is, but this is how petty he is.</v>

59
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.950
He, this is,

60
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.890
this is this reason why he won't stop because he won't stop. Right.

61
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.640
He'll say I've, I've expressed myself to him like this. He said,

62
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.460
that's why I'm like playing with you. You're too sensitive. Right?

63
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.240
So we go back for us like, okay, it. Let's go back.

64
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.800
And like we've had the conversation, but what I realized Joe,

65
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.180
is that it doesn't matter what I say. He's never going to give it, you know,

66
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.200
he's never going to do it.

67
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.390
So what I have to do is continue to destroy him on the level that I need to

68
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:09.130
destroy him in the memes. I'm ruthless.

69
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.800
I've seen them. And people are like, I thought.

70
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.590
<v 0>It was a inside fun joke though. I didn't know. It was so.</v>

71
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.670
<v 1>Serious. No, it's serious. And it's funny. Okay, Joe,</v>

72
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.010
everything is always underlining. Everything is always something underlying.

73
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:26.170
It's like, no, we're cool. But ah, so it's.

74
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.490
<v 0>Never, you never feel comfortable.</v>

75
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.020
<v 1>I liked him and the reason, oh, I like we'll have fun together.</v>

76
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.680
I have said to him,

77
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.020
you know why I said, I know why you think you're a sex symbol and you look good.

78
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.340
I said, because I was in South Carolina this weekend, right? And I say,

79
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:49.030
you are the best looking person in South Carolina. You should feel like a king.

80
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.890
We with each other like that. But also know his radio background.

81
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.290
I'll never take this away from, this is where we differ.

82
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.900
His radio background has coming from South Carolina.

83
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:02.230
You know how this is getting radio break going from market like South Carolina

84
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.740
to New York, New York is the number one radio market period.

85
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.870
You go from that from a PA or intern, whatever entry level position you had.

86
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.730
You go from that and you build and you grind and you a country, you a country.

87
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.200
And you, and now your Charlemagne, the God who works hard. And he says.

88
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.750
<v 0>Cast with Andrew Schultz to what is.</v>

89
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.733
<v 1>That brilliant idiot. But.</v>

90
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.780
<v 0>He does.</v>

91
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.930
<v 1>Very good. He does. I'm a, I'm a person of this. Two of them together. They are.</v>

92
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:32.500
They're great. I'm a person like this, Joe, if you doing it,

93
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.560
I can't hate on that. You're doing it. You do a really good job at it.

94
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:39.730
You you doing late night and all that type of. I respect that.

95
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.740
But stop with the same class. You can't clown me.

96
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.190
You can't clown me. I'm not a, you, you can't clown me.

97
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.000
You giving people asses for Christmas presents.

98
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 0>Giving people. You didn't notice, Joe. No.</v>

99
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.530
<v 1>Joe, you didn't notice. I didn't know. What the are you doing.</v>

100
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.410
<v 0>Man? Just busy doing other stuff. Oh yeah. We went through.</v>

101
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.180
<v 1>This again. Right? I forgot. We went through this with spit the 16 two.</v>

102
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.880
<v 0>I'm sorry. I didn't mean this is different. Like giving them fake.</v>

103
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.680
<v 1>Now you okay. Can I play in this scenario before you see this video? Okay.</v>

104
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.500
Right. And I'm not trying to say anybody's gay,

105
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:23.300
but sometime people are real comfortable.

106
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.640
<v 0>Comfortable, real comfortable. Okay.</v>

107
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.710
<v 1>If Jamie were to come in here like this and be like, oh Joe, good to see you,</v>

108
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:33.620
man. I haven't seen you since hallway. I got a gift for you. You'd be like,

109
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.120
thanks, Jamie. That's nice.

110
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.420
You open a box and he opened that box and you open it.

111
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.270
And then as Jamie gave you this as a gift.

112
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.990
<v 0>Okay, here we go. No, it's open it. Let's see.</v>

113
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.570
What is this?

114
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:50.330
<v 1>This is friends.</v>

115
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.510
<v 0>Is that a rubber? What does that look, Joe?</v>

116
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:01.400
Oh, he made a mold of his. Oh, okay. That's funny. That

117
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.580
was kind of funny by how long fell a little bit, either. As long as.

118
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.230
<v 1>He goes and put his finger in the booty hole.</v>

119
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.290
<v 0>Well, you know, you do what you gotta do and you want to get a loud.</v>

120
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.110
you talking about man. I don't care. Really.

121
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.610
<v 1>Okay. All right. All right. You're comfortable. You would be comfortable. Black,</v>

122
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.080
black. What the? Wait.

123
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.940
<v 0>The road show. So is that,</v>

124
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.720
would you design an exact mold or do you just like give him a picture? I didn't.

125
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.140
<v 1>See Joe.</v>

126
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.840
<v 0>Do that. Here it is. You know that that's.</v>

127
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.110
<v 1>And guess what, Joe, and this is what I try to sell. You really appreciate that.</v>

128
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:44.660
That's white boy humor right there. You love that joke.

129
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.660
<v 0>It's natural to lie to you. It's not my favorite thing.</v>

130
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.720
<v 1>That's your favorite thing, but that's the humor you can respect. That's what,</v>

131
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.210
that's what you're telling me. Like dude, I teabag tubes my whole life there.

132
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.930
<v 0>No, I haven't ever done that. But what they're doing is that's unnecessary,</v>

133
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.850
unnecessary and rude. Okay. And no one likes it like that anyway. Oh.

134
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.600
<v 1>Oh my God. Oh my God. This is the set up.</v>

135
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.090
<v 0>That's the thing with porn stars, man. They,</v>

136
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.560
they get paid to get like molds of their body. And then dude. So you're.

137
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.080
<v 1>Trying to say Charlotte man is a porn star.</v>

138
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.910
<v 0>That's how they make those.</v>

139
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.780
<v 1>Okay, Joe, I don't know how the they made that one,</v>

140
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.630
but don't bring it to my interview and don't keep putting it in my.

141
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.700
<v 0>Is that fair? I know. Just think about this. Why is there a hole dude here?</v>

142
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:36.590
If it's a mold of your, the only reason why there's a hole as they put it there,

143
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.410
they put a place. We can stick something in.

144
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.980
<v 1>I'm making Joe is that that's not what you give your mans. I understand.</v>

145
00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.200
I know. You're going to know how to break it down. The whole in the anal cavity.

146
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.093
I wouldn't do it. And all that.

147
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.940
<v 0>Type of. That's not what I'm.</v>

148
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.710
<v 1>Saying. And then would you be sketchy of a guy and then what.</v>

149
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.530
<v 0>Are they going to fill it up with cream? What is that? They're polishing it.</v>

150
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.680
<v 1>That's DJ envy. He got a family. Joe.</v>

151
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.190
He's got a family job. No, he's got a family and a dope son is like jigs.

152
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.100
Envy's a great father. He's got family there.

153
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.160
<v 0>Go for it. Once you already got the party row on your finger in a rubber.</v>

<v 0>That. So I wouldn't, here's the thing.</v>

158
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.700
I wouldn't want someone to give me that I wouldn't want to be there.

159
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.350
I wouldn't want to have to deal with it when I.

160
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.300
<v 1>Got, I don't want to be around the type of that I don't.</v>

<v 1>No down. Now you're going to understand them. I understand.</v>

163
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:38.400
The point I'm making is that I know that's your thing, the booty stuff,

164
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.300
but a little, you guys have fun, you know like y'all, y'all have fun doing it.

165
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.570
I am not of that place or space. You're not.

166
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.140
<v 0>Into finger and rubber butts. Not all people on camera.</v>

167
00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.800
<v 1>And then they went back and forth son. They went back and forth.</v>

168
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.590
I had to keep doing the corny jokes. And the last time I went up there,

169
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.800
I knew I already knew they was going to do. They're going to try to do a choke.

170
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.780
You know, those horns they take to soccer matches.

171
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.563
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

172
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.920
<v 1>I went to the breakfast club with a bag full of them.</v>

173
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.500
And every time he says I've dragged it like this, Hey Jesus.

174
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.830
I shut him that he couldn't talk. Right. Then I'm shaking it. Like,

175
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.040
I'm like this. I got the, just the free on his freezer, my hand,

176
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:25.050

177
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:28.080

178
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.430
Joe and I got another clip.

179
00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.380
I knew you would like that part more than anything. I clipped up on his.

Then they still want to do the jokes. They still wanna do the jokes.

183
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.810
They ain't like this, Joe. They won't stop Joe. These won't stop, Joe.

They still won't stop. Right. This both stop. I'm telling you, Joe.

185
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.490
So now they're like, oh yeah, your interview is over. We're going to leave guys.

186
00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.410
They get up and leave you there and leave me there. That's a joke.
