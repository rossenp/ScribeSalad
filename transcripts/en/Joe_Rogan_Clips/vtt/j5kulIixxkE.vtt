00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.410
I always said that you look like a dude who they invented in a Marvel comic book

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
to kill the Hulk. I guess what she looked like when you were in your prime man.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.140
<v 1>Yeah. I felt like I probably could have to be like in those days.</v>

5
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.640
<v 0>I mean, God, you were freakishly huge. It was crazy to see. He was like,</v>

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.420
you know, I remember paying attention to bodybuilding from the beginning,

7
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:27.980
like the Franco Colombo and Swartz and anger days to what you guys had

8
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:31.370
become, you know, when you were in your prime, you just redefined everything.

9
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:33.740
Everything was just so extreme.

10
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.930
<v 1>Yeah. We were pretty, pretty, uh, tough back in the old days.</v>

11
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.400
Everything was hard. You know,

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.060
the guy that I was competing against were real good. And, you know,

13
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:47.720
I just came out of nowhere, you know? Cause I, I got in bodybuilding real late,

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.340
you know, where I'm from. We didn't have it.

15
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.580
And I didn't find out about it until I graduated college.

16
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.730
When I went to Texas and started working for the police department.

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.190
How old were you at the time? I was about 24.

18
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.650
So that's when he started bodybuilding. That's when I started,

19
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:04.970
but I had been working out, you know, since I was 12, 13 for sports,

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.080
we now I had, I was on the power lifting team. I did power lifting, uh,

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.923
in high school.

22
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.130
So I was on the piloting team and you know what, I'm from Louisiana,

23
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.620
real small town. Most of the, a lot of the guys are kind of big.

24
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.510
Like me kind of strong, like me, you know, a lot of people don't understand,

25
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:28.200
but strength is something like a national, not a natural gift. You know, you,

26
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.500
you can work on it and get better at it,

27
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.570
but you also have to be gifted a little bit. Yeah.

28
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:40.010
You have to have a nice base and you have to have a little talent, you know,

29
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.580
like this guy, uh, I think I can't remember his name, but uh,

30
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.580
he dead lifted the 1100 pounds. Oh.

31
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.570
<v 0>That uh, game of Thrones guy. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.530
<v 1>Yeah. A mountain. That's a gift, you know, that's talent. Yeah. He's gifted.</v>

33
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:59.000
Everybody can't do that. You know, I, I did 800, you know, for a couple of reps,

34
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:03.500
but uh, I don't think I can do 1100. That's a lot of weight.

35
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.393
That's a lot of weight.

36
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.840
<v 0>He's an enormous human being though. That guy, if that's a Viking right there.</v>

37
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.630
Yeah. You.

38
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.900
<v 1>Got to have,</v>

39
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.900
you have to have a lot of weight to be able to pull a lot of weight like that

40
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:12.734
too.

41
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.050
<v 0>You, in your career,</v>

42
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.380
you were known for lifting large amounts of weight too.

43
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.810
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like I was saying, you know,</v>

44
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.150
I started power lifting when I was in high school, you know,

45
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.180
I had to like the gift of strength, you know,

46
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.080
I was pretty strong in high school, you know, my all throughout my college days.

47
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.200
And uh, you know, it was just something that I,

48
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.070
I think I was kind of born with it a little bit, you know? Cause, uh,

49
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.000
you don't just start lifting heavy weights like that. All of a sudden, you know,

50
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.620
you have to have a, like I said,

51
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.240
you have to have some kind of natural talent for.

52
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.920
<v 0>It. Well,</v>

53
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.110
there are some crazy photos of you during the Mr. Olympia days when you were a

54
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:50.180
police officer, is that you?

55
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.800
<v 1>Yeah, that's that's me in the ninth grade on the left and that's me and went in.</v>

56
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.490
<v 0>The, what happened to your arm and the left. You got a cast on somebody out.</v>

57
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.360
<v 2>I know how to.</v>

58
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 1>Sell for playing football. And uh,</v>

59
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.080
I think I fell on my wrist or something and cracked it or something.

60
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.540
And that's me winning the, uh,

61
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.660
Mr. Universe turning pro in the middle.

62
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.330
And that's me winning the 9 99 Mr. Olympia for right there. Wow.

63
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.730
You were big. Yeah, I was kinda big a little bit.

64
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.920
Well, you know, I got a lot bigger than that. That was my second Olympia.

65
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.300
I only weighed about 2 55. There what's the biggest she ever got. I was 2 95,

66
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.100
my seventh one.

67
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.030
So I put on a little bit more weight as I got on up there. But.

68
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.120
<v 0>Is it one of those things where you just kind of have to keep up with everybody</v>

69
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:47.550
else and everybody just keeps getting bigger and bigger?

70
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.260
<v 1>No, it was that thing when I was trying to distance myself from everybody else.</v>

71
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.920
So I kept getting bigger and bigger, so nobody would catch up with me

72
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.220
and what a lot of people don't understand is you see me big up there like that,

73
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:05.430
but you know, it took a long time for me to get there. You, no,

74
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:06.630
that doesn't happen overnight.

75
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.310
I put on about five pounds of muscle between five and 10 pounds of muscle a

76
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:14.850
year. And that came from all that, you know, that heavy lifting,

77
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.990
a lot of eating, a lot of eating.

78
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.320
<v 0>A standard meal for you. I mean.</v>

79
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.840
<v 1>It wasn't a lot to me, you know, but if, if somebody, you know,</v>

80
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.350
normally try to eat, it probably be a lot. So I eat probably like, uh,

81
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.270
a pound of chicken grill breasts, you know,

82
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:40.050
with a half a cup of rice. That was a normal meal. Yeah.

83
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.740
How many of those did you have a day? I ended know about six meals a day.

84
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.910
You know, it's kind of hard to eat like that, you know?

85
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.080
So I would have to wake up in the middle of the night to eat and go back to

86
00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:55.500
sleep. Really? Yeah. No, no.

87
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.270
<v 0>Debbie annoying. You're tired and sleeping got to wake up to eat.</v>

88
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.170
<v 1>No, you kind of get used to it. Yeah. When you eat like that,</v>

89
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:08.130
you get hungry every three hours. Oh really? Yeah. Every two to three hours.

90
00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:11.670
You're hungry. Cause I'm not, I'm not eating a lot of fat, you know,

91
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.190
it's lean, you know, I'm not eating lots of carbs. So it's just, it's,

92
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.610
it's a little, a little bit of food at a time. For me. It was.

93
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.280
<v 0>And you would get down to how much, what percent body fat.</v>

94
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.780
<v 1>I was 0.3, 3.33. What does.</v>

95
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.990
<v 0>That mean? Is that less than 3%?</v>

96
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.130
<v 1>Less than half a percent less.</v>

97
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.130
<v 0>Oh, 0.3, three. Like what 0.3, three human. Get that low.</v>

98
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.600
<v 1>Uh, I got, I got attributed to my genetics.</v>

99
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.950
<v 0>But it was also like a trickle-down system, like off season.</v>

100
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.200
Say if you like, how many weeks would you,

101
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.640
would it take for you to get ready for Mr. Olympia? 10 to 12. 10 to 12.

102
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.800
So at 12 weeks out,

103
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.640
how much body fat do you think you were carrying around then?

104
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.190
<v 1>Uh, about 3%. So three was at a high.</v>

105
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.080
<v 2>That's the highest? Yeah. Geez.</v>

106
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.230
<v 1>300. I'm 330 pounds at that though. Oh my God. But.</v>

107
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.300
<v 2>You get tired all the time without um,</v>

108
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.110
I'm uh I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm really good and fat.

109
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.230
<v 0>That's good. And fat 3% body fat is good and fat. That's hilarious. Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.080
Jimmy, see if you can pull up a picture of him winning the seventh,

111
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.980
Mr. Olympia title. When he was at his heaviest, I'm going to see.

112
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.070
<v 1>What that looks like. I was pretty big at that one. Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.280
<v 0>You were big, man. I remember looking at the magazines,</v>

114
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.020
like shaking my head today. I would say, oh, that's photo-shopped yeah,

115
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.230
I didn't have Photoshop back.

116
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.600
<v 1>Then. No, they didn't have it back there back then. You know,</v>

117
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.350
I was a little bit too big for that when they had me to come down a little bit

118
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:51.730
for the next one. Oh really? But I came down to like 2 75. So.

119
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.100
<v 0>When you said they coaches your.</v>

120
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.160
<v 1>Who judges, the judges.</v>

121
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.840
<v 0>The judges were telling you you too big. That's when you know he up.</v>

122
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.910
That's when you getting crazy.

123
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.680
When the judges at Mr. Olympia are telling you a guy who's won it

124
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.980
multiple years in a row, in a row, they're telling you,

125
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:15.070
you get into big Ronnie, take it down a notch.

126
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.050
<v 1>Yeah. Cause you know, the guy next to me is only like two 50, you know? So.</v>

127
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:23.470
<v 0>Why were they saying you, you still looked amazing. Like,</v>

128
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:24.820
why were they saying you were too big?

129
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.420
<v 1>Uh, cause I wanted to, it really was too big. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.480
For the standards back then, you know.

131
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.620
<v 0>That. It's really just taste. Right. Like it's they look at it and they decide.</v>

132
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.410
<v 1>Yeah. In a way it's kind of subjective in a way.</v>

133
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.290
<v 0>What year was the it's 1 0 5. Was it on five Ryan?</v>

134
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.670
<v 1>Uh, no, that's the eighth one. Oh fourth number seven.</v>

135
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.090
There we go. Yeah. That's it right there.

136
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.930
Wow. Yeah. God, you were huge.

137
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.420
<v 0>That does look like a guy who comes out of a lab to kill the Hulk.</v>

138
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.310
You know like some evil genius, like the Hulk is working for the Avengers.

139
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:14.700
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

140
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.180
<v 0>So they, they, how do they make that conversation with you?</v>

141
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:20.500
When they say Ronnie you're too big.

142
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.830
<v 1>Just talking to my nutritionist. You know,</v>

143
00:08:22.831 --> 00:08:26.800
I haven't nutritionists did on my diets and all that kind of stuff from me.

144
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.810
So they probably just, you know, told him real nicely.

145
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.060
Yeah. Bring it down a notch.

146
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.590
<v 0>I remember there's a photo of you when you were still on the police force and</v>

147
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:39.430
you were also,

148
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.800
I don't know if you were Mr. Olympian when you were on the police force,

149
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.250
when you wait time and then you eventually left the forest,

150
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.110
you were so big.

151
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.710
You're sitting there with the uniform on I'm like there is no way that's a

152
00:08:50.711 --> 00:08:51.790
regular uniform.

153
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.590
<v 1>No, it's not. No, it's not a union.</v>

154
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:56.700
<v 2>No shorts. That can't be real.</v>

155
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.790
<v 0>Did you, did you arrest people with those shorts on? Nah,</v>

156
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:00.990
I made those shorts myself.

157
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.290
<v 1>Well we did wear shorts though. We did have shorts police department.</v>

158
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.030
I think you see that picture right there.

159
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.490
I got on shorts and in the briefing room,

160
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.780
but they're not showing my legs right there, right there. Yeah. Yeah.

161
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.880
I have them show us if you, if that,

162
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.490
that picture is actually bigger than that, but you just can't see.

163
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.660
<v 0>Or other guys that you worked with just start lifting too. Yeah, yeah.</v>

164
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.660
<v 2>Pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. We.</v>

165
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.610
<v 1>Had a gym at station. We had about four or five stations.</v>

166
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:39.560
Every station has a gym. We have a training center with a huge gym. Really?

167
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.920
Yeah. I started working out there when I first hired on,

168
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.350
I worked out with me and the chief and some other guys,

169
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.720
we all worked out together there for a while.

170
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.130
And this in the beginning when I first hired on, yeah. Before I got real,

171
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.590
real big, you know, you know, I've had to start small and I was,

172
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.280
yeah. So I was, I was two 15 when I first started.

173
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.450
<v 0>Now, when you first started,</v>

174
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:05.600
did you have this idea that one day and it was this a giant?

175
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.040
<v 1>No, no, no. I, I did it cause the guy gave me a free membership to the gym.</v>

176
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.200
I never had a dream. I just wanted a free membership.

177
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:16.570
Cause I was poor back then.

178
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.690
I couldn't afford the pages for a gym membership because I just hired on and

179
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.720
coming from Domino's pizza. Well, you know,

180
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:26.220
I had to eat pizza every day to survive.

181
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.400
I survived because I didn't make that much money.

182
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.570
By the time I got to the police department and I was still struggling and trying

183
00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:35.960
to get back on my feet and I couldn't afford a membership still. You know,

184
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.830
when you were 24? Yeah, I was 24. So.

185
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.360
<v 0>You were just a big guy?</v>

186
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.830
<v 1>Yeah. I've been big and muscular my whole entire life.</v>

187
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.390
<v 0>But regular big, not like Mr. Olympia bag. Well.</v>

188
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.670
<v 1>I would say put a picture up there, uh, that somebody took not too long ago.</v>

189
00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.770
Cause I, when I, when I first got into a sport, a bodybuilding, uh,

190
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.460
I was doing security at a Mr. Olympia event.

191
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:09.560
And most of the people in the audience thought that I should be on stage back

192
00:11:09.561 --> 00:11:14.480
then really think so. You know what? They thought that I had 22,

193
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.240
23 inch arms back then I had that, those

194
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.560
20, 22, 20 21, 22 at times in college.

195
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.180
How big were they when you were at your biggest 24? 24?

196
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.800
That's the biggest they got that's like a waste. Yeah.

197
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.460
Yeah. But like, uh, like a runner.

198
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.850
<v 0>Zach bidder. I bet Zach better got a 24. Yeah.</v>

199
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.980
<v 1>Actually my waist was like 29 when I first started. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

200
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.140
<v 0>I remember Holyfield when he was a heavyweight champion worldly.</v>

201
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.160
A 28 inch waist.

202
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.760
<v 1>Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. That's a V right there. Yeah, exactly.</v>

203
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.700
<v 0>Yeah. Crazy. So you started,</v>

204
00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:56.920
so you do this security for the Mr. Olympia event. Anyone? Yeah.

205
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.190
Did that get like the bug in your head? Did you start thinking? No.

206
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.110
<v 1>No, no, no. I never started thinking that</v>

207
00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.510
I wanted the first one in, uh, night 98.

208
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.540
<v 0>So how do you enter it? What, what makes you want to enter something like that?</v>

209
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.320
<v 1>Well, I, like I said, the guy said if you compete,</v>

210
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.360
I give you a free membership to the gym.

211
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.540
So I was just competing for a free membership to the gym.

212
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.160
Cause I worked full-time police department.

213
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.510
I had that job had like a couple of security jobs on the side.

214
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.990
So I didn't really need money from body, but I hadn't, you know,

215
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.670
benefits and everything.

216
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.150
So you wouldn't need money from Bonneville for a free membership.

217
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.350
I was just doing it for free membership.

218
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.730
<v 0>You do it. And obviously people go, this guy has got real potential.</v>

219
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.090
<v 1>I guess they were saying that to themselves. I never heard anybody say that.</v>

220
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.100
<v 0>So what did you do?</v>

221
00:12:47.101 --> 00:12:50.310
Like you just decided to keep going and I just kept going for the free

222
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:50.730
membership.

223
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.920
<v 2>Yeah. I'm not going to give it up.</v>

224
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.330
<v 0>Just was about free memberships at one point in time.</v>

225
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.810
When did it become serious? When I won my first Olympia 98.

226
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:04.350
<v 2>That's when it became, when you find your first Olympia. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

227
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.110
<v 0>Do you know how many Bibles? Right. And I want to jump out of a building.</v>

228
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.590
I'm not, they're going to go right to the top floor and leap out a window.

229
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.260
<v 1>Yeah. Obviously my dream was always to be a professional football player.</v>

230
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:18.720
So I played football, uh,

231
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.290
junior high and high school college and all that kind of stuff.

232
00:13:22.291 --> 00:13:25.710
And when not in drafted, I like, okay,

233
00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:28.470
I got a degree so I can get a good job, you know, uh,

234
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.560
with accounting degree and I graduated with honors and all that kind of stuff.

235
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:35.220
And I figured I'd just being an accountant, make good money there.

236
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.270
So I never had no dreams or aspirations being bodybuilding,

237
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.800
but you never were an accountant? No, I never made it. I never got a job.

238
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.640
So you just got a job at the police department instead? Uh huh. Yeah, exactly.

239
00:13:47.641 --> 00:13:51.600
I tried for about two years to get an accountant job. Yeah. I tried real hard.

240
00:13:51.601 --> 00:13:55.260
I did it a million interviews and uh,

241
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.310
so some of the biggest accounts found in the world in the United States anyway.

242
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.420
And uh, nobody never hired me. So I like two years later. Okay,

243
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:07.980
I'm done this. Ain't meant to be, ain't nothing happening here.

244
00:14:07.981 --> 00:14:08.700
You know,

245
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:13.590
that's two years and I always saw an ad for

246
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:19.410
police officers and when I got the newspaper every weekend and

247
00:14:19.411 --> 00:14:23.730
it was always a big ad, you know? So it, it stood out. So I'm like,

248
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:25.200
Hmm,

249
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.380
they hire and then you don't need experience because all the jobs I went on,

250
00:14:28.381 --> 00:14:32.460
you know, the interviews I went on, they always want you to have experience.

251
00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:36.500
I'm like, well, hi man. You know, you have no experience. Right. So I'm like,

252
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:38.400
I'm like, well just give up on this, you know,

253
00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:42.600
just go get me a job where you don't have to have experience. And like I said,

254
00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:46.440
the police officer ads was the thing that stood out the most. And I'm like,

255
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.680
that's not like a job where I can have a lot of fun. You know?

256
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.000
<v 0>I can't believe that you didn't really get serious until after you won Mr.</v>

257
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:57.860
Olympia. That's that's hard to believe.

258
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.540
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Well, you gotta understand, you know,</v>

259
00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.430
I never had any dreams of being a Mr. NPO.

260
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.400
I never had any dreams of being a bodybuilder. I only did it.

261
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.830
Cause the guy gave me a free membership to the gym.

262
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:17.620
<v 0>Once you started getting going and you won Mr. Olympia and you realized,</v>

263
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.670
wow, um,

264
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.660
I'm the best I got to throw myself into this.

265
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.470
Cause the way you worked out, man, I watched a video of you working out once.

266
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.340
And um,

267
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:33.220
like just the intensity and thinking like this guy is not just doing this guy is

268
00:15:33.221 --> 00:15:37.390
doing this for 12 weeks straight. The intensity that you had in the gym,

269
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:41.260
like you were, there's a certain level, no matter what the sport is,

270
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.980
champions have a certain level of focus and dedication.

271
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.580
And I remember watching that video go, that's what a champion looks like.

272
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:49.600
That's what a champion looks like.

273
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.990
<v 1>Well, you got to also think realized that, you know,</v>

274
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.790
I started working out when I was 12.

275
00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.710
I kind of fell in love with it when I was 13 and it just kind of became a hobby

276
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.150
once I joined the power lifting team. So I enjoy working.

277
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.860
<v 0>Out when you won the first Mr. Olympia, how old were you then? 34. Okay.</v>

278
00:16:08.861 --> 00:16:12.430
So you had a solid eight years of lifting, you know,

279
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.590
this is after you were on the fourth for.

280
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:19.000
<v 1>Awhile. Yeah, exactly. And I had all the way. I already had the base to,</v>

281
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.090
you know, being in high school in the power lifting team.

282
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.040
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
