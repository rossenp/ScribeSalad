1
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 1>I think what you said is dead on that. You gotta go straight.</v>

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.310
He's gotta go straight African American cuz white people are just not, Hey,

3
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.870
and we're live this.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.630
This is what I think we need to recognize the return of Dr. Cosby and uh,

5
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.790
send a shout out to him and all the folks in the barberhop. No, I can.

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.990
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; I'm triggered. I'm triggered. You.</v>

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.020
<v 1>Were saying, uh, before the show,</v>

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.420
like what do you do if you're at a comedy club and bill Cosby walks.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.060
Cause apparently bill Cosby's doing stand up again and like, what do you do?

10
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.890
<v 2>Why isn't he in jail? &lt;laugh&gt; I'm not even trying, like,</v>

11
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.090
I'm not trying to be funny. Why is.

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.770
<v 1>This guy in jail? Well, because the first first trial was,</v>

13
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.240
was it a mistrial? Yeah, they can't do that. It was a mistrial. Um,

14
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:49.120
they couldn't agree, which is hilarious. Like, I mean,

15
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:53.040
how many people have to say that guy drug me and raped me? How many people like,

16
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:56.680
is there some sort of, could you imagine there's like 80 people yeah.

17
00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.760
That are telling the same story yeah.

18
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.880
Of you drugging them and raping them and people like,

19
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.450
so.

20
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.910
<v 2>And look, and here's what I'll say, like make this sucker up to your, you know,</v>

21
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.390
I'm sorry. That's right. I just,

22
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.790
I don't want anything black and a crazy near me right now.

23
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.870
We're talking about bill Cosby. This is this too soon for this.

24
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.870
I guess I just, you know,

25
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.590
and it's interesting that this happened after this weekend was the women's

26
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:19.711
March.

27
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:22.110
And I know like a lot of people wanna roll their eyes and I was getting a lot of

28
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.860
on Instagram for like the women's March you guys have to is exactly the kind of

29
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:30.460
thing that I'm terrified of is that this guy is now not in jail.

30
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.580
And he's just like back to doing standup. Yeah.

31
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:36.460
Because I don't know if we got desensitized or if we just forgot about him or we

32
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:39.500
just got sick of talking about it. Like how, I just don't understand how people.

33
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.420
<v 1>In that he's not coming. I, I think he's, first of all,</v>

34
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:46.890
he has an enormous ego and he's a psychopath. Correct. And I think that he is,

35
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.953
he's just,

36
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.970
he has enough fans and enough people in his community still love him

37
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.370
where he can go places in small places and they accept him. And then he's, he's,

38
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.770
he's advertising it. And what is it on.

39
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.530
<v 2>Twitter page that people that accept him with this?</v>

40
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.040
Is it people who have their own skeletons in the closet and they see him coming

41
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.600
back is like they get redemption in some way or maybe it makes them not be

42
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.920
inencouragable people or is it like a herd mentality or is it just star like,

43
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:17.080
how do you rationalize that in your head? A little bit of.

44
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080
<v 1>Star okay. Little bit of dumb people. The fact.</v>

45
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.160
<v 2>That he's famous eclipse is the fact that he's a psychopathic.</v>

46
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.273
<v 1>Right. But then there's also,</v>

47
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.990
do you remember how it was right after OJ got innocent?

48
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.950
There was a guy and I don't wanna say his name. Cause I respect him.

49
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.910
He's a comic and he went on stage. He saidkertop, he said, no, he's a black guy.

50
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:40.710
He goes, my blackness will not allow me to think that OJ did it. And I,

51
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.150
I was interesting. Yeah. I was like, what did I,

52
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.700
what yeah, the that I just hear. Yeah. Like that is insane. Like, okay,

53
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.740
all black people are innocent.

54
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:52.020
What is a black person comes in and kills your family?

55
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.660
Will your blackness exonerate that person? Yeah. Like how,

56
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.420
how are you gonna handle it then? And I don't know.

57
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.560
<v 2>What the demo, I mean, were, do you know who was in that job?</v>

58
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.920
Was it all black people? I don't know anything about, I don't know. I,

59
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.440
I can't read it. Like, I'm just, I'm sick to my stomach. You you're gonna be.

60
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.080
<v 1>Okay. No, I don't know if it's a, I don't know if it's a black, white,</v>

61
00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:10.240
when rape, rape, rape.

62
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.840
<v 2>It culture on stage performing.</v>

63
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.880
And there's not like a complete Malee of disapproval.

64
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.950
That's really scary to me. &lt;affirmative&gt; it is.

65
00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.390
<v 1>Scary. It's scary. But I think that, uh,</v>

66
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.590
there's a certain amount of people that get overwhelmed by celebrity mm-hmm

67
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.430
&lt;affirmative&gt; that he shows up. Like, I can't believe he's here.

68
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:27.470
They don't wanna say well, like if Charles.

69
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.950
<v 2>Manson goes up at a jazz club, it's like, he's a celebrity,</v>

70
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:32.310
but he's also a Charles.

71
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.230
<v 1>Manson's probably less of a monster. Here's why I'll throw this at you.</v>

72
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.350
He never killed anybody.

73
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.780
Charles Manson actually told people to kill people and they did mm-hmm

74
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.020
&lt;affirmative&gt; and it's terrible that they did it.

75
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:47.620
Like Tex Watson did all the crimes. And um, uh, what was her name? Squeaky from?

76
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.860
She was the one who tried to kill Gerald Ford.

77
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.300
They they're the one who did the crimes. Yeah. He was just this crazy.

78
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.380
Who talked these people into these.

79
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.940
<v 2>Things. He was kind of the puppet master. Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.090
<v 1>But that's what scares me kind of be raped. Who knew knows how many women and.</v>

81
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.810
<v 2>Allegedly it's also. Yeah, allegedly it's also, um, it just,</v>

82
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.530
it scares me and shakes me to my core. You know,

83
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.530
not that a psychopath does psychopathic things,

84
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.170
but the people who permit it and who are permissive. Yeah. And are okay with it.

85
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:15.811
And don't resist,

86
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:17.890
like the fact that a bunch of people in that club are just like, okay,

87
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:18.530
we're good. Okay.

88
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.010
<v 1>We're okay.</v>

89
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.040
But we don't really know what we just know that he was there and we know that

90
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:24.440
he's gonna do another show.

91
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.360
And then he announced that he was gonna do some show at a jazz club.

92
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.760
It's like today I think, is it today? Or tomorrow'm looking right.

93
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.760
<v 2>And is this jazz club? I mean, I don'tunno, who owns it?</v>

94
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:36.520
I don't know enough about it probably today. I dunno.

95
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.520
And I'm like frozen with disgust. It's like,

96
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:39.680
that's the other thing is like it's.

97
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.030
<v 1>Yesterday. Yeah. Oh, so it's already over. Yeah.</v>

98
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.670
As promised he performed at a jazz club today, but this article was yesterday.

99
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.450
Wow.

100
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.950
<v 2>As aspromised like, oh, he's a man of his word. He might be a rapist,</v>

101
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.270
but he does not lie.

102
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.510
<v 1>And he was wearing that hello friend sweater that he always wears what a</v>

103
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.990
nightmare. And he's got that, um, Bobby Brown thing on.

104
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.780
<v 2>I don't know what that is. The microphone I'm trigger. I'm upset.</v>

105
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.620
<v 1>I'm upset the microphone head piece thing. And I mean, I don't.</v>

106
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.220
<v 2>Know. It's just so tricky because it's like,</v>

107
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:10.260
I was getting all these nasty comments on Instagram this.

108
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.820
<v 1>Weekend. Like, but why are you getting nasty comments for what? Well,</v>

109
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:13.140
I think with.

110
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.220
<v 2>What's going on, right.</v>

111
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.020
<v 1>Why, why are they because of.</v>

112
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.380
<v 2>The, I was posting photos from the woman's March,</v>

113
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.300
which was the March was about a lot of things.

114
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.490
And I think just in the last month or so there's been a little bit of eye roll

115
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.650
of like, oh, this is still going on. You know, like there's a lot of,

116
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.690
I think guys and women also who are a little bit exhausted or I had one guy

117
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.890
I talked to a couple weeks ago, a friend of mine who was like,

118
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.010
I'm done with this. &lt;laugh&gt; like, what do you mean you're done with this? Like,

119
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.640
um, we are done with a, uh, sexual predators being, um,

120
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.560
getting in trouble and getting fired and getting cleansed from our society and,

121
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.400
um, possibly, you know, stopping from, um, assaulting people in the future.

122
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.840
And they were just like, oh, just, I feel like this has gotten ridiculous.

123
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.881
You know, there's,

124
00:05:57.881 --> 00:06:01.040
I think a lot of people think it's like a hysteria or it's like women being

125
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.800
dramatic, um, or something like that.

126
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.080
And then something like this happens and I'm like, oh,

127
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.400
are we not being dramatic enough?

128
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.480
Cuz this is crazy that he's just going on stage and performing like as if

129
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.240
everything's just kind of fine again. Well.

130
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.790
<v 1>I think he's a bad example cause I think he's nuts and I don't think it makes</v>

131
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.950
any sense that he's out. I.

132
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.390
<v 2>Think anyone who rapes this 20 people is not, I think all these people are nuts,</v>

133
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.630
I think were more nuts for just being like, okay,

134
00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:23.710
I guess he's doing comedy again.

135
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.190
<v 1>I don't think we are. I think most people like what in the are outrage script.</v>

136
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:29.670
Yeah. I sent it to Tom Segora and that was his,

137
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.670
his immediate reaction was like what he gave like a bunch of years,

138
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.310
I guess I'm thinking.

139
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.260
<v 2>About the people who were in that jazz club and the guy that owns that jazz as</v>

140
00:06:37.261 --> 00:06:38.740
club. you guys.

141
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.140
<v 1>Um, yeah, we don't know. I mean, we don't know who these people are.</v>

142
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:42.880
Here's thing. What.

143
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.340
<v 2>If I'm in a comedy club and bill Cosby gets on stage. Yeah. I'm like,</v>

144
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.660
I gotta hear what the this has to say. Yeah. Like that's what I'm thinking.

145
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.980
I'm not being like awesome bill Cosby's here.

146
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.140
So maybe I should give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they think

147
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:55.340
they're seeing some kind of circus.

148
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.050
<v 1>Show. Well, I don't think I would say anything. I don't think, I mean,</v>

149
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.970
I don't think it helps. Like I don't think I would yell out. You're a rapist.

150
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.370
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't think I would do that,

151
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.370
but I definitely think I would sit there and watch and like study him like

152
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.090
some weird creature. Yeah. Which is what he is.

153
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.250
He's A's an aberration in, in humanity. Like uh, well, first of all,

154
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:19.160
he's an aberration in a couple ways. Right? Right.

155
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.000
He's an outlier in terms of the, the, the pop,

156
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.120
the popularity he reached mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he reached this insane level of

157
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:27.920
popularity and he did it in the sixties and the seventies when the world was a

158
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:31.080
different place. Right. And I really we've talked about this a bunch of times,

159
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:34.000
this podcast, I think a lot of people drug people back then,

160
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.920
I think it was normal. I think that dropping a Mickey and someone's drinks.

161
00:07:37.921 --> 00:07:38.754
I mean, he, it was.

162
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.633
<v 2>Maybe not normal.</v>

163
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.470
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. That's, that's a better way to put it. Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.630
I think a lot of people did it. Yeah. And I think a lot of people,

165
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.350
people still do it. Yeah. Well,

166
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.430
but I think a lot of famous people did it back then. Yeah.

167
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.230
I think they were giving out pills and I don't think,

168
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.710
I think culturally we've evolved way more than we

169
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.260
are aware of. Think.

170
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:02.180
We think of ourselves as being very similar to people from the 1960s.

171
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:04.060
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't think we are interesting. I think,

172
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.700
I think we're way. I think if you go from like 18,

173
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.620
10 to 1870 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I bet people are pretty similar. Interesting.

174
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.090
Yes.

175
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.140
<v 2>Okay. Good point. Yeah.</v>

176
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.460
I think technology is moving so fast and adapting to that and the fact that we

177
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:19.770
have alarm systems, it.

178
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.650
<v 1>Right guys, 1960 to 2018, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; way different. Yeah.</v>

179
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:29.610
way different. What's acceptable. How people think of things. What we've,

180
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.890
what just that's how people,

181
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.690
I think one of the things that's happening and one of the reasons why guys are

182
00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:38.570
eye rolling about the women's March is, is that it's a new thing. And this is,

183
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.280
is overwhelming amount of energy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

184
00:08:41.281 --> 00:08:45.160
that's headed towards this thing. And, but what it represents is years,

185
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.160
decades of frustration,

186
00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:49.960
women that had to work with guys that were grabbing their that's right.

187
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:51.560
And trying to them. And that's.

188
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.280
<v 2>Right. And all hard, the pendulum SW hard, it's like it's snapped fast. And,</v>

189
00:08:55.281 --> 00:08:55.801
and there's also,

190
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.360
we always talk about this and I'm obsessed with the epigenetic imprinting. Yeah.

191
00:08:58.361 --> 00:09:00.800
It's not just us. It's our moms and our grandmothers. Yeah.

192
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.480
Who this happened to and we carry that pain and that yeah. Suffering.

193
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.600
<v 1>With us. Well, I think there's a lot of guys that say, Hey,</v>

194
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.720
I didn't do anything. I shouldn't have to feel this,

195
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.760
but this is the thing these guys saying, like, I'm done with this.

196
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.670
You're not even a part of this. Yeah. Like, how are you done with this? This,

197
00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:15.950
you don't.

198
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.510
<v 2>Have to go there. Why is so how is this inconveiencing you? So like,</v>

199
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:19.750
I don't understand how well, if you'd.

200
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.790
<v 1>Stuck in traffic. Well.</v>

201
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.790
<v 2>I get, yes. Women's traffic&lt;laugh&gt; that's, that's it? I mean,</v>

202
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:26.150
that's exactly right. So it's like a couple, I mean, you're in LA,

203
00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:28.910
you're always sitting in women's March traffic, but I feel that way about the,

204
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.863
it was.

205
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.230
<v 1>Marathon, the marathon.</v>

206
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.270
<v 2>I playely the gay pride parade and the whatever. So it's like,</v>

207
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.260
I'm so sorry are gonna have to like sit in traffic for an extra 20 minutes.

208
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:39.780
Yeah. But like, you know, get your Amazon drone.

209
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.780
Why are you driving on a Saturday? Anyway, I.

210
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.660
<v 1>Get it. I mean, it makes sense if I, I just,</v>

211
00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:47.580
I guess a woman who worked in an office, I'd hate it. I.

212
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.940
<v 2>Guess I just don't understand why this is such a hassle for men.</v>

213
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.820
I don't understand why it's such an, unless you were raping people,

214
00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:59.010
assaulting people, um, hurting people, nothing's being taken away from you.

215
00:09:59.130 --> 00:09:59.131
Right.

216
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:03.090
And I feel like a lot of men think something's being taken away from them and I

217
00:10:03.091 --> 00:10:07.650
don't know what that is. Yeah. You know, and I'm just a little bit confused. Um,

218
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.330
if it's unfollow me, I don't know unfollow.

219
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.170
If it's blowing up your Twitter feed and your Instagram, I just, I,

220
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.960
I can't wrap my head around why this is such an inconvenience for guys.

221
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.393
I Don' think. And whats.

222
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.880
<v 1>Threatening about it. I, I don't think it's that many guys that are saying this.</v>

223
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:24.200
Okay. Most men I think are, are recognizing like that.

224
00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.720
If you look at the stories,

225
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.720
like the Harvey Weinstein one is the worst and most egregious example. Right.

226
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:32.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I mean, he's a guy that did it for decades.

227
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.960
They even enable him. Cos he's pretty bad too. Yeah.

228
00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:39.830
Well Cosby's worse because Cosby was like,

229
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:43.070
Harvey Weinstein was an obvious predator, right. It's like, Hey, don't,

230
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.270
don't go in the chicken coop with the Wolf. And here's something.

231
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.630
<v 2>Interesting. I was also getting about this, about, um, a lot of people are like,</v>

232
00:10:49.631 --> 00:10:52.910
well, if you knew about Harvey, why didn't you say something? And it's just,

233
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.190
it's such a Testament to how, um.

234
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.670
<v 1>Who said, someone said that.</v>

235
00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:00.100
<v 2>To you. Yeah. Like I just got some comments or like, well you knew about Harvey.</v>

236
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.500
Why didn't you say something, you know,

237
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.500
when you knew about it 10 years ago or whatever, what did you know? But I,

238
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.140
I had heard like, oh, he like sleeps with actresses and he like,

239
00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:11.260
makes them them. But I wasn't really in that world. So I knew about it,

240
00:11:11.261 --> 00:11:13.140
but what was I gonna call up the New York times and be like, Hey,

241
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.820
I was on comedy central for 10 minutes. So I have a idea. Right. You know,

242
00:11:16.821 --> 00:11:18.570
like who was gonna, you know, and it's also,

243
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.090
it's like the kind of thing where we didn't even know what we were allowed to

244
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.650
say. And we didn't even know that there was a possibility for change Uh-hmm

245
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.690
&lt;affirmative&gt; or that there was a possibility that anything would be done about

246
00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:31.690
it. Right. Like that's how, um, ingrained in our psyche.

247
00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.730
It was and how we just didn't know there was anything.

248
00:11:33.731 --> 00:11:35.290
We just thought that's how it was. Well, first.

249
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.010
<v 1>Of all, you didn't know him, you didn't work under him. So, uh.</v>

250
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.600
<v 2>He did come to the comedy store once. Oh, I think you were gone.</v>

251
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.280
And this isn't like my Harvey Weinstein story.

252
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:47.520
Like it's not close to how awful most of the women's stories are, but it is,

253
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.680
I think more like, kind of funny. He came to the comedy store and uh, I got,

254
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.800
I went on stage in the main room and then I left and then Tommy called me and he

255
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:58.080
was like, oh, tar Harvey Weinstein came here to see you. Um, he's here.

256
00:11:58.081 --> 00:11:59.760
You need to come back and talk to him. And I was like,

257
00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:03.680
I was like already at the improv or already like whatever. And I was like, I,

258
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.120
I don't wanna go. And then the only reason I did not go back at first,

259
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.720
I was like, him for just like summoning me to come back.

260
00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.550
&lt;laugh&gt; I'm making $22 is the come comedy store. Like I don't, you know, and,

261
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.150
uh, it already took me 40 minutes to get outta the comedy store parking lot.

262
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.430
I can't go back in there. And uh,

263
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.350
I remember literally just being like the lighting in there is bad.

264
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.110
I don't want him to see me. &lt;laugh&gt; the lighting is bad.

265
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.190
Like the lighting on stage is great.

266
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.390
Like he saw me at my best and I really don't wanna go back and like talk to him.

267
00:12:32.391 --> 00:12:35.060
I don't like, know how to do small talk with the producers. I'm not, you know,

268
00:12:35.061 --> 00:12:38.860
me, I'm like a neurotic mess. Like I'm not good at like charming and whatever.

269
00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:39.760
Um.

270
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.140
<v 1>But yeah, that is such a crazy way to think of things insane. Insane.</v>

271
00:12:42.141 --> 00:12:43.500
The lighting in there was perfect. Yeah.

272
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.260
I it's gonna be everything got that's a disaster.

273
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.580
<v 2>I gotta go. Like, he saw me in my best. Like, let me just get the outta here.</v>

274
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.290
But like, I, I didn't know how bad it was. I, you know,

275
00:12:54.291 --> 00:12:55.490
it's like the kind of thing that it's like,

276
00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:56.970
we didn't know what we didn't know touch you. You feel a little.

277
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:58.250
<v 1>Guilty though. Like what you're saying,</v>

278
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.490
what I'm getting is that you've people saying that to you, you feel like, oh,

279
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.050
of course I didn't do it. I didn't do. I'm not, I'm not totally.

280
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.530
<v 2>I think that there's a lot of women that kind of have done nothing wrong,</v>

281
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.210
but were're consumed with guilt and shame, like should men too. Yeah. But I, I,

282
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.440
I'm so glad to hear you say that, cuz I'm just not hearing out of that.

283
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.360
I'm not hearing a lot of empathy and maybe I'm just like zoning in on negative

284
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:18.360
comments or I've.

285
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.800
<v 1>Never had a female employee and I never worked in an office,</v>

286
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.880
but even though you hear all this sexual harassment and, and you go,

287
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.360
did I do anything? Yeah. You gotta, you gotta check.

288
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.760
It seems like everybody did something, but it's like, but.

289
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.280
<v 2>We were the same way. It's like, I mean,</v>

290
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.480
I remember working on a talk show and everyone's like, oh, we'll do,

291
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:38.150
is that count? That's not as bad as rape. Right. Like getting granular about it.

292
00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.030
Right. Like I remember I worked on a, um,

293
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.990
a talk show late night talk show and a guy came up to me, um,

294
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.310
in front of like a couple of the writers and he took his hand and like put it

295
00:13:46.311 --> 00:13:49.910
between my butt cheeks and just went like swiped. And he was like,

296
00:13:49.911 --> 00:13:50.870
its like a credit card machine.

297
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.270
And like everybody started laughing and of course I started laughing cuz I

298
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:58.060
didn't, I, I froze and I was embarrassed. Was he your friend? No,

299
00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.100
he was like my coworker. Mm. Like, you know? Okay.

300
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.300
And it was just kind of a Dick comedy writer and I was like, what do I do?

301
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:07.540
What am I gonna do? I mean, at the time I had no concept that it was offensive.

302
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.020
I was emotionally so no and unconscious in my twenties,

303
00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:11.820
like I didn't even think to do anything about it,

there's all these little tiny things that aren't enough to be assault,

307
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.730
but are too much to be appropriate. And it's just like a gray area.
