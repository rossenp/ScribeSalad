00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.580
<v 0>The.</v>

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.360
<v 1>Joe Rogan experience. Um, but yeah, I,</v>

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.720
I definitely like being in there being active. I train all year round.

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.560
Like I don't really take big breaks unless I like hurt something.

5
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.200
So in most of my fights, I come out injury free. Uh,

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:18.360
if I do have injuries from like a fight camp,

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.710
not from the actual fight that really fortunate. Yeah. No, I'm lucky.

8
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.910
So I want &lt;laugh&gt; I go in, I wanna, uh, you know,

9
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.910
I wanna take advantage of my health because I know it's not gonna last forever.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.550
How old are you now? Um, &lt;laugh&gt; you know? Oh yeah.

11
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.270
20, 26. Yeah. Yeah. That's the magic number? Uh, no,

12
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.820
I'm 34 this year. Yeah. Well, you look great.

13
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.740
<v 0>Thank you. When did you start training?</v>

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.740
<v 1>Um, I, I did my first Mo class when I turned 24. Wow. Yeah. So I called.</v>

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.660
<v 0>In my, uh, maybe that's a thing, right?</v>

16
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.500
Like you don't have the wear and tear of like a lot of people start when they're

17
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:57.020
10 and you know, by the time they get to 24,

18
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:01.060
they already got they're all 10 NCL up and back a mess and neck.

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.970
<v 1>Stunts your growth too a little bit. I don't know. I,</v>

20
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.690
I feel like some something happens.

21
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.850
<v 0>If you cut weight. It certainly does. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.810
<v 1>Yeah. So, yeah, I didn't, I didn't really do any sports after,</v>

23
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.610
I guess, middle school and really from middle school

24
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.000
through high school to college. And then after college, I didn't do.

25
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.880
Like I was didn't do anything. Nah, I was skinny fat, so I didn't have to.

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.000
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; but you didn't work out or nothing? Nah, it didn't work out.</v>

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.240
<v 1>That's crazy. It's weird.</v>

28
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.760
If you see a picture of me from like right after college it's I look like this

29
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.600
little skinny like stick figure,

30
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.840
like just soft girl. It's really weird.

31
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.390
So like when people see me now they're like, holy. Like.

32
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.550
<v 0>Of people from back then. Yeah. Yeah. Well they must be freaking out now.</v>

33
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:53.030
Like she's a what? Yeah, she's in the what? She's a UFC contender. I.

34
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.150
<v 1>Know. Get the outta here. No, Angela funny. Yeah, exactly. Like nobody.</v>

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.030
And that was so different. Well, not different, but I was like super quiet,

36
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.540
like all my life, like in high school, especially college,

37
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.820
like I was always just like really shy and really like soft spoken.

38
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.860
<v 0>That's surprising cuz you're very funny on Twitter. Oh, thank you. On Twitter.</v>

39
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:14.220
You're.

40
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.500
<v 1>Hilarious. Well, it was always funny.</v>

41
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.140
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; you're always funny to just quiet. Nobody knew.</v>

42
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.700
<v 1>It. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; I kept it to myself. I cracked myself up all day, but um,</v>

43
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.290
but yeah, like I'm, I'm just super shy.

44
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.850
Like always awkward around like new people, new settings.

45
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.770
And like I had my tightknit group of friends,

46
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.170
but like I was never like the popular kid by any means. So.

47
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.730
<v 0>What brought you in into Mo Thai class?</v>

48
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 1>Um, a workout you just needed just fat. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.200
I just got married. Um, and I also had an office job.

50
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.320
I was working at an animation studio and uh, before that I had been bartending,

51
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.000
so I was like moving around and doing stuff and I never really felt like

52
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.480
inactive, but once I quit the bar job and was just doing that full time,

53
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.440
I just felt like fat and lazy and greasy. And &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

54
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:08.120
everything that happens from like sitting down all day. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean,

55
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.280
you know, you like, you do all sorts of outside of this just to like, you know,

56
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.320
stay happy. So yeah, right. Yeah. It was really cool. Uh, discovering it.

57
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.990
Like I, I was just around cuz I always wanted to learn how to fight. Um,

58
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.190
but like, uh, boxing intimidated me. I'm like,

59
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:28.190
they're not gonna wanna deal with me. Like, you know, they like,

60
00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:30.510
they deal with me if I came in when I was like 10,

61
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.350
but not now some old &lt;laugh&gt; girl wanna learn how to box.

62
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.950
But then people are telling me like, oh, Mota is like really cool. And I,

63
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.380
I was afraid of getting bulky, you know? And they're like, oh no,

64
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.860
if you do Mo Thai, like you'll still look really natural.

65
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.740
You wanna look like you're on steroids. And I was like, oh, okay.

66
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.620
<v 0>Every comes afraid of that. You're afraid of big shoulders and fake.</v>

67
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.140
<v 1>Arms. Yeah. I mean, no, I don't care. I'm like bring it on,</v>

68
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.820
you know &lt;laugh&gt; but uh,

69
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.940
back then I was like really worried about looking like a ninja turtle.

70
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.770
<v 0>That's so funny cuz it's hard for a girl to look like that without steroids.</v>

71
00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.170
Yeah. You, but you see some girls who go hard. Yeah. Like CrossFit.

72
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.850
<v 1>Girls, half my opponents. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; he's just all trapped up. Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.050
<v 0>There's there's a few, there's a few that you definitely know.</v>

74
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.970
Something happened in the past.

75
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.330
<v 1>Something happened. They, they grew up on a farm. Yeah. That's.</v>

76
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.920
<v 0>The around. Hey around &lt;laugh&gt; so you were 24 years old.</v>

77
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.840
You walk into Moton class. When do you get addicted to it?

78
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.960
<v 1>First class man. First class, first class. Uh, my coach, uh,</v>

79
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.320
well he, my first coach,

80
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:37.480
Brandon Levi does evolution Moton in New York.

81
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.560
<v 0>Uh, so that's.</v>

82
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.680
<v 1>Where you were in New York at the time? Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:42.950
In New York at that's where I went to school and everything. And uh,

84
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:47.790
first class I threw like an elbow and a knee on the type pads and I was like,

85
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.070
oh &lt;laugh&gt;. Cause it feels so hard. Yeah. And like,

86
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.150
I never knew that I could generate that much power with my like little body cuz

87
00:04:56.151 --> 00:05:00.710
I was probably like 115 pounds, like wet soak and wet, you know, at the time.

88
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.420
So I was just like, oh my God, like I feel so powerful.

89
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.540
&lt;laugh&gt; and like ever since then I was just going every day I was going with my

90
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.380
husband. Like we were like getting in shape, learning how to kick and stuff.

91
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.900
And it was just like a lot of stuff. I never thought I'd be able to do.

92
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.940
I was doing it like even just throwing a head kick. Like I,

93
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.370
I didn't like try out for cheerleading because I was inflexible.

94
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.290
You know, I was like, I'm never gonna be able to do this.

95
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.610
I can't do a high kick. I can't do a split or anything like that.

96
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.210
So being able to get my leg up high enough to kick someone the head,

97
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.170
like it was like a huge milestone for me, athletically.

98
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.090
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; I love a story like that where you didn't do from like middle school,</v>

99
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.691
high school.

100
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:44.560
You didn't to your 24 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then all of a sudden you get

101
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:45.720
addicted to it. Yeah.

102
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.640
<v 1>Yeah. It that's crazy. That's always in me man. Good. 10 years.</v>

103
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.000
<v 0>Later. Yeah. You're top contender in the UFC. Yeah. That's.</v>

104
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.000
<v 1>Bananas. It's weird. But like,</v>

105
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.480
it makes sense to me because like anytime I tried to do a sport,

106
00:05:57.481 --> 00:05:58.314
when I was a kid,

107
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.120
I would just lose interest mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I think it was because they

108
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:06.440
were all team sports. Like I was on basketball, team, softball, uh,

109
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.760
bat baseball, whatever. Um,

110
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.000
I ran track for like a few months and all of that stuff. I was just like,

111
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:17.750
this is stupid. Like what's the point? You know? Or that, or, uh, I don't know.

112
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.710
I, I didn't like working with people,

113
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.190
but the one thing I was good at was stealing the ball in basketball.

114
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.990
&lt;laugh&gt; so like I never made any shots. Like I,

115
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.590
I was really bad at like dribbling and everything,

116
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.950
but if someone got the ball and they were next to me,

117
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.870
I'd run over and I'd grab it and just like Rigg until they're just like,

118
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.380
&lt;laugh&gt; like, they would just get mad at me and let go of the ball.

119
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.660
So I'd steal it and then pass it to the girl that could shoot. So, so yeah,

120
00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.620
that was the one thing I was good at that's conflict.

121
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.380
<v 0>Yeah. Maybe, maybe that was like a sign of things to come.</v>

122
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.540
<v 1>Conflict. Exactly. I like that. I like that.</v>

123
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.100
And especially cuz I was so shy outside of that,

124
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:59.170
then it was just kind of like my outlet. So.

125
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.050
<v 0>How long was it between your first class and your first fight? Mm.</v>

126
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.850
<v 1>It was about uh, nine months. Wow. Yeah. So, so right away.</v>

127
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.410
<v 0>You're like balls deep into this thing. Yeah. Without.</v>

128
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.970
<v 1>For lack of better &lt;laugh&gt; what else? Yeah. I'm like what else? Deep. Could I,</v>

129
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.480
yeah. What, what can a girl balls is deep. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, um,

130
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.680
I was, yeah, I was really into it and I hadn't considered fighting yet,

131
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.640
but um, but my coach was like, it was, I think it was around the time.

132
00:07:29.641 --> 00:07:30.960
Have you ever heard of uh,

133
00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.640
the w Ks mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it was around the time of that and he was

134
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.670
taking a couple people down. He was like, Hey, you wanna do WK?

135
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.630
You wanna have a fight? And I was like, oh, are you sure?

136
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:45.630
Like you sure I'm ready? And it was kinda, uh,

137
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:50.550
halfway because, well, I don't know if this is why he asked,

138
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.630
but once I said yes, uh,

139
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:55.990
there was a girl that used to train with us who was also doing it and my weight

140
00:07:55.991 --> 00:08:00.380
class. And he was like, oh, &lt;laugh&gt; this is gonna be fun.

141
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.900
So, um, so yeah,

142
00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.700
I thought it was cool that he had that confidence in me cuz the,

143
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.620
all the other girls who were in the tournament had been training a lot longer

144
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.500
than me, uh, for years even. So, uh, yeah, I was just like, okay,

145
00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:16.220
let's let's do it. Let's see what happens. Like I was scared,

146
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:19.420
but I also wasn't like putting all my eggs in that bad.

147
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.210
Like I didn't think anything was gonna come from doing Mo Thai.

148
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:27.970
It was just fun at the time. Right. So I went and I beat two girls,

149
00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:33.530
won the little, the champ regional championship or whatever. Wow. And uh,

150
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.570
from then on, I was just fighting. They had this show, uh,

151
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.450
in New York called Friday night fights. And um,

152
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.800
I got a few shows on that or a few fights on that. Um,

153
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.520
I went 14 and oh, as an amateur multi fighter.

154
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.360
Then when,

155
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.640
before I went pro I was trying to get an MMA fight just so I had like one or

156
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.920
two amateur MMA fights under my belt. So if I do decide to do it,

157
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.880
I have that experience, but no one would fight me.

158
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.880
So I ended up going pro anyway had two pro multi fights.

159
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.680
And then I had my first pro MMA fight

160
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.550
two days before the tough try outs. Wow.

161
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.550
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; that's so recent. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. What year were you on?</v>

162
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:22.470
Tough. That was that tough.

163
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.550
<v 1>Six years ago. 20. So I think it was 2014. Yeah. Wow.</v>

164
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.510
That's when the tryouts were and I think it aired. Yeah.

165
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:33.070
I think our finale was like that December. Well.

166
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:33.903
<v 0>That makes sense.</v>

167
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.260
Now as to why you've gotten so better with so much better over the last few

168
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:40.740
fights. You're so learning. Yeah. That's.

169
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.940
<v 1>So crazy. Yeah. Yeah. I shouldn't have been in there.</v>
