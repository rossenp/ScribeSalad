00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.760
Someone called me homophobic because I said I had an old tweet.

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:07.440
This is from 2012, right? Yeah.

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.840
They dug up a bunch of tweets about me this week. Okay. Okay.

5
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.880
And one of 'em from 2012 said, call me romantic. But I love it.

6
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:19.800
When I see gay couples that are so comfortable that they can kiss in public.

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.510
<v 1>I saw that. Yes. And someone,</v>

8
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:24.670
but then someone said that you were fetishizing gay people by come on.

9
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.390
<v 0>That's hilarious. That was a, that was a legitimate tweet. I was probably high.</v>

10
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.030
I saw because that's when I feel like warm and fuzzy and I,

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.470
I saw a gay couple make out. I think that was what it was. I mean,

12
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.150
it was eight years ago. It's hard to remember, but.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.060
<v 1>That's quite sweet. So you may as well have end. Like you may as well. You.</v>

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.820
<v 0>Might as well. Like, but I, I was legitimately, you know, you know,</v>

15
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.980
it's, it's weird, man. It's weird. The whole thing is very weird,

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.580
but they could just call you homophobic for that. It's.

17
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.620
<v 1>Just so crazy. Well, that's the other thing we could do is like, is, well,</v>

18
00:00:57.621 --> 00:00:58.740
I hate using the phrase call out,

19
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.460
but how about we start calling out people who misuse those words, right? Yeah.

20
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.770
If, if you're hemophobic you hate gay people. Yeah. It's not,

21
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:06.090
not you don't you like,

22
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.210
you think it's nice that they can kiss openly and publics.

23
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.530
<v 0>So it there's no logic to, but that's the thing it's like,</v>

24
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:13.570
you're arguing with someone who's there,

25
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.090
there it's like the idea that if you leave Islam,

26
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.290
if you, you could be killed. Right. Right.

27
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.840
This is what happens to past state. Yeah. Right? Yeah. That is crazy. Yeah.

28
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.440
Right. Terrify. If you leave, it's so terrifying that someone could kill you,

29
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.280
but that is the same kind of religious thinking.

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.520
Religious CR crazed ideology adherence to the dogma. Yeah.

31
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.950
No matter what that would allow someone to think that I could be homophobic by

32
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:47.430
saying that. I think it's great when gay guys are so comfortable,

33
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:48.264
they kiss in public.

34
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.030
<v 1>Well it's because they know you are in your mind. They, they, they,</v>

35
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.350
they do this incredible mind reading thing. That's what it's all about.

36
00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:56.150
They're all psychics. Did you know that they're all psychics. They.

37
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.710
<v 0>Don't care about reality. They don't care about what's true. Exactly.</v>

38
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.550
There's no need for reality in their world.

39
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.100
If they've decided you're a bigot,

40
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.060
then they can use anything and everything against you,

41
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:10.340
including pro gay tweets. Pro.

42
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.380
<v 1>Yeah. They can use exactly. Let's think about,</v>

43
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.380
they can use a pro gay tweet to prove that you're homophobic. It's amazing.

44
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.060
<v 0>But it's kind of good because it's so crazy that logical</v>

45
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.050
left leaning. People read that and they go, what the they do? And they go,

46
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:29.450
come on man. And you know, it's been positive for me. Yeah.

47
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.570
In a lot of ways that they're so over the top that, you know,

48
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.250
like I've heard gay friends go, did I know your homophobic? I'm like, I didn't.

49
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.410
<v 1>Know either amazing. Now I know, but they know. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.050
Maybe this is why they always turn most severely on people from the left.

51
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.530
Who question this stuff. They really do.

52
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.720
Cause they well expect it from the right. You know? I think.

53
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.000
<v 0>Too. Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.640
Especially if you look like you should be on the right and you're on the left,

55
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:54.680
which I definitely do. Right. You know, it's like, there's there. I mean,

56
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:58.160
you could try to figure it out, but I think it all boils down to adherence,

57
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.000
adherence, strict adherence and compliance to the dogma. And if you don't,

58
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:06.080
if you're not willing to comply 100% with the ideology, they'll attack you.

59
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.360
So do you just like Martin nav.

60
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.000
<v 1>To over, but that's why I think left and right is no longer helpful. I, I think,</v>

61
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.920
I think it's, that's why there are all these weird alliances going on now.

62
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.280
I mean,

63
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.000
I did this event recently with Peter begot who I know you've spoke to and James

64
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.910
Lindsay &lt;affirmative&gt; and we were given these talks at this event in London and

65
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:22.270
we were sitting there at lunch and there was like, um,

66
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.990
the head of the atheist society sitting next to this evangelical Christian

67
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:26.910
pastor from America. And there was like,

68
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:29.990
there were people of no faith and all faith and left and right. And it's like,

69
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.030
but we all believe in Liberty.

70
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.030
Like ultimately we all care about freedom and individual freedom.

71
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.430
And that's the, that's the new fault line it's not left against. Right.

72
00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.700
It's people who believe in,

73
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.380
in Liberty for the individual or people who want more authority to control you.

74
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:44.780
And that's, that's the real conflict.

75
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.300
<v 0>Well, if the right really wanted to bring more people over,</v>

76
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.140
what they would do is establish like

77
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.020
universally across the board, um, an appreciation for gay people,

78
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.290
appreciation for a marriage and appreciation for the need to take

79
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:05.570
impoverished communities and bring them up. Yeah.

80
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.250
And appreciation for welfare and appreciation for, you know,

81
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.570
raising the minimum wage. Yeah. If they just started a few things like that.

82
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.370
Good Lord. The amount of people that would jump off that ship,

83
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.760
that sinking ship of liberal idea. Yeah. Because it's just,

84
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.600
it's infested with rats.

85
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.080
It's infested with rats that are chewing a hole in the very hu of the ship.

86
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.440
<v 1>That happened in the UK was the conservative government that pushed through gay</v>

87
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.840
marriage. Cause actually, cause actually that's quite conservative idea, you.

88
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.720
<v 0>Know, get government outta your life. Yeah. Yeah. It should.</v>

89
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.440
<v 1>Be, well, maybe that's what they, maybe that's what they need to.</v>

90
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.670
I think what definitely, if you, if you support the left,

91
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:45.270
you need to try and dissuade the Democrats and the,

92
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.830
and the labor party from going woke because they alienate all of their major.

93
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:49.270
They do.

94
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.630
<v 0>And they don't even realize they're doing it.</v>

95
00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:53.510
But the problem is in this country, there's no room for a third party. Right.

96
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:55.870
People don't appreciate it or believe in it. No, you don't.

97
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.910
<v 1>Have, you don't have that option. Do you?</v>

98
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.620
<v 0>Maybe they kind of do like Gary Johnson ran last year and some people voted for</v>

99
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:04.780
him, but what's really happened in this country previously, historically,

100
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.500
is that when someone charismatic came along, that's an independent,

101
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:11.260
they really just take votes away from the Democrats. Yeah. So you split the.

102
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.620
<v 1>Vote, right? Yeah. So the Republicans.</v>

103
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 0>Are pretty rigid. Well, actually here's a example against that though,</v>

104
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.140
is Ross Perro.

105
00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:22.290
He actually took votes away from the Republican and that's why Clinton got in

106
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:22.880
office. Right?

107
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.970
Bill Clinton actually won when Herbert Walker Bush was in his first term.

108
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.850
So he only done one term. And then bill Clinton won in, uh, when Herbert Walker,

109
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.130
Bush was going for reelection. And the reason why he run,

110
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.290
he won rather is cuz Ross, Perro, who was this eccentric billionaire.

111
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:39.124
Do you remember him?

112
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.090
<v 1>I know. Sorry. I remember Ross Perro. Yeah. Yeah. He.</v>

113
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.240
<v 0>Was an eccentric billion there. Who independently did. Yes. Independent.</v>

114
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.840
And he got on TV and bought an entire half hour of

115
00:05:48.841 --> 00:05:50.120
primetime television. Right.

116
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.720
To show people how they're getting by the federal reserve and taxes.

117
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:56.600
And he was explaining, I had a pat, Hey, take a look over there.

118
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.560
See this's what he gonna do.

119
00:05:57.561 --> 00:05:59.560
They take it here and they get there and he was doing all this.

120
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720
And everybody's like, what the?

121
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.640
And I remember everybody was all in a wa I voted for him. I I'm pretty sure.

122
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.480
Yeah. It's hard to remember. Were.

123
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.400
<v 1>You worried about so long ago splitting the vote though, or you? No.</v>

124
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.280
<v 0>I was 18. I don't know what the. I don't know how old, well, older than that,</v>

125
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.120
I must have.

126
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.760
<v 1>Been 21, but I'm not right. Think, I mean,</v>

127
00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:19.670
there isn't that much between the Democrats and the publics. Is it? I mean like,

128
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.910
um, there's you don't have a, a real sort of left wing, right? Wing option.

129
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.590
They're pretty similar on a.

130
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.150
<v 0>Lot of things. It depends on who you're talking to. You know, if you,</v>

131
00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:27.631
if there's,

132
00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:32.390
there's a giant difference between Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders,

133
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:35.470
right. There's a giant difference. There's some, a lot of it is,

134
00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.060
people are concerned with, uh, abortion rights. That's a giant one.

135
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.980
And people are concerned with a Republican,

136
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.580
putting someone in the Supreme court that is gonna limit a woman's right to

137
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:47.740
choose.

138
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.580
<v 1>Right. So social issues, that's the way the.</v>

139
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.140
<v 0>Difference lies. Those are big ones. And those are also big ones.</v>

140
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.540
Those pro-life people, they, you know,

141
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.380
they will not vote for someone who's not pro-life.

142
00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.810
And so if you get to a position where you are a Republican,

143
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.090
you pretty much have to be pro-life right. If you want, want.

144
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.010
<v 1>The group. So those are the sticking points. Yeah. Because.</v>

145
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.490
<v 0>They, they, you know, and this is, there's no judgment here, but this is their,</v>

146
00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.290
their position is that you're killing a baby. Yeah. Right. And they're like,

147
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:16.930
I don't give a about anything else. You can't kill a baby. Right.

148
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:18.560
And so they're like, okay, okay.

149
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.160
And so many Republicans that maybe even have had abortions.

150
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.120
<v 1>Themselves, they can't be open about that particular issue. They can't be open.</v>

151
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.080
<v 0>About, I get it. They have.</v>

152
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.000
<v 1>To, they have to hide it. But this is why I think someone like Sanders is,</v>

153
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:29.080
is a genuine lefting option.

154
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.600
And why someone like Elizabeth Warren or someone who's pushing the woke thing,

155
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.280
it will never be. That will be like electoral, hemlock. I,

156
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.640
I think it'll just absolutely not work. But see, as.

157
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.470
<v 0>They don't see that, how do see it because.</v>

158
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.510
<v 1>They're full of, but how did they not see it happen last,</v>

159
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:44.390
like Hillary Clinton was targeting all the various demographics and she's like,

160
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.870
she was splitting the Electra up and say, and it didn't work well,

161
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.230
how can they not see that this never.

162
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.470
<v 0>Works? Have you ever known someone? Who's just a real liar,</v>

163
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:54.070
like pathological liar make up a pass. They make up things.

164
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.750
They don't know that other people can't tell or that other people can tell

165
00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:02.580
rather that, that they're not normal. They're not, they're not acting normal.

166
00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:04.540
Right. They don't seem genuine. Okay.

167
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:09.420
Like there's cer there's certain aspects of people that it's hard to

168
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.453
tell. Yeah. But there's,

169
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.380
some people just don't seem genuine and political people in

170
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:18.060
particular, like when people are running for political office,

171
00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:20.210
that's when that really stands out. Yeah. Yeah.

172
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.850
Because over and over and over again,

173
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:24.730
you see them doing these speeches and over and over and over again,

174
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:29.410
you see them talking about things and some people can sense it and some people

175
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.650
can't, but they can't tell when you're a liar.

176
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.410
You can't tell other people see you. Right. Because you're lying.

177
00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.090
Like I know a guy I'm gonna be nice here.

178
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.800
<v 1>Not name names or anything.</v>

179
00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.840
<v 0>Never. Um, he's gay as, but he doesn't think everybody knows it. He's.</v>

180
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.720
<v 1>Flamboyant. Right. He's gay.</v>

181
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.960
<v 0>All, everyone that I know knows he's gay and there's, and we all wish, you know,</v>

182
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.360
but he's got a family. He's got like a wife and kids and we're all speculating.

183
00:08:56.361 --> 00:08:58.400
Like, how's this guy get his rocks off. It's kinda crazy.

184
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.520
But it's just one of those things. Like the, the man is a homosexual.

185
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.560
I'm pretty sure. I mean, if I had a bet, I'm pushing all my chips in. Right.

186
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.000
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And because of that,

187
00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:14.280
he acts in this really strange cuz he's living this kind of lie of,

188
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.870
he acts in a strange way. And I don't think he realizes that people know.

189
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.310
<v 1>And you think a lot of these people go into politics.</v>

190
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.510
A lot of these sort of they're kind of sociopathic. A lot of people end up.

191
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.830
<v 0>In there's there's something about them.</v>

192
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.990
And so they have this fake earnestness to them. Right.

193
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.550
And that fake earnestness will work.

194
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.910
It will work if you're talking to 10,000 people,

195
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.220
if you're to 10,000 people,

196
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.300
about the way we can come together as a country and we can take America

197
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.860
back. Yeah. There's no connection.

198
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.021
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

199
00:09:44.021 --> 00:09:47.420
But I always put that down to them having to follow a party line or they're,

200
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:49.540
sloganizing, you know, they're throwing slogans. That's all that.

201
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.373
<v 0>There's a little of that.</v>

202
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.780
<v 1>To, this is why I'd never be a politician. I can't,</v>

203
00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.460
I couldn't bear not to just say what I think yout.

204
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.290
<v 0>Be a politician now for sure. Not when someone's trying to be woke,</v>

205
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.850
what they're doing is they're just has nothing to do with being genuine.

206
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:06.170
If someone's a woke politician, unless that's who they really are.

207
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:06.810
I think a lot of.

208
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.010
<v 1>'Em are though. I mean like, well AOC,</v>

209
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.570
I think she a AOC melanoma and Rashita tole,

210
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.570
and I think they mean what they say. Well, AOC.

211
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.930
<v 0>Is also, uh, you know, she's not even 30, she's 29 year old woman. Right.</v>

212
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.720
She's idealistic. And she's got these thoughts of the future and, and she's,

213
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.200
you know, democratic socialist.

214
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.480
<v 1>There was an article in spectator this week about this like that,</v>

215
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:26.520
that there aren't really woke people. They're just sort of they're,

216
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.440
they're just sort of acting this out. I wish that were true,

217
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:31.040
but I don't think it is. I don't think it is.

218
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.880
And I think Trump's being very smart whenever he,

219
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.480
whenever he sort of brings people like melanoma into the limelight of folk

220
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.750
focuses on AOC and focus on that. Cause it,

221
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.710
it means that you start thinking Democrat is woke. Yes. You know,

222
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:47.190
it sends that sort of message. And, and we know it just never, it never works.

223
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.690
And I,

224
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.030
that's why I despair with the labor part and the way the labor party went.

225
00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:52.190
Like I just, you know, I, I wanna see a proper opposition.

226
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:54.990
I wanna see a proper lefting part that cares about class issues.

227
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:56.990
That cares about money. That cares about the poverty line. Yeah.

228
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.140
Social mobility. Yeah. You know, not, you know,

229
00:11:00.141 --> 00:11:03.460
whether you are whatever microaggressions or whatever, you.

230
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.060
<v 0>Know, compassion for people that are trying to get by in this life.</v>

231
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.660
Not social justice issues. Yeah. Not nonsense.

232
00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.620
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. And that,</v>

233
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:12.780
and that's the way most people feel that that really is.
