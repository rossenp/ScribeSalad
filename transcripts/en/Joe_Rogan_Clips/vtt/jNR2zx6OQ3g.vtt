1
00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.320
<v 0>So, so listen, man, you were, you just came back from the Canello tripleg fight,</v>

2
00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.400
which was a, a phenomenal fight. That was a phenomenal fight. Yeah.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.360
I really enjoyed that fight a.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.400
<v 1>Lot. I think people exaggerate how good fights are nowadays.</v>

5
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.920
Like if they're around. Everything's great. Yeah. I think everything is,

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.360
if a pitch has one good year in baseball, he's great.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.400
He's he's like the next Santa Colfax.

8
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.270
Like people don't wait to see and,

9
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.670
and truly graded, uh,

10
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.950
against things that were out of their era. Mm. Because you know, we're human.

11
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.670
Like, Hey, I was there. I reported on it.

12
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.190
It's the greatest fight ever. And you really think so? No, no,

13
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780
but that's what people, that' what they, right, right, right.

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.180
I think it was a really good fight. Yeah. But everything's relative, you know,

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.580
and it depends on everything is influenced.

16
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:53.460
The judgment of people is influenced.

17
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
At least I see it in my view for whatever that's worth

18
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.340
by what's around and how hungry they are.

19
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.970
Like everybody bought the pakeo maywether first fight because

20
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.570
the fans were hungry. Their imagination was like, there's no good fights. Right.

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.730
This is gonna be a good fight. So they're anticipating it.

22
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.170
So you got 'em at the right time. If it was the eighties and you had Lennon,

23
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.040
Duran, Pinel, woodtake haler, haler, uh, you know, you,

24
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.160
you had, um, Herns, I mean, you had all these great fight, Aaron Pryer.

25
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:29.840
Mm. You had all these guys fighting each other.

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.160
You probably couldn't have pulled off the, the maywether

27
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.160
uhpackeo thing that you pulled off. And it, it turns out to be a, you know,

28
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.910
a bit of a, I don't wanna say scare am, but, uh, it,

29
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.390
it definitely was what it lived up to be. Wasn't.

30
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.230
<v 0>That because backyard came into the fight injured.</v>

31
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.630
<v 1>I, I don't believe it. I never saw any, listen,</v>

32
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.550
I'm not saying you didn't have an injury, but you, you are in a tough business.

33
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.930
You,

34
00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.590
you were in tawondo and all that kind of fighting stuff and MMA and what,

35
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.220
whatever part of it, I'm probably not giving it the proper, um,

36
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.420
understanding of what it was and, and exactly what part of the fighting,

37
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.220
not just MMA, I'm being too broad, but I know you did TaeKwonDo.

38
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.340
You did kickboxing.

39
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.900
I know that you're you were a national champion when you were young.

40
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.980
Somebody showed me something about it. So, um, you,

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.610
you do things when you're injured. I mean like, when are you not injured? Right.

42
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.690
If youre, if you are a football player, if you're a fighter,

43
00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:31.450
if you're in the contact with tell me when you're not injured,

44
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.570
like when there's not something wrong.

45
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.570
So I never saw proof during that bout I was there governor for

46
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.970
ESPN, I never saw proof where he winnced or,

47
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.840
or he didn't throw that hand or, or he food in a,

48
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.080
in a poor way or in a, in a less than high level way. I,

49
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.040
I never saw that. So listen, I'm not in this body. Uh, you know, and, and, um,

50
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.320
I'm not a mind reader, but I, I didn't see it. But what I did see,

51
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.120
I saw him and his trainer in the runway was more telling to me

52
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.400
taking selfies because they had got paid a,

53
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.400
a few extra dollars to promote some kind of product where

54
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.600
they selfies were attached to it. Mm-hmm. So I saw that to me,

55
00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:21.910
that was more Deb bill ating to see a guy before the biggest fight of his life,

56
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.310
where people were going crazy and, and gonna break the paper view, record,

57
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.110
and paying a hundred dollars for the freaking thing to see him taking a selfie

58
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.790
when the mentality should be in a different place.

59
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.230
And normally is in a different place before.

60
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:38.590
You're about to walk that a hundred yards to the ring.

61
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.700
You might not come out of there. Right? It's always possible.

62
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.340
You have to have that mentality.

63
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.620
I thought that was more debilitating than anything I saw physically with what

64
00:03:48.621 --> 00:03:52.380
was supposed to be an arm injury. So to me,

65
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.340
look to me, maybe it's, I don't know if it's fair to say it was a money grab,

66
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.650
but obviously it, it was a bit of a money grab. Uh,

67
00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:06.530
they were beyond themselves. Uh, you know, one guy was retired,

68
00:04:06.531 --> 00:04:07.490
he came back for it.

69
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.250
They were beyond the peak of their abilities in their career. And I just,

70
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.610
I, I just didn't see, uh, I, I didn't see that fight. Uh,

71
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.930
the purpose to it well.

72
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.800
<v 0>Happened about five, six years late. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.200
<v 1>I, I just, I mean, what,</v>

74
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.960
what, I, I, I, anyone who gets in a ring,

75
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.080
they deserve to make as much money as they can. I never,

76
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.430
I never say that a fighter got overpaid. Never. I don't care.

77
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.950
I never say that because I understand what it took to get to that point. And,

78
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.550
but, you know, you can, you can play with things and, you know, you can,

79
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.070
you can kind of lead people to things. Mm. And again,

80
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.750
where we started with this conversation, you know, it,

81
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:02.300
it's the time you're around the,

82
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.300
the environment what's not around, not just what's around,

83
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:08.340
but what's not around. Right. You know, there's.

84
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.300
<v 0>Not that many great fights to be made right now is what you're saying. Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.460
So the tripleg Canello fight is important because there's not a lot of guys

86
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:19.380
waiting in the wings. It's not like the old days of the 1980s or the,

87
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:21.460
the glory days of the, we wait and middleweight division.

88
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.250
<v 1>No, it's not. Right. And, and the people, you know, they, they have a thirst,</v>

89
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.223
if you will,

90
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.690
to see something that the PR department can bring,

91
00:05:32.691 --> 00:05:35.650
it can use the right material because they, they,

92
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.570
it has to be fighters that obviously are Marqui fighters with a name that they

93
00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:43.280
can build it and get the, imagine nation of the people that say,

94
00:05:43.281 --> 00:05:44.160
this is gonna be a great one.

95
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.560
So when they see it and they pay a hundred dollars on $85 or $95,

96
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.760
whatever the heck they're paying, um, for the fight,

97
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.600
and then it's a good fight. Well,

98
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:58.880
it becomes a great fight because of all those elements. Mm. Because,

99
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.720
uh, you know, it it's during your time you saw it, you committed to it,

100
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.240
you sacrificed to pay that money. You sacrificeed the fly there.

101
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.280
And yeah. It a really good fight becomes,

102
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.830
uh, a great iconic for yeah. Yeah. And,

103
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.150
and I don't think we separate that in our minds. I don't think, Hey,

104
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.070
who says we have to, because right. It's about enjoyment. So if that,

105
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.270
if that makes people happy, Hey, that's part of,

106
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.710
that's part of what goes into the mix of entertainment.

107
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.540
But I didn't see when I try to separate that being in the business,

108
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.980
I didn't see it as, you know, the thrill on Manila. Right. I, I saw it as

109
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.180
a really good, solid fight. And they, once again, unfortunately,

110
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.380
took away from it with controversy, with the decision. Did you think the.

111
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.340
<v 0>Decdecision I thought the first decision was terrible.</v>

112
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.140
I thought tripleg clearly won the fight.

113
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.290
I thought the second decision was arguable. I thought like, this is,

114
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.890
this looks like a draw to me. And it was an amazing fight.

115
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.010
<v 1>I mean, I gotta be honest because I mean, that's where you're supposed to be.</v>

116
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.930
And who do you think won? I added 1 17, 1 12.

117
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.170
And a lot of people were gonna say for you had it too far.

118
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.970
I had it for galafkin really. And all week long, I picked Canello to win on,

119
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.880
on ESPN, on sports and I was working. So I,

120
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:27.120
you know, 1 17, 1 twelve's big. Yeah. It's five round. So yeah. I, I, yeah.

121
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.560
So I'm, you know, you, you, you start to,

122
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.840
you're human, you start to hear people like you, you know,

123
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:38.480
that knows something about fighting that it had it closer. So you, maybe you,

124
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.070
you don't want to yell that you add at 1 17, 1 12, but yeah.

125
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.590
You still gotta yell it. Yeah. Because that's what you believe.

126
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:48.110
That's what you saw. And I still say it, I still yell it.

127
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.910
That it was, they didn't give 'em credit for jabs.

128
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.710
Like jabs don't count no more. Right? Like

129
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.620
I'm not gonna pick out anybody because that's not really

130
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.140
fair to do when you have a podium and they don't have a podium, but

131
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:10.620
sometimes it is because they deserve it. But not, not generally.

132
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.060
And the judges nowadays, I,

133
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.010
I think that they just give it,

134
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.610
I see too often that they almost go down the easy route.

135
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:29.690
Like, you know, they just give it to who's aggressive.

136
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.410
A guy's walking forward, a guy's throwing punches. It's like,

137
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.450
they're favoring that guy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, and it's more to it than that.

138
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:37.810
And I understand that the sport doesn't help itself.

139
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:42.480
They don't make a clear criterium, but it's supposed to be clean,

140
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:43.470
harder,

141
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.680
effective punchers because the separation of professional boxing and amateur

142
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.040
boxing is you have to sell it. You have to make money. Right.

143
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.360
And you gotta put Fannie in the seats. So you want to see guys get hurt.

144
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.160
You wanna see guys andpac guys. So it's the cleaner who hurts the guy more?

145
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:02.520
It's the cleaner, more impactful punches, but it's not just drone.

146
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.080
It's not just aggression because the aggression has to lead to something

147
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.840
effective, effective aggression. So I,

148
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.470
I saw for me to get it to that once step 12,

149
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.470
I saw galovkin on the outside control range,

150
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.270
control distance. You want to use that silly word ring generalship. Cuz I,

151
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.110
I have the time, I don't know what they're talking about. They say ring general,

152
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.630
like right. What are you talking about? I just saw the way you judged it.

153
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.700
Where did, where did you fit in ring general into that? Into your thinking?

154
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:40.820
Because I'd like to know, but if it is ring generalship,

155
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.180
he was controlling the range. He was controlling outside.

156
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:47.980
He was keeping the shorter man on the outside, catching him with the champ,

157
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.820
making him earn his way in, making him pay a price to get in.

158
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.970
Now was the other guy canal be in the other guy landing the hard clean body

159
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.210
shots that sometimes you don't get credit for. Yeah, he was, yeah. Oh,

160
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.970
like I say on ESPN, he was putting water in the basement. Yeah,

161
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.570
he definitely was. But

162
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.810
the jab didn't count suddenly we're suddenly in a universe where the jab

163
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.250
of a guy doesn't mean anything when we don't want it to mean anything.

164
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.560
When we want, wanna give it to the aggressive guy, to the, to the guy trying,

165
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.160
you know, trying to get in.

166
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.200
<v 0>There. The question is like,</v>

167
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:25.200
what's more important is a jab more important or a hook to the body. What,

168
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:26.880
what is moremportant in your eyes to, to the.

169
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.440
<v 1>Body? Clean is more important, more important.</v>

170
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.160
But if the jab outnums the hooks to the body through many rounds

171
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.430
and, and the numbers are significant, it's greater than,

172
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.630
than you have to account for that. Right.

173
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.030
<v 0>So you think that people are watching,</v>

174
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.790
they're watching a couple of jabs and then one hook to the body and they count

175
00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:48.070
that one hook to the body better than they count the two jabs.

176
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.350
<v 1>Yeah. And I don't have a problem with that because I count it that way too,</v>

177
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.710
if it's a good shot. Yeah. I, because again, a power shot. Yeah.

178
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:59.620
Because that is, what's gonna drive people to the event right. To the sport.

179
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.260
It's the harder punches. So I have no problem with that.

180
00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.500
But if the jabs are 20 jabs, right. And it's two body punches,

181
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.700
well then I'm starting to say, we,

182
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.340
we can't forget the jabs because the body punches got your attention. Mm. And,

183
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.170
and it, it, you know, it, it moved you outta your seat a little bit,

184
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.530
maybe because for whatever reason. So I,

185
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:27.330
I'm just saying that the criterium is not clean enough,

186
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.290
uh, for, for the judges sometimes. Well, it's.

187
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:33.850
<v 0>A even bigger mess in MMA and it's a lot of the same judges. I, I mean,</v>

188
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.970
I think the problem with judgesing is the same in both sports,

189
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.520
you should have someone who has experience in the sport. I mean, they,

190
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:43.520
they have to have a deep understanding of what they're actually watching and

191
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:45.960
that's not the case. I know it's not the case in boxing,

192
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:49.680
cuz I know a lot of the same judges from boxing also judge MMA.

193
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.520
They don't know what they're talking about in MMA.

194
00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:53.640
And I don't think they know what they're talking about in boxing either.

195
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.840
And that's a real travesty,

196
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.920
it's a huge disservice to these professional athletes who literally are,

197
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.000
as you said, risking, everything as they step in there,

198
00:12:03.001 --> 00:12:05.840
there's a real good chance that they might not come out.

199
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.320
I mean it happens every so many fights, a guy dies.

200
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.870
This is just a fact in boxing and the fact football too football too. Sure.

201
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:17.430
That's and MMA as well. Well MMA has plenty of problems, you know?

202
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.630
I mean there's, there's less deaths in MMA,

203
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.950
but we're getting deaths from weigh-ins. You know,

204
00:12:21.951 --> 00:12:24.830
we have a lot of extreme weight cutting issues in some of the small

205
00:12:24.831 --> 00:12:25.910
organizations in particular.
