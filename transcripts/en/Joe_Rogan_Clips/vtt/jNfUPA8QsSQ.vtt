00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Joe, I'm sorry to like,</v>

2
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.040
I want, I like, I, I thought I had all these questions for you, man. I was like,

3
00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:12.200
guess lame to ask my questions on their show and it's not in the moment like we

4
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:15.760
often do, but I really D I know you've probably been talking about it,

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.750
but I wanted to hear your take on deep fake cuz like that at

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.510
deep fake of you really bothered me.

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:29.110
Like it set off like a whole series of thoughts in my head that like

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.430
of all the futuristic that freaks me out the most, I like.

9
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.910
<v 1>Well, for someone like you or someone like me,</v>

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.070
it's easy for them to do it because they basically got a library of all the

11
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:40.790
sounds that we can make with our mouth.

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.380
And so they put it in a database and then they can get you to say words.

13
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:45.300
You've never said before.

14
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.460
And in order that you've never said 'em before in a way that you can kind of

15
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:53.300
distinguish for now, I kind of can hear that it's fake,

16
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:56.980
but it was me talking about sponsoring a hockey team filled with all

17
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:59.900
chimpanzees. Yeah. And teaching chips to play hockey,

18
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:04.250
which sounds exactly like something I did do. And, um, it's,

19
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.930
it's close. You know, I mean they had one,

20
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.850
a few years ago that they did with Ronald Reagan where they had a fake speech

21
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.930
and this was way way before the internet.

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.890
And someone had pieced together, uh,

23
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.280
fake collab barration of a bunch of different Ronald Reagan speeches

24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.640
and then used them with sound editing and turned it into a,

25
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.760
a whole statement that he never gave before.

26
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.800
And then the white house went on television and showed how they did it and

27
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:41.720
showed on the news, all the different speeches that they pulled from and the,

28
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.590
the actual sentences where they pulled from, they showed it to you.

29
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.950
So there could be no denying someone. I forget what it was.

30
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.470
Maybe it was the Russians. Was it the Russians?

31
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.603
<v 0>Of course.</v>

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.190
<v 1>Someone had done that. People, I don't know. I don't know who did it.</v>

33
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.990
I don't remember, but it was interesting. Cause I was like, oh wow,

34
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:01.750
they can do that. But I thought, you know,

35
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:05.420
think about how many times Ronald Reagan has given speeches. You just take,

36
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.100
listen, someone with pains, taking detail, mark down,

37
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.420
all the words and no speeches,

38
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.780
put 'em all in some sort of a multi-loop cuz it's, you know,

39
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.620
you have to go like to Phil Specter's house,

40
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.540
they have the old school reel to reel sound recorders and

41
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.130
piece that together and splice it up and then release it.

42
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.930
Pretend that Ronald Reagan is trying to start a war with Iran or something like

43
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.210
that. Yeah, man, I forget what it was. Do you remember the premise?

44
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.890
<v 0>No, I don't remember the premise of that, but I.</v>

45
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.890
<v 1>You know, do you remember that the recording?</v>

46
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.970
<v 0>I don't. I kind of remember it, but it's a foggy memory, man.</v>

47
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.360
It's pretty wild PR, but this is like to a,

48
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:49.320
me of the sun and all the things to worry about this is

49
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:52.880
really intense. Mm. Like, you know about the hostage, uh,

50
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.400
the weird hostage, uh, phone thing people are doing where they're like,

51
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.240
you get a phone call from the phone number of your wife and you answer it and

52
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:04.640
it's like, we've kidnapped your wife. You know,

53
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.600
it's someone freaking out in the background.

54
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.600
They're like send us money or she's. And like, they've been right now,

55
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:15.080
what they've been doing is they've been, you know, someone will say,

56
00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:18.400
let me talk to her and they just hand it to some lady who's like, oh.

57
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.390
You think, oh my God, it's her. I'll give you whatever you want.

58
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.510
People have been sending the money, you know?

59
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.230
And like when you consider like what happens when deep fake technology

60
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.950
intersects with just the ability to like call people from spoofed numbers and

61
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:36.950
that suddenly if someone gets your phone number list,

62
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.220
they're gonna be able to call your friends is you and record conversations

63
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.820
where as they sort of dredge up, you know, who knows whatever they want.

64
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.260
Maybe they wanna blackmail you. Maybe they wanna get money.

65
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.140
Maybe they wanna embarrass you. That to me is like,

66
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.660
so spectacularly weird that we're gonna end up

67
00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:01.810
having to have passwords that we tell each other away from our Alexis,

68
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.450
which is like, listen, if I call you and I'm seeming strange, &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;,

69
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.530
you know, the PA the, the password is like, go for 69.

70
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.490
Otherwise it's not me. Yeah. You know? Cause that's gonna, that's a reality.

71
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.970
I mean, just look what people are already doing with spoofing numbers. Mm-hmm,

72
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.600
&lt;affirmative&gt;, that's up man. &lt;affirmative&gt; and like that, that aspect of it.

73
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:25.400
And also just like supply and demand. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; in other words,

74
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:28.000
there's one Joe Rogan. Right, right now.

75
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.000
But if an AI starts duplicating you and improving on you, like,

76
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.240
and I'm saying, you know, five or 10 years, no offense, man.

77
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.800
But maybe an AI could like turn you twice as smart. You know, mm-hmm,

78
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.790
&lt;affirmative&gt; make you like whatever. Who knows what?

79
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.590
And then suddenly you're no longer in demand in the sense that once the

80
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.910
Joe Rogan AI package goes on the dark web or makes its way into

81
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.310
wherever people are gonna just be able to download you and have conversations

82
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:59.870
with you and make video. You know what I, that to me is the, the,

83
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.580
so what are the most are realities that we are entering into is one where you're

84
00:05:04.581 --> 00:05:07.340
gonna go on YouTube and there's gonna be a video of you.

85
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.460
Looks like you sounds like you, but it's like 50 times funnier than you,

86
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.060
50 times cooler than you, 50 times smarter than you.

87
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.980
Cuz it's an AI pulling from the internet. It's just you but better.

88
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.930
And no one's gonna wanna watch you you anymore. Cause they're like,

89
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.890
I wanna watch, I love the real Rogan,

90
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.570
but I wanna watch the Rogan whose brain is functioning 50 times the speed of a

91
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:32.290
normal human brain. Cuz that guy, wow.

92
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.210
<v 1>That's how they're gonna take over. Well, right. They make us all obsolete.</v>

93
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.290
<v 0>We're they?</v>

94
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.570
<v 1>Yeah. Better versions of all of us.</v>

95
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.010
They're gonna be like invasion the body snatchers.

96
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.960
<v 0>Yeah. That's right. That's right man. And that's not, I mean I'm even,</v>

97
00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:48.640
let's say it's 20 years away. That's still too soon say.

98
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.560
<v 1>It's a hundred mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; let's go crazy.</v>

99
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.041
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:56.840
We're gonna be basically like sort of drowned out by multiple versions of

101
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.560
ourself with exponential intelligence. Well, that was.

102
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.961
<v 1>My concern.</v>

103
00:06:00.961 --> 00:06:04.640
When I was talking to KSW about downloading your consciousness into a computer.

104
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.560
I'm like what's to stop you from making multiple copies and if you can make one

105
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.520
copy. Yeah. Like what's what's to stop you from being like,

106
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.920
tell me some fat guy with a little Dick. Who's a real.

107
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.230
Wouldn't hack into the system and infe it with copies of

108
00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:23.190
him. Yeah.

109
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.790
That just overwhelms everyone else's data where he is omnipotent.

110
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.230
And he is literally the ruler of the realm that he exists in. Yeah.

111
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.870
Yeah. Cause he's figured out how to hack into the grid and take over.

112
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.980
Imagine you think you're gonna be in heaven.

113
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.820
You're gonna enter into this virtual reality. But look,

114
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.060
you're gonna get to what fly dragons and have sex with beautiful women and eat

115
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.660
fruit and this fat guy with a little Dick,

116
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.900
he hacks the system and then everybody's gonna suck his Dick.

117
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.340
And everywhere you go is a version of him is trying to get your suckers. Dick,

118
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:59.690
come on, come on. Yeah. This people ears. He's holding people down five,

119
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.610
six of on a person, just you from every angle BA that's what he created.

120
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.330
And his, I mean, that's what a computer virus is. Sure. It's everybody. Right.

121
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:12.610
If you think about that, that most there's a lot of viruses. I don't know what,

122
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.610
how, what percentage of viruses, Jamie? You know,

123
00:07:14.611 --> 00:07:19.600
this are not financiallymotivate it there's

124
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:23.120
gotta be some viruses that people create just to people. Sure.

125
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.600
<v 0>Right. In the old days for sure, man. I mean I think they, yeah,</v>

126
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:30.320
they were just there to up your, to freeze your, your computer up your,

127
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.560
they didn't, they weren't worm.

128
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.160
They weren't grabbing data to use it against you. They were just like, you know,

129
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.230
shutting your computer down to be a Dick. Yeah. Or making it save weird things.

130
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.830
Yeah. Like, you know, real basic, the old viruses in the days of AOL,

131
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.750
remember those man, they were cool. They were like scary,

132
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.710
but not like today where they like shut down the power grid until you send

133
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.030
somebody a million dollars worth of Bitcoin. Oh.

134
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:57.030
<v 1>You have to completely remap your hard drive. Completely reload.</v>

135
00:07:57.031 --> 00:07:59.500
Your operating system. It just kills a, you have to,

136
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:03.380
the only way you gotta kill the operating system, swipe it clean.

137
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:08.380
Start from scratch. Sorry. It's all cooked. Yeah. All your work.

138
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.450
off.

139
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.260
<v 0>Gone gone, man. Just.</v>

140
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.340
<v 1>Like this fat guy with a little Dick back guy with everybody, hundreds of them,</v>

141
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.500
a sea of them running at you, pulling on their half hard.

142
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.450
<v 2>There's a story going around this weekend about uh,</v>

143
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.010
Samsung TVs having viruses in 'em and you being able to scan it for a virus.

144
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:30.490
There's like a program on it that allows you to scan for viruses. And then to,

145
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:32.690
I guess today Samsung deleted that tweet. Oh great.

146
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.850
People were pointing back to this being in like the weeping angel program where

147
00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:39.770
the CAA can use your TV to listen to your conversations and they are doing,

148
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.160
and they're recording it. Weeping angel.

149
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:45.360
<v 0>What a great name. Why doesn't the CIA start?</v>

150
00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:50.320
Naminging the Navy UFOs. Weeping angel. Why do they call it that?

151
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.560
Why do they call it that? What is that? That's why?

152
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.880
Why do they have to bring angels? Is that Satan? Is Satan a weeping angel?

153
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:01.960
Is that what they're saying? Like what the is that weeping angel. That's weird,

154
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.560
man. That's weird. But like, you know, the implication that they,

155
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.560
in your deep fake that they sent out to the world was it already happened,

156
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.560
you know? They're like, how do you know this hasn't already happened?

157
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.270
And words like, how do we know we're not duplicates? How do we know?

158
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.830
We're not one of an infinite number, an array of like,

159
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.590
you know, versions of us that are being populated all over.

160
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.550
Some server somewhere could.

161
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.230
<v 1>Be, well, that's the thing about the simulation theories. That one day we,</v>

162
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.660
if things keep going the way they are like, and then I was gonna bring this up.

163
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.940
When we were talking about people like looking at cities and looking at the

164
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:43.500
grids and looking at the hive, like, what is,

165
00:09:43.501 --> 00:09:45.260
what are these cities doing while they're spreading?

166
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.420
And they're being productive,

167
00:09:46.421 --> 00:09:49.580
they're making things and they're making better things all the time. Well,

168
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.460
if they're making better things all the time, like what,

169
00:09:51.461 --> 00:09:52.380
what are they interested in?

170
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.770
And while they're interested in computers and CGI and art intelligence and

171
00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:01.490
artificial life and, and they're all definitely moving in some sort of a,

172
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:05.290
a greater technological dependency.

173
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.290
Like we're pretty dependent now, but it's gonna get greater and greater, right?

174
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:12.330
Yeah. We get more and more. Well, one,

175
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:17.760
one day they're going to have a reality that

176
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:22.800
isn't tangible in the sense that without

177
00:10:22.801 --> 00:10:27.000
this system, you wouldn't be able to experience it, but it will be a reality.

178
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.560
Once you're in the system, once you're in the system,

179
00:10:29.561 --> 00:10:32.280
you will feel your elbows on the Oak desk. Yeah.

180
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.040
You'll feel the sweat on your palms you'll feel the sunglasses on your nose.

181
00:10:36.041 --> 00:10:39.950
You'll feel a those things. Yeah. So who's to say that that's not real well,

182
00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:42.110
if that can happen one day,

183
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.950
if they can create an artificial reality that you cannot discern from the

184
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:47.350
reality that you're currently experiencing,

185
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:50.870
how do you know it hasn't already happened? Right? You don't, you don't.

186
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.551
And you know,

187
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:56.430
some super smart people think that we should keep open the

188
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:57.264
possib.

189
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.820
That that is what we're operating under or that the stability

190
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.380
and the rigidity of the dimension that we exist in is not nearly

191
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.780
as firm and not nearly as permanent as we like to think it is. Right.

192
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.540
Which is one of the reasons why psychedelics is so exciting. And so, uh,

193
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.090
there's, there's so they're so

194
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.610
they're transformative, but they're also, they're valuable, but they're also,

195
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:29.930
they illuminate the possibility of others, of other things,

196
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.690
other dimensions, other life forms, other, other levels of consciousness, other,

197
00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:37.170
other ways of interacting with each other,

198
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:42.160
especially mu well kinda all of 'em all of them that when you take like a,

199
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.160
a transformative dose yeah. You experience some weird thing where you're like,

200
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.920
oh, this is possible too. Like, this is like a whole nother way of existing.

201
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.880
Like who's to say that if, if, if human neurochemistry, right,

202
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.480
if that's what's causing depression and elation and dopamine and

203
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.000
stonin and all these different, wonderful things,

204
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:05.360
it's what caused melatonin and all these different things that happen when

205
00:12:05.361 --> 00:12:07.320
you're sleeping. And then the psychedelic ones,

206
00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:11.800
like the DMT who's to say that we have to exist with this

207
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.230
mixture, right? Who's to say that life with a,

208
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:20.190
a thicker mixture isn't also possible and might be

209
00:12:20.191 --> 00:12:22.030
going on around us all the time.

210
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:27.190
Like there might be these porous sort of

211
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.990
entry ways into these other dimensions. Cool.

212
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.030
That are consistently open and closed.

213
00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:34.980
And they're constantly around us all the time. But when we're,

214
00:12:34.981 --> 00:12:38.980
when we're just in straight normal consciousness that we experience without

215
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.620
perturbing it with alcohol or pot or psychedelics,

216
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.740
we want to think that this is reality. This is rigid. This is it.

217
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.020
But maybe it's a reality. Yeah. Maybe there's a load of 'em.

218
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.450
Maybe when you make decision, you enter into different ones.

219
00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.930
Maybe you are constantly shifting the one that's around you and how you interact

220
00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:01.764
with people.

221
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.890
You mean like your decisions are the way you navigate through the multiverse.

222
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.570
It's entirely possible, right? Yeah. Yeah, man. You, I say that too many times.

223
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.690
Well, we could, it is a thing. If you, if you,

224
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:17.160
if you just think about how little we understand about consciousness,

225
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.320
about what happens when you die, what happens when you sleep? What,

226
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.000
how little we know about what,

227
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:24.280
what is going on when you're communicating with people?

228
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.080
What is going on when you're interacting with people? Yeah. What,

229
00:13:27.081 --> 00:13:30.840
where are these ideas coming from? Yeah. Are these ideas,

230
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.440
little life forms in an,

231
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:38.110
a non observe state. Yeah, man. Bro,

232
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:39.470
are you taking off the glasses? You getting crazy?

233
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.270
I just realized I don't get to look at your beautiful eyes, Joe. It,

234
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.830
I was enjoying this. We did it for hours. Um,
