WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, we got to stop doing that with dolphins and orcas.</v>

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:08.130
It's going to be thought of the same way we think about slavery today.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.040
It's that it's horrific. We can't understand that.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.660
And we can't believe that compassionate human beings would be willing to

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.750
isolate members of a super social,

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.790
highly intelligent animal species and just put them in swimming pools.

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.770
It's barbaric. It's crazy. It's torture. It's it's,

8
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.400
what's sad.

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.590
<v 1>Here is, you know, we're years removed from the documentary Blackfish and,</v>

10
00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:35.480
you know, that was really impactful. I mean,

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.150
arguably responsible for the paradigm shift that we're,

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.870
that we're experiencing here in north America and other places, of course. Um,

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.600
but maybe it's time for people to revisit it. I know SeaWorld, uh,

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.160
their stock and their value is sort of going up now, granted, they, you know,

15
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:51.470
they changed their numbers, they skew it. They have free beer day.

16
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:54.050
They pumped the numbers up, you know, they have all these different promotions,

17
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:57.020
whatever. I mean, everything that comes out of these, these facilities,

18
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:01.190
these assume it to be all by the way that it's all,

19
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.900
but none of people questioned them on it.

20
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.770
But as we speak while we're amidst sort of a paradigm shift here and, uh,

21
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.990
I mean, I can speak to it because I mean,

22
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.950
I'm very happy to say that we have very effectively decimated Marine land.

23
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.740
And we'll talk more about that. But, uh, over in China,

24
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.380
this is now a burgeoning business and I, and I did,

25
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.090
we discussed this a year and a half ago and it's,

26
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.600
it's tenfold now it's happening very quickly and I'm sure you're familiar with

27
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.170
the whale jail situation in Russia. Have you seen that? No, I have not.

28
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.900
They've got, uh, enclosed in this bay.

29
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:34.250
They've got over a hundred wild cut Balugas and

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.180
orcas. So there's about 10 orchids if I'm not mistaken. And uh,

31
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.940
some activists flew a drone over it.

32
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.880
This got worldwide attention, a lot of outcry, a lot of, uh,

33
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.570
anger of course. Um, so what happened was Jamie.

34
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.920
<v 0>To us right now for the folks that are listening and we're looking down at the,</v>

35
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.790
what looks like swimming pools with, uh, I guess those are belugas.

36
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.470
<v 1>Those have all been sold. Those are essentially sold and ready to go to China.</v>

37
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.090
Uh, but on account of the fact that the activists got this and created a real

38
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:12.140
worldwide stink, um, all the negative press that came of it, uh,

39
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.590
they've now resolved that they want to try to, well they've,

40
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.060
they've hard considered, uh, releases. Um,

41
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.430
the governor in the area signed a intent to release agreement with the

42
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:28.400
world sank, uh, with the whale sanctuary project, uh,

43
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.830
who sent a team to assess the animal's health and whatnot.

44
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:32.270
And this was all of like three weeks ago.

45
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:34.700
It's not a long time ago and they assessed that all these animals should be

46
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:38.090
released. There's a couple of issues. There's a couple of things that,

47
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.300
that are becoming conflicting.

48
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.230
A it's going to require a lot of costs if it's done responsibly,

49
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.200
be it appears. Okay. So what's happened is, as we know,

50
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.110
Russia's not exactly a democratic, uh, environment.

51
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.590
Only one person makes the decisions on account of what becomes of these whales.

52
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.350
Whereas there was some PR stunts to say, Hey, we're going to,

53
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.161
we want to release them.

54
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:05.680
We want to do this to sort of mitigate the global outrage.

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.380
The captors have propagandize this entire effort to free these whales

56
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.300
as a means for the west to undermine the Russia's Russia's economy.

57
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.190
So the whale trade economy,

58
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.080
here's where Marine land comes into play in a, in a theory at this point,

59
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.290
but it has these very intense implications.

60
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.180
What we know about what Marine land is doing currently in their transition from

61
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.340
brilliantly successful business to virtually decimated, thank you,

62
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.800
um, is they're shipping their whales out. We know too,

63
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.210
um, are going out if it's not this week, it'll be very soon.

64
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.950
I'll be shocked if they're not out I'm in LA.

65
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:49.390
So I can't say that it's happening right now.

66
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.110
I think it may very well be happening this week. They're going to Spain.

67
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.960
We know that five other permits have been, uh,

68
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.780
requested to send these animals now to the states.

69
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.960
So it was that they're liquidating. They're the, yeah,

70
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.570
they're going through liquidating. But the issue is

71
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.600
if in fact Russia catches wind, that Marine land is sent sending their whales.

72
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.780
Let's use the worst case scenario to China.

73
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.920
It validates the Russian captors,

74
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.350
propaganda and concerns.

75
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.250
Suddenly what we're concerned is going to happen is those animals suddenly Putin

76
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:28.810
says, forget it, sell them, ship them out. That's that's a scenario,

77
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.240
but why would he do that? Because again,

78
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:35.020
the captors are propagandized that the west wants to cripple the Russia's

79
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:37.690
economy, that they're wild whale sale economy.

80
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.200
So if some Marine land is selling whales to China from Canada,

81
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.530
then suddenly the captains have a point. They'll say the Putin look there,

82
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.610
they're selling whales.

83
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.670
Why is it such an outrage that Russia is doing it when Marine lands doing it?

84
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.450
So there's that concern? The other one,

85
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.660
and this just came up within the last 20 hours,

86
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.040
is it appears rather than go the most responsible route,

87
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.500
which we know is going to be a costly endeavor, but you know,

88
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.620
we're game and we're ready is, uh,

89
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.490
they're now considering just dropping the nets and saying, see you later.

90
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.410
<v 0>And letting all the animals go. Here's what we suspect.</v>

91
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.120
<v 1>They're going to let the orcas go because they were captured illegally. Uh,</v>

92
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:22.180
there's some gray area as to whether the beluga whales have been captured

93
00:05:22.181 --> 00:05:23.170
illegally or not.

94
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.060
So I think it'll probably start with the orcas rather than move them to where

95
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:30.730
they were at the same time of year, uh,

96
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.110
when they were captured so that they can be next to their P their trends, uh,

97
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.380
transient pods are they're they're they're, um, they're pods.

98
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.500
They just want to drop this, this net and say, see you later. Well,

99
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:44.740
that's as irresponsible as it can get, but that's crazy.

100
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.510
That's like making someone.

101
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.140
<v 0>A slave for how many years, a year, somewhere on the planet.</v>

102
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.520
<v 1>But imagine there hope you can imagine it would be, oh, see it didn't work. Oh,</v>

103
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:59.420
Jesus. There's a lot of, uh, there's. This is a big issue. Uh, we're on it.

104
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.810
There's a, there's a great team of activists over there.

105
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.110
<v 0>Would it be accurate to say that maybe what these groups are doing</v>

106
00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:12.850
right now is recognizing that there's probably going to be some radical changes

107
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.570
in the way these things are permitted, what's legal,

108
00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:18.910
what's not legal and what people are tolerating.

109
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.830
It's just not the same as it was 10 years ago,

110
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.040
catch them and sell them as fast as you can just get out while you can,

111
00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:27.160
because it might come a point in time when not only could they not sell it,

112
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.520
but they might be responsible for doing exactly what you said and bringing you

113
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:34.450
back to the area where it's family would be it, which would.

114
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.420
<v 1>Be an incredible cost. It has been incredible cost.</v>

115
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:41.830
It would be an undertaking unlike any other rescue, uh, that we know of. And,

116
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.280
uh, how much would something like that cost? I can't even imagine. I mean,

117
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.880
I would be the wrong person to ask. I can't put a figure on it.

118
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:51.620
I just know that it would take a lot of time. Uh, it,

119
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:54.040
it would be a lot of dedicated, uh, I mean, we would need.

120
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.060
<v 0>The pod. Yeah. You'd have to figure it out.</v>

121
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.590
<v 1>That would be able to bring the whales out. I mean.</v>

122
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.240
<v 0>To be able to somehow or another,</v>

123
00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:04.600
get it close enough to the other worlds without freaking them out. It's.

124
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.100
<v 1>A whole thing, but it's possible. I mean, that's the important part.</v>

125
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.000
<v 0>Man. The whole,</v>

126
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.660
it's just one of those things that I really think has people we're going to look

127
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:15.490
back on and we're going to go, man,

128
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.170
how did we in 2019 not know that that was insane.

129
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.680
Does that is not a chicken? You know what I'm saying? I mean,

130
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:26.280
that's not like something you could just keep in a cage. That's that?

131
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.780
<v 1>So let's back up to, uh, as you know, it for, well over four and a half years,</v>

132
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.501
five years now,

133
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:34.630
I've been advocating for bill [inaudible], which is a ban against, uh,

134
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.630
 which is a national conduct, Canada wide ban

135
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.630
 against a whale and dolphin and porpoise captivity. So that would include no more breeding, no more important, more export any of that. Okay. During these, this, this, by the way, is going down as the longest bill ever researched in Canadian history, because it's been a lot of issues from

136
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.630
, uh,  opposition, uh,

137
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.630
 one, one Senator in particular. In fact, if I can have a moment to just give,

138
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.630
uh,

139
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:34.630
 Senator Don plant a big goal, I, when you piece of, which camera do I look at? 

140
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.463
So that I win you piece of. So I should, I should be more, was.

141
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.180
<v 0>That the other guy, the lawyer.</v>

142
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.550
<v 1>The Senator that has put every possible, um,</v>

143
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.040
block in front of the passage of this bill,

144
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:20.890
he's tried to kill it silently forever. I mean, this is an epic,

145
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.610
epic story we've had to as activists and the community at large. And again,

146
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:28.510
I have to stress how much you've had a hand in this is I've had to re I've,

147
00:08:28.511 --> 00:08:33.040
had to have these campaigns where we literally flood the Senate servers to the

148
00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:36.460
point of crashing it on, uh, on a couple of, uh, instant, uh,

149
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.230
instances where they were going to kill the bill,

150
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:42.340
very silently through a sort of procedures he's got as, uh, his role is a,

151
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:43.990
it's called the Senate whip.

152
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.410
So he's actually yields a lot of influence and power. He, he, uh,

153
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.650
creates the committees where people do the studies and everything. He sets the,

154
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.300
uh, the dates for the committees. I mean,

155
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:56.880
he had this thing studied for like 17 straight months was absurd. Again,

156
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.560
longest tenure in a, in a Canadian legislative history. It appears,

157
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:05.190
but this guy was, you know, doing his, his, uh, so he used to kill.

158
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.840
<v 0>It. Do you think that w what do you think, why was he doing that?</v>

159
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.890
<v 1>He's one of these guys, as he looks at this bill and he sees it as a activist,</v>

160
00:09:15.891 --> 00:09:18.080
sort of left wing, liberal,

161
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.640
liberal sort of fluff bill. He doesn't see that it's necessary.

162
00:09:22.641 --> 00:09:26.750
He went to Marine land as an invited guest. Uh, he's very, uh,

163
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.330
publicly declared his friendships for John Holder.

164
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.620
I don't want to speculate as to whether there's been any, uh, money exchanges,

165
00:09:33.621 --> 00:09:37.160
but I know he's certainly very interested in killing this bill and by virtue

166
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:41.450
alone of activists pressuring and exposing all of his, his efforts,

167
00:09:41.451 --> 00:09:44.450
we actually saved this bill on a number of occasions.

168
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.680
The most notable of which was just a few weeks ago, where, uh,

169
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.590
in the house of commons, it appeared this bill was going to die.

170
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.540
And literally at the 11th hour, I packed up, we drove to Ottawa.

171
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.390
I had a tweet storm set up, we put pressure on,

172
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:02.660
I tweeted individual senators or rather individual members of, uh,

173
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.380
of parliament. And, uh, I promised them, and you know,

174
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:09.680
this is a sensitive time in Canadian politics for Justin Trudeau,

175
00:10:09.681 --> 00:10:11.210
the leader of the, of the liberal party.

176
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.500
I promised them if this bill dies on account of the fact that what was happening

177
00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:18.380
was the liberals were going to propose amendments to the bill. Last second,

178
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.260
that would send it back to the Senate for further review.

179
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.780
At which point we know Don Plett was waiting in line to kill it.

180
00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:25.070
There was nothing we could do at this point.

181
00:10:25.071 --> 00:10:28.670
This was going to be his to kill the fact that this was being facilitated by

182
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:30.770
liberals was really an infuriating thing. But nonetheless,

183
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.950
we applied an incredible amount of pressure. I drove my down there.

184
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:35.990
I got there and I stood in front of every, which one of them.

185
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:38.960
And I looked them all in the eyes. I'm just like, I'm going to make you famous.

186
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.760
I'm going to make you famous.

187
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:45.620
And I'm going to make you famous and I'll make you famous. And, uh,

188
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.650
I don't want to speculate if that's, what if that's what saved the day,

189
00:10:48.651 --> 00:10:50.780
although it was mentioned in the house of commons,

190
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:54.590
that special interest pressured them at the last second, but in a,

191
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:55.850
in a last Lazarus.

192
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.300
<v 0>Can you say that to someone I'm going to make you famous?</v>

193
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.870
<v 1>I think it's my most, it's my most effective tool.</v>

194
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.910
<v 0>It's like a scene from, uh, like, uh, the what's that, what are the,</v>

195
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.450
what was the cowboy movie where Val Kilmer played a

196
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.780
doc holiday member tombstone? Yeah, it sounds like a line in tombstone,

197
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:23.000
right? Oh, no. You know what? It's from? Uh, the one with the Bon Jovi song,

198
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.990
you know, those, those, you know, shot down in a blaze of glory, you know,

199
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.190
you know, those, those, those cute guys in the,

200
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.010
was it the eighties or nineties at all? Like did a Western movie.

201
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.570
<v 2>Together guns, that's it. It's from that? I'm gonna make you famous. Oh. Sorry.</v>

202
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.470
I knew I had heard it's from somewhere. I think it's from that.

203
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.320
<v 1>I'd hope. I'd hope. That was my line. But nonetheless it's whatever.</v>

204
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.430
<v 0>Emilio Estevez,</v>

205
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.980
this was arguably the campy cheesiest of the cowboy

206
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.530
movies. Right? Is it the campaign just today?

207
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.800
I didn't see it. I don't know. They're all handsome devils.

208
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.013
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.230
<v 1>So I show up and show up. Literally,</v>

210
00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:06.120
they get them right before the meeting starts.

211
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:11.010
The entire committee stands up and leaves the room. Now we're,

212
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.670
we're there and we're prepared for this to die. I'm there for a funeral. Uh,

213
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.150
they come back in the conservative members of the committee, uh,

214
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.240
propose their amendments, the liberals, which outweigh the, uh, uh,

215
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:25.110
the conservatives are, you know, they're all voting.

216
00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.360
So they're just knocking these things down, knocking them down,

217
00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:27.901
knocking them down,

218
00:12:27.901 --> 00:12:31.860
and then suddenly it comes to the liberals time to propose their amendments.

219
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.390
First guy comes up and he says,

220
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.950
I'd like to withdraw my amendment nodal on the record, sits down. Okay,

221
00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:42.720
we'll go to number two. I'd like to withdraw. My amendment sits down.

222
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.030
Number three, I'd like to withdraw my amendment. We're like, holy.

223
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.400
I'm looking back. You know, I've got some,

224
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.730
we've got some people there that are obviously of, of the,

225
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.100
with the same interests as me. And, you know,

226
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:56.520
I don't even know exactly what's going on at this point. I just know that, uh,

227
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.710
their faces are indicative that this, we might win this thing. And the fourth,

228
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.840
uh, member of parliament stands up,

229
00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:08.700
he withdraws the amendment and we save this thing in the last second.

230
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.810
And I absolutely know it was a pressure campaign because like I said,

231
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.330
I was going to come on this podcast.

232
00:13:15.331 --> 00:13:17.370
I'd already had this date written for some time.

233
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.200
And this was going to have political implications that I don't know that the

234
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.290
liberal party could have sustained. It's a really bad time.

235
00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:26.850
I think this came from the top down,

236
00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.090
whereas efforts to kill it came from the bottom up. This came from the top down.

237
00:13:30.091 --> 00:13:30.930
You're not killing that bill.

238
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.000
<v 0>I think people are understanding what dolphin captivity really is,</v>

239
00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:39.210
what Orca captivity really is. I think they're understanding that now.

240
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.230
And I think it's just one of those things that exists because it's always

241
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:44.064
existed,

242
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.550
but if it didn't exist now there's no way anybody would ever let you do it.

243
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.490
If there was no captive dolphins and orcas,

244
00:13:50.491 --> 00:13:55.110
if someone just went around and kidnapped them with what scientists know now

245
00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.810
about their social structure and their community.

246
00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.820
<v 1>Do, they're so complex the way they, they have dialects, right?</v>

247
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.050
It's they have dialects, orcas have, uh, um,

248
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.443
they have,

249
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.990
they share languages in different regions and actually have a different accent

250
00:14:12.991 --> 00:14:16.770
of sorts. I mean, it's, uh, it's really remarkable stuff yet, right?

251
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:21.120
It would be a global outrage. If today as day one, someone said, Hey,

252
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:24.600
look at this thing, let's put this in this box because we have them already.

253
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.441
Well,

254
00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:28.230
because we have them in there's some legacy businesses that have been around for

255
00:14:28.231 --> 00:14:30.630
a long time. That's a great way of putting, um, you know,

256
00:14:30.631 --> 00:14:33.360
they have the means to fight. They know now that look,

257
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:36.570
this is not going so well. If you can, you can see it in all the advertising,

258
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.390
uh, these days, uh, uh,

259
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.880
SeaWorld almost rarely shows any orcas in their commercials.

260
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:46.080
Although it seems the industry is, uh, sort of switching to baby walruses.

261
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.840
In fact, they're, they're,

262
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.720
they're the new orcas they're sort of the new brandable. Um, yeah, it really is.

263
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:55.460
It's happening all over. It's happening in Canada as well.

264
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:59.720
The Vancouver aquarium is running with it. Um, yeah. And same as SeaWorld.

265
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:01.520
If you go to their, their Twitter, it's, you know,

266
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.270
I can't say that present day it's, it's like literally the case today, but, uh,

267
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.870
yeah, a lot of baby walrus, uh, stuff. It's where it's going. It's just,

268
00:15:08.871 --> 00:15:11.210
they know that they can run with that. At least for the time being

269
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.490
what's crazy in all of this is here. This bill is passing.

270
00:15:16.491 --> 00:15:18.740
Now we know it's going to pass. It's a, it should be,

271
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.480
it should get Royal assent. Uh, come second week of June, uh, shy of some,

272
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.320
some catastrophe, this thing will become law. Um,

273
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.530
that's why Marine land is trying to get rid of these whales as quickly as they

274
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:34.430
can. They got to get them out of here because at least now they can just, well,

275
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:38.660
it sounds like to, to, uh, export permits have been approved. So to beluga,

276
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:42.350
whales are going to Spain. Um, you know,

277
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:45.260
now granted that's being facilitated through the Vancouver aquarium.

278
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.160
This becomes an ugly mess here because when it comes to zoos,

279
00:15:49.161 --> 00:15:51.380
they're all part of these associations. Okay. And these are,

280
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.350
these are industry voices, anything that's if at any time you're told, well,

281
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:58.430
this is an ACE at a accredited facility. You know, most schools for instance,

282
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:01.180
or, or general people would say, oh, well, it's a credit. It's a good place. No,

283
00:16:01.181 --> 00:16:05.510
no, no, no, no. What that means is these places facilitate, uh,

284
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.040
animal transfers, one, not to other member facilities. It's really just a club.

285
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.830
And this club protects, uh,

286
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.360
the interests of these parks and keeps any type of oversight,

287
00:16:17.361 --> 00:16:19.010
lack their lobby groups basically.

288
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.240
So what's happened is now through the Vancouver aquarium Marine lent.

289
00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.160
So Marine land is sending these whales to Spain,

290
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:29.840
but they're claiming them to be Vancouver aquarium, uh, uh, Wales,

291
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:33.740
which is not true. They were never on these animals inventory,

292
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.390
or rather this facilities inventory list.

293
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.830
There's never been any knowledge of any of this,

294
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:40.700
but what's happened is because Vancouver aquarium is accredited and has an

295
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:43.490
affiliation with the ACA. So in Canada we call it Casa.

296
00:16:43.491 --> 00:16:45.830
The Canadian association of zoos and aquarium and Marine land is,

297
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:50.390
is in fact not, uh, they no longer have their accreditation. They did.

298
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.960
They didn't have the best of relationships shortly after all of our revelations.

299
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.570
Um, it's all just written.

300
00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.490
Now it's just the industry as a whole is breaking all of its own rules to

301
00:17:01.491 --> 00:17:05.870
facilitate getting these beluga whales. Marineland has 51 of them. Okay.

302
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:10.310
There's five born every year, but they always have 51 and they don't,

303
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.720
they haven't shipped an Orca out in nearly a decade at this point. Um, I mean,

304
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:17.210
you do the math at what's going on. Exactly. So they're dying.

305
00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.920
They're always have 51. They don't ship them anywhere else. I can attest that.

306
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:25.550
Yes. Uh, when I was there and in my experience,

307
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:28.580
and you don't have to watch my words because I know Marine lens, lawyer,

308
00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:32.900
Andrew Burns is listening. Hi, Andrew, I'll see you next week. Um,

309
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:38.150
in my experience, uh, yeah, you're uh, for as many animals are born,

310
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.490
you're just about losing as many. So you'll lose two old ones.

311
00:17:40.491 --> 00:17:42.590
You'll lose three young ones, not all the ones that are boring,

312
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.920
it'll be successful just about half are. Um, so,

313
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.710
so what's happening now is the industry wants that bloodline.

314
00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:51.210
There's 51 captive orcas. Whereas, you know,

315
00:17:51.211 --> 00:17:53.430
there's a lot of controversy and importing animals from other places,

316
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:54.420
the states can't, in fact,

317
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:56.880
they can't bring them in from Russia without a public consult period.

318
00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.740
It might still be the case with Canada.

319
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:02.520
So actually the public might actually be consulted about the import of these

320
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:06.480
five belugas that, um, Marine land is seeking permit for it to export.

321
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.120
So that's something that certainly has activist level. I'll be,

322
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.860
I'll be helping to guide towards the proper resolution,

323
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:17.550
but yeah, that's all happening. It is a race right now to,

324
00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:22.230
to get rid of Marine lens animals. And, uh, I've had,

325
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:26.430
it is a wild time. It's, it's a wild time to be inside the doors at Marine land,

326
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.520
as I can imagine in the fences. Uh, and it's,

327
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.080
it's a most wild time for me to be on the outside because I've never in the last

328
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:35.070
six and a half years of,

329
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.370
of litigation and just of my advocacy and being sort of, you know,

330
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.880
basically being engaged in war with Marine land.

331
00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:46.800
I've never seen them work harder to suppress me and

332
00:18:46.801 --> 00:18:48.360
to try to silence me than they are now.
