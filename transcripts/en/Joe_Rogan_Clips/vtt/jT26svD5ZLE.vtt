<v 1>What I mean? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Maybe she just, just doesn't make sense.</v>

9
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:23.030
If you look at the work of Ralph bmenthal and Leslie keen,

10
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:25.750
New York times reporters they're Credly reporting these, this stuff,

15
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.540
<v 0>UFO. We know that that doesn't mean anything.</v>

16
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.140
It doesn't mean it happened because well.

17
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.900
<v 1>It means it's a state certified or state recognized paranormal experience.</v>

18
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.140
<v 0>Sure. You can get anything certified in New Hampshire. That's a goofy place.</v>

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.930

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.480
<v 1>A nonapp five. And then in Martha, Texas, you heard of the Mar lights.</v>

33
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.173
<v 0>No, I have not heard.</v>

34
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.340
<v 1>Of that.</v>

35
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.040
The Mar lights are these a anomalous and that's a state kind of recognized

36
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.840
paranormal mystery, too mysterious. Marite they have a, a kind of a picnic area.

37
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.360
We can watch them at night. No one knows what they are.

38
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.800
They appear every night and they bounce around on the horizon.

39
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.400
They go up and down and back and forth.

40
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.430
People say all their headlights from different cars on the highway.

41
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.070
But the air force, uh, the state police,

42
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:50.070
they've all tried to figure out what they, they are.

43
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.710
And they just don't know what the Mar lights are.

44
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.870
And they're recognized by the state of Texas as a paranormal event.

45
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.590
You but I like your skeptical view. Yes I do. Yeah.

<v 1>Well, that's what they say in the airfor the police they've looked in there.</v>

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.690
They've done surveys. They've done. Juetic surveys. What is it? Is it gas?

59
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.440

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.370
<v 0>What do they think it is? What's the official explanation.</v>

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.410
<v 1>No one knows mystery lights that state of Texas has a little plaque.</v>

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.720
smoke weed and stare at the sky. Do you,

67
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.600
is there any UFO sightings that you think are nonsense?

68
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.480
Is there any like mainstream ones that you listen to and you're like,

69
00:02:58.481 --> 00:02:59.360
I'm not buying that one.

70
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.720
<v 1>Um, well, um,</v>

71
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.680
all the people that I've talked to that have had sightings and have had

72
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.800
experience to seem very genuine. I don't know that anyone has been,

73
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.360
I don't know anyone that's been blown out publicly that I would doubt. I mean,

74
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.800
can you think of one? I don't know. I, I believe I, the allgache boys,

75
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.110
Calvin Parker down there in Mississippi, the Pascagoula incident. I mean,

76
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.911
again, their,

77
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:26.470
their lives were severely negatively affected by these experiences. Um, right.

78
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:26.630
But.

79
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.990
<v 0>They didn't know whether or not that was gonna be the case when they reported on</v>

80
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:34.150
it. A lot of people do silly things that ne negatively affect their life. Yeah.

81
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.190
And that's, they don't, they're not aware. They don't,

82
00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:39.340
they're not future tellers. They there, the there's.

83
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.173
<v 1>A guy there. He was,</v>

84
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.780
he says that the alien appeared at his back screen porch door he's in col,

85
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.780
Colorado. Do you know that gentleman? Uh, he says that the, do.

86
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.540
<v 0>You have balls deep in this man? You know, all these stories, this guy. I.</v>

87
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.860
<v 1>I, I don't really, I don't know if I believe him because the, no, the, uh,</v>

88
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.340
Colorado of alien at the back door, I don't know. Doesn't seem right.

89
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.530
I just looked, I don't know if I, him or not. It just like,

90
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:02.130
like he was fabricating there, that guy.

91
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.170
<v 0>Out, I'm sure there's a lot of people fabricating things. And I'm also sure.</v>

92
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.650
There's a lot of people that believe they're telling a true story,

93
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.650
but in fact are schizophrenic. Mm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

94
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:13.450
Or they have some issues or there's, I think there's a lot of that going on.

95
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:13.610
You.

96
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.010
<v 1>Know, Billy Meyer was, was doubted for me story. Sure. Story.</v>

97
00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:17.130
What do do you think about, about him?

98
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.160
The pictures are so vivid and the playtine plaing store so vivid. I don't,

99
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.760
I don't, I mean, he's not a book, uh, Billy Meyer, uh,

100
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:27.440
you can put's Billy Meyer, UFO, uh, photos of up there wheres he from he,

101
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.000
he was a Swiss. Yeah. We.

102
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.790
<v 0>Have his book.</v>

103
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.880
That was the know somebody came to the comedy store and gave me with the big.

104
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.760
<v 1>Book on that guy. The big pictures and the isn't that isn't that they.</v>

105
00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.103
<v 0>Well.</v>

106
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.400
<v 1>Well, look at the one by the pine tree. They're going, they're going, oh.</v>

107
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.470
Attached the saucer to the pine tree, but I heard.

108
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.510
<v 0>He threw it in the air and took a picture of it. Okay.</v>

109
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.870
<v 1>Well, that's one theory, but wasn't it, you know,</v>

110
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.710
didn't they do that just to show the scale of their ship.

111
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.270
And some of those photos are pretty, pretty convincing. I don't know. And

112
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.810
okay. If you wanna.

113
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.140
<v 0>Say guy who keeps taking awesome pictures of youfo, I'm not buying it.</v>

114
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.460
<v 1>Well again, you know, if there was anyone that I had doubt,</v>

115
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:10.020
because throw so much doubt has been thrown his way. That's pretty, pretty.

116
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.180
I mean, how do you, well, I suppose with Photoshop, but Bruce McAbee,

117
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.380
I believe is Bruce. McAbee's analyzed these. He wrote this book. He says,

118
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:17.970
they're real.

119
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.970
<v 0>What? Right. But a guy who's writing a book on UFOs is analyzing U no,</v>

120
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:23.690
but you' saying they're real. This guy wants, but.

121
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.410
<v 1>But Bruce McAbee is a, is a doctor. And, and, and he's a sci, he's a,</v>

122
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:28.410
he worked for the Naval.

123
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.370
<v 0>I want to talk to his, ex-girlfriends see if he's full of.</v>

124
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.930
So you know what I'm saying? Like,

125
00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:35.250
like you could say all these positive things about people. Yeah.

126
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.450
<v 1>He was, he worked for the Navy. He was one he's the expert. Well,</v>

127
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:42.680
he's the expert. He said, that's the Gucci version. Yeah. That, yeah.

128
00:05:42.681 --> 00:05:44.720
Look at those balls. What are they? That's a bling bling.

129
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.960
Those are the pin balls.

130
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.080
<v 0>I'm that if you had an Instagram account and you and alien,</v>

131
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:48.860
that's the one you'd.

132
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.040
<v 1>But I think he did a photo. He did a photo analysis and he said that, uh,</v>

133
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:54.960
that Bruce believes the real. And I believe Bruce, if you, if you read, uh,

134
00:05:54.961 --> 00:05:56.640
this book here, he's, uh, he's the real thing,

135
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:00.000
like what Stanton was the real thing, Bruce, McAbee's the real thing because,

136
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.040
uh, they're there are scientists who are doing, um, you know, very, very, uh,

137
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.280
thorough and close inquiry on the,

138
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:08.600
on the matter mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so if you ask me who I doubt, maybe,

139
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.280
I don't know, Billy mayyer I don't know. I don't know. Yeah.

140
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.960
<v 0>He took too many. Yeah.</v>

141
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.000
<v 1>If he had like three it's like a Glu it's like too much chocolate. Yeah.</v>

142
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.030
<v 0>Come on. That's all you're doing. You're out there and they just come to you.</v>

143
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.710
Why don't you set up a camera crew? 24, 7 for a couple weeks. And,

144
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.070
uh let's well, Stephen Greer.

145
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.870
<v 1>Uses lasers. He points them up to the sky and, and kind of attracts em that way.</v>

146
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:31.310
Yeah. Yeah. You know he's. Yeah. Well, uh,

147
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.550
but his wife and daughters have said that if, you know, they've sat out and,

148
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:37.860
and watched these things come and go in North Carolina at their house. And.

149
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.900
<v 0>But people saying that something happened. And so how about all the photos?</v>

150
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.300
But his thing is about UFOs. He's made documentaries about UFOs.

151
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.420
His business is he knows a lot about UFOs. What, what you want.

152
00:06:51.421 --> 00:06:53.380
I talked to Greer. I'm not buying it. What you.

153
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.140
<v 1>Want is you want the Sam, you want the, uh, you want the herb Shermer story.</v>

154
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.650
What's the herb Shermer store.

155
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.930
Nebraska highway patrolman on patrol sees a flash of light in the Ashland oil,

156
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.850
uh, refinery near Nebraska, flash of light in oil refinery in the broad.

157
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:12.810
Dielight not a good thing. Could be a fire, goes up, not into UFOs.

158
00:07:12.811 --> 00:07:16.890
Highway patrolman goes up. He was taken into a ship and deposited.

159
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.520
He's one of the famous one. So no agenda there didn't wanna tell a story again,

160
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.400
got into trouble for it. But again, here's the thing. Herb Shermer, herb Sherm,

161
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.000
H I R M E R, and little.

162
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.360
<v 0>Disrespect to herb. But some cops are crooked. They steal people's money.</v>

163
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.120
Some cops rape people. Some cops pull people over for nothing.

164
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:39.350
Some people shoot people for, for non-existing crimes. There's a lot of,

165
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.790
there's a lot of people that just happen to be police officers that are also

166
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.590
full of. That's.

167
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.790
<v 1>That a lot of people are full of. That's true. Yes. But I, I, you know, again,</v>

168
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.990
here he is, he's a guy. Why would he say that? There's no evidence. The.

169
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.030
<v 0>Other one is where's his evidence?</v>

170
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.550
<v 1>Well, his evidence is anecdotal. Like a lot of it, but that's a problem. Right?</v>

171
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.950
Well, the Phoenix, the Phoenix lights, there's there's video of that. That's.

172
00:07:59.060 --> 00:07:59.740
<v 0>Ifferent one, that's.</v>

173
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.460
<v 1>A different story. Um, Marni zzaora Z is Z a M O R a.</v>

174
00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:04.180
He was a New Mexico highway patrolman.

175
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:06.300
He said a saucer landed and he saw it land. And Dan.

176
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.980
<v 0>Aroy, everybody wants to be special.</v>

177
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.420
And one of the best ways to be special is for you to have a special moment with

178
00:08:12.421 --> 00:08:14.940
some special creatures from a special place mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

179
00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:18.140
And no one else can recognize whether or not you're telling the truth or not

180
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:18.920
telling the truth. Right.

181
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.370
You talk about out this and everybody wants to listen and they listen to you.

182
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.490
They're totally fixated on everything you like to say. Well, how about.

183
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.330
<v 1>Pro? How about toxic? How about provez jaafari Pervez jaafari I like the name.</v>

184
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.570
<v 0>Okay. Hevez.</v>

185
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.770
<v 1>Jaafari he was an Iranian, uh, air force pilot, and he still lives.</v>

186
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.450
Inran he's does many lectures and he did the famous, uh, it's the Iranian,

187
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.280
uh, te around UFO society.

188
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.720
He chased the UFO in his jet and the thing turned off all the electronics and

189
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:47.760
the jet. And he said, this thing was moving. How about general Deb brewer? Well.

190
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.840
<v 0>How about David? Fraer.</v>

191
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.480
<v 1>I don't know him. He's.</v>

192
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.680
<v 0>Um, he's the guy that they were talking about on the, uh,</v>

193
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.680
bomblazar documentary he's he experienced something that flew

194
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.040
exactly like the lalazar ones. I'm I'm gonna talk to him soon.

195
00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:07.880
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and he incredibly credible and you know,

196
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.200
military accolades.

197
00:09:10.201 --> 00:09:15.110
He's a very well respected guy and he's never had any other fantastic sort of

198
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.390
stories that he's told. I can't wait to talk to him about this.

199
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.910
<v 1>As jaari he's a good guest too. You should get him on.</v>

200
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.470
And then there's the guy who flew the Alaskan, uh, you know,

201
00:09:23.471 --> 00:09:25.630
the Japan airlines flight with all the wine on it.

202
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.670
And the UFO above Alaska circled him several times. That's a famous story.

203
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.310
I'd get a bottle.

204
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.350
<v 0>Of that wine. Yeah. That.</v>

205
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.300
<v 1>Would be, yeah. Yeah. So Alaska airlines citing. That's another one. So no,</v>

206
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:38.660
but I like, I like your view. You are not gonna sit here and say, oh,

207
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.460
it's all true. I'm accepting it all. It's too easy to,

208
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.620
but all I give all I give you all I give you here today from my experience is

209
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.660
the ones that I believe mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that's Betty and Betty Hill.

210
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:50.500
Travis Walton, Betty bar. Gosh, boys.

211
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.300
<v 0>Yeah. Betty and Barney hill are, are really interesting one,</v>

212
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.970
cuz there's also there wasn't precedent, Betty and Barney hill in 1961.

213
00:09:57.971 --> 00:10:01.130
There wasn't a bunch of people that were talking about these things happening to

214
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:01.350
them.

215
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.690
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and since then there've been very many that were really

216
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:08.770
similar. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; very similar and it makes you wonder. Yeah.

217
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.610
Cause here's but this is what I wanna say to people that are skeptical.

218
00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:15.170
And of course I'm skeptical. That's why I'm knocking holes in these things.

219
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.440
Yeah. But it, if that,

220
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.480
if it did happen and you were left alone to try to explain to people,

221
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:25.600
something that is incredibly unique,

222
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.560
very few people ever experience it.

223
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.920
It would be so hard to get people to believe you. Well.

224
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.640
<v 1>That's why you have to go to a professional. You go to a professional, but even.</v>

225
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.480
<v 0>There's no such thing, you know, well, someone who can professional,</v>

226
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.590
no means you make money doing it means you studied it and you make money doing

227
00:10:39.591 --> 00:10:41.510
it. There's not a single human being on this planet.

228
00:10:41.511 --> 00:10:45.150
That's a professional Explorer of other worlds, right?

229
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:49.390
There's not a single person on this planet that is a professional expert on

230
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:51.990
alien civilization and could tell you everything they need to know.

231
00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:54.190
I know more about French.

232
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:58.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; about the Lang the French language than anyone that's ever

233
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.860
lived knows about alien civilizations. And I don't know about French. Right.

234
00:11:02.861 --> 00:11:05.300
Do you know what I'm saying? Yep. I know it's a real place.

235
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.460
I know France is a real place and French is a real language. And I could say,

236
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.580
pollvufar say that's more than anybody can explain about any I,

237
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.060
any civilization on some other planet, you've.

238
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.250
<v 1>Gotta take the credentials of the people who, who at these things. And I,</v>

239
00:11:18.251 --> 00:11:19.930
I do refer to, uh, do the credentials.

240
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:21.290
<v 0>Are poorlyly terrestrial.</v>

241
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.370
<v 1>They are that's right. No. Um, you know, UFOs, uh, generals, pilots, and, and,</v>

242
00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.730
uh, uh, on UFOs, go on the record.

243
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.730
That's Leslie Keen's book and there's some pretty, pretty compelling, uh,

244
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:32.350
you know, stories.

245
00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.370
<v 0>Do you remember arcce hall when he had that,</v>

246
00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:37.690
that thing you would do things that make you go Hmm mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm

247
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.563
&lt;affirmative&gt;.

248
00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.200
<v 1>Hundreds in states. See flying saucers, Indianapolis news, you know, anyway,</v>

249
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.840
this is a neat book by Bruce. I believe Bruce was the real thing.

250
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.520
I believe Stanton is the real thing. And.

251
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.540
<v 0>I listen,</v>

252
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.840
Jay Allen Heinick is one of the more interesting characters to me because he ran

253
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.040
love blue book book. Yeah.

254
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.360
He ran project blue book and his directive was to debunk these stories.

255
00:11:56.361 --> 00:11:59.280
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whether or not they were credible. He was,

256
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:04.160
his directive was to say, that's a weather balloon. That's a, that's a star.

257
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.320
This is, uh, swamp gas. That was his directive.

258
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.790
But then when he left project blue book, he said, listen, these things are I?

259
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.910
<v 1>Yeah. 20% of sightings are unexplained. Yeah. He said, these.</v>

260
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.990
<v 0>Things are real. And when you, when you talk to a man like that,</v>

261
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.750
who's living was in debunking these things.

262
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.190
And then after it was all over,

263
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.430
he was compelled to communicate with the American public,

264
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:30.150
that there was a real situation going yep. Going on.

265
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.110
<v 1>There is. Um, and he.</v>

266
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.340
<v 0>He's really into interesting.</v>

267
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.500
<v 1>To me and Ken Arnold, his sighting is pretty compelling. Sure. Um, so I think,</v>

268
00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.660
I don't think they want to form a relationship with us.

269
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.900
I think they're coming and going like taxis.

270
00:12:41.901 --> 00:12:44.940
And they have been since the beginning of the existence of,

271
00:12:44.941 --> 00:12:47.500
of life on this planet, the existence of this planet, do you.

272
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.860
<v 0>Think they engineered human beings?</v>

273
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.220
<v 1>Well, that mission to Mars movie is one of NASA employees. Favorite movies.</v>

274
00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:55.210
I think maybe they a mission to.

275
00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:56.210
<v 0>Mars movies. I't, that's.</v>

276
00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.010
<v 1>A, a mission to Mars. Tim Robbins. Really good picture. It's a doc.</v>

277
00:12:59.010 --> 00:12:59.970
<v 0>It's a, its.</v>

278
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.050
<v 1>A feature. It's a feature. It's a feature. Yeah. Mission to Mars.</v>

279
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.970
<v 0>Yeah. What is it about.</v>

280
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.370
<v 1>It's about the mission to Mars and them discovering there was a civilization</v>

281
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:09.330
there and that perhaps we were helped along in our development. Yeah.

282
00:13:09.331 --> 00:13:13.090
What year was this? Around? Uh, thousand. I'm not sure. Missionthousands really.
