00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.620
What's incredibly brave is that you deep into your

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:12.540
twenties have this revelation and

4
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:17.370
then have the courage to escape. And so I want to get back to that. Like,

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.340
what was your job? Like? What did, what was the first job you got?

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.240
<v 1>Uh, so I didn't get a job immediately. I thought I had to,</v>

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.690
I thought I have to be responsible. Like, of course I'm with my sister.

8
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:30.120
Like we had some money saved, just we lived at home.

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.050
We didn't have a lot of expenses. Like we,

10
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:34.950
we used our money to travel across the country picketing, but we still,

11
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.790
we still had some money.

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.080
<v 0>[Inaudible] we got to get out there and people off.</v>

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.040
<v 1>Well, and it was, it was, I thought it was the greatest, like I thought, like,</v>

14
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.320
it was always exciting. Like, oh, are you going on this pickup trip? Yeah,

15
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:46.980
I'm going to west.

16
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.761
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

17
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:51.240
So it was just like a part of life you guys used to pick at Scientology.

18
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.380
<v 1>Yeah. And we're doing it in Clearwater wants to super boring.</v>

19
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.520
Like there was nobody out there.

20
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.290
You got to rank the pickets by like, I dunno,

21
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
George w Bush's second inauguration was like insane.

22
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.930
And then there's like Scientology.

23
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.200
<v 0>Oh yeah. That was like post nine 11. It must've been really rough to.</v>

24
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.760
<v 1>Yeah. Especially we had a sign that said, thank God for nine 11. Oh.</v>

25
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:15.743
<v 0>God.</v>

26
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.830
<v 1>It. And it was like,</v>

27
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
we were stationed like at the intersection of these three streets and they were

28
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.080
blocked off for the parade.

29
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.800
So like he finishes his inauguration speech and this like huge crowd of people,

30
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:26.790
like hundreds of that, whatever,

31
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:29.880
how many thousands of people like flood down this thing.

32
00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.470
And then they're stuck in this,

33
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.710
in this intersection waiting to go right past us on this sidewalk.

34
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.020
And so there was like this, uh, new,

35
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:38.970
they're seeing this like thank God for nine 11.

36
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:41.490
And it was right after the tsunami too. Uh,

37
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.940
so my mom had a son was holding the thank God for the tsunamis or whatever.

38
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.080
And I'm like, so people are just enraged by the time they actually got to us.

39
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:51.720
So like, we're standing like right at the edge of these barricades, like,

40
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:54.960
so on the other side is the parade route. And so like, you know,

41
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:58.620
people were like jumping, like some guy jumped on my back, like on one another,

42
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.830
like stealing signs and like jumped on your back. Yeah. Like,

43
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.300
so I'm li I was like leaning over the barricade. So he couldn't steal my signs.

44
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:08.010
Sorry. I'm not getting away from the mic. And, uh,

45
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.490
so like one of my cousins actually like gave his signs to another church member

46
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:15.480
and then it was like standing on top of a trashcan, like going, come on,

47
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.730
you guys, like, just, just don't worry about them. They're not worth it.

48
00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.460
They're not worth it. Like with my cousin who was, you know,

49
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.700
just because it was so it got so physical, like, you know,

50
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.840
people and like the cops.

51
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.640
<v 0>Like saying you guys aren't worth it. He was.</v>

52
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.160
<v 1>Trying to yeah. Pretending he was.</v>

53
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.640
<v 0>Yeah, exactly.</v>

54
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.380
<v 1>Oh, wow. Yeah. So that one got pretty, yeah, pretty got pretty dicey,</v>

55
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.580
but get violent.

56
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.160
<v 0>The guy who jumped on your back, like, what did he do?</v>

57
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.590
<v 1>So I will, I'm holding my signs. And I'm like,</v>

58
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.930
like I talked to myself into this barricade. So like,

59
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:46.380
there's nothing else he can do. So he and there was like, there was,

60
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.530
I should also say there were cops just on the other side of the barricade,

61
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.840
just like, like every five feet. There was a cop, I think there was.

62
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.720
So there was like maybe 14,000 cops in DC that day.

63
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.860
Cause it talks first migration after nine 11. So anyway, but so I mean the,

64
00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:00.250
and the cops were mostly just standing there.

65
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:04.350
Like I look over the guy gets off and um, like my,

66
00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.120
my brother is standing next to me. Who's seven or eight, eight years.

67
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.620
So he would have been like early twenties and uh, um, this,

68
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.530
I see. And when he jumped over the barricade,

69
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.060
because the way people were coming after us and this cop like pulls out a, uh,

70
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.660
you know, club to in and making us get back over the bar,

71
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.270
like jump back over on the other side, like with these people who are,

72
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.320
and not really doing anything, but it, it.

73
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.060
<v 0>But did you expect the cops to risk their lives?</v>

74
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.060
Even though you're obviously provoking people? I mean,

75
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.570
you're obviously putting yourself in a situation where you're saying something

76
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.370
incredibly insulting and just devastating to all these people that lost

77
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.970
friends or loved ones on nine 11 or in the tsunami or,

78
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.700
or have family members that are gay. I mean,

79
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.820
did you guys really expect the cops are going to take the beating for you or the

80
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:53.230
cops are going to get involved?

81
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.290
<v 1>Oh, for sure. I mean, we thought that he was like, it's their job.</v>

82
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.950
<v 0>Right? They didn't, you would never do what you did then. Right? Like what if,</v>

83
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.290
what if someone passed some sort of a law saying, listen,

84
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.520
you guys know what you're in for.

85
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.640
We have no desire to help you there'll be no police presence.

86
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.930
Would you still protest? Well.

87
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.820
<v 1>We did that. And that's something that some cops did respond.</v>

88
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.700
<v 0>That way. Did they say like, there'll be no police presence whatsoever?</v>

89
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.230
<v 1>Where was that at? I can't remember it, but it happened more than once. Yeah,</v>

90
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.320
for sure. And like, sometimes the cops would, we'd say,

91
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:23.320
we're going to come to protest this, you know, something. And they would say,

92
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.970
you know, you can come,

93
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:28.900
but you can't hold that sign or you can't tell you step on the flag or whatever.

94
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:30.970
Sometimes they tell us in advance. Sometimes they would wait until we got there.

95
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.990
<v 0>And step on the flag.</v>

96
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.670
<v 1>Yeah. Like we desecrating the flag was a big, we saw it as an idol and you know,</v>

97
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:39.340
the American flags and I don't actually, my mom got arrested. I had a,

98
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.690
we were in Nebraska and, um, uh, my little brother,

99
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.340
we were protesting a soldier's funeral.

100
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.430
And we were like far away from the church. Um,

101
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.370
but there was a group of people on the other side of the street and they were

102
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.480
all holding American flags all the way from, from the road all the way up this,

103
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.220
you know, the long entry to the, to the church, we were quite far away. And, uh,

104
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.160
my brother was nine years old at the time. And he did what he always did,

105
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:05.080
which was, uh, you know, put down,

106
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.050
lay the American flag on the ground and stand on top of it and hold a picket

107
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:12.850
sign. And within like a couple of minutes, uh, like nine cops showed up,

108
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.120
uh, and started talking about arresting my mother, uh,

109
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.100
for flag mutilation and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. And,

110
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.550
uh, so before they do the arrest, you know, again,

111
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:27.940
my mom and my uncle were both there and they are both lawyers.

112
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.020
And my uncle is like, uh, you know, Johnson vs Texas,

113
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.400
the Supreme court said in that case that, uh, you can even, you can utilize it.

114
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:39.850
Not only can you mutilate a flag, you can even burn it. And, uh,

115
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.530
and that's perfectly lawful. And one of the cops was like, we're not in Texas,

116
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.640
we're in Nebraska. So like, this is obviously a Supreme court case. So it's,

117
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.580
and he said, Supreme court has jurisdiction all over the country.

118
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.310
So in other words, I guess what I'm saying is like the,

119
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.890
the way that sometimes the, they did,

120
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.640
sometimes there were really good cops who did their job more super professional,

121
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:06.260
and didn't let their beliefs about our religious beliefs or their,

122
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.110
what they thought about our message get in the way of them doing their job.

123
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.770
But sometimes they did, sometimes they would threaten to arrest, you know, my,

124
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.140
our parents, if they brought children,

125
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.310
they would take their children away from them. You know, things like that. But,

126
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.020
but we absolutely expected them to do their jobs like that. That was,

127
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.900
and this is the Supreme court.

128
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.690
<v 0>I mean, I know you're not justifying it,</v>

129
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:34.520
but it's from the point of view of something like me, uh,

130
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.720
someone like me, I, I would say, don't bring any cops there. No, if you,

131
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:43.430
if you start that kind of at a funeral or for a soldier and a bunch of people

132
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.990
come by and beat your, well,

133
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.380
then don't do that again because you're people off and you're hurting their

134
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:50.900
feelings and you're dealing with someone who's already emotionally scarred.

135
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:55.370
Those cops need to be out there stopping robberies and, you know,

136
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.820
breaking and enterings into people's houses and carjackings.

137
00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:00.680
And that's what they're supposed to be doing.

138
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.610
They're not supposed to be like helping out people who are intentionally

139
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.300
provoking and emotionally disturbing people.

140
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.220
<v 1>But I mean, so obviously from the church's perspective, it's like this it's,</v>

141
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.250
these are sincerely held religious beliefs and the first amendment,

142
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.180
like what good is the first amendment like this, obviously this stuff.

143
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.830
<v 0>But it's not a first amendment issue.</v>

144
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:26.540
Like the F because it's no one in an official position is saying you cannot

145
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:27.374
speak.

146
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.620
<v 1>Well. So compare that to like the campus what's going on on these campuses.</v>

147
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:30.861
Right?

148
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:34.310
Where do you think that the cops shouldn't be there to protect those people

149
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.350
there they're provoking people and making them angry?

150
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.560
<v 0>Well, it's a different sort of a scenario. Um,</v>

151
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.970
I think the cops should definitely be there to prevent violence on campus for

152
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:48.080
several reasons. One reason, because I think you're dealing with very young,

153
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:52.640
very impressionable people who make very poor choices and feel justified

154
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:56.960
because they're around a bunch of people that also have like-minded ideas,

155
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.690
a lot of peer pressure, a lot of, um,

156
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.830
diffusion of responsibility that comes from these mass groups of people that are

157
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:08.090
acting and the mob mentality that comes along with that.

158
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:11.960
I think it's very, very important to protect them from themselves.

159
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:13.730
And it's a hot button issue.

160
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.200
I think protesting at a soldier's funeral is just gross.

161
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.620
I agree with you. I mean, I know you do. I know you do. I mean,

162
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:22.480
but I'm just saying, like,

163
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:25.880
I don't think the cops have a responsibility to save you from being gross.

164
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.620
<v 1>Yeah. I just, I don't know. I mean, obviously this was a Supreme court case.</v>

165
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.810
It became a, did you know that, that it, this,

166
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.330
there was a case where we were sued by the church.

167
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.880
<v 0>And I do remember that and how that play out.</v>

168
00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.460
<v 1>Uh, it, it went on the first, they,</v>

169
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.760
they want a $10.9 million verdict against us at the trial court.

170
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.740
And then it was reversed at the appeals court.

171
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.320
And the Supreme court said eight to one. They have,

172
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.300
it's the constitutional right for them to do this.

173
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.990
This is their religious beliefs. They have a right. They, especially because,

174
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:56.100
I mean, sometimes I will say it,

175
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:59.550
like I described to you that very first picket soldier's funeral picket that I

176
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.190
went to, like that was very close quarters. You know,

177
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.090
we were right up on top of them. Like if we had chosen to sing or you know,

178
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.060
that, you know, they would have heard us. But in a lot of instances,

179
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.670
we were way far, far away, like in that,

180
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:13.050
in the instance that went to Supreme court,

181
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.730
they were more than a thousand feet away.

182
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:18.750
There was like a hill that the family didn't see church members, you know,

183
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:22.320
things like that. It, there was, um, so I mean,

184
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.780
they have a right to do it.

185
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.513
<v 0>Who has a right.</v>

186
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.230
<v 1>Well, the, the church, I mean, right.</v>

187
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.240
<v 0>Okay. They have a right to decide,</v>

188
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.610
to say horrible things about someone who just died or someone who lost a son or

189
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:36.570
a daughter in war.

190
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.530
<v 1>Yeah. I think obviously I, I don't, I think it's terrible that they do do it.</v>

191
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:43.200
And that was actually one of the things, you know, before my sister and I left,

192
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.063
that was one of the,

193
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.360
I wasn't going to hold a sign that I didn't believe was true.

194
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.880
And I wasn't gonna go to any more funeral protests.

195
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.700
<v 0>Do you think that the police should, I mean, they're,</v>

196
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.540
they're operating on tax dollars and it's a limited amount of resources.

197
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.240
<v 1>I mean, we're taxpayers, right? I mean, sure.</v>

198
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.770
<v 0>You are, but do you think that the resources should go to that? Right. I know.</v>

199
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.690
I know. But do you think that really the cops that's the,

200
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:15.180
an intelligent and adequate and fair use of resources to go and protect a

201
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:16.230
bunch of troublemakers?

202
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.700
<v 1>So it depends on what, how do you, how do you feel about the first amendment?</v>

203
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:23.220
Like at the it's it's, it's the principle of the thing,

204
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.690
rather than the applications, like this is just one application, like, so, so.

205
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.040
<v 0>Who's to decide exactly. That's, that's.</v>

206
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.210
<v 1>The whole idea, like, so who,</v>

207
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:34.650
what we have not entrusted our government to decide what opinions are acceptable

208
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:37.350
and what aren't. So they, they don't, they don't get to have.

209
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.630
<v 0>Right. But it seems like you're organizing this.</v>

210
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.830
So if you're organizing this sort of a antagonistic display where you know,

211
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:47.490
you're going to hurt someone's feelings in a very dangerous time, right.

212
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.310
Don't you think you should hire your own security? Like,

213
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:52.740
why should the police have to be there to secure you?

214
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.480
<v 1>Because, because this it's the law, like they, they are supposed to, you know,</v>

215
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:01.440
protect like the, again, what, what good are so first amendment rights, right?

216
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.660
Like to be able to, to say, it's, it doesn't protect popular speech, right.

217
00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:09.870
Because public speeches need protection, unpopular speech needs protection.

218
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.200
So it's just, again, it's, the police.

219
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.930
<v 0>Are really there to enforce laws where the law.</v>

220
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.700
<v 1>Is. You don't get to punch somebody.</v>

221
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.400
<v 0>Right. If you know.</v>

222
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.820
<v 1>Okay. So for instance, like go just back to the campus thing for a second,</v>

223
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.700
right? You have these people who have announced,

224
00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.870
we're going to go protest this person. We're not going to let them speak.

225
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.750
Even though they've been granted permission by the, you know,

226
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.600
everybody like that, they're going, they should be able to speak. Right.

227
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.360
We're not gonna let them speak because we don't like their message.

228
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.440
So if the cops know that that's going to happen, like, so, so what happens,

229
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.460
like I'm just trying to.

230
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.620
<v 0>Let them shut it down.</v>

231
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.800
<v 1>Um, but I'm saying, I think that's wrong. I think they, they should be able,</v>

232
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:51.120
they should go. And like, so this is what they veto is what it's called. Right.

233
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.580
I think in, in, in like the cops, can't say, well,

234
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:58.960
obviously this is still back to like, it's not, if the cops say,

235
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.880
well, you can't speak because you're likely to cause a riot or people to,

236
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.680
you know, some, some kind of disturbance,

237
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.790
like they're not allowed to do that based on like, if it's just,

238
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:14.260
this is religious opinion, we weren't saying, we want you to hurt us.

239
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.090
We're not trying to provoke you to hurt us.

240
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:20.200
We're trying to deliver this message that we think is the truth of God. Right?

241
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:21.034
So it wasn't,

242
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.120
there's a difference between like deliberately provoking and inciting violence,

243
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:29.200
like deliberately inciting violence and what we were doing, which was, you know,

244
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:33.070
trying to proclaim this message that we thought was the truth,

245
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.860
our goal wasn't violence. Like we didn't want violence.

246
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:39.760
That's why we contacted the cops. Right. We weren't going to attack them. And,

247
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.230
and we didn't want to be attacked.

248
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.070
We just wanted to be able to exercise our rights without fear of,

249
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.790
without fear of violence. That's, that's the principles of,

250
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.800
of our democracy.

251
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.780
<v 0>All right. Um, so I see what you're saying. And I think that it's, it's,</v>

252
00:12:55.781 --> 00:13:00.190
it gets a little weird when we're talking about people giving speeches on campus

253
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:02.350
and then having other people's shut down those speeches.

254
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:07.480
Because I think that the people who are protesting have as much, right.

255
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.110
Especially if it's in their school, they have as much right.

256
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.850
To voice their concern for this message as the person does distribute that

257
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:17.890
message. And if the police come along and say,

258
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:20.170
we're going to shut down the distribution of this message.

259
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.420
Most of the time they do it when things are out of hand.

260
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.840
So an excellent tool for someone who's trying to silence people is to make sure

261
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:27.670
that things get out of hand. I mean, that's.

262
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.890
<v 1>So that having the cops present, like,</v>

263
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:34.900
and letting both sides have their voices without the ability to resort to

264
00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:36.400
violence. So this is the whole idea,

265
00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:39.070
like we would in these letters that would go out to the cops.

266
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.140
Was that the idea of having a buffer zone? Like, yes, we're going to,

267
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.930
we want to proclaim our message. We want you to be out there too. Like we loved.

268
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.630
And honestly we loved it when counter protesters were there because it just

269
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.700
brought more attention to our message was.

270
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.920
<v 0>I understand that. But I just think that you shouldn't,</v>

271
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.520
obviously it's not you anymore, but I just do not think that anybody,

272
00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:58.870
especially from an offensive group,

273
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.800
like that should be able to allocate resources that are public use. Like police.

274
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.490
<v 1>We obviously, we didn't make the decision, obviously.</v>

275
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.310
Like we didn't make the decision to, for them to like, they decide like, okay,

276
00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:11.140
well, is this likely going to like,

277
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:14.740
so they can either be proactive and set the buffer zone or be reactive.

278
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:17.500
Like we're calling the cops because we're getting punched or whatever.

279
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.520
And cause like, they're going to go out no matter what it was a, we, we,

280
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:25.330
when even when they would say, we're not going to protect you where we would go.

281
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:29.020
Right. I mean, there were obviously, there were rare situations where, uh,

282
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.760
so for instance, like, uh, when Gabby Giffords was shot in Arizona, uh,

283
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.920
we had a couple of, um, an FBI agent actually,

284
00:14:35.921 --> 00:14:40.300
and a guy from the local police department come and say like, you shouldn't go.

285
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.380
And cause there was a nine year old girl who had been killed and the church said

286
00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:48.370
they were going to protest her funeral. Oh Jesus. And uh, so they said,

287
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.280
I don't think we can protect you like this it's too volatile. It's too. Uh,

288
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.220
and so in that case we didn't act, we actually didn't go.

289
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.500
<v 0>That's kind of a chicken show response.</v>

290
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.820
<v 1>Actually. I was going to say like, so the thing is,</v>

291
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:04.610
so I was there during this conversation and my heart,

292
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:07.010
my mom was explaining that we weren't gonna go, um,

293
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.680
it actually had more to do with logistics.

294
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.560
Like we couldn't get there like plane tickets and whatever.

295
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:15.920
Like we just couldn't get there. So it was like, okay, like, that's fine.

296
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:16.754
Like I hear you.

297
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.690
<v 0>It's so reasonable.</v>

298
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:21.230
It's so fascinating to talk to you because you're such an intelligent,

299
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:22.160
reasonable person.

300
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:26.690
It's almost impossible for me to imagine until I see like the

301
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:31.400
little bit of resistance to the idea of this

302
00:15:31.401 --> 00:15:33.770
being a first amendment issue and the police there,

303
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:38.720
then you kind of go back to the church. I could see it boil up inside of you.

304
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.600
<v 1>Well, it's just like we were talking about this a little bit ago.</v>

305
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:44.660
I mean just the whole, the importance of discourse in the marketplace of ideas.

306
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:47.810
This is one like, like again, I, I,

307
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:51.560
I just think it's so important and I think it's important, you know,

308
00:15:51.561 --> 00:15:56.360
because obviously my own personal experience makes me such a believer

309
00:15:56.361 --> 00:15:57.130
in.

310
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:57.131
<v 0>Well,</v>

311
00:15:57.131 --> 00:16:01.820
you've gone a journey through free speech that most people never experience free

312
00:16:01.821 --> 00:16:04.490
speech that you don't even agree with anymore. Right. Yeah.

313
00:16:04.491 --> 00:16:05.750
Which is even more crazy.
