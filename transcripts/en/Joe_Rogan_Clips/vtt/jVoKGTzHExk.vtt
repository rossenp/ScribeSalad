WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.600
<v 0>And someone who knows how to be popular.</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.120
And there's a bunch of people out there that are pro wrestling fans and they

3
00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:11.680
bought right in hook, line and sinker. Yeah. And that's, and, and it's not,

4
00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:13.320
that's a very simplistic version of it.

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.560
There's a lot of other people that wanted to throw a monkey wrench in the

6
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:18.680
system, cuz they thought Hillary Clinton was a crook and she probably is.

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.190
Cuz they're all crooks there's most,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.950
most of those people at the top are at least in some way up. Yes. You know,

9
00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.270
we have an opportunity to bound who Al Franken.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.470
I know Al Franken's just a butt grabber. All things.

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.310
<v 1>Considered, not even, not even did you read the last, the,</v>

12
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:38.990
like the straw that broke the camels back? The last one where the,

13
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:42.780
they all said enough is enough. Who's in the Atlanta antic, this woman, he put,

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.180
she asked for a photo Uhhuh. He put his arm around. His hand was on her waist.

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.140
He squeezes her fat. He squeezed her. He, she said he,

16
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.300
he grabbed a handful of flesh, which is a weird thing to say,

17
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.500
but he squeezed her at least twice is her quote. At least twice.

18
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.460
He had his hand on her waist and she said,

19
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.050
I don't even let my husband touch me that way in public because it demeans me as

20
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.330
a professional woman. Oh God, are you kidding me? Yeah.

21
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.290
Let's I'd like to interview her husband. Like you're not allowed,

22
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:14.690
allowed to put your arm around your wife in public dude. Squeeze her. &lt;laugh&gt;.

23
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.570
I mean, my wife would love to be squeezed. The more, the, the more the merrier.

24
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.770
<v 0>The idea of it is, um, is very strange because that,</v>

25
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.080
that one doesn't make sense.

26
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.560
De lean Tweeten one was the only one that made sense. He there's a photo of him.

27
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.320
She's unconscious, it's demeaning. I get the whole thing.

28
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.720
He apologized for that. And rightly so. And apparently he tried to kiss her,

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.360
but then the butt grabbing is like, well,

30
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.040
you definitely shouldn't be grabbing people's butts. But I mean,

31
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.720
how much of a big deal is it? And.

32
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.470
<v 1>Also do have we still opt? I mean,</v>

33
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:45.910
Chelsea handler was on bill Mar the other night and she said,

34
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.110
I have to believe these women because I'm a woman. And I thought, well,

35
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:54.110
wait a minute. Does that mean I have to believe all men because I'm a man,

36
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.990
isn't there any discussion about whether these things are true or.

37
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.230
<v 0>Not? Or, and Kuya said this best. He said, uh, he put it on Twitter.</v>

38
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.860
He goes saying,

39
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.580
all women are liars is just as crazy as saying all women tell the truth. Right?

40
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.340
<v 2>Well, yeah. I think a lot Franken, I don't know enough about Franken,</v>

41
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:16.940
but a lot of these people it's like, like Weinstein,

42
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:19.780
wasn't like 40 people or something like that. Like 40,

43
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.300
I think when it starts getting up.

44
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.770
<v 1>Up in the, and also what he's accused of is it's.</v>

45
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.130
<v 0>A different thing. We're not talking about taking pictures with people.</v>

46
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:29.210
They where they like you,

47
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.970
they wanna take a picture with you and you grab their waist.

48
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.050
We're talking about, I mean, he's been accused of rape. Yeah.

49
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.290
By more than one woman, like actual rape rape,

50
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.370
not just like getting someone drunk and having sex with 'em,

51
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:43.090
but like holding them down type rape. Yeah. There's a lot of he's.

52
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.960
There's a lot of crazy. See, here's, what's kind of. Um,

53
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.560
if prostitution was legal,

54
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.280
would that exist or is it a power thing? Is it always a power thing?

55
00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:01.680
Like, does he want to like have sex with the star of his films?

56
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.760
Cause that's.

57
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.760
<v 1>I think it's more a question of if,</v>

58
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.600
if there weren't so many teenage boys who never got laid,

59
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.480
what would the society look like? And by this, I don't mean to excuse anyone.

60
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.320
And I don't mean to say teenage girls should be more promiscuous or anything.

61
00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:19.870
I'm you're just looking at objectively.

62
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.990
I'm saying that guys like Harvey Weinstein,

63
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.270
that dude didn't get laid in high school. Right? Most of the,

64
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.910
you look at these mass shootings, a lot of these guys in their,

65
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.190
in their suicide notes say I'm doing this because I can't get laid.

66
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.470
I'm gonna die of Virgin. That's that's the one begins actually, uh,

67
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.900
there's this massive amount of fresh situation that builds up cuz

68
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.100
biologically, most boys are horny, little monsters at 13 or 14.

69
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.900
They're not getting laid, wait, hold.

70
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.733
<v 0>On, go with this please.</v>

71
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.020
<v 1>Sorry. And so it gets to the point. So there, there may be five,</v>

72
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.620
six years between when a boy is totally obsessed

73
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.930
with not just sex, but with being acceptable to women,

74
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.010
being loved by women being touched, being caressed, you know, being,

75
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.450
and they can't think about anything else and they're not getting it.

76
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.450
And so I think a lot of boys grow up with extreme frustration that either

77
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.210
curls into misogyny, where you get these like mass killers who kill,

78
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.960
who do they kill hookers, right, right. Sexually liberated free women in,

79
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:27.080
in their perspective. And you get guys that just chase money,

80
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.800
their whole lives because they think the money and the power is gonna get them,

81
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:31.634
those women.

82
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.080
And so when they get to that place and they're still disgusting and they,

83
00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:39.920
they sense that the women don't even wanna them or they only them because

84
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:41.430
they're gonna get something from them.

85
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.510
Then there's all this self hatred and shame. I think that's,

86
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:47.710
what's being expressed here. So I think it is power.

87
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.030
And I do think that it having it's an,

88
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.750
it's an expression or a manifestation of a deeply sex,

89
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.310
negative pathological culture.

90
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.231
<v 0>But conversely,</v>

91
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.870
how do you feel about like women that were in attractive in high school?

92
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.430
How come they don't lash out in the same way?

93
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.660
And they're not out there raping dudes? Well, one because counting.

94
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.620
<v 1>'Em down, women are much better at accepting, uh,</v>

95
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:09.220
their sexual situation.

96
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.740
You see women have accepted a lot of that men aren't able to accept for,

97
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.500
you know, millennia that's partly biological and probably partly cultural,

98
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.250
but also because I mean, women can have sex.

99
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.770
Even women who aren't particularly attractive because the, the, the whole, uh,

100
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:30.050
market is so skewed in the other direction.

101
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.090
Even women who aren't particularly attractive probably don't have much trouble

102
00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:36.130
getting laid in high school.

103
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.690
<v 0>But I don't think it's just that.</v>

104
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.520
I think you're boiling it down to getting laid. That's a reduction, this thing,

105
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.360
I think, or it's way more emotions.

106
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.000
<v 1>Touch. And especially with women though.</v>

107
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.040
<v 0>But an unattractive woman who was a hard time finding a boyfriend, you know,</v>

108
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.040
someone who loves her, someone who wants to be emotionally connected to her,

109
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.200
that probably is just as painful to a woman,

110
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.920
as a guy who can't find maybe more painful. Yeah.

111
00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:00.600
Than a guy who can't find sex partners.

112
00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.920
<v 1>In psychology. They say that men express their, their,</v>

113
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.680
these feelings through anger and women through depression and sadness. Right.

114
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.840
So you probably don't see women lashing out and killing a bunch of dudes.

115
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:15.000
You see them being depressed and feeling like. And when you do, they.

116
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.670
<v 0>Have high testosterone. That's why I test women.</v>

117
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.510
<v 2>Another point to be made here is, is that like, you know,</v>

118
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:24.870
people do say the thing, oh, well like people like Harvey Weinstein,

119
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.230
they wanted all this money to get laid. But I don't, I do not think that's it.

120
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.390
I think what people like Harvey Weinstein probably enjoy is power.

121
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.740
It's not like, oh, I want to get laid. I'm gonna become this mass. It's like,

122
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.140
I like to dominate. I'm a dominating force. That's what I am.

123
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.500
I'm going to, I enjoy like having people around me who worship me.

124
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.060
And as part of that, I'm going to dominate my interns.

125
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.700
I'm gonna dominate my employees. And when I'm around women,

126
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.970
I'm gonna to use my I'm gonna jerk off in house plants in front.

127
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.810
I mean, it's like, really the IUs. But you know, you gotta,

128
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:08.610
you gotta really think about that. It's like, I, I don't, I don't,

129
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.491
I know what you're saying.

130
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:12.290
How poor Harvey Weinstein when he was in front of the.

131
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.450
<v 0>Up. That's not what he's saying. Well, I.</v>

132
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.410
<v 2>The thing of the, the he's not getting touched enough. Well, no, no.</v>

133
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.760
<v 0>No. But like, this is, there's a lot of frustration.</v>

134
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.520
That's inherently connected to this suppressive sexual culture that we find

135
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:28.840
ourselves embroiled in that we don't necessarily agree with. Right.

136
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.600
<v 1>I mean, why are pretty little boys? Why are, you know, because one,</v>

137
00:07:32.601 --> 00:07:35.520
that's the only access they have two, they're less likely to tell on them.

138
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.480
And three there's self. I just.

139
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.470
<v 0>I recidivism.</v>

140
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.190
<v 2>I like to do a little thought experiment, which is, I like to imagine what,</v>

141
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.910
where my head's gotta be.

142
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.950
If I jerk off into a house plant in front of somebody, if you,

143
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.070
if you've tried that, just, just think about it.

144
00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.990
Like where would what's going on with you? Christmas tree.

145
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.790
<v 0>Yeah. It might be like you just celebrating &lt;laugh&gt; okay.</v>

146
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.300
<v 2>It's like new year's Eve. Okay. How just.</v>

147
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:04.580
<v 1>He.</v>

148
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.940
<v 0>Doesn't have upstanding. And if you jerk off in the plant,</v>

149
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:09.380
the plant's gonna absorb it and he's just leaving his DNA all.

150
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.900
<v 1>Over the plant. It's probably good for the plant.</v>

151
00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.820
<v 2>Toot. It is', it's terrible for plants. Not my jigs Weinstein.</v>

152
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.580
<v 0>Is my S is great for plants, bro. Plant.</v>

153
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.460
<v 2>Wonder where that plant is.</v>

154
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.610
<v 0>That plans alive. It's running for Senate alpha.</v>

155
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.690
<v 1>Come coming soon from on it. Dot com Joe,</v>

156
00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:30.370
come, you can probably sell your come. Right? I.

157
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:31.650
<v 0>Don't want anybody having more time,</v>

158
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.770
but don't you think that's all these things?

159
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.210
Uh it's I think it's certainly this sex is, it's not just a,

160
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.280
a power thing because he is not just exercising power.

161
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.240
He's exercising power in a sexual way. Yeah. It's not just power.

162
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.360
I think it's the game.

163
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.960
Like we were talking about like corporations and even police officers and guys

164
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:54.000
like Jeff sessions who have the game to arrest people.

165
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.680
That is the game they play. They get really good at it. That's what the game is.

166
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.800
The game with a guy like him is I can't believe I get to what's her name?

167
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.720
You know, name, famous actress. And that famous actress is on her stomach. Uh,

168
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.080
and your mouth her like, whoa, really? Is this really happening? And it,

169
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:13.360
why is it really happening? It's happening,

170
00:09:13.361 --> 00:09:16.190
cuz you're gonna let her be cat one or whatever the the movie is, right? Yeah.

171
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.230
Yeah. There's, there's some nutiness to it. There's some craziness,

172
00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:23.310
there's some forbidden thing to it. There's some, there's a bunch of,

173
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.550
a bunch of things in play. Power's one of the dynamics.

174
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.870
It's just the most foul one because all the other ones like the sexual

175
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.350
frustration and stuff doesn't seem so gross. It's like when you,

176
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.180
when you you're, you're imposing your will on someone, then it's unquestionably.

177
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:42.220
It's an expression of power. Like once you are raping, once you're coercing,

178
00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:45.460
once you're imposing your will and you're saying, I'm gonna, you know,

179
00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:49.180
take away your career. If you don't let me have sexual intercourse with you.

180
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.660
Well then it's a hundred percent power thing. Yeah. Like how did it get there?

181
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.460
There's a lot of things. And I think you've got.

182
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.050
<v 1>To got a lot of and does power. I mean, I,</v>

183
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.170
I guess I have an exercise sufficient power in my life to know the answer to

184
00:10:02.171 --> 00:10:03.090
this question, but does,

185
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.530
does dominance feel good directly or is it,

186
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:11.250
is it something that comes to you indirectly? So in other words,

187
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:15.730
does it feel good to dominate someone else or

188
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.280
because then you can get something that you want from them.

189
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.600
<v 0>I think it's something that you want from them. And I think there's,</v>

190
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:25.520
there's also there's I think human beings are connected to each other in

191
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.560
an undeniable way. And I think that if you are exercising power over someone,

192
00:10:30.561 --> 00:10:34.880
like say, if you hate to paint the scenario, but just say, if you rape someone,

193
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.510
you are sexually attracted to someone your low with you and you rape them.

194
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:41.990
And if you have any conscience at all, if you, you know, they're screaming, no,

195
00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:44.910
and you're still having sex with them and you come and then after you have to

196
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:48.830
think about it, like you would be horrified at yourself, right?

197
00:10:48.831 --> 00:10:53.750
Like the level of self hatred would be almost unimaginable that you've imposed

198
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.790
yourself. And you're your, your, your twisted sickness.

199
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:02.500
And in the heart of that moment, you know, the, the, the,

200
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.940
the power dynamic, trying to impose the power, it can't possibly feel good.

201
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.180
I think it's just a thing. I think it's just a,

202
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.540
almost like a creepy leftover reptilian instinct.
