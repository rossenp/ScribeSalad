00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 1>Experience. You know,</v>

3
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.330
and I think one of the reasons for that is we have a rate of something like 2000

4
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.640
species a year being deemed extinct, right?

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.460
So when you have that many animals being extinct every year,

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.520
there's there's flags being put up, is it really extinct?

7
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:17.100
Have we looked everywhere? And so this, you know,

8
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:18.240
I don't want to say I was the first,

9
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:21.450
but I feel like I was in that wave of first people to start looking into

10
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:25.560
extinction. Um, as far as an ongoing animals, wrongfully deemed extinct.

11
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:29.040
And now it's like, it's like mainstream in the biology world. It's like,

12
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.300
there's a lot of people that are like,

13
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.220
I'm going to go see if I can find this thing. Is it.

14
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.890
<v 0>Because it's a romantic sort of thing? There's a lot of cash.</v>

15
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.510
Like if you can find an S seemed to be extinct Barbara

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.650
Russa.

17
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.050
<v 1>I think so. I think it's very romantic, you know,</v>

18
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:46.050
as opposed to just setting out to study something that we know that's there,

19
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:50.100
this like harrowing journey to find this creature that the world has written

20
00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:51.390
off. It's very romantic.

21
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.180
<v 0>You have you ever heard of the orang? Pendek.</v>

22
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.200
<v 1>Oh, this is like a, this is a cryptid right? Yes. What is I I've heard this.</v>

23
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.130
<v 0>Word. Any monkey person. That's right. Did we.</v>

24
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.930
<v 1>Talk about this last time? We might've.</v>

25
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.880
<v 0>Yeah, I'm very repetitive. That's.</v>

26
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.890
<v 1>Okay. I don't mind. It's still fun. It's not in my wheelhouse, you know,</v>

27
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.640
like the cryptids the Lochness.

28
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.000
<v 0>That's what they think is in Vietnam. Um,</v>

29
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.560
I think it's in Vietnam and maybe some other parts of Southeast Asia and, um,

30
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.510
the, the, the most people thought it was nonsense until the, uh,

31
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.920
homo floresiensis until they found out about that Hobbit person that lives in

32
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.180
the island of Flores. And then they're like, okay, hold on or lived, right.

33
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.380
Say right. As recently as 14,000 years ago. Right?

34
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.560
So when they found out about that thing, they're like, well, mate,

35
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.520
maybe these little are still hanging around, out there somewhere.

36
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.630
Just you're dealing with incredibly dense jungle. And they're very wary.

37
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.630
If you're a person stomping through the jungle, something that lives there,

38
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.040
here's you a mile away for sure. You, you, you're not sneaking up on them.

39
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.370
<v 1>No. Well, we, this year, um, I went into song dune,</v>

40
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.390
which is the world's largest cave. That was only discovered in 1995.

41
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.040
It's this massive opening, six miles of underground cave.

42
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.050
You know, you don't see daylight for two days,

43
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:10.920
six miles it's you should look at the pictures of this place. You'll love it.

44
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:13.740
I mean, it's just this, it looks like something out of avatar. I mean,

45
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.730
this cave you can fit in New York city skyscrapers inside of it. It's so big.

46
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.890
It has its own weather system. Yeah. It's it's where is this song?

47
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.760
So it's in the Annamite mountain range between Vietnam and Laos. And, uh,

48
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.850
we got to go into it this year because we were looking for this habitat.

49
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.130
In fact, this is my show that comes out tonight. Uh,

50
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.420
we were looking for this habitat.

51
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.220
<v 0>So people can hear animal.</v>

52
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.300
<v 1>Planet extend your alive. Um, tonight at 9:00 PM on animal planet,</v>

53
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.220
we go into Songdo cave set your DVRs.

54
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.053
<v 0>Kids plug.</v>

55
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.350
<v 1>But.</v>

56
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.910
<v 0>Um, let's see this. Oh my God. Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.150
<v 1>There there's, you know, hanging song doing that's the entrance to it. And like,</v>

58
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.490
look at the size of it. The scope of it is.

59
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.060
<v 0>Nothing to compare it to. What am I looking at? I'm seeing the.</v>

60
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.200
<v 1>It was a little tense. People, people, those are tents.</v>

61
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.720
There's full lake in there and.

62
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 0>That's inside the tent. I mean, that's inside the key. Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.270
<v 1>Look at the wedding cake. That one right there. That's called the wedding cake.</v>

64
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.420
It's yeah, that one. It's this pyres. I mean, it's just,

65
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:12.490
it's the most fantastic looking thing.

66
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.660
That is a person standing on top of that little Pyre right there for sky.

67
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.093
<v 0>God. Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.960
<v 1>That's insane. It's insane.</v>

69
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.810
More people have summited Everest than have been through that cave.

70
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.630
<v 0>Wow. Well people summit Evers every day now.</v>

71
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.560
<v 1>Wow. That's why, but yeah, so we that's the wedding cake.</v>

72
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.360
<v 0>My God, that's incredible. I have.</v>

73
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.430
<v 1>A picture just like that. That I'm very proud of.</v>

74
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.730
<v 0>God. That's so spectacular.</v>

75
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.870
<v 1>But what's amazing is about two thirds of the way through the system.</v>

76
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:44.050
You can see where what you're looking at is areas where the cave roof has

77
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:47.350
collapsed and there's isolated pockets of ecosystem. Right?

78
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.440
So we were talking about the pygmy people that could live in the forest of

79
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:51.274
Vietnam.

80
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.260
This is the kind of my point is this giant six mile long cave with these huge

81
00:03:56.261 --> 00:03:59.530
openings wasn't even discovered until I think 95.

82
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.390
So what's to say a tribe of small people couldn't hide in something like that

83
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:08.380
and move in and out and never be seen. I mean, it's, it's fantastic.

84
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.420
<v 0>There was a stupid movie about people that lived on the ground that eight</v>

85
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:15.490
people remember that this chicks.

86
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.350
<v 1>Was that the cave in the sin. The.</v>

87
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.020
<v 0>Was.</v>

88
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.560
<v 1>Yeah. So my whole team watched, we, we, we spent like, when we were going,</v>

89
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.480
like leading up to this expedition, we're like, all right,

90
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.910
let's watch a bunch of bad art cave movies before.

91
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.990
<v 0>The first one's bad. The second one is so bad. It's it's funny. Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.590
They did a descent too. And you're like, wait, ah.

93
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.240
<v 2>I'm. You are bringing that up. I stumbled across a video potential.</v>

94
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.270
It's obviously probably not real of an orange pen deck. No, it's.

95
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.440
<v 0>Totally real. Jamie.</v>

96
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.680
<v 2>Have you ever seen this? These guys are on bikes,</v>

97
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:50.590
Dick and this thing runs out in front of them. Let me see.

98
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.410
It doesn't look like CGI is the only thing I'm going with at the moment.

99
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.640
It probably it's obviously, probably.

100
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.770
<v 1>Definitely a person. It.</v>

101
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.650
<v 2>Had a tail or something like they would do like freeze frames of it.</v>

102
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.100
What I stopped watching because you guys took me on the cave thing,

103
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:06.430
but it's a 10 minute video. If you,

104
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.190
neither of you have seen this before that I've never seen it in a.

105
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.120
<v 0>New there in.</v>

106
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.700
<v 2>Vietnam. I think so, bro,</v>

107
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.410
if they were just out riding their bikes in this thing,

108
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.660
they caught it on their GoPros and they're trying to find it.

109
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.590
Let's see that they could also be trying to troll everyone on the internet.

110
00:05:20.591 --> 00:05:20.830
I don't know.

111
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.820
<v 0>No. These guys have a troll, uh, video. I mean, what is their,</v>

112
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.470
their YouTube page? Have you gone to any.

113
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.820
<v 2>It's on a, it's like on a big foot Webster Sasquatch Crump was this.</v>

114
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.530
<v 1>It remember in men and black, how they used to always check the, uh,</v>

115
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.791
whatever it was called,

116
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:39.750
a check like the national Enquirer for like tips on aliens.

117
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.840
Because where else do you go to get this info though?

118
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.540
<v 0>Let me see this again. Pop out right here.</v>

119
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.500
Here. It goes there, right there.

120
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.210
<v 1>That's definitely a person or a humanoid. It's really.</v>

121
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.200
<v 2>Tiny. Whatever it.</v>

122
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.033
<v 1>Is. Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.360
<v 0>That's right. I'm pretty fast. Well,</v>

124
00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:07.420
it also could be like. Yeah, yeah. Could be,

125
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.710
but it could be a little monkey person like me.

126
00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:15.550
We know those little monkey people were real. Yeah, exactly. God.

127
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.350
Imagine if that's real.

128
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.160
<v 1>And keep in mind. And again, I'm not like a huge crypted guy, but keep in mind,</v>

129
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.130
you know, as a, as a homosapien, they have a higher intellect,

130
00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:28.240
which means they're better at avoiding people. Right. So it's, you know, it's,

131
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.380
it's not unreasonable to say if it was a group of small humanoids out there that

132
00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:34.330
didn't want to be discovered they could stay hidden.

133
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.400
<v 0>Yeah. And if it's really small, you know, and,</v>

134
00:06:38.401 --> 00:06:41.860
and also some sort of a hominid that has intelligence,

135
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.070
it's probably got a pretty decent food source in the jungle,

136
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.010
but they would find a dead one. Wouldn't they.

137
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.040
<v 1>That's always the argument. Right. Why isn't there a road kill?</v>

138
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.700
<v 0>Yeah. But the thing is like, there is all,</v>

139
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:58.990
a lot of mountain lions. Good luck finding a dead one.

140
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.870
Yeah. Yeah. There's that look at that.

141
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.250
<v 1>That's like the best screenshots. That's a tail that looks like a spear. Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.340
Who knows? Who's what's to say that isn't a short guy,

143
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.490
who's been poaching and he's like, crap, I'm getting busted. Right.

144
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.740
But it doesn't mean it's not fascinating.

145
00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:18.310
And this is the kind of stuff that we Wade through in droves to try and figure

146
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:20.620
out, you know, are these animals, are these creatures?

147
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:25.180
<v 0>That's so weird. Got it.</v>

148
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.550
I'm such a sucker though. Oh, that thing looks like it's wearing shorts,

149
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:32.530
dude. Doesn't it?

150
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.740
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And it's running.</v>

151
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.740
<v 0>Exactly like a person that's a little false, but it's so little right.</v>

152
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:43.240
Incredible kid. That's the thing about the, it could be a little kid. Yeah.

153
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.710
But that's the thing about the orange pen deck is that they think it was like

154
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.580
the homo floresiensis I think they think it's really the same thing in the homo

155
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.440
floresiensis was really a three-foot tall four feet. Yeah. Right? Yeah.

156
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.090
Some subset. Yup. That's another image. Oh, wow.

157
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.460
Yeah. That looks like a little person, man. It looks weird though.

158
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:04.294
It's got a hat.

159
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.330
<v 1>That's where we're in a Disneyland.</v>

160
00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:10.960
They're pointing out the ears because it matches the orange pen deck images of

161
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.823
that.

162
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.190
<v 0>Sasquatch type head or something. Dude.</v>

163
00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:18.220
That is a person with a stick and they're.

164
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.030
<v 1>And there that creature looks naked. It doesn't look like there's shorts on.</v>

165
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.390
Yeah.

166
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.110
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. It does. So how tall do you think that is?</v>

167
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.330
That looks really short, fast. I mean short and like three feet tall.

168
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:36.460
<v 1>Going into tall grass. Right? What's that three foot grass. Four foot grass.</v>

169
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.900
<v 0>That's so weird. Okay. So here's a size comparison. See,</v>

170
00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:44.350
I'm such a sucker. Look at, look out, look, there's a size comparison.

171
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.360
That is tiny, man. It's tiny.

172
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.800
<v 1>It's really tiny.</v>

173
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:48.873
<v 0>Oh my God. It's real.</v>

174
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.060
I want to believe so bad. It's such a moral.

175
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.930
It's such a moron when it comes to this stuff.

176
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.450
I believe in big foot for so long yesterday, so bad.

177
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.970
<v 1>It's between 80 and 150 centimeters,</v>

178
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.870
which is somewhere between 30 and 60 inches tall. So it's three to five feet,

179
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:07.140
three to.

180
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.230
<v 0>Four feet. Tiny little thing. It's amazing.</v>

181
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.250
<v 1>I hope it's real. Yeah, I do too. I do too. Yeah. I mean, it's fantastic.</v>

182
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.880
Do you hope.

183
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.800
<v 0>Would you rather not knowing and it lives or someone</v>

184
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:21.510
kills it and you find out that it's real.

185
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.580
<v 1>I'd rather not knowing and it lives meat for.</v>

186
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.960
<v 0>Sure. Yeah. Me too. But I feel like a. Yeah. I want to know,</v>

187
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.650
but I don't want it to die. Right, right. You know what? Come on, man.

188
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.700
Just tell me.

189
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.260
<v 1>Blurry. Does the line get in that situation because it's, it's humanoid. Right?</v>

190
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.094
So it's like,

191
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.640
it's not like you're catching and putting them in zoos to breed them and keep

192
00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:45.210
the population up. Like that gets really dicey.
