<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 4>You can match. If you get your together,</v>

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.280
you could be talking like biggie and making everybody look stupid. Right.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.720
<v 1>You know that crazy. One night we was in LA and, um,</v>

5
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.150
it was like within Hollywood,

6
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:19.770
somewhere and pock had biggie bunny and we was just on stage rapping and.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.740
And everybody was freestyle and warranty, biggie, pock, and myself,

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.850
and maybe some video footage of that. Let's see if you can find that biggie,

9
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:34.740
Snoop Tupac orange-y freestyling in Hollywood. Wow.

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.220
Yeah, that was hard. And we didn't really know because at the time,

11
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.770
so we were looking at who was this fat,

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.760
rapper rapping was like, whenever,

13
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.320
when the words came out of his mouth,

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.260
stopped looking at what he looked like and was like. He got his.

15
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.470
<v 0>One of my favorite videos in all of hip hop is biggie on the corner in Brooklyn</v>

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.710
when he was 17 years old. Have you seen that?

17
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.960
<v 1>Yeah, let's do this right here.</v>

18
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.640
There's people in the crowd.

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.090
<v 0>Biggie on stage.</v>

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.110
<v 1>Corrupt tip Qaeda.</v>

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.880
<v 0>Do you think when it comes to.</v>

22
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.910
<v 1>Right there, he wouldn't even own that for a records. That's this? That,</v>

23
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:27.060
this is the crazy part. They go biggie right there.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.260
<v 0>And what year was this? 93.</v>

25
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.810
<v 1>It wasn't even on death row records.</v>

26
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.190
He was just my homeboy that came through to with me. And he brought,

27
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.010
because Woody see now big,

28
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.860
they got a warranty right there.

29
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.923
Technique.

30
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.750
<v 0>He had an explosive.</v>

31
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.300
<v 1>He on the west coast, in LA.</v>

32
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.430
<v 0>How good is his style?</v>

33
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.393
<v 1>Wrapping a warrant. GB.</v>

34
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.220
<v 0>Give me some volume, Jamie.</v>

35
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.970
[inaudible] See if you can find that video of him when he was 17 years old on a

36
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:18.180
street corner. That's one of my favorites.

37
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.400
Cause you see like a dude is like, you know,

38
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.950
just a couple of years removed from being a kid.

39
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.860
<v 1>Let's see, people don't even know that exists. Right?</v>

40
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.620
You just gave us some exclusive right there. That's on YouTube,

41
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.560
but they don't know what exactly it.

42
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.240
<v 0>Is here it is. This is my favorite. Give me some volume on that.</v>

43
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.700
He's in front of a grocery store for.

44
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.743
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

45
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.910
<v 0>Imagine being out there and seen a 17 year old kid rapping like that.</v>

46
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:24.250
You're like, oh, it's over. It's over.

47
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.810
I was so good. I need a cigar. You ever smoke regular cigars?

48
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.080
<v 1>Nah, I don't with those. They'd give me head rush.</v>

49
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.833
I gotta have my right.

50
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.380
<v 0>I imagine someone being that good at 17 years old.</v>

51
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.100
<v 1>I don't know a bunch of cats like that.</v>

52
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.850
<v 0>Video. I played it before only has 4,000 views on it. Wow.</v>

53
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.610
<v 1>I'll tell you, Joe, you owe a thousand. You finna make this.</v>

54
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:01.330
And I'm only reason why I'm saying this is because I seen it one night on

55
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.520
accident. I only seen a little piece of it and I was like,

56
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.990
I remember that night. That was like some cool we had. Did they go Snoop Dogg,

57
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.730
young snow globe for you had long hair.

58
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.890
<v 0>So what is this? This one was 4,006 interview. It says Tupac and biggie onstage.</v>

59
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:19.690
1993. Rare. Just try to find that on YouTube and it'll pop up and that's

60
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.990
4,612 views as of today.

61
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.650
<v 1>I bet you. Next time we talk that gonna have 400 some thousand bills.</v>

62
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.080
<v 0>Yeah. Today's November 11.</v>

63
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.190
<v 1>This is 93. When we all cool. Right?</v>

64
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.960
We all chilling. We all know west coast, Tupac brought biggie with him.

65
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.010
We rocking. We let her get down with us. We go in the back, smoke, chill,

66
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:43.480
hang out. It's beautiful.

67
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.340
<v 0>When did it go? Sideways?</v>

68
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.050
<v 1>Once pod got shot. When he got shot,</v>

69
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.700
he felt like they did it. But.

70
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.180
<v 0>This was when he got shot in New York before he got shot in Vegas.</v>

71
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.153
<v 1>And.</v>

72
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.450
<v 0>He felt like someone from the west coast was involved. No.</v>

73
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.710
<v 1>Or.</v>

74
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.390
<v 0>From the east coast, excuse me. Yes.</v>

75
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.880
<v 1>And later information came up that the people that he thought did it had</v>

76
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:11.170
nothing to do with it. So.

77
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.010
<v 0>So by him accusing people of it, it kind of sat there.</v>

78
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.480
<v 1>And then by him being bailed out by death row records and death row records add</v>

79
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:22.600
more gasoline to the fire and him being a part of the most gangster,

80
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.830
his labeling the world that his opposition didn't want no issues with.

81
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.150
It only exited on as opposed to let's find a resolution.

82
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.620
Now let's keep making it more of a problem. Right. You know, in hindsight,

83
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:38.890
we should've been sitting him down saying, nah, let's not go after him.

84
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:42.490
Let's just make great music. And you know you on bail right now.

85
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.550
He wasn't even out of jail. He was out on bail when he got killed.

86
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.273
<v 0>It's um,</v>

87
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.720
it's obviously you're dealing with giant cultural

88
00:05:55.721 --> 00:06:00.170
influences and big business too. Cause the, the business of rap is big business,

89
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.090
but there's comparisons to that and what's happening with other countries.

90
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.860
<v 1>It really is. Yeah, man, man, but you can all get along, but Joe,</v>

91
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:13.850
did you see this? They see how pure that was. Yes I did. Yeah, I did.

92
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.230
We were all young. I was 22. Pock was 22.

93
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.910
We was all the same age. So it was like,

94
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.230
this is us at 22 years old being young MCs competitive.

95
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.150
You see the spirit, he was rapping when he was rapping.

96
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:28.640
Like he was battling the same way he was rapping on the corner. Right.

97
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.510
Same spirit. But that's what hip hop was like. We,

98
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.570
we enjoy when somebody could come and hold his own.

99
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.970
<v 0>But what's really crazy is if that's 1993,</v>

100
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.680
that is at the very most

101
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.020
a ten-year-old art form.

102
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.570
<v 1>15 At.</v>

103
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.850
<v 0>15, 15 at the most. Yeah. 15 like w where it really emerges.</v>

104
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.780
Right.

105
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.760
So within 15 years you have from almost no

106
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.150
influence to almost the most influence.

107
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.910
<v 1>Depending on what month that was either.</v>

108
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:15.440
I just caught the case or I hadn't caught the case and the way I'm looking

109
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.360
on it don't look like I caught a case. Wow. By the way. Yeah.

110
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.930
I'm looking at my spirit and my body and right. You're not thinking about it.

111
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.290
Yeah. And when I caught the case, all that kind of was over with right.
