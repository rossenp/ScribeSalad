00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.680
Have you seen these bricks that people have been finding at all these different

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.640
sites where people are protesting Uhuh, these organized stacks of bricks?

4
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.000
No. Yeah, man. Look, this is, I'm gonna send Jamie,

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm gonna send you one that Eddie sent me that's who do you think is.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.833
<v 1>Putting that?</v>

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.990
<v 0>That's the question, right? It's like who is, who is putting that? Is it Antifa?</v>

8
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.003
Is it the cops?

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.590
It's is it someone who wants someone to throw a brick so that they can impart

10
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.190
martial law? Like what is it? Yeah.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.510
<v 1>I, I, you know, my, my brain always goes to conspiratorial here.</v>

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.460
<v 0>It is mysterious. Brick piles appear throughout major protest cities. I mean,</v>

13
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.900
these are, these are bricks that are appearing,

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.860
that don't have a reason to be there. Jamie,

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.100
I'm gonna send you this video that, uh, Eddie sent me because this is I'll. Uh,

16
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:54.660
I'll air. Drop it to you, buddy. God, man. It's the car too.

17
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.980
And the big car they said in, uh, long ditch yesterday left a car out there.

18
00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.741
Hey,

19
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:03.250
they looked car who leaves a free car off would just take to a free police car.

20
00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:07.610
Yeah. So they left an old police car out there. And then on top of that, this,

21
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.850
uh, this old, why is this not, would you look at this? Okay.

22
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.210
Jamie I'm air dropping to you right now. So this old police car,

23
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.090
and then these three,

24
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.610
you have all these protestors and then these three people move in a very

25
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.320
organized fashion. And there's a, a guy who made a video about it.

26
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:28.200
Have you seen the video, Jamie, where the guy breaks down these, the Antifa,

27
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.960
have you seen that? I'll send you the video. This, this is weird. What's that?

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.880
I never saw this. Yeah. Okay. Put it up on the screen too. I,

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.800
I gotta figure out how to do it. Send photos. Oh, I see. That's so crazy.

30
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.590
So there's these, there it is. So these random pallets of bricks,

31
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:47.470
this is very organized. This is on Ventura Boulevard out here in LA,

32
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.190
or I think it's in north Hollywood.

33
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.110
So these pallets of bricks are just sitting there, like,

34
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:56.070
look at this. What? Yeah.

35
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.150
<v 1>They're just like, like riot supplies.</v>

36
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.630
<v 0>Exactly riot supplies and what exactly.</v>

37
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.220
So who's doing this, this is very organized. I mean,

38
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:06.580
there's many stacks of these.

39
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.740
<v 1>Bricks. It's very an anarchist. Well, is it? Cause it's organized, but I mean,</v>

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.500
why?

41
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.260
<v 0>I mean, well, it's fuel for anarchy, right? Yeah. But.</v>

42
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.380
<v 1>I just, I wonder look, look at this. Or do you think, do you think, I mean,</v>

43
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.380
here's another theory.

44
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.370
It could be possibly performance art &lt;laugh&gt; I mean, I mean,

45
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.290
and I'm, I'm not saying that like as a joke,

46
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.130
but like some performance artists like go to that length, but that's very,

47
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.810
very organized and very ominous and very weird. I mean,

48
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.370
I hope that those were reported and that the police like picked.

49
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.370
<v 0>Them up. Well, one thing that is happening that's promising is that these, uh,</v>

50
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.850
provocateurs yeah.

51
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.880
Are getting caught by actual of black lives matter protestors and grabbing them.

52
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.360
And these that are breaking windows and spray painting things like they're

53
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:53.480
grabbing these people and saying, Hey, you. And they're,

54
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.280
they're turning these people in. Like these people are smashing things,

55
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:00.040
thank the Lords. But they're recognizing that this is damaging to this.

56
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.160
Like there's a great moment in time right now where we can enact real change.

57
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.040
<v 2>He mandated that nursing homes take back in yes and 43% of</v>

58
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:11.640
coronavirus death are nursing homes.

59
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:16.440
And this is a nursing home pandemic mandated that they take back in recovering

60
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.430
COVID patients. And he happens that he got a, you know,

61
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.790
million dollar plus campaign check for his reelection through a affiliated

62
00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:28.910
committee before he got reelected. And so he also put,

63
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.510
made sure to put into place a liability for all their executives so that if they

64
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.750
don't do a good job, they can't be held liable.

65
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.540
And that data shows is correlated with increased COVID

66
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.420
death and infection rates,

67
00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.580
because they know that they're not gonna be held responsible.

68
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:46.300
So there's a lower threshold there.

69
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.660
So there were very specific decisions that were really bad and fueled the worst

70
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:51.860
outbreak in the entire country.

71
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.060
But because he can get on TV and give a commanding press conference,

72
00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:59.140
that's all people really care about. He's got like 80% approval rating. Yeah.

73
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.630
He's.

74
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.770
<v 0>Spoken about the recovering COVID patients being readmitted to the nursing</v>

75
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.270
homes.

76
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.570
<v 2>Not much because his brother it's the best part on CNN is primetime anchor,</v>

77
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:09.390
Chris Cuomo.

78
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.090
And they do these ridiculous interviews where they like joke around about how

79
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:17.290
big his nose is rather than asking. Yeah. Questions like that. And look,

80
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.930
it'd be one thing. If you were gonna have your brother on once or 12,

81
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.040
like I get it fine. You know, but no night after night after night,

82
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.160
it's the show of the two brothers chumming it up while people are dying.

83
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:31.760
This is a politician who's supposed to be held to account that is supposed to be

84
00:04:31.761 --> 00:04:31.920
your.

85
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.120
<v 3>Role around with his brother, joking about the size of their nose and the swab.</v>

86
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.760
Well, there are like literally thousands of old elderly people who died because

87
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.270
explicitly this decision, now we're not saying he knew of the decision,

88
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.670
but like there needs to be some like scrutiny and accountability of that.

89
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.390
Nobody at CNN wants to touch it. Cuz Chris GU was the anchor.

90
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.790
Nobody at MSNBC wants to touch it because he is a Democrat because he's the

91
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:53.391
biggest Democrat.

92
00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:56.430
And they all live in New York and they all probably have dinner with each other.

93
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:57.231
And of course, I mean,

94
00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:59.510
people on the right are talking about it because he is a Democrat,

95
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.540
but like there's no, I mean, outside crystal and a few others on the left.

96
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.780
<v 2>You wearing and on the right they're total hypocrites too.</v>

97
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.460
Fox news picks it up with this like liability story and how he gets this

98
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:09.181
through. Meanwhile, Mitch,

99
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:12.820
McConnell's proposing the same thing at a national level and they're like a okay

100
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:13.980
with that. So, I mean,

101
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:18.180
this gets back to the sort of central concept of the show,

102
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.570
which is we don't do that. Like yeah, if it's a dark, we're gonna, you know,

103
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.810
we're like, you up on this thing. Like, let's talk about it.

104
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.690
If it's a Republican, we're gonna do the same thing. And that's the way, I mean,

105
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:33.970
at a basic level, that's the it's supposed to be. And it it's a big,

106
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.690
big problem. Again,

107
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:39.890
going back to this moment that we're living in because no one trusts anyone and

108
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:43.600
for good reason, even if you are an a NBC watcher and you know it,

109
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.040
and you love it and you love Rachel Maow and whatever, you know,

110
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:48.000
you're getting spun,

111
00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.200
you know that they're picking certain stories that are gonna like peak your

112
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.320
interests. And they're ignoring every, the, the end of every, the,

113
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:59.160
the lesson of every single news story cannot be air go. Trump is bad.

114
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.000
&lt;laugh&gt; like, that cannot be the conclusion of literally every news story.

115
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.640
And over on Fox news, the end conclusion of every news story cannot be Argo.

116
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.240
Democrats are evil and unAmerican, right?

117
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.000
<v 0>Yeah. You gotta give people the choice to do what they want to do.</v>

118
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.430
I, I don't know if they're right. I don't know if you,

119
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.590
we have to inform people and then we have to give them the ability to

120
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:29.150
make decisions. And I don't know if you're right. I don't know if I'm right.

121
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.430
I don't know. Who's right. I'm scared. You're scared. Can we talk? Yeah.

122
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.260
That's what I'm doing. Don't think clubs work for what?

123
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.900
I don't trust people who drive with mask on. No, it's weird. It's weird.

124
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.780
I think they're. You're in your own car. It doesn't make any sense.

125
00:06:45.781 --> 00:06:46.820
And so where you going?

126
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.900
&lt;laugh&gt; you're gonna fold you gonna what interrogation?

127
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.940
You're gonna fold. You're gonna fold up. Shop you.

128
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.130
Hey what's what, why are you a mask on you're in your own car?

129
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.530
I'm scared. It's a sky poison. I'm scared making the wrong choice.

130
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.170
I thought you just said to make your own choice. That's the right choice.

131
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.130
&lt;laugh&gt; listen. You're always gonna have. We have to, everything is real.

132
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.680
All things are real lie. Pus. True.

133
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.000
Lovers' thieves. I think everything is real.

134
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.520
We gotta all accept it together. Recognize

135
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.640
flush. 'em &lt;laugh&gt; wake them up in the morning. Get

136
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.510
give 'em your love. Could you imagine? I think that's part of what sad man.

137
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.710
I'm I'm gonna work out to this every day. Wake him up.

138
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.510
It doesn't happen on its own. You must force it.

139
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.750
You must force all of it. Love force, love, hugs,

140
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.740
hug your friends force. I love you. Who is Mike?

141
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.300
I don't know. Imagine a friend. I have a couple of Mike friends, Mike Young,

142
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.260
Mike Young. I love you. I love what's happening right now.

143
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:11.780
I love a lot of people. We all gotta love each other a hundred percent.

144
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.220
I think that's pretty much the key. That is the key. Unlock that door.

145
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.890
The key is this. We gotta accept that we're all living in this

146
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.690
fantastic soup of possibilities. Oh yes.

147
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.650
And we all come from different backgrounds and different deficits.

148
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:36.290
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and different strengths, different, different ideas,

149
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:41.240
different perspective, different biases bridge. God.

150
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.080
<v 4>Not. A lot of people were serving the style of pasta that I wanted to serve.</v>

151
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.080
So I started giving it away like a gateway drug &lt;laugh&gt; I was just like,

152
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:53.200
send it to tables for free. And they were like, what the?

153
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.720
And it just started gaining momentum and gaining momentum. Wow. So.

154
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.600
<v 0>So when you moved to Italy to, to learn how to do, like what,</v>

155
00:09:01.601 --> 00:09:05.040
what is the apprenticeship like in, you know, learning how to make pasta?

156
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.720
<v 4>I mean, it's an apprenticeship. You have to put yourself in the,</v>

157
00:09:10.721 --> 00:09:14.200
in the student's chair and, and be a sponge. I didn't speak any,

158
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.270
not out a lick of Italian. Um, but the Italians are very expressive.

159
00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.550
So you're able to communicate through just being Italian, I guess. And, um,

160
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.230
I spent three months, you know, six days a week, 10 hours a day,

161
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.630
just making pasta. Wow. Period.

162
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.310
<v 0>See, this is what's fascinating to me. Things. You just, you,</v>

163
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.220
you just take for granted, oh, here is a plate of pasta, like, but what,

164
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:41.900
what is involved in learning how to make it that good.

165
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.580
<v 4>It's not just ingredients. When people sit down at a, at a restaurant,</v>

166
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:48.180
people aren't just paying for,

167
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.260
for the experience of sitting there and the cost of food, they're,

168
00:09:52.261 --> 00:09:55.810
they're paying for the experience of the people that are making food.

169
00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:01.090
Mm that's a big part of it. That's the way that I look at it. And 11 years of

170
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.130
making pasta by hand,

171
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.770
there's a lot of depth that some of the younger guys just

172
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:12.170
aren't willing to pay the time cost. Mm.

173
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.970
And a lot of the younger cooks out there.

174
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:18.160
They bounce around job to job six months here, three months here.

175
00:10:18.161 --> 00:10:21.040
And they think that they've mastered it, but there's just no depth.

176
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.320
There's no depth.

177
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.200
<v 5>You know, you have to also consider how labor intensive it is to, you know,</v>

178
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:29.920
hand roll out the pasta. And you know what Evan was saying before,

179
00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:33.200
like each one rolled by hand, you know, when you, when you eat a bowl pasta,

180
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.400
you're not thinking that each one was like pressed out by.

181
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.750
So it's like extremely labor intensive.

182
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.830
And a lot of people when we were opening, um,

183
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.710
Evan did have his own restaurant BCA before, which was also, um, uh,

184
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:51.550
basically focused around pasta as well. That's a whole other story. Um,

185
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.230
but when we were going to open up this restaurant and we put in the middle of

186
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:59.220
the restaurant, the temperature controlled to lab, which is taking up tables.

187
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.460
So if you're a business person, a restaurant tour,

188
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:03.220
you say how many tables could fit in there?

189
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.420
How much is each table worth to your, your bottom line?

190
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:08.500
You're using up that space to put in,

191
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.780
you're using that space to put in a pasta lab. Are you crazy? Um, also,

192
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.180
you know, when you're thinking about, you know,

193
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.010
training the people and how labor intensive it is, people were saying like,

194
00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.690
we're, we're crazy doing, doing this again. Yeah. They don't.

195
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:23.730
<v 4>Think we could make money. Yep.</v>

196
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.370
<v 0>Well, it is a lot of space that past lab is a big space,</v>

197
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.930
but it's so cool to be sitting right there. It's a show stopper. Yeah.

198
00:11:31.931 --> 00:11:33.570
It really it's. It's something special.

199
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:38.440
<v 6>I.</v>
