1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>I'll have to come up with the rest of the names.</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>Your manic, dedication to work is very inspiring.</v>

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.680
Like it makes me feel like I need to work more.

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.380
Like when you're writing all the time and doing all these things,

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.910
like you're one of those guys it's like,

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.100
it feels like you're always with your foot.

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.660
<v 0>Yeah. I'm kind of furious for work,</v>

8
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.040
but I don't it's it's not what it's what I do,

9
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.340
but it's also what I don't do in that.

10
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.730
I don't have a family and I'm not putting it down. I just don't have that.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.120
I'm just not chipped that way. I never thought of having kids.

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.580
I don't have a wife. I don't have friends. Really.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.550
I, most of the people I know, uh,

14
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.150
either pay a salary or a commission to my phone,

15
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:49.830
doesn't ring my old best friend from, since I was 12 and MCI of the band,

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.880
Fu Kasi. He and I talk every Sunday if possible. Uh,

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.830
but pass that my phone usually doesn't ring,

18
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:59.730
unless it's an interview or Heidi going, Hey, you're late. Get over there.

19
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.390
Is that good? It is what it is. Work.

20
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.500
<v 1>For you like it's.</v>

21
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.050
<v 0>It's all I know. I've been that way since I was five.</v>

22
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.090
<v 1>But no, the no friends part.</v>

23
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.910
<v 0>Well, I don't, I'm not looking for enemies. I'm not looking for a fight.</v>

24
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.830
Of course. I just don't want to come over on the weekend for dinner.

25
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.540
No, no.

26
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.390
<v 1>I have a good time at dinner with somebody I'm.</v>

27
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.060
<v 0>Just uncomfortable, then I'll say the wrong thing.</v>

28
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.640
And I just act,

29
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.610
I look at the table full of people go act like them.

30
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.240
<v 1>You'd be friends with comics because you can't say the wrong thing cause no one</v>

31
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:33.840
cares.

32
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.770
<v 0>Yeah. But then you have to then they'll call and say, Hey, come out with us.</v>

33
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:39.120
We're going and you have to go.

34
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.370
<v 1>You don't have to go. Why not? Go ahead.</v>

35
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.860
<v 0>Deadbeat. I'd be a deadbeat friend. Cause that's fine.</v>

36
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.380
I'd never want to go with anyone to do any. You don't have.

37
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.190
<v 1>To.</v>

38
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.080
<v 0>But, but we'll look at all the phone calls.</v>

39
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.220
<v 1>I'm saving. It sounds like you're managing expectations versus, you know,</v>

40
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.220
like it's, it doesn't sound like you don't like friends. It's just,

41
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:01.020
you don't want expectations.

42
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.480
<v 0>I, I, you know.</v>

43
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.463
<v 1>As it's gonna get.</v>

44
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.710
<v 0>Well also I'm just kind of moody in that. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.180
We're going to go out and do this thing.

46
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:13.350
And then I don't want to see anyone or do anything until

47
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.660
20, 28 and I don't want to cancel. And so,

48
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.980
uh, here, this is my big beef besides hanging out with you. Uh,

49
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:27.120
my big social, uh, thing is many, many years ago, 2003.

50
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.610
I did a song with William Shatner, bill Shatner on his album.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.980
And we became pals Henry come by the house for Monday

52
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.030
night football.

53
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.070
And he invited me to the house for Monday night football.

54
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.780
He lives a few traffic lights from me and I'm walking up the stairs to

55
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:51.180
the living room where the big TV is.

56
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.070
And I heard all this laughter and voices and I froze and I was right

57
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.130
at the threshold of the door. And I said, turn back, turn back to her.

58
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.970
I'm turning back Henry.

59
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.240
And he saw me and I'm like, Hey bill.

60
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.220
And I walked in and met all his really cool friends.

61
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.840
And he, at least for me,

62
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.050
bill is one of the nicest people I've ever met in my life.

63
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.510
And it's one of the oddest friendships I have

64
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.860
in that. I've been going to bill Shatner's house every year,

65
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.810
since 2003. So what's that 15 years. Right.

66
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.550
And I will be there this year. I'm on his next record.

67
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.800
He's doing another record. Oh yeah. I did the vocal last year. Rocket man.

68
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.120
Um, this is, uh, it it'll be fun. I'm not gonna, you know,

69
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.320
it's for him to announce it. But um, every great once in a while,

70
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.280
his assistant will contact me. Hey, bill really wants to see you. Uh,

71
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.070
how about like next? You guys are you free for next Wednesday?

72
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.120
Go meet him and the wife and the valley and go eat. I'm like, yeah.

73
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.300
And it's great to see him in his amazing wife.

74
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.980
And I truly value that friendship. I mean,

75
00:04:11.981 --> 00:04:13.240
I look forward to seeing him.

76
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.860
I really enjoy hearing what he's up to because he's always doing like five

77
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:22.300
things and it's become this thing where I

78
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.750
really look forward to football season. I don't know much about football.

79
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.890
I have no idea what I have back to us. Um, I think they run, I don't know.

80
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.360
I I'd never knew,

81
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.380
but I like going there and it's always the same group of people.

82
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:39.460
People he's known for like 500 years and they're super nice and I've kind of,

83
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:41.800
sort of known them for like 15 years.

84
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.010
And it's so odd because I have nothing else like that really

85
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.590
in my life. I'm just a weirdo. Just William Schachner.

86
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.360
Yeah, it's weird.

87
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.210
The other thing I would do once a year and sadly it ended,

88
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:06.190
but for a few years I would go to Gail Zappa's birthday party on January 1st

89
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.510
because I would play a lot of her husband's music on my radio show, Frank Zappa.

90
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.020
And one time someone in the family wrote me and said, Hey,

91
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.630
thanks for playing dad on the show. I'm like, are you kidding?

92
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:20.590
I love those records. And then Gail, the mom,

93
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.160
the wife wrote and said, Hey, thank you. And um, you know,

94
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:26.710
we know who you are here and we like you.

95
00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:29.410
I have a birthday party every January 1st.

96
00:05:29.411 --> 00:05:33.520
Why don't you come up to the house this year or next, next year? Like, you know,

97
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.310
and I did. And that was like three or four years in a row.

98
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:40.360
I did that until Gail passed away. And you know,

99
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.570
in the more you get there or whatever, it is like two in the afternoon,

100
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.180
two hours before I'm genuinely nervous to go

101
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.590
be in a room full of extraordinarily nice people with

102
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:58.370
fantastically good food. And there everyone was always so nice to me. And like,

103
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:01.100
it's like a who's who you walk in. You're like, wow,

104
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.430
it's just all these people you recognize I'm not here to name drop,

105
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.670
but some of the tables I sat out at that thing, I'm like, really,

106
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.290
am I really talking to like really fantastic?

107
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.250
And she was always so nice to me. And like last time I was up there,

108
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.250
one of my books is like in the living room. I'm like, wow.

109
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.690
And when she passed away, I wrote one of the family members. I said,

110
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.200
I am so sorry. Like thank you for the hospitality.

111
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.820
Your mom was so great to me.

112
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.120
And I'm kind of like the rescue dog I'm used to being outside.

113
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.690
So I don't come inside very often.

114
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.370
And I went to that birthday party because they're just the friendliness of that.

115
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.320
I wouldn't as socially nerve-wracking as those things are for me.

116
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.580
I had such respect for that extension of kindness.

117
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.120
I can not disrespect it by not going,

118
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.080
I wouldn't dare the samurai. And he says, you do not distract.

119
00:06:57.081 --> 00:06:58.490
You must be respectful.

120
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.420
Even if it makes you nauseous with social anxiety.

121
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.450
Cause I just don't know what to do. Um,

122
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.400
I can't say no because it's such a nice thing to do for

123
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:13.700
someone. Yeah. Play. She must not really know how I am. Otherwise.

124
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.820
She never would have invited me. So, um,

125
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.590
but things like that out of sheer politeness and

126
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.930
respect for someone being friendly to me,

127
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.980
I'm kind of a pushover just because I'm like, wow, that was so nice.

128
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.080
I must salute that.

129
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.960
<v 1>I think it's so good that you're open about your social anxiety and then about</v>

130
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.360
how you feel like being around all these people.

131
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.040
Cause a lot of people in the outside, they see someone like you,

132
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.930
you know, black flag, all your spoken word things,

133
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:52.760
your books, your, I mean, I, I always go back to, uh, that, uh, uh,

134
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.470
the liar song and your neck was like the size of my waist and you're screaming

135
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.690
and painted red. And like,

136
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.750
you're this crazy intimidating guy in a lot of ways.

137
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:06.980
So to hear you talk about social anxiety and how weird you feel,

138
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.720
and I think we all can, we all feel that I always feel like that. I mean,

139
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:14.720
it doesn't matter. I think no matter how famous you get you're,

140
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.930
if you're paying attention, you're going to have an imposter syndrome.

141
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.360
You're you're always going to feel like you don't belong there if you're

142
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:23.690
actually paying attention. And if you don't, you'll pro you're probably,

143
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.000
you're probably delusional at some sort of a way.

144
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.740
<v 0>The people who don't right. Like I never, I get to do cool stuff.</v>

145
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.150
And the bit before I go into that on your point,

146
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:40.070
it's easy for me to be in front of people. That's a very different than,

147
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:43.340
than being with people. I can be the party,

148
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.750
but going to the party is difficult. Putting me in front of like five people,

149
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.860
5,000 people stage frightened. No, I can't wait to be out there.

150
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.590
Your performer type. Like you've loved that audience. So they showed up like,

151
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.110
are you kidding? I'm a dog with a wagging tail.

152
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:00.750
I want to get out there and get it going. I can't wait.

153
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.730
I wait the whole day on tour to get out there.

154
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.900
The whole day is about eight o'clock, you know, stage time, um,

155
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.700
being amongst people like going to like a gallery event,

156
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:15.930
I go see a Shepard Fairey thing or something and people are super nice to me.

157
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.830
And I'm always polite back, but I'm a little nervy, but if they say,

158
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.770
can you get up and speak for five minutes? Oh yeah, I got this.

159
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.000
That's so strange. It is strange, but it's also, um,

160
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.820
it's a way to avoid being with people, be in front of them.

161
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.440
It's a way to be in the room with people, just be the center of attention.

162
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.600
So maybe that's coming from some kind of neediness or some deprivation

163
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.780
as a, you know what I didn't get as a kid. Um,

164
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.070
but that you make a great point about that when you really think, well,

165
00:09:47.071 --> 00:09:48.420
this is where I belong.

166
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.830
I think you lose all the fun of it. Yeah.

167
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:57.330
And you turn into kind of a jerk. So when I, every 500 years,

168
00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:01.310
I go to one of those premiers, I get invited and you're standing you're,

169
00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:05.190
you're in a room full of tons of really good food. And none of those people eat.

170
00:10:05.191 --> 00:10:09.300
So I just like go in there and come out nine pounds, heavier bunch of shrimp.

171
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:15.120
Um, I just eat, but you you're. I was at a big Hollywood premiere,

172
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:19.530
big, big movie years ago. And it's like that one, that one, that one, that one.

173
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:22.950
And they're all like, ah, it is their lives. And I'm with a buddy of mine.

174
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.950
We blagged in there and we're like, what are we doing here?

175
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:30.030
This is so cool because we know we shouldn't be here. And after shaking,

176
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.590
Ike Turner's hand 10 minutes later, I'm back in my own kitchen,

177
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:37.410
going back was so weird.

178
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.000
Like what a surreal evening. And uh,

179
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:44.160
cause my friend and I were standing next to him and he said,

180
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.730
that looks like I turn, I go, no man, that is, I Turner, he looked,

181
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:52.470
looked like a human Barracuda. He's like terrifying. I said, let's go, come on.

182
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.590
Like we bought a ticket. We're at the dance. Let's let's go talk to this guy.

183
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.170
He was like, no, no, no, no. I just walked right over there. I said,

184
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:02.130
you invented rock and roll rocket 88. And he went, yes, I did. It shook my head.

185
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.280
Wow. And I said, he first ever distorted the guitar on tape,

186
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.410
which is kind of true. And he went that's right.

187
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.880
And I fluffed him up and he was all happy to meet me. And I said, Hey,

188
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:12.750
and here's my friend.

189
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.440
And I brought my friend over and we shook his hand and kind of stood with him

190
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.120
for a minute and went, okay.

191
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:21.600
So it was probably not going to get any better for us. So let's get out of here.

192
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.580
And so we ate so a few more handfuls of mini burritos and we

193
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.433
bail,

194
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.710
but it was one of those nights where like we weren't supposed to be in there.

195
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.630
And if I ever lose that, yeah. Then just never talked to me again.

196
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.840
Cause I'll just, my head would have disappeared up. Pardon me?

197
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.171
<v 1>Well,</v>

198
00:11:40.171 --> 00:11:43.830
that anxiety and that insecurity is a big part of the fuel that keeps everything

199
00:11:43.831 --> 00:11:47.460
moving. Super fuel. You analyzing yourself. Yeah.

200
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.290
<v 0>And anger. Yeah. I'm mad at,</v>

201
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.920
I like fighting and not fighting like in a

202
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.490
ring for me. A lot of things are confrontation.

203
00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:02.830
Like tour is what you think. I can't do 47 shows in 48 days. No,

204
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:06.430
actually my next tour is 47 and 47. Um,

205
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.940
I have a day off and I have two shows a few days later in one day. So, um,

206
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:15.010
you think I can't we'll then book 20 more like book 200 more in

207
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:19.600
the winter and just give me a Lama and a knife. And I make every gig like,

208
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.800
like watch this.

209
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:25.510
And that's so much of what fuels me like um,

210
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:29.080
yeah. And like, I come up with these huge ideas for books.

211
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.560
Like that's going to take me five years to write it and it did.

212
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.250
And I just finished it. It's going to the proofreader soon, this epic project.

213
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.560
It's, it's a series of music books. It's 407,000 words.

214
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.910
Yeah. It's a bit much, but so am I,

215
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.480
is this idea pages? It's a, I don't know. It's a lot,

216
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.760
it's mostly on a hard drive, so we don't have to like deforest some park. Um,

217
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.890
but it was an idea I had, I said, okay,

218
00:12:56.891 --> 00:12:59.260
this is going to take a lot of years to execute this idea.

219
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.770
And so like watch me work seven days a week on this thing,

220
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.120
watch me stay up until the next day working on this thing.

221
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.470
And a lot of what fuels me, that's what gets me into auditions.

222
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.450
Like I think, you know, like, Hey audition for this TV show. I'm not an actor.

223
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.020
So am I going? Yeah, outgoing. And I sit in that hallway,

224
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:21.910
like 20 years older than all these other people.

225
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.800
And they got the good Jim bodies audit, fantastic hair, chiseled bodies.

226
00:13:26.801 --> 00:13:27.910
And they all know each other.

227
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:30.430
I'm like this weird old man going for the same part.

228
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.940
The only guy not dipped in cologne. I'm like, oh man.

229
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:35.880
And I go in there and I bomb,

230
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.990
of course I get my parking pass validated and listened to slay on the

231
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:43.900
way home, take the lump out of my car.
