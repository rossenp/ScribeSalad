00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.640
<v 1>Hey, um, what do we know about, uh, the, the bounty</v>

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.200
was all that, that we were looking at before? No, I.

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.080
<v 2>Yeah, I, I deleted that bank.</v>

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.600
<v 1>We were looking at something you were trying to figure out whether,</v>

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.920
what was it that we were trying to figure out was actually true.

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.150
<v 0>$80 Million, but bounty, is that what it was? I heard earlier it was 50 million,</v>

8
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.670
but let.

9
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.190
<v 1>Me check. Listen, if nobody pays 80, then you know,</v>

10
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.870
somebody comes along and they say, I wanna do it for 40 five's. Yeah.

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.670
An 80 million bounty on Trump. George Lopez jokes. We'll do it for half.

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.110
That's.

13
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.070
<v 0>So funny. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.060
<v 1>I guess you're not allowed to say that Well's.</v>

15
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.940
<v 0>Back. And the.</v>

16
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.220
<v 2>President, someone at the funeral said that if they bring him his head,</v>

17
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.220
like 80 million whoa,

18
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.180
80 million citizens contributed a dollar. Oh, no. Sorry. If they did,

19
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.420
is what it said. Someone stole.

20
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.220
<v 1>That. Oh. If, if each of the countries 80 million citizens contributed $1,</v>

21
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:04.610
there'd be an 80 million reward for anyone who brings us Trump's head,

22
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:09.210
George Lopez says we'll do it for half that's. Uh that's what a comic says,

23
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:14.170
folks. &lt;laugh&gt; that's funny. &lt;laugh&gt; any other time it's uh,

24
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.010
you know what, man, when anybody could be the president, right?

25
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.410
And this is sort of manner,

26
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.520
is it really the same thing to threaten the president? Like, is it,

27
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.280
is it the same thing as threatening Lincoln? Is it,

28
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.480
is it the same thing to threaten Trump in a joke, uh,

29
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.960
to threaten a guy, just think about it. Who is a former game show? Host?

30
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.200
Who's a, a noted, noted baller, right? A character in many,

31
00:01:39.201 --> 00:01:43.910
many rap songs cuz of his balling and he likes to talk on Twitter.

32
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.460
You can't make a joke. You can't make that joke like that. We'll do it for half.

33
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.313
You can't make that joke.

34
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.700
<v 2>Some of the rap guys have gotten in trouble for what they've been saying in</v>

35
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:53.534
their songs though.

36
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.700
<v 1>I know, but that's a weird one.</v>

37
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.900
<v 0>I mean, he's still the president and as much as it's I know, but.</v>

38
00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v 1>That's where it's weird. Yeah. It's like, what does that mean?</v>

39
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.460
What does that mean? It means you're better than everybody.

40
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.330
Every definitely better than everybody. I can't pretend we're gonna kill you.

41
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.490
<v 0>Even talking about it. I think you can get in trouble. What.</v>

42
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.730
<v 1>Happened to Kathy Griffin? When she showed that rubber head,</v>

43
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.250
she had that rubber Trump head, nothing. Right? She.

44
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.130
<v 2>Gets suspended from Twitter. She lost her career. I.</v>

45
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.970
<v 1>Don't know. No, she didn't get suspended from Twitter.</v>

46
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.490
They gave her a bump in the algorithm.

47
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.000
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; it did her career up. Did it? Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.480
A lot of cancellations of shows. I'm sure.

49
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.920
<v 1>Yeah. I think she took some time off too. Yeah. That's weird.</v>

50
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:36.040
Nobody thought Kathy Griffin was really gonna murder Trump. Right? Right.

51
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.240
<v 0>It have been artist. Yeah. Art.</v>

52
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.200
<v 1>Type thing. It might have been in port days,</v>

53
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.480
especially since she knew him and she was on his show.

54
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.670
All of it is crazy, man. It's all so crazy. Let me ask you both.

55
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.790
Are you guys worried about Iran? Not too much.

56
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:56.150
You worried about what what's happening here?

57
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:59.960
You worried about these military people making joint exercises.

58
00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:00.794
When that happened. What.

59
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.720
<v 2>Was interesting?</v>

60
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.840
I was gonna bring up is that the LAPD's made some tweets that they're gonna,

61
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.200
like, we're watching LA just case. Everybody's worried. And they're like,

62
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:10.040
what are you talking about? And they're like, oh, I don't know.

63
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.240
Just we're just paying attention. Huh?

64
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.680
<v 0>Okay. I'm not worried about it as much as,</v>

65
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.830
as previous type stuff that's happened. What you know, like with,

66
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.350
uh, uh, like North Korea or you're worried more about North Korea.

67
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.950
I was worried more about North Korea cuz that's like an actual threat from,

68
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.790
I think a crazy person and where I think I ran.

69
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.150
They're just gonna try to kill Trump. I don't think they're gonna necessarily.

70
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.820
<v 1>Like bro, if they kill Trump, it's going to be chaos.</v>

71
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.900
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think I don't. And I don't think they're gonna be able to do that.</v>

72
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.540
I think if anything, this is the worst part has already happened.

73
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.420
<v 1>Maybe I don't think so. I think there's gonna be some sort of retaliation.</v>

74
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.140
<v 2>Funeral that they showed on a people were there.</v>

75
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.890
<v 1>Yeah. The guy was in a Chevy showed up. So I noticed in a American truck.</v>

76
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.970
<v 0>Respect. Why, why, why does this one concern you so much than like, you.</v>

77
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.530
<v 1>Know, because it seems like this is the first example of someone being</v>

78
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.650
impulsive. Someone making this kind of a decision that maybe, uh,

79
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.530
strategy experts and real military experts. Would've had some

80
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.560
real good. I mean, this is speculating,

81
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.520
but that they would have some real good reasons why this is a terrible idea and

82
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:31.440
that there are other methods of working things out that doesn't have to

83
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:35.040
go this way. Doesn't have to be. And this is not a movie. This is real life.

84
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.640
Yeah.

85
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.360
<v 0>But do you think they're just gonna force 'em out then?</v>

86
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:38.680
Like don't don't know what's gonna happen.

87
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.390
It almost seems like it's too good to be true are for people that hate.

88
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.550
<v 1>Trump sort of. But then if something happens, here's the thing.</v>

89
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.310
If something happens, especially something horrible happens.

90
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.510
See the way America is like we are like,

91
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.230
we have the genes of this wild conquer,

92
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.210
just lust for travel human that was willing to get on a

93
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.130
boat and make it over here from Europe and from where every other place.

94
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.890
And then the slaves that were dragged in here against their own will.

95
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.690
And then the other people that were imprisoned here and they were,

96
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.410
and then the native Americans who got pushed out and the Mexicans that got put

97
00:05:19.411 --> 00:05:23.200
that's, this is all thousand of years of jeans, right?

98
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.080
The moment something goes crazy. That's when all that stuff comes out, like,

99
00:05:28.081 --> 00:05:30.440
do you remember how people were when nine 11 happened?

100
00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.720
Everybody had an American flag on their car, man, everywhere. It,

101
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.720
it became an intense place place where you like, you, you just that,

102
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:45.590
that whole break glass in case of war, like that's real. If someone provokes,

103
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.670
someone does something where we feel like we're really at war,

104
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.950
we're gonna unite. We're gonna unite in a crazy way.

105
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.590
And the thing is a lot of people are gonna love it.

106
00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:57.720
They're gonna feel great that we're United against an evil.

107
00:05:57.721 --> 00:06:00.160
Cause I mean, this is,

108
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.560
this is why people have employed that strategy to convince their people,

109
00:06:04.561 --> 00:06:07.680
to get into war. I mean, Hitler did it, right? Didn't Hitler.

110
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.840
He burned the rice tag, right? That was,

111
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.320
he did that in order to get people more enthusi

112
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.590
asked about his plans. I'm pretty sure he did that.

113
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.790
And I think Nero did that with Rome as well. But,

114
00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:28.630
but I'm an idiot and my memory's faulty. So who knows,

115
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.750
you know, way more than anybody. So &lt;laugh&gt; no four weeks after.

116
00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:37.940
Definitely not an arson attack was performed on the race dog bill. Oh,

117
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.260
so it was arson. So they think he did it in order to get people pumped up, like,

118
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.980
look, the fur was right, man. Uh,

119
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.700
I've been in the, the middle of this fourth native American book,

120
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.860
this blood and thunder book that just happened.

121
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.970
Like the, the reason why I'm worried is not because of the news,

122
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.930
not just, but also because of these books, we,

123
00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:04.770
it talks about the native American interactions with the soldiers and the

124
00:07:04.771 --> 00:07:08.210
settlers and that is in our genes, man. It just happened.

125
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.690
People were horrible. They did horrible thing.

126
00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:17.130
And it shatters this notion that so many of us loved to hold onto,

127
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.440
without the Europeans here,

128
00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:23.840
the native Americans live peacefully &lt;laugh&gt; they didn't live peacefully with

129
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:27.840
each other. No one ever has the native Americans slaughter each other.

130
00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:31.400
They took each other slave. They killed each other. They tortured each other.

131
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.320
The command sheets were known for it. I mean,

132
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.440
it's horrific hearing these stories,

133
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.390
horrific what soldiers did too horrific with the human beings of that era when

134
00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:46.110
forced into that conflict were willing to do and what they were willing to

135
00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:49.910
become. That is not that long ago, man. That's why I'm scared. Well,

136
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.150
I'm scared because I, I feel like we are gone so far. It's so safe.

137
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.550
It's so safe that people don't even like saying that it's safe. We like,

138
00:07:57.551 --> 00:08:01.580
we like to be in denial about it and focus on so much of the inequality,

139
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.980
the in inadequacies and all the problems and the violence and this and that.

140
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.860
And they're right about all those things. But God, this is a soft time to live.

141
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.380
And if some hits the fan,

142
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.460
you're all gonna know that when you're really worried about your life every day,

143
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.300
when your loved one's really could get shot and killed by someone who's a,

144
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.410
a mile away with a scope because that's, what's been going on.

145
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.530
If that's what it comes down to, you're gonna understand how soft we had it.

146
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.650
You're gonna really know how soft we had it.

147
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:32.890
And this is that cycle that everybody says right hard times, make strong men,

148
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.690
strong men make easy times, easy times make weak men. And this is a,

149
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.800
a, a common, it's just how human are. We need a motivation to kick.

150
00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.920
We need, we need some reason to rise to the top.

151
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.000
We need some reason to go out there and conquer.

152
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.040
And that the best reason is if we get attacked, if we get attacked,

153
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:56.480
we're gonna go crazy. It's gonna be horrible. I'm really scared.

154
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.560
Like I'm like legitimately worried that people,

155
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.040
some people are losing their grip on what violence actually means and what war

156
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.000
actually means, cuz it's not happening over here.

157
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.760
And because it doesn't happen over here.

158
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.920
The only ones that can tell us are the ones that went over there,

159
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.600
the ones that went over there and come back, they do not paint pretty stories.

160
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.070
They paint stories of ugly people and day dangerous people. And they're like,

161
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:19.910
you gotta be vigilant cause you gotta be diligent and you gotta be vigilant

162
00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:22.510
because this world is not what you think it is.

163
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.430
There's a lot of parts of this world that are chaos written and filled with

164
00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:31.710
crime and filled with murder and filled with death and filled with despair and

165
00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:33.910
there's money there and there's terrorists.

166
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.100
And there's these religious fundamentalists who wanna throw gay people off

167
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.900
roofs. And that real. That's happening in 2020 right now,

168
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:42.740
somewhere in the world.

169
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.980
They're probably planning on throwing a gay guy off a roof who,

170
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:49.980
because some,

171
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.060
some person wrote that down 2000 years ago or whatever it was

172
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:55.850
F luck.
