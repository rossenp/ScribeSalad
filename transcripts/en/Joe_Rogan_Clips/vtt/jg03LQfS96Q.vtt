00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What happens? What.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.260
<v 1>Happened was Sam. I sat next to Mitzi in her booth.</v>

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.480
He got on stage and he did the whole bit before he had done the young comedian

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:16.440
show that I was on with that, Rodney did Rodney's first young comedian show.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.460
And it was the whole thing about, you know, the, the kid in the,

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.990
whenever they do those world vision commercials with a starving kid in his

7
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.680
famous, the most famous, one of the most famous things that any comedians done,

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.660
which was just a truism,

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.600
which is the camera man can give them a sandwich and starving kid get out of the

10
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:36.860
desert, go to the word of the food.

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.860
<v 2>Is that's a bit that I use in a conversation with a guy.</v>

12
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.070
It was a weird conversation. There was a guy who wrote a book on comedy.

13
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:48.050
He was teaching a comedy course at a university and he was sitting here talking

14
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:52.970
to me. And he said that the best comedy always punches up,

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:54.301
I think, is there,

16
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:58.250
there was a time when people really believe that nonsense like that there was a

17
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:02.750
formula to comedy and that comedy should always attack the large power

18
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:06.410
structures and that the small people should be, you know,

19
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.990
elevated by communists. So he's sitting here telling me this.

20
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.550
I go that's nonsense. I go,

21
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.420
one of the greatest bits of all time is literally about starving children. Yeah.

22
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.530
There's no listening to Carlin no further down that you could punch.

23
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.220
One of his other great bits was about dead people getting in the.

24
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.210
You remember that the bit about homosexual negrophiliacs who would pay money to

25
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:27.590
be with the freshest male corpse.

26
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.700
Those are two bits where you're punching down as low as you can.

27
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.960
Someone's dad died and there's this guy's, um, it doesn't,

28
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.470
it doesn't get any there's no further. We can punch down.

29
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.600
<v 1>In the main room. And he was doing a bit where, uh, he says,</v>

30
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.900
this is what happened in my marriage. And he would unplug the mic is my Dick.

31
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:51.890
You know, without, even if he did not need a mic to prove the point,

32
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.740
but he would lay on the, on the ground with his girth.

33
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.710
And he would pretend that he was having sex with his wife from behind.

34
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.650
And he goes, this is what happened in my marriage. And she,

35
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.300
as I'm trying to her, and he's like, she's like, we got to fix the fence. And.

36
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.040
<v 0>He goes, shut the up. I'm trying to,</v>

37
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.550
is it needs a new coat of paint.

38
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.480
<v 1>But we can't do, you know, you can't do that now. Really? I mean, you could,</v>

39
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:18.320
if you were Sam.

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.100
<v 2>He could do it again. He couldn't do is alive. Now he could do it. First of all,</v>

41
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:23.180
he was uniquely,

42
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.220
he was uniquely qualified for that kind of comedy because you,

43
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.530
he was short and he was fat and he was going bald in the war.

44
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.110
<v 1>And the long coat and he was hanging out with all the rock and roll and porn</v>

45
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.650
people.

46
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.620
<v 2>The coat, he came on stage, like he was a child molester or something. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.240
I mean, that was, look at that. Look at that picture. That's him and bill Hicks.

48
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.280
<v 1>Uh, I loved, wow. That's crazy. Picture bill was the sweetest,</v>

49
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.020
most timid guy.

50
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.310
<v 2>It was bill that was nailed down there.</v>

51
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.540
So he's got a nail Polish on it's one on with tips. Oh, it's the shadows.

52
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.250
But that was, was a sweetie then.

53
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:04.000
So when you see him then, I mean, when you go on stage he's,

54
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.940
that was part of why it worked,

55
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.900
because I think there's a lot of people that really could do more than they're

56
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.690
doing and they know they could and they want to make excuses.

57
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.900
And it's part of the reason why throughout history,

58
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.940
they've left people behind.

59
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.900
There's certain people that if you had a tribe and you had to make it over this

60
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.490
mountain and Bob is lazy and he's like, you got to carry me, bro. My Bob,

61
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.150
we're both walking c'mon man. Bob's not supposed to make it.

62
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.060
He's not supposed to make it. We want him to make it,

63
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.090
but we don't want our kids to die. We don't want our mom to starve.

64
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.510
We got to keep going, Bob, you lazy. Come on, bro.

65
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.170
There's always been people like Bob and it's part of the problem with humans.

66
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.830
So I'm a.

67
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.770
<v 3>Contradiction, but hold on a second. I.</v>

68
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.371
<v 2>Understand.</v>

69
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:53.200
But I'm gonna give you what I that's what attracts people to socialist ideas

70
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.110
is just that they're nice that they want to.

71
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.110
<v 3>Do better. Socialist ideas are very appealing. I mean, I get that.</v>

72
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.740
And that's why they're very popular with young people who don't know any better.

73
00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:08.280
They didn't have enough life experience understanding Peter shift.

74
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.410
<v 2>This is the bridge because G a guy like you,</v>

75
00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:15.210
who really understands economics can talk to a guy like me and we can explain it

76
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:18.150
to everybody because otherwise we just have an I,

77
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.680
I'm definitely not arguing with you,

78
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:24.000
but your argument versus people who disagree with these argument, you have this,

79
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.541
but there's a,

80
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:28.200
there's an opportunity to make this bridge and for us to understand.

81
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.340
<v 3>Each other and hoping, I think sitting here listening and make that bridge,</v>

82
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.233
and I know produce,

83
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.220
I want to help people evolve from being socialists to being capitalists

84
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.170
because capitalists aren't mean they just understand the unintended consequences

85
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.640
of these well-intentioned programs when that the left is in favor of,

86
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.330
but they don't understand that they actually backfire and make all the problems

87
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.830
that they're trying to solve worse. It isn't the fire department.

88
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.860
When you have a local fire department, right.

89
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.820
That a fire department is there to put out any fire to any house, right?

90
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:06.630
So everybody in the community benefits from having a fire department,

91
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:09.900
it's not there just for one person. It's for everybody in the community.

92
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.330
We're talking about where the government takes money specifically from one

93
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:19.680
person and gives it to somebody else for their specific benefit,

94
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.710
because they think they need it for whatever problem or whatever reason they

95
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:24.570
need the money. And this.

96
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.570
<v 2>Would be like Bob, wanting money from you are lazy.</v>

97
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:28.920
Frank Bob were talking about.

98
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.180
<v 3>I am all in favor of private charity.</v>

99
00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:37.950
I'm all in favor of people voluntarily helping out their fellow man.

100
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.040
And Americans will do that. I mean, we didn't do that.

101
00:05:41.041 --> 00:05:44.520
We did that a lot more in the past when the government didn't take so much of

102
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:47.730
our income and taxes, we had a lot more money. Like I mentioned,

103
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:48.600
Grover Cleveland.

104
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.230
When he said that quote about the government not supporting the people,

105
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.000
there was a bill to appropriate $10,000 for some

106
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.640
farmers in Texas who have been hit by a drought and Grover Cleveland vetoed the

107
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.110
bill because he said, look,

108
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:06.860
there's nothing in the constitution that allows the government to give money to

109
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.310
people just because they need it. Have you.

110
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.930
<v 2>Heard of this problem?</v>

111
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.500
You knew of people that their children were going through this.

112
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.760
And how long did it take you before you decided to commit to pen to paper on

113
00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:19.594
this?

114
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.060
<v 4>So I, I spent, uh, maybe a month or so,</v>

115
00:06:22.061 --> 00:06:24.970
just hearing the reports of the parents and reading the original study.

116
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:29.080
There's an original study that the book is, you know, John jumps off from,

117
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.930
which is the Lisa Littman paper at brown university,

118
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.970
public health researcher who looked into this.

119
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:38.770
And she found that there was all of a sudden, this huge epidemic in America, um,

120
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.360
of teenage girls,

121
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:44.320
deciding they were trans with their friends after social media merging and,

122
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:46.150
and pushing for hormones and surgeries.

123
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.590
<v 2>You had a conversation about this with someone who's a transactivist that says,</v>

124
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:52.990
well, maybe what's really going on. I mean,

125
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.320
I'm just taking the argument of it may be what's going on.

126
00:06:56.321 --> 00:06:59.650
Is there are a lot of trans women and there would be more,

127
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:03.070
or there's a lot of women who would turn trans, become a man.

128
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.200
There would be more, but they'd never had had that door open to them before.

129
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.510
And that maybe there's more trans people than we think.

130
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.990
<v 4>Amazing. Amazing. So it's a great point. And I thought about it cause I've,</v>

131
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.210
I've, you know, I tried to look, I'm a journalist.

132
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:19.090
I like to look at ideas in both sides. I didn't have, like,

133
00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:21.850
I did not have a dog in this race. So let me tell you three reasons.

134
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:25.030
I don't think that's compelling. Number one, when,

135
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.860
when Lisa Littman looked at the prevalence rates,

136
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:30.670
she found that it's 70 times what we would expect within a friend group,

137
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.360
which means it's highly concentrated in groups of friends,

138
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.430
but there's two other reasons.

139
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:39.940
So we wouldn't expect that if it were randomly distributed among the population,

140
00:07:39.941 --> 00:07:42.790
but there are two other reasons. I don't think that's right. Number one,

141
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.540
if we're just rewarding to normal, now that there's greater society,

142
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.370
societal acceptance, right?

143
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:52.030
We're just say we're just avoiding reverting to a normal base rate of

144
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:53.260
transgender women.

145
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.740
Where why are where all the women in their forties and sixties coming out as

146
00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:59.320
trans, they should be coming out now is their time. Now,

147
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.740
is there a moment we should see tons of women in their forties and sixties and

148
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:04.660
so on coming out as transgender,

149
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.170
but we're not seeing that we're seeing the same population that gets involved in

150
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:12.550
cutting demonic, possession, witchcraft, anorexia, Ballymun,

151
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:16.690
convinces themselves. There's a problem. And, and there's one anyway,

152
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.520
there's there's one last reason is that suicide rates are going up.

153
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.440
But if these women who were living under a prior, you know, supposedly these,

154
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:27.520
all these transgender,

155
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:31.000
these real transgender people who are living under a more repressive regime and

156
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:32.830
are now just finding themselves this,

157
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.100
you would think the suicide rate would be going down with greater acceptance.

158
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:38.680
<v 2>So when you're saying suicide rates are going up,</v>

159
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.250
you mean suicide rates with teens who turn trans both.

160
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.240
<v 4>With the rate of trans of suicide among this populate. First of all,</v>

161
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:48.850
among girls in general is extraordinarily high.

162
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.170
This is just one part of the mental health crisis they're in. And second of all,

163
00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:55.090
we know that the rate that these, that these,

164
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.830
that these trans identified kids have very high rates of suicide,

165
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:03.210
suicidal ideation. It's, it's really, you know, an area of real concern.

166
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.460
<v 1>This is the other paper I wanted to tell you about it. It does mention alien.</v>

167
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.323
So it's a,

168
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.730
it's it is a recalculation of trouble for having no, no, they're not classified.

169
00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:16.520
It says unclassified. It just hasn't been released out of this room right now.

170
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.160
It just recalculates how likely it is.

171
00:09:19.161 --> 00:09:22.490
There are alien civilizations in our solar system, or how likely.

172
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.560
<v 2>So it's about the Fermi paradox.</v>

173
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.580
<v 1>It's the Drake equation. So they had done this years ago about,</v>

174
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:32.000
they tried to figure out how many planets are out there, how many are on it?

175
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.570
And habited, this is a reworking of the calculations. And again,

176
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.340
I can't read it. I became a.

177
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:42.380
<v 2>Journal reference document introduction to this statistical</v>

178
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.620
Drake equation. So this is something that they,

179
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:50.090
they created for the defense department. So they could get an understanding.

180
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.280
<v 1>What the baseline of our information is about all those different topics I told</v>

181
00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:55.670
you about it.

182
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.990
And then this one is how likely is it that we have galactic neighbors and how

183
00:09:59.991 --> 00:10:01.400
close might they be? Yeah.

184
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.400
<v 2>Now the key question, how far are they?</v>

185
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.030
<v 1>It comes to an answer it's like 30 pages into that,</v>

186
00:10:08.031 --> 00:10:11.210
but you're the first person outside the program to see it.

187
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.340
You better address the sure. This is okay. Yeah.

188
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.940
It's not like I'm going to get visited there. Um.

189
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.400
<v 2>Yeah. Well, how far do they think they are? I.</v>

190
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.160
<v 1>Hope they, they get up for you. And again,</v>

191
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:26.120
I'm one of the reasons I become a journalist is so I don't have to do math. So.

192
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.080
<v 5>Um, that's one of the cool things now that's happening is, um,</v>

193
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.470
because of the New York times article and really cause, you know,

194
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.180
you had Bob on and come, her favorite,

195
00:10:35.181 --> 00:10:38.870
people are talking about this and the zeitgeists, I've had more people,

196
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.700
serious people come forward to me in the last year of my life

197
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.870
than ever before. And it includes soccer moms and just people that just,

198
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:50.900
I want post the documentary. Yes.

199
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.120
Ever since the Lasar documentary, you know, and,

200
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.250
and people found out that I kept my word to Fravor and didn't tell his story.

201
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.010
New York times told it I kept all that. You know,

202
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.040
people started to trust me with, Hey, we can keep his mouth shut.

203
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:08.780
If he needs to, people have come forward to me and drove since the Lasar movie.

204
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.990
And of course it's like soccer, moms and people that just say,

205
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:12.890
I don't want to be known.

206
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:16.130
I just want somebody to hear this because my husband would think I'm crazy.

207
00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:17.840
Let me just tell you what happened to me and I'm out of your life.

208
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.180
What are they telling you? I mean, Joe hits,

209
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.280
'em everything you can imagine from seeing craft that are right

210
00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:29.540
there, right in front of him to, you know, abduction stories,

211
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:31.580
which I don't get into. Cause it's too crazy for me.

212
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.740
But the reporting sightings encounters, all UFO stuff. That's why they call me.

213
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:40.430
They don't call me for other stuff. Right. But also very serious people,

214
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.500
people that have worked or do work within our military and say I had an

215
00:11:45.501 --> 00:11:48.590
encounter, I, there was an incursion.

216
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.590
I know George has dealt with this for 30 years. It's just,

217
00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:53.260
it's just new for me that the,

218
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.950
the amount of people coming forward to me and telling me their stories and

219
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:58.900
giving me documents and stuff like that,

220
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.320
I gotta be careful because a lot of it's gotta be. Right.

221
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.510
But a good handful of it is power. A lot.

222
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.330
<v 1>Of it is, you know, it's um, like bait to discredit us credit. Yeah. Okay.</v>
