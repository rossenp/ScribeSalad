00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.350
The problem is is that if we have to view democratic

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:12.120
socialism as a moment in the larger movement

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.340
of democracy, my dear brother,

5
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:19.050
Jeff Stout is one of the great philosophers and thinkers of

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:23.280
democracy, calls them egalitarianism freedom traditions.

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.620
And that's simply a way of saying that if you look at the world through the

8
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:33.060
lens of the masses of people who are poor and working people,

9
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.640
what are the conditions under which they can have security

10
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.900
from domination?

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.730
What are the conditions under which they can have dignity

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.340
by holding forms of oppression at arms length. And for me,

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.413
it's not an ism.

14
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.790
You see if capitalism vis-a-vis feudalism can

15
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.760
generate liberties and freedoms I'm for it.

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.230
And that's precisely what the middle-class is did when they broke from feudalism

17
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.500
in Europe or broke from feudalism and other parts of the world, right?

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.630
You had to overthrow Kings and Queens in the name of personal liberties,

19
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.760
but those personal liberties were confined to often to white brothers with

20
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:21.270
property. And the white brothers would no property.

21
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.640
They either trying to hold onto their whiteness.

22
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.270
So they'd become like the white brothers would property or they make moral

23
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.750
choices and said, I want to be a person of integrity.

24
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.590
I want to fight with the folk who are being excluded.

25
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.130
And this is one of the problems and talking about race and white supremacy in

26
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.240
America, because you see,

27
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.170
we think too often in monolithic categories,

28
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.240
there's never been a white supremacy without fighting against white

29
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.930
supremacy. And that includes white brothers and sisters.

30
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.550
There's a tradition from Anne Braden from Myles Horton.

31
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.180
You'll have Highlander center. You've got that wonderful picture of Rosa parks.

32
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.340
She was at Highlander center four months before she was

33
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:08.820
arrested before she sat down on a bus in order to stand up for justice,

34
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.060
right there at Highlands on the miles Horton, who was miles Horton,

35
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.840
a white brother who brought black folk and white folk together,

36
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.470
went to union seminary, trained under Reinhold Niebuhr.

37
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.860
He had cousins and the KU Klux Klan. Wow.

38
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.050
So his Thanksgiving Denis were very complicated,

39
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.850
but that's true for a whole lot of white brothers who fight against white

40
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:34.200
supremacy and Brayden, uh, uh, rabbi Abraham,

41
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:38.610
Joshua Hep test show me that Zahi. You have a whole tradition of white brothers,

42
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.170
sisters. Who've been fighting against white supremacy.

43
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.290
You get into music Becks by their Beck.

44
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.400
He sitting at the feet of Louis Armstrong and he's a great artist.

45
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.050
Louie is genius of geniuses, right? And that middle-class brother from Iowa.

46
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.340
You asked him about white supremacy. You as Brubeck about white supremacy,

47
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:58.290
you as any of the, uh,

48
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.490
Paul Desmond of these folk who are connected to traditions

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.620
in which black humanity brown humanity is seen and

50
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.454
affirmed.

51
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.170
<v 1>You had a point in the book, race matters.</v>

52
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.790
It resonated with me that I never really thought of before.

53
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.070
And what you said was that because of the fact that the United States has this

54
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.990
deep history of slavery and the slavery of African-Americans

55
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.910
that white people became white people instead of Polish and German and

56
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.290
Italian, instead of it being like most other countries where they,

57
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.680
the Italians think of themselves as Italians and the Greeks or the Greeks,

58
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.480
those were white people.

59
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.580
They're all co they combine as white people. I never thought about that before.

60
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.820
<v 0>I mean, you've got these scholars of American studies, um,</v>

61
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.280
let me nail paint was one of the towering ones,

62
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:55.240
but it goes all the way back to brother Alexander and David,

63
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.440
David Roediger.

64
00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:00.160
And some others who've been talking about the way in which whiteness was

65
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:04.480
created. Take for example, an Irish brother who calls doc Ellis island.

66
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.370
His people have been dealing with 800 years of vicious, British colonialism,

67
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.210
and imperialism,

68
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.740
vicious to attacks various famines that w in some ways

69
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:18.970
created, or at least enabled and so on, they get to New York.

70
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.900
And they're told that they're white. And they said, no, no,

71
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:27.040
because we know the British are white and we're not British. And, uh,

72
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.690
but then they said, yes, you are looking by the west. Look at Jamal,

73
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.890
look at Latitia, where are you going to go on the Jim Crow bus?

74
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.060
Just get off the boat from Ireland. If you go to the front,

75
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.430
you would vanilla folk. You go to the back, you went to chocolate folk.

76
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.340
What you're going to do. And for our presses, Jewish brothers and sisters,

77
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.650
he was even more complicated, more complicated, right?

78
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.630
They get there and they say, no, we not with the guy.

79
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:53.950
And we not with the Gentiles.

80
00:04:53.951 --> 00:04:57.790
Y'all been oppressing us for 2000 years.

81
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.400
Pole groms get holes, Holocaust, vicious attacks,

82
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:05.890
and so on. But then they get to and say, well,

83
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.810
are we going to be in the back with the black folk? Some of them did you see?

84
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.080
Cause you've got a rich tradition of progressive Jews, Noam Chomsky.

85
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.090
When he got back there, Stanley Aronowitz,

86
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.640
would've got back there with the black folk. You see what I mean?

87
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.300
But you got some other Jewish folk, like any other group. Well,

88
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:25.150
we kind of lukewarm, let's just kind of move back and forth.

89
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.850
And then some of them want to assimilate completely.

90
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:31.210
Especially the highbrow German Jews were actually white,

91
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.420
as well as the Gentiles in America.

92
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:37.960
Now get beyond that old world prejudice, you say, well,

93
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.960
you better check yourself because every Christian civilization we know is shot

94
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.860
through with Jewish hatred,

95
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.300
don't don't believe the hype sooner or later is going to be manifest.

96
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.650
You see what I mean? And so in that way, you can see the discourse of whiteness,

97
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:54.310
blackness, brownness, redness, and so forth become so,

98
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.150
so deeply rooted in American law, American structures,

99
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.800
American perceptions.

100
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.750
And this is why the arts are so crucial because it's primarily in the

101
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:10.160
music and in the arts where the breakdown of white

102
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:14.420
supremacy begins to take place in the country. It's not the politicians.

103
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.850
It really isn't. It really is,

104
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:22.160
is no accident that the first massive form of entertainment in the United States

105
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.630
is what the menstruals and blackface. And you say, well,

106
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.740
what was going on with black fists,

107
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.250
Eric Latin others have talked about the love and theft. On the one hand,

108
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.260
there's a fear of black freedom because black freedom somehow

109
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.790
means less freedom for whites. There's a fear of black creativity,

110
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.510
because that means maybe white supremacy is a lie. Maybe they're human,

111
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:47.510
just like us. Maybe they just, as creative, imaginative,

112
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.400
and talented just like us. Then they hit it music. And they say, oh,

113
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.280
they got something going on in the black side of town. But we don't know.

114
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.180
It was like you going to see prior, right? If somebody had told you all brother,

115
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:03.020
Joe White supremacy, America tells you that black creativity,

116
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:05.210
black intelligence, black genius doesn't exist.

117
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.530
And you go see pride with your parents and you go away thinking just Negro's a

118
00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.270
genius. Somebody lied to me. I got to recognize that.

119
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.360
And then you recognize those, the whole tradition of prior.

120
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:21.920
And we can go on and on from the Coltrane, Sarah VOD and on and on and on.

121
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:25.760
Right? And so people begin to think, especially white brothers and sisters,

122
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.410
our parents had been lying to us when it comes to black intelligence,

123
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:33.110
imagination and genius and humanity.

124
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.130
And yet the structures make it difficult for us to come together.

125
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:41.480
We're talking about up until 1960. That's a long time though, 1776,

126
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.560
that 1964 and five.

127
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.050
That's a long time for both slavery and Neal slavery to be in

128
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:51.884
place.

129
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.750
And here we are now 54 years later trying to create a multiracial

130
00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:59.210
democracy, which is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

131
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.590
And it's already been enacted in the, uh,

132
00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.270
in jazz groups slash stones bands.

133
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.390
Multi-racial the combination.

134
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.690
The studying of the comments is that you all have you sit down with comics,

135
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.190
you all talk about the juniors across race and gender, gender, gene, and gender,

136
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:23.820
as if it's a natural thing that already shatters the white supremacists and in

137
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.680
nets in male supremacist categories, whiteness, blackness,

138
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.340
all in different silos, but it's so hard to do it on the ground.

139
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.310
The part of the problem of talking about race in American,

140
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.300
this is why I've been very critical of a number of contemporary black

141
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:42.200
intellectuals because white supremacy cuts so deep in the culture.

142
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:44.630
People begin to think it has magical powers.

143
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:49.250
And somehow it just floats above American history as if it's just part of our

144
00:08:49.251 --> 00:08:51.080
DNA in a biological way.

145
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.860
But all conceptions of race in the modern world are

146
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.830
grounded in predatory capitalism.

147
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.620
So that the talk about whiteness and blackness becomes a

148
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:09.600
way of rationalizing social structures like slavery and

149
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:10.500
Jim Crow.

150
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.640
And it has to do with trying to extract labor

151
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.050
resources. It's an attack on their humanity and identity,

152
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.690
but it's tied to economic structure.

153
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:26.670
So to talk only about race means we hide and conceal the

154
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:31.050
social structure that are generating unbelievable suffering for

155
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:36.020
everybody, everybody you see. And so, uh,

156
00:09:36.021 --> 00:09:38.880
the last thing you want is talk about race.

157
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.910
I'd say something about gender and the way gender is much more complicated

158
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.270
because gender has been around for so,

159
00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:46.800
so long every culture that we know almost,

160
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.900
but in modern conceptions of race are tied to modern conceptions of predatory

161
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:56.520
capitalism here and abroad, which includes imperialism, which includes empires.

162
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.850
So the United States comes out of the British empire.

163
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.130
We engage in the ROIC,

164
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.970
courageous revolt against the British empire.

165
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.980
It was a magnificent struggle.

166
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:11.250
That's what I like about George Washington and Thomas Jefferson,

167
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.860
because I'm an anti-imperialist, they were an anti-imperialist.

168
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.410
Now they're urban gorillas. They picking up guns. They fighting,

169
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.700
I don't go that far, but there are also white supremacists. You see?

170
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:24.750
So as soon as they overthrow or push back the British empire,

171
00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:26.670
what do you get in the declaration of independence?

172
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.570
Beautiful words about equality, but you also get savages.

173
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.400
We've got to take their land and you get an empire of Liberty.

174
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:40.440
This is where the comics come in. What does an empire of Liberty look like?

175
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.990
Who's not in on the Liberty is a whole lot of people not in on it.

176
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.700
<v 1>Oh, that was Carlin. Right?</v>

177
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.280
Carlin had his bit about this country was founded by slave owners who wanted to

178
00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:51.900
be free.

179
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.080
<v 0>That's right. And talk about the American dream. You got to be. Yeah.</v>

180
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.940
<v 1>You gotta be dreaming to believe it.</v>

181
00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:58.980
<v 0>We sleep.</v>
