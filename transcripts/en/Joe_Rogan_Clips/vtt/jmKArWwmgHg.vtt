00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Here's a question. The war in Europe,</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.360
all the countries involved. Yeah. What was the,

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.040
what was the size of the landscape we're looking at in con in like relationship

4
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:15.240
to the United States? When you look at France and Germany and England, like,

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.000
what is that like?

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.040
<v 1>Well, it wasn't just Paul Poland, Germany. Oh.</v>

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.873
<v 0>Yeah. But I'm talking about Russia.</v>

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.950
<v 1>It was Russia, I think is five time zones.</v>

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.310
<v 0>Right. Russia's giant. Russia is a different animal, right. Because Russia's,</v>

10
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.590
um, you know, that's Asia. Yeah. And Russia.

11
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.190
<v 1>Russia would just rely on old general winter.</v>

12
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.710
<v 0>But, but European aspect of it, the European part of, uh,</v>

13
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:37.950
world war I and two I'm how much, what I was thinking is like,

14
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:41.940
it's almost like having a war inside America, right? Yeah. I mean, it's really.

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.500
<v 1>Close. I think, I think if you look at, uh, if you, if you take, uh, France,</v>

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.420
Spain, uh, Italy, you know, Germany, Poland,

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.940
all those areas, they fit in Rhode Island, Hungary, Austria. Yeah. All those,

18
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.260
you know, Bulgaria, Romania, you'll go slop. Those in Florida.

19
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.180
<v 0>Will tough those in.</v>

20
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.300
<v 1>Florida. How, how big is that area?</v>

21
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.210
<v 0>I'm on the give one minute. He's got too much. That's a lot of Googling.</v>

22
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.690
I found, I found a thing that like world war, I map 40 maps that explain.

23
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.570
<v 1>World war I, so world, world ones, a different thing too. Yeah. World.</v>

24
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.730
<v 0>I was, that's what you're talking about, right though. World one world,</v>

25
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:20.010
world war two. I want two is the whole world. Yeah. Two is everything right.

26
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.350
But so.

27
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.680
<v 1>Is world war. I remember world war I, the Ottoman empire was crumbling. Right?</v>

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.760
So Turkey's empire was crumbling. So Turkey got the middle east involved.

29
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.600
The British were, were, were, you know, were involved in the middle east.

30
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:36.440
They were fighting the Turks. That, that whole area became, uh, theater for war.

31
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.720
<v 0>Dude. I'm on, I'm on my third wild west book in the last couple weeks.</v>

32
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.030
Really? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, about the history of the wild west.

33
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:48.350
Lemme tell you this one, it's a blood and thunder. Yeah. Um,

34
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
blood and thunder. An epic tale of the American west.

35
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.910
It's about kit Carson and the mountain men. Yeah. Bro. Rough.

36
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.730
<v 1>Dudes.</v>

37
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.510
<v 0>Bro. Men. Just the, the,</v>

38
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.300
the wars with all the various tribes and the chaos and the,

39
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.100
the way they would kill people. Oh my God. It's so crazy.

40
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.260
<v 1>The, the native Americans had oh yeah.</v>

41
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.100
<v 0>Brutal dude. One of these stories that I was reading, uh,</v>

42
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.260
I don't think it was this one. It was, uh, it wasn't the kid Carson one. It was,

43
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.380
um, the, uh, the one on, um,

44
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.530
general Custer general was the last one, which was, um, son in the morning star.

45
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.770
That was the last one that I was reading. Beau. Yeah. This one, the one guy,

46
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.530
one, a native American guy wants to this other guy's wife. So he, uh,

47
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.970
he tries to get him. He can't get him. Eventually finds him one day, kills him,

48
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.810
eats his heart, cooks his heart comes back and tells everybody.

49
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:44.800
Then marries the lady.

50
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.840
<v 1>Well, you gotta eat a man's heart. Cuz you impose his will on. Imagine.</v>

51
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.640
<v 0>You're married. Joke. A guy married. You're a woman.</v>

52
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.120
You're married to a guy and this other dude wants to you.

53
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.560
He kills your husband and eats his heart. Yeah.

54
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.920
And then you say getting this TPE big boy.

55
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 1>That's, that's pretty gangster.</v>

56
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:02.480
That's pretty good because the guy loved you and I'm.

57
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.400
<v 0>Gonna eat his heart. I'm gonna eat his love for you. He cut.</v>

58
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:08.640
He cut two fingers off of his hand because he couldn't get to her.

59
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.120
And he loved her so much. And he was angry that he, he couldn't kill her.

60
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:14.720
Now did he win her over? Well, he must have won her over.

61
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:17.080
He cut two fingers off his hand before he got to her.

62
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.950
And then foul the guy after he cut two fingers off his and killed the guy. Yeah.

63
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.430
Ate his heart cooked. It came back. Told everybody like ate most of the heart.

64
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.870
<v 1>Yeah. That's a stalker. That's a, that's a, that's a oh yeah. Stage five.</v>

65
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.270
Stalker. Is that, does that go back past that's yeah.

66
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.670
<v 0>Past.</v>

67
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.503
<v 1>Made his heart.</v>

68
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.590
<v 0>Ate his heart. You remember like when we used to have those, uh,</v>

69
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.700
terrorism color today. Yellow. No worries. Yeah. Remember it was a flag. Yeah.

70
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.020
That's.

71
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.850
<v 1>It. That's a flag.</v>

72
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.860
<v 0>This is it. Battle front of Europe. Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.180
<v 2>This was from 1917 and a paper in London made this. This is explaining uh,</v>

74
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.340
interesting. The battle area. Battle.

75
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.580
<v 0>Zones. Yeah. Oh, so all it fit in the center of the country. Right.</v>

76
00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:58.140
And they compared it even. Yeah. God dude.

77
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.930
Just imagine if that was going on in the center of the country.

78
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.730
If Montana was at war with Wyoming and Colorado.

79
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.530
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; it was all, it was all trench warfare too. Oh my God. See,</v>

80
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.930
world war is really interesting because there are some parallels now, world war.

81
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.010
I, if you look at world war, I, it was a time when,

82
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.930
first of all, the world hadn't been Europe,

83
00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:19.570
hadn't been the war for a hundred years.

84
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.120
So when people went into war in world war, I, they were, I mean,

85
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:28.920
they went in every young man volunteered and even women volunteered

86
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.720
to be nurses and to cook. And so it was this,

87
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.760
they were singing songs and they were gonna be gone for two weeks and it was

88
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:38.680
gonna be really exciting and it was romantic and,

89
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.070
and no one in co polluting,

90
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.790
the soldiers really understood the technology like machine

91
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.510
guns and, and that kind of technology and mustard gas.

92
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.350
And they didn't know they were still fighting the way they had

93
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:57.790
been fighting for millennia, which was on horseback feathers,

94
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:00.950
in their helmets and charging with great braver.

95
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.620
And so what happened was they would charge and the other side would open up with

96
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.860
machine guns and sh and artillery, and then ultimately poison gas.

97
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.340
And so the numbers are too staggering to even imagine,

98
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.300
but like for 800 yards to, you know,

99
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.730
to try to capture that money land or whatever they would lose,

100
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:28.370
they lost something like 300,000 men in a day. I mean, that's what was going on.

101
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.530
They were just getting owed down. Not that many. Oh dude, the numbers are crazy.

102
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.170
The battle of the Psalm. I can't remember what it was.

103
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.010
It was beyond like the number of men that were lost per foot.

104
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.970
I remember I had to ask three times cause I couldn't believe it.

105
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:43.120
And because they were just the, so your,

106
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.240
your arrogant commanders would blow a whistle.

107
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.440
Sometimes they would kick a soccer ball and you would follow the soccer ball

108
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.320
over the ditch and run as they were shooting at you,

109
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.200
Uhhuh &lt;affirmative&gt; and you'd. And if you didn't, you'd be tried for cowardice.

110
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.800
Sometimes you'd be shot by your commanding officer in the back of your head.

111
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.160
Cuz remember a lot of these armies were conscripted.

112
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.040
They were brought in against their will from, you know,

113
00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.840
this was the time of imperialism when the country that was bigger and stronger,

114
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:14.800
the, a Hungarian empire, Austria itself would come in and say, you belong to us.

115
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:18.190
Now there were these secret alliances that would happen. And,

116
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.910
and so that battle was so insane and they, it was just,

117
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:24.870
it was a true meat grinder. It was a true meat grinder.

118
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:28.310
And then you'd have no man's land, right? So you'd have no man's land.

119
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.150
And that was the area where they would, they would come in. They, you know,

120
00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:36.630
they had to cross to kill and men you'd hear them dying. Oh and groaning,

121
00:06:36.631 --> 00:06:39.860
but nobody could get to them. It was the, it was the worst man.

122
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.020
It was the worst. And in those trenches, the, the body parts and everything.

123
00:06:44.021 --> 00:06:45.780
And then, then people would have to go to bathroom there.

124
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.420
And then the rain would come. You were living in a gutter.

125
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.140
It was beyond what people can imagine. It was beyond,

126
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.420
it was the most horrific thing.

127
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:55.220
And the only thing that was worse was something called world war II,

128
00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.210
which is essentially a continuation of that first European

129
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.330
civil war. And uh, and I don't know, man, it's,

130
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:08.090
it's beyond what we can we're so less than a hundred years time like that. Yes,

131
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:08.690
sir. Less than.

132
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:13.410
<v 0>A hundred years ago, sir. Years inside of one person's lifetime. Yeah. 1945.</v>

133
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.960
Ari Ari's dad is a Holocaust survivor. Yeah. You go a Shakir's dad.

134
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.360
Yeah. Is a Holocaust survivor. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, I mean,

135
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.160
that's how close.

136
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.993
<v 1>It is.</v>

137
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.880
And that all came from this idea back then that you could perfect society and

138
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:29.800
perfect human beings.

139
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.880
<v 0>You know, six inch hows are. Yeah. That's human.</v>

140
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.200
<v 1>Beings. You know where, where this is, where the idea of, uh,</v>

141
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.480
where ideas can be so dangerous, this idea that human beings are,

142
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.830
are a blank slate and they'll that you can make them anything you want.

143
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.790
You can reeducate them in a camp and they'll be what you want.

144
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.550
This is the history of, of Europe and, and those ideas lost ground.

145
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.950
That's why the individual it's so important for the individual to take

146
00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:57.710
precedence over the state. This is also.

147
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.500
<v 0>Why it's so important for people to be able to express themselves.</v>

148
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.060
That's what I mean. And for people to, you know.

149
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.300
<v 1>But fidelity to the state in a fascist society in, in,</v>

150
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:08.900
in communi rush fidelity to the state,

151
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.340
the collective must be superior to the individual,

152
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.900
the individual, you're a tiny leaf on a tree. If you have a society like that,

153
00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.450
somebody's gonna run that. Somebody's gonna set that doctrine and they,

154
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:25.490
and they will justify killing 20, 30 million people to.

155
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.050
<v 0>Way install it. They say they're doing it for the country. Sure. Yeah. You know,</v>

156
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:30.610
there's, there's so many patterns like that,

157
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.650
that just repeat themselves over and over again, with human beings and power,

158
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.230
you get.

159
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:35.370
<v 1>You know, Hitler, um,</v>

160
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.890
by many accounts seem to genuinely enjoy world war.

161
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.080
He enjoyed it. And then he got blinded by mustard glass,

162
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.360
and he couldn't believe Germany, surrendered. He couldn't believe it.

163
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.440
And a German physician,

164
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.800
there's one record of the German physician saying characterizing Hitlers follows

165
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.120
again. This is from Buckholt, uh, lectures. It said, um, &lt;laugh&gt; he goes,

166
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.840
this person is not fit to command humans

167
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.840
and is a, and is dangerously psychotic.

168
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.560
And because of a lot of crazy reasons, he was able to start the,

169
00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:18.070
or join the Nazi that he's worked in. He actually started as,

170
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.750
um, a mind for the German army. What's a mind.

171
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:27.950
So a guy who sped on, uh, subversive groups. Oh,

172
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.110
okay. Oh, like a rat. Yeah. Rational a revolutionary groups.

173
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.430
That's how he came across the nationalist socialist partner,

174
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.940
national on socialist party. Yeah. Then nuts now the Nazis and uh,

175
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.900
but kind of went, you know what I like what these guys are saying. Yeah.

176
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.820
So he joined. Yes. I want.
