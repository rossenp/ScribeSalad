00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.680
<v 1>Experience. Did you see that lady who got into it with Trump? No. This reporter,</v>

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.000
first of all, she was asking a question with a mask on,

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.720
which is like settle down. &lt;laugh&gt; they had to that's so crazy.

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.280
Everybody there had to have a mask on,

6
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.440
but he didn't have a mask on she's the only one, she took it off.

7
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:19.280
When she got mad, she did. Yeah. Play it. Play the video.

8
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:22.790
Everybody there has took it off once she got mad. So this in the white house,

9
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:24.470
what happened? He was saying, she was saying,

10
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.790
why are you bragging about how many Americans

11
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.630
have been tested? And that the United States test more people than anybody.

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.550
Right? When, uh, 80,000 people have died, like,

13
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.140
why is this a competition for you Uhhuh? And so he says, um,

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.140
he said that you should ask China. He said, people are dying everywhere.

15
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.940
If you want, you want to ask someone about that?

16
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:52.580
You should ask China mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and she says,

17
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.260
why did you say that specifically to me? Because she's Asian.

18
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.810
Oh, so, and then, and then he goes, thank you, next question to someone else.

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.130
And then this lady steps in and she was gonna, she was like, I have a question.

20
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.130
She was like, and then she wanted to let her talk.

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.650
Uhhuh was gonna give her question to that lady Uhhuh. So she'd ask again,

22
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:14.970
this is something the reporters are doing now. Right? It's adorable.

23
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.930
&lt;laugh&gt; the president says next person. And he goes, sir, he goes, yes, you,

24
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.930
he goes, I'd like to give my colleague this question and then they give it back.

25
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.480
So the reporters are forcing him to ask questions in a really sneaky way.

26
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.160
And it seems like, it seems like they're all in on it.

27
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.120
So when one of 'em has like some sort of a contentious exchange with the

28
00:01:33.121 --> 00:01:36.520
president. Yeah. And the president says next, so they say, sir, over here,

29
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:39.080
he goes, you, he goes, I'd like to give this question to my colleague.

30
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.630
&lt;laugh&gt; give it back to Bob. It's some crazy keep away game playing. Oh, right.

31
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.950
And uh, you know, he goes, and she goes,

32
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.310
why are you saying that specifically to me? You know, because she's Asian.

33
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.670
And he goes, I'm not saying it specifically to anybody.

34
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.710
I'm just saying you should ask China. Right. It's it's kind of crazy.

35
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.573
Like watch this.

36
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.310
<v 0>The us is doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing.</v>

37
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.940
Yes. Why does that matter? Why this a global competition to you.

38
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.620
If every day Americans are still losing their lives and we're still seeing more

39
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:10.860
cases every day.

40
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.580
<v 2>Well, they're losing their lives everywhere in the world.</v>

41
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.700
And maybe that's a question you should ask China. Don't ask me,

42
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.820
ask China that question. Okay. When you ask them that question,

43
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.370
you may get a very unusual answer. Yes. Behind you please. Uh.

44
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.490
<v 1>Hold on. Here. It goes. Watch. See? It's mad, sir. Why are you.</v>

45
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.330
<v 0>Saying saying that to me specifically?</v>

46
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.610
<v 2>I'm telling you, I'm not saying it specifically to anybody.</v>

47
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.210
I'm saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that.

48
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:40.770
That's not a nasty, please. Go ahead. Why does it matter when, okay. Uh,

49
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:45.120
anybody else? Please go ahead please. Two questions. No, it's okay.

50
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.840
But you pointed to me. I have two questions Mr. Next next, please. You did.

51
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:54.080
You called on me. &lt;laugh&gt; I did. And you didn't respond. And now I'm calling on,

52
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.080
sorry. I just wanted the young lady in the back, please.

53
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.600
I just wanted to let my colleague finish,

54
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.480
but can I ask you ladies and gentlemen? Thank you. I just.

55
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.240
<v 1>Wanna let my C finish. They know how to do this.</v>

56
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:05.920
They have this little sneaky move. &lt;laugh&gt; they've done it before. It's pretty,

57
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.320
pretty interesting. Oh, they've, they've come up with ways to, uh, to.

58
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.760
<v 3>Deal with, to get around the angry substitute teacher. That's so strange.</v>

59
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.320
<v 1>So strange to see a guy who's a present,</v>

60
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.950
regardless of whether or not you think he's handling anything. Well,

61
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.070
it's so strange to see that, like that's such,

62
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.190
he's supposed to be the media guy, right? Right. Yeah.

63
00:03:25.191 --> 00:03:29.510
He's supposed to be the guy that's like savvy the savvy television performer

64
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:32.230
guy. Right. And to handle that, that poorly. Yeah.

65
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.430
<v 3>I know. I don't understand why it would take so little for him to have every,</v>

66
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.950
his numbers would be through the.

67
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.620
<v 1>But this is what happens. They're they're playing a game. Right.</v>

68
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.180
And they just won that hand. Right.

69
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:49.020
Because the game is talk condescending to you, right? Like,

70
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.180
why is it a competition to you when all these people are dying. Right.

71
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.940
And you said people are dying all over the world.

72
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.100
If you wanna know why you should ask China, that's a good answer.

73
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.050
It is to question, that's a gotcha question.

74
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.050
But then she makes it racial. I know, because it wasn't necessarily.

75
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.890
<v 3>Racial. He come in with a, with a hard cha he did.</v>

76
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.370
<v 1>China, but he does that China.</v>

77
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.650
<v 3>But that's still not.</v>

78
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.010
<v 1>Racist. I know. But so if he was talking to a white man, yeah.</v>

79
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.970
And the white man said that to him and he said, you should ask China. Sure.

80
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.440
He would say the same thing. Yes. Yes. Just the worst case scenario.

81
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.720
That that question gets asked by a lady with a mask on Asian,

82
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.280
China, and then she gets mad and she takes the mask off.

83
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.400
Let know she's not even playing by the rules anymore. Yeah. Are you racist?

84
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.310
<v 3>You know, it is a, uh, it is a beehive of an environment there.</v>

85
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.630
<v 1>It is not. It is. But it's also,</v>

86
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.470
I don't know if that's helping anybody like to chastise him,

87
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.590
but to get him riled up. And I don't think it's helping anybody the way he's.

88
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.750
<v 3>Biting. No, this, I mean, yeah. It's a complete breakdown of what that,</v>

89
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.870
that used to be used.

90
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.750
<v 1>To be. Yeah. It's not what it used to be. It's this weird, gotcha. Competition.</v>

91
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.580
And then him getting pissy. Yeah. And him, the fact that he stormed off like.

92
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.860
<v 3>That, it's a, it's a TV show. It's we're watching a TV show.</v>

93
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.100
We're not watching the, the adult telling us if it's gonna be okay.

94
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.740
<v 1>You're so right. &lt;laugh&gt; and during a pandemic,</v>

95
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.100
that is the worst time for some like that. It's the.

96
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.340
<v 3>Worst. I just, you just want some consolidation of real information.</v>

97
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.860
Just tell me how to feel. Dude.

98
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.410
<v 1>I remember have to know nine 11 people hated Bush.</v>

99
00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.330
They thought he was really dumb and he couldn't spell. Yeah. And then, uh,

100
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.890
well that was, that was Dan quail, but that was his insurance policy, right?

101
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:31.370
Yeah. Dan quail was so boring.

102
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.210
<v 3>No, but people hated Bush going into that. They hated him, hated.</v>

103
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.010
<v 1>Him. But then after nine 11, he had some speeches.</v>

104
00:05:37.011 --> 00:05:40.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that made even people that I knew that were hardcore

105
00:05:40.491 --> 00:05:42.840
liberals, like, all right. I love this sky. I.

106
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.720
<v 3>Love it's a moment when you rally. Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.880
<v 1>Well, he really rose the occasion too. Yeah. George Bush, after nine 11,</v>

108
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.280
he gave people a sense of comfort.

109
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.760
<v 3>That's right. That's what you want. You see people craving it. We're craving it.</v>

110
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.760
Yes. That's why, when that's why,

111
00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:01.480
when Cuomo and Newsom speak and they just give you reassuring.

112
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.520
Yeah. Very, very controlled. This isn't a people gravitate.

113
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:08.480
You're just like, okay. You just want to hear that.

114
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:12.360
You just want to Giuliani was the same way after nine 11. It was like, okay,

115
00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:14.080
you're making me feel better. That made.

116
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.670
<v 1>Giuliani's reputation the way percent like, like a leader. A hundred.</v>

117
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.790
<v 3>Percent. Yeah. It's um, it's you don't,</v>

118
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.590
you don't pit people against each other in a tragedy. And.

119
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.910
<v 1>But it's unfortunate that he can't see that. And he keeps getting caught.</v>

120
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.750
It's like, you know what? It's like, it's like,

121
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.470
he's boxing with someone who's piecing him up. Yeah.

122
00:06:31.471 --> 00:06:32.990
Like these things keep happening.

123
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.950
So he keeps having these exchanges where he's like heated exchanges and war

124
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.660
words get said, and it's bizarre.

125
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.123
<v 3>It's really strange.</v>

126
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.740
<v 1>Was the one where he went off the script where he was talking about therapies.</v>

127
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.500
Yeah. Uh, maybe we could, uh, get some disinfection.

128
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.380
It kills it in a minute in the leg, a cleansing. You see the woman next to.

129
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.260
<v 3>Just like her eyes coming out of her head. She's taking deep breaths.</v>

130
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:56.620
So she doesn't pass out in the middle of it. She was like.

131
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 1>Holy. So then after that, he responds that, you know, he was sarcastic.</v>

132
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.490
Yeah. The reporter is asking, he said he was sarcastic.

133
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.370
Like he should have said, look, I'm not a doctor. This is just an idea.

134
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:10.090
Cause that's really what it was. It was like,

135
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.570
I might have done that on a podcast. If I was I'd have to be drunk.

136
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:15.090
You'd have to be drunk. You've to.

137
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.360
<v 3>You would, I've never seen you smoke that much weed. I could get there.</v>

138
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.360
<v 1>I could get there. If you leave me alone long enough,</v>

139
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:22.320
I'll say something that dumb.

140
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.680
I said the dumbest of my life on this podcast high.

141
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.000
<v 3>Not that.</v>

142
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.480
<v 1>High, but here's the thing. What came out of it, which really fascinating. Yeah.</v>

143
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.320
There was an actual,

144
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.320
publicly traded biotech company that came up with an idea mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

145
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:37.920
to get when an intubated people, uh, to get a, uh,

146
00:07:37.921 --> 00:07:42.190
ultraviolet light tube down through that, into the lungs,

147
00:07:42.191 --> 00:07:46.110
Uhhuh and illuminate, cuz using ultraviolet light, you can kill bacteria. Right?

148
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.070
You can kill viruses.

149
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.950
And that's one of the reasons why they have those things like stereo pens,

150
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.030
where you go backpacking, Uhhuh, um,

151
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:55.150
you can get some water out of a Creek and you just use this ultraviolet light.

152
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:57.790
It kills everything inside that water. Right. Right. So they,

153
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.140
they actually have this bio old company publicly traded company put out this

154
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:04.300
video on how this can be done Uhhuh. Well,

155
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:06.020
their account was banned from Twitter.

156
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.100
<v 3>Oh really? Because is it a real company?</v>

157
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.900
<v 1>Yes. It's a real company and they let 'em back eventually. Yeah.</v>

158
00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:14.940
But this is how toxic this relationship with the president is right where the

159
00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:18.700
president says something on TV. Yeah. And then people go,

160
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.490
what the did you just say get light to people.

161
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.170
And then this publicly traded biotech companies,

162
00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.930
like actually we've already been working on that and this is the concept and

163
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:30.930
this is the science behind it because UV light kills BA you, you banned,

164
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.170
they banned them. They banned a biotech company from Twitter.

165
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.530
Now they brought the back once it was explained to them. Yeah.

166
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.280
But any other time in history, like say of the, this was going on, right.

167
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:42.360
You know, 10 years ago.

168
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.840
And there was a virus and the virus is infecting people's respiratory systems.

169
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.920
And someone said, while these people are, are being intubated,

170
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:53.520
we can actually stick a light through the same tube that the ventilator uses and

171
00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:54.680
we'll illuminate the lungs.

172
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.840
We could actually probably kill a good deal of this bacteria. Be like, oh,

173
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.480
medical breakthrough. Right.

174
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.480
<v 3>And this, but you've had a complete disintegration. Right.</v>

175
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.600
It's that's the result of a breakdown and that's, what's been,

176
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.840
so that's why it doesn't work in communist countries.

177
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:11.160
Like you can't trust the source for your information. Right.

178
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:14.440
That's what we're at in a democracy. We're no one can trust the sore.

179
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.790
We're all scrambling. Like does this one know? Does this one.

180
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.991
<v 1>Know,</v>

181
00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:21.790
does this one what's a direct result of his toxic relationship with the press?

182
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:22.191
Yes.

183
00:09:22.191 --> 00:09:25.550
Because people are so people who are with him are so with him and people who are

184
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:28.470
against him are so against him. And it's almost like people with him.

185
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:30.750
Part of the reason why they're with him is cause they're so against all these

186
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:35.420
other whiny, liberal people, that that's side.

187
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:38.620
Just so annoying. No I'm going with Trump. He tells 'em to off.

188
00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:39.820
That's my favorite part. Right?

189
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.700
<v 3>He makes them, he makes those people angry. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

190
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.540
<v 1>No, a hundred percent. It's a terrible relationship. It's so it's, it's.</v>

191
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.860
<v 3>Bad for everybody. It's awful. Because if in any,</v>

192
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.140
if at any moment we should be uniting and taking care of each other. It's now
