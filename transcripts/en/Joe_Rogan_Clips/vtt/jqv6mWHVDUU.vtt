00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.140
<v 3>Are you aware of the controversy surrounding the male Mona. Lisa?</v>

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
Do you know the story about this? The male Alisa? No. No. It's um,

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.610
there's the most expensive painting ever sold.

5
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.850
It was sold for $400 million to, uh,

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.810
the Ben Salaam. Excuse. What is his name?

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.740
Solomon Mohammad bin Salaam. The, is that, am I saying his name right?

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.420
The head of Saudi Arabia. MBS. MBS. Okay. What is his actual name though?

9
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.190
I'm sorry, I.

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.560
<v 2>It up. It's probably Brian Saunders.</v>

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.570
<v 0>Mohammad bin Salaam.</v>

12
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:39.143
<v 2>Salamanca.</v>

13
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.320
<v 1>Okay. The MBS,</v>

14
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.330
the head of Saudi Arabia bought it for $450 million.

15
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.613
This is it.

16
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.390
And the crazy thing is someone bought it at one point in time in the

17
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:52.230
past,

18
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.150
I want to say for $1,500 and they didn't

19
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:59.370
realize that it may or may not be,

20
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.790
cause this is where it gets controversial may or may not be the work of Leonardo

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
da Vinci. So it was, it was restored. So go do the history of this,

22
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:10.870
the controversy and the, his documentary about it. Yeah, there's a,

23
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.010
there's a crazy history to it. Um,

24
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.240
where someone bought it for extremely low amount and then a Russian oligarch

25
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.430
bought it for over a hundred million dollars C $1,175 at an addict

26
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:27.930
sale in new Orleans for a dirty painting that he hadn't even seen after a

27
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.660
painstaking restoration, I think took a decade.

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.250
Some began whispering that it might be the by the master himself.

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.850
So an art dealer in 2005 paid

30
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.660
$1,175 for it. So 16 years ago,

31
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.760
someone paid $1,175 for the most expensive

32
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:52.380
painting ever sold. So then this guy go down, scroll down.

33
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:57.000
I can't get this article is, oh, that's one of them because he economists, um,

34
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.870
there's a bunch of other articles that are free that you could read about it.

35
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:03.000
But it's a, it's a crazy story. So this,

36
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.960
this person I believe started working on it in 2005,

37
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.430
started the restoration.

38
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.600
And then by the time I think it was around 2015,

39
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.430
they started realizing like, holy.

40
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.920
Cause I guess sometimes in the past someone would take a great painting and

41
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:20.940
they would paint over it.

42
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.590
<v 2>Which is.</v>

43
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.150
<v 1>Crazy. Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.740
And so then there's this insanely painstaking restoration

45
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:33.450
project where you removing layer upon layer upon

46
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:34.284
layer.

47
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.500
<v 0>What $60. This was sold for 1958.</v>

48
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.440
<v 1>$60. So it gets even crazier. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.730
<v 0>An article from 2017 where it was on auction for even less than it was just</v>

50
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.180
sold.

51
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.150
<v 1>Yeah. So it's an Oxford for a hundred million dollars then.</v>

52
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.410
And that's when it was bought by the Russian oligarch before MBS bought it.

53
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.770
<v 2>The controversy that the person who originally bought it should get a kickback</v>

54
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:56.604
because.

55
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.770
<v 1>Yeah, no, here's the controversy.</v>

56
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.550
The controversy is it may not be by Leonardo da Vinci at all. I see.

57
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.660
And or it might be partly by DaVinci. And so Google this,

58
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.180
th th there's a scan of the image and I don't understand the technology involved

59
00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:12.641
in a scan,

60
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:17.260
but the scan apparently revealed that there's more than one era of painting

61
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.860
or there's more than one application of painting,

62
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.900
meaning that more than one person worked on it at more than one time,

63
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:26.350
like an.

64
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.460
<v 2>Exquisite corpse.</v>

65
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.000
<v 1>Hidden re-drawing Lisa. So this might not, no, no, this doesn't reveal it.</v>

66
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.470
This is not, it it's it's about, there was a digital scan of that painting.

67
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:38.350
What is it called again? It said male, Mona, Lisa, I don't know.

68
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.440
There's another name for it. There's a name for that painting.

69
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.610
I forget what it is, but Salvatore Monday, Monday. Yeah. Silva Terma.

70
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:47.830
So when they did the scan,

71
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.480
there's something about the hands and the way the paint is done on that in

72
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:54.910
relation to the rest of it that it's like, you know,

73
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:57.550
they're talking about like microns,

74
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.500
they're measuring depth and layers and age and all sorts of different

75
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.420
and they truck. But when you're dealing with $450 million for a painting,

76
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.961
Jesus,

77
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:12.760
so it gets down to this despues long page about it.

78
00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:16.470
Okay. See if you can see this, the images cause there's images of the, uh,

79
00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:19.630
the analysis. If you scroll down, it's a beautiful painting. Yeah.

80
00:04:19.631 --> 00:04:22.180
It is very beautiful. There's there's images.

81
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.680
Is that what it used to look like on the right?

82
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.230
I think that's what it used to look like.

83
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.240
And then they slowly but surely restored it to the point where it's at

84
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:36.010
now. Um, was that what it looked like? So versions of it, people would, yeah.

85
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.880
There's more than one version of it. So people would buy paintings like,

86
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:44.770
you know, a hundred years ago, 500 years ago and just start scribbling on it,

87
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.470
paint over it. Yeah. So they had to go over these things to restore them,

88
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.410
like insanely painstaking. Like I said,

89
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:57.670
it took like 10 years to, to restore that.

90
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.250
<v 2>I see, I see they're doing like these, this is a, what do you call it?</v>

91
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:04.660
Cross section analysis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because they have to find like,

92
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.810
what is the original paint color? So they have to find the original layer.

93
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.733
Exactly.

94
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.900
<v 1>So that's what it used to look like. Imagine that,</v>

95
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.200
and then they bring it from that to what you see now,

96
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.550
like look at that crazy. So what, what does that mean? Then they paint over it.

97
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.440
Like how do they do that? I mean,

98
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.010
that's just someone paint over the old paint and make it look better.

99
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:27.730
Is that better? Like, isn't it better to be scratchy and all up.

100
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.713
And they originally.

101
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.290
<v 2>I know, I know it's yeah. I guess it just depends on what you want. Right.</v>

102
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.400
<v 1>But that's the problem with this painting. So after all that,</v>

103
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.590
after buying it for $450 million,

104
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.570
it's currently in controversial dispute as to whether or not it's actually the

105
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:44.770
work of Leonardo da Vinci.

106
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.090
So since they w they wanted him to, uh,

107
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.320
donate it to the Louvre in Paris. Yeah. But they were like,

108
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.510
we're not going to put it next to the Mona Lisa.

109
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.670
He wanted it to be next to the Mona Lisa, the male Mona Lisa,

110
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.120
or at least in the male model. And they're like, they're like, we don't,

111
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.580
we don't, we're not going to give this thread stamp.

112
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.840
We don't even know if this is real.

113
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.280
<v 2>Wow. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. It's just, oh man. Could you imagine that,</v>

114
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.980
that feeling of being rejected like that and you're like, imagine.

115
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.450
<v 1>Got it. You're that guy, I mean, this is the guy that allegedly killed, uh,</v>

116
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.740
Jamal Khashoggi for criticizing his regime. Yes. Okay. Um,

117
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.730
and have you ever seen that movie, that dissident, which is incredible movie,

118
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.790
but Bryan Fogel that details all the, the, the,

119
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.870
the events that took place? Oh, no, I haven't seen the crazy, but,

120
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.260
so he's the one that's in possession of this painting.

121
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.970
And now it's currently on his yacht.

122
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.710
So this $450 million painting is on his yacht.

123
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.560
And so art fanatics are like,

124
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.390
you can't have a painting on a yacht. Like if it's six, four, well,

125
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:54.410
not just that, the con the climate, like to have the right,

126
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.040
the seawater to have these paintings. I mean, maybe you only had it for a day,

127
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.320
or maybe you only had it like to tell everybody how did it there.

128
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.120
He actually has it in a client.

129
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.910
<v 2>I imagine he would. I mean, come on. I don't know, man.</v>

130
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.480
<v 1>He's balling out of his mind buying $450 billion paintings.</v>

131
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.650
He might be paying on it right now.

132
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.600
<v 2>That's nothing, that's nothing. I do, whatever he.</v>

133
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.280
<v 1>Wants. He can do whatever he wants.</v>

134
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.750
If you got the kind of money for $450 million painting, but it might not be,

135
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.770
it might not be legit. And apparently, so I go down a rabbit hole.

136
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.840
Apparently there is a massive market for illegitimate paintings and people get

137
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:31.520
robbed all the time. And there was in fact, a guy who was a master. There's a,

138
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.500
I believe is a documentary about him.

139
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.530
<v 0>Who there's a big one on Netflix about this right now. I thought, that's.</v>

140
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.180
<v 2>What you're going to be like the master forgers.</v>

141
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.040
<v 1>Well, there was a guy who was, that was his trade.</v>

142
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.010
What he would do was make fake Picassos.

143
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.350
So he would make his own work,

144
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.660
but in the style of Picasso and they would claim that this was a

145
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.490
loss because whoa. And he sold these things for millions,

146
00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.960
millions of dollars.

147
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.360
<v 0>Flux, one, this lady got, they found she was selling fake for a long time.</v>

148
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.840
<v 1>Oh, okay. I don't, I I've missed a lot of people off. I've not seen that one,</v>

149
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.240
but there's a guy who was,

150
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.240
he did time and he got released eventually.

151
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.380
And he did time for creating fake masterpieces.

152
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.850
And it's really crazy because the guy was insanely talented. Right.

153
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:26.300
His art was magnificent. Right, right, right.

154
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.420
But it wasn't Michelangelo, conned people.

155
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.390
<v 2>I mean, the art was great, but it cons people.</v>

156
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.350
<v 1>But it was it's, it's weird. It's like, it's. So my uncle said this to me once.</v>

157
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.720
This is really funny thing because when I was a kid,

158
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.030
I would pretend I brushed my teeth. Right. But I,

159
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.210
I really didn't brush my teeth and my uncle, my uncle Vinny.

160
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.090
Who's a really interesting guy. He's very creative guy as an artist.

161
00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:50.270
And he said, it's funny because I used to do the same thing. But once,

162
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.350
eventually I realized I put so much effort into pretending that I brushed my

163
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:59.070
teeth, that I could have just brushed my teeth would that same amount of effort.

164
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.600
And I wouldn't have to pretend.

165
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.370
