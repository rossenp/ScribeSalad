00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.720
now measuring it in humans is, I mean, there's this concept of people.

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.240
I'm an emotional person. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, I'm emotional.

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.760
Like people, I get emotional, like people love to say, yeah, those,

5
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.840
those kind of things. What are,

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.550
is it possible to measure varying ease of emotional

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.390
response in terms of like how it's affecting a person physiologically,

8
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.310
whether or not these emotional responses are physiological or whether

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.830
you've gone down a well grooved,

10
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:38.750
psychological path that you've been sort of participating in your whole

11
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:43.580
life so that you have these sort of triggers, this happens. And then up,

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.380
I'm gonna, I'm gonna start crying. This happens up,

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.340
I'm gonna get angry and people sort of fall into those paths without

14
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.174
self-reflection,

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.700
without this ability to be objective and introspective and go,

16
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.420
why am I reacting this way? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like what?

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.860
Maybe you should stop being so emotional Joe. Right.

18
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.610
And anybody he ever said that to you. &lt;laugh&gt;.

19
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.890
<v 1>Uh, I guess my wife has said, &lt;laugh&gt; sure.</v>

20
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.570
<v 0>Well, what does that mean? Like what, you know what I mean? Like the, this,</v>

21
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.810
the varying degrees of emotional response and whether or not those are

22
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:19.010
beneficial or whether or not they de detract from your experience or inhibit

23
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.730
your, your ability to be productive.

24
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.240
<v 1>So, you know, I, it really nailed a lot of interesting stuff in there.</v>

25
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.200
And I, um, you know, it's a very kind of deep analysis of, of what's going on.

26
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.240
So the problem is that our language is so bad that,

27
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.800
um, all these terms that we have,

28
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.150
we borrow from what's called folk wisdom or folk psychology, you know,

29
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:47.910
they they've come through the ages.

30
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.630
And this is true in every aspect of science that you have folk

31
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:56.630
terms, you know, folk physics becomes real physics.

32
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.670
And then the folk stuff goes away. Folk biology becomes real biology. And the,

33
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.940
you know, the folk stuff goes way, but in psychology,

34
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.980
the folk stuff never goes away because we always experience

35
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.260
the folk aspect of it. When we have a conscious experience,

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.620
that's what our conscious minds is.

37
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.580
Our folk psychology of ourselves and of others and of other animals.

38
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.530
But the, um, um,

39
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.450
underneath that is the part that we can get rid of the folk psychology

40
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.250
of, because we can understand how behavior is control,

41
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.010
how these physiological responses are controlled. And it ain't because,

42
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.010
you know, we've had fear is causing it, you know, but, but when you're afraid,

43
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.480
you're almost always running from the bear and feeling fear. But,

44
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.600
and, and so you assume that when you're running from the bear,

45
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.720
fear is what causes you to run. But fear is not the answer.

46
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.680
Fear is your awareness, that all that is happening to you.

47
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.520
<v 0>Mm. But also the,</v>

48
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.480
the ability to conate the consequences, right? Yeah. Yeah.

49
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.760
Like this bear's gonna get, I mean, he's gonna.

50
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.640
<v 1>Yeah. Enhance. So it's all, that's all, you know,</v>

51
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.960
one interpretation after another running forward.

52
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.390
<v 0>But no self, no fear. That's no pop possible either. Right?</v>

53
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.630
<v 1>Well it, no, I mean, you need the self to be afraid. Yeah. So, I mean,</v>

54
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:29.750
that's your, and to be consciously afraid,

55
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.910
but you can react to danger without the self. And that's what, you know,

56
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:38.750
that's key. You, you find yourself freezing or walking in New York city,

57
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.820
you jump back and the bus goes flying by. So you've reacted to danger, but,

58
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.660
but only afterwards,

59
00:03:43.661 --> 00:03:46.820
do you feel fear when you cognitively become aware that that's.

60
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.740
<v 0>Happened well, in that sort of a situation,</v>

61
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.300
but in a situation like where you're walking down a dark alley and then you see

62
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:54.580
some guy who seems to be following you. Yeah. You're like, oh.

63
00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.580
<v 1>Boy. Yeah. So now you're,</v>

64
00:03:56.581 --> 00:04:01.530
you're in a situation where you're in a potentially dangerous situation. Right.

65
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:04.170
So now you're anxious about what's gonna happen. Yeah.

66
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:06.210
So you're not starting with, fearre starting with anxiety,

67
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.650
worry about what's gonna happen. Nothing. There's nothing there that's made you.

68
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.690
<v 0>But then what if he ramps it up? It says, Hey, Joe. Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.690
Why don't you come over here, man? I like to borrow some money from you. Yeah.

70
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.530
You're like, oh. Now it's fear is that fair.

71
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.120
<v 1>Now you've got a specific threat. Right. And yeah. So you,</v>

72
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.560
now you're into fear and then that's gonna morph into another anxiety about what

73
00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:30.400
the hell is this guy gonna do to me. Right. So, but all of that, you know,

74
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.360
the, the dark alleyway is gonna go into your brain and trigger

75
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.880
your muscle, tension, your heart, to race and so forth.

76
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.390
And the dark gal is gonna go to your cortex and you're gonna be interpreting

77
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.550
the fact that you're in a dark alley and your heart is racing in terms of being

78
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:50.830
anxious and fearful and all of that. But they're happening separately.

79
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.190
It's not one bundle. It's like separate things in the brain.

80
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.030
And once we understand that it becomes, I think, a much easier problem,

81
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.860
how to approach problems of fear and anxiety.

82
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:06.700
You've gotta separately treat the behavior and the physiology from the conscious

83
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:09.220
thoughts. And in between those two,

84
00:05:09.221 --> 00:05:12.940
you also gotta change the cognitions that underlie, uh, the,

85
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.580
the conscious experience, but also the cognitions can trigger behavior.

86
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.330
So, you know, one of the things we've, uh, we've pro proposed, uh,

87
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.010
I proposed this in my last book. Uh,

88
00:05:25.011 --> 00:05:29.890
anxious was a kind of test program for exploring this where, uh,

89
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:34.690
it would be kind of a three part, uh, three step program. Um, first you would,

90
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.410
um, you'd have to do it with something simple,

91
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.770
like a spiderobic a what spiderobbic or snakeobbic. Oh, okay.

92
00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.840
You would do exposure therapy, subliminally.

93
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.080
That means you subliminally present the picture of a snake or the spider

94
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.560
so fast, the conscious mind doesn't know it's there. So like.

95
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.360
<v 0>Those old, uh, hungry eat popcorn things. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Have.</v>

96
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 1>The movies. Okay. Yeah. And.</v>

97
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.800
<v 0>That's a very common technique in psychology.</v>

98
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.200
So they would show you a film and there'd be one or two frames of a spider if

99
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:03.540
you had a rock.

100
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.960
<v 1>Or just a picture, you know, art, but could be a film. Yeah. Okay. And, uh,</v>

101
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.240
but it would have to go very fast in the film. So it would,

102
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.400
so with a picture you'd just present it really quickly. And, um,

103
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.950
because you know, normally if you show a spiderobic, uh,

104
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.510
try to do exposure therapy,

105
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.190
they don't wanna do it cause they don't want to deal with spiders, but they,

106
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.390
they, their conscious mind doesn't know what's happening,

107
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:29.390
cuz it's going through subliminally.

108
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.950
So the Amy amygdala is being tamed by the exposure.

109
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.700
And now they can look at the picture are without, you know,

110
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.140
the body Rere reacting. They're not jumping, they're not, uh,

111
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:44.780
their heart isn't racing because the amygdala has been turned off.

112
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.580
So all those body responses have, have calmed down.

113
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.180
So now the person can kind of go some undergo,

114
00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:55.860
some cognitive change about looking at spiders and so forth. And then finally,

115
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.340
once you've done those two steps,

116
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.730
the brain's ready for talk therapy and meditation and other kinds of

117
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:05.970
mindfulness approaches, uh, because all of the,

118
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.850
the impediments to all that have been put aside by this, these first two steps.

119
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.570
<v 0>So has anybody ever like officially cured someone ofachnophobia or fiiofil</v>

120
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:19.520
offiiophobia or, you know, fear of snakes or spiders,

121
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:22.960
like those are those seem to be almost like deep seated genetic fears.

122
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.920
<v 1>Well, they, we, I mean our ancestors yes. Had, uh, snake and, but.</v>

123
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.440
<v 0>They vary. Right. Which is what's weird.</v>

124
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.680
Our ancestors certainly experienced venomous snakes. Right. And,

125
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.750
but there's something about some people of,

126
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:43.750
of almost illogical reaction to it that it's often been speculated that this is

127
00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:48.190
some sort of a genetic memory of someone perhaps in their ancestry line,

128
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.390
surviving a snake attack or losing someone to a snake.

129
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.390
<v 1>It's more, you know, it turns out that the, um,</v>

130
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.740
it's more about the ability to rapidly learn about those kinds of dangers

131
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.020
than to innately respond. Mm.

132
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.780
So there seems to be it's called prepared learning.

133
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.700
So you have an evolutionarily based thing that's with you that everyone has some

134
00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:14.460
version of, but you know, it varies from individual to individual.

135
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.860
And then some people, um,

136
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.930
are prone to rapidly learn that either

137
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:26.730
because of other experiences or because of their particular genetic makeup.

138
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.010
And so they tend to go down the road of,

139
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.330
of acquiring these kinds of phobias now.

140
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.130
So it's the problem with treating that by just extinguishing it,

141
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.800
uh, through exposure is that the, um, uh, extinction is always imermanent.

142
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.040
You know, if you, once you've been reduced, nothing is wrong.

143
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.560
This is true in a rat or person. Let's say the rat has been given a tone,

144
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:58.560
that's been paired to the shop and then adheres the tone 20 or 30 times stops

145
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:01.080
responding. But then if it goes back in the,

146
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.920
the room or the chamber where the shock had occurred, the tone will again,

147
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.720
bring it, you know, I elicicited,

148
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.040
and the spiderphobic returns to the place where he,

149
00:09:12.041 --> 00:09:15.550
or she was bitten by a spider or a place where spider is supposed to be present.

150
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:19.990
It can come back. So these are imperfect temporary solutions.

151
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:25.270
They're not enough. Um, and, uh, that's why, I mean, they're called,

152
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.350
uh, these are called, you know, reinstatement and, um,

153
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.990
things like that because they, they pop back up.

154
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.860
So maybe medications can helptamp that it down a bit. So,

155
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:39.460
uh, medications are useful in,

156
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.660
in that sense of being able to control the behavior and the physiology,

157
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.340
but less so in terms of changing the mental state, because, you know,

158
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:51.380
how could you possibly design a medication that would know how to change the

159
00:09:51.381 --> 00:09:53.900
content of a, a mental state? I mean,

160
00:09:53.901 --> 00:09:57.290
that seems like an impossible task and that's what you want to do.

161
00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:59.170
You don't wanna change all mental states, right?

162
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:03.090
You wanna change the one content, you know, I'm afraid of spiders.

163
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.450
<v 0>Yeah. Uh, it's,</v>

164
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.370
it's so fascinating though,

165
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:13.250
how people vary so widely in their,

166
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.120
their reaction to certain fears or certain things that could induce fear,

167
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:22.600
whether it's dogs or, you know, whatever irrational thing that people have.

168
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.000
The, the source of that is really often

169
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.240
speculated that there's like some sort of a genetic component to it.

170
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.720
Do you buy into that? So.

171
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.470
<v 1>Let's say, let's say that, that, you know,</v>

172
00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:39.870
in any kind of situation like that,

173
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:42.310
there are multiple systems in the brain that are gonna be involved.

174
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.670
We're gonna isolate the Amy amygdala as, you know,

175
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:50.670
hypothetical part of that system that is detecting and responding to

176
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:51.504
the stimulus.

177
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.870
So we're gonna go into the Amy amygdala and focus on one little part.

178
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.700
It, uh, called the lateral nucleus. That doesn't matter,

179
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:02.820
but it's the part that gets the input from the outside world.

180
00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.900
So that is the gateway into the Amy amyglin. So now let's talk about,

181
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.100
let's say it's got, I don't know, a hundred thousand cells and neurons, um,

182
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.100
and, um, each of those neurons,

183
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.410
it's gonna have a bell curve

184
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:26.210
that's based on the genes that made that cell and whatever

185
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:30.890
kinds of electrical signals it's had throughout the life of the organism.

186
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:35.610
So you're gonna have a hundred thousand bell curves, you know,

187
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:40.560
various degrees that when ulus comes in those cells, that,

188
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.840
that are activated,

189
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.720
their little bell curves are gonna determine how much they respond to that.

190
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.720
And that's gonna propagate to other cells that have their own bell curves in

191
00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.200
areas. And so on down the line,

192
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.320
that what happens at the level of behavior

193
00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.680
is a very complicated, uh,

194
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:04.280
kind of summation of all those bell curves of all those cells

195
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.520
that happen to be activated. So it's not like, you know,

196
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.240
one thing is programmed. It's not like a brain areas program.

197
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.350
It's all about what's happened at those specific cells,

198
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.630
both through genetics and experience.

199
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:19.470
So we often kind of oversimplify things by thinking, well, there's a,

200
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.030
a gene or an area that has, um, inherited that. Then.

201
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:33.340
<v 2>&lt;Silence&gt;.</v>
