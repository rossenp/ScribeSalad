00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How long did it take you to research this?</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.730
<v 1>I, I, you know, I did this partly while I was at a day gig,</v>

3
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.060
so I'm not really sure. Probably three or four years, something like that. Um,

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.810
there isn't as much as you would think because, and the reason is, I mean,

5
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:20.670
there's a fair amount and it's all in Texas, which is good. Um, but there's,

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.060
uh, one curious thing about, um,

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.430
writing about native Americans is that they don't,

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.940
they didn't write anything down. So, so if you're writing about,

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.290
say Winston Churchill, I mean,

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.460
you can track him from like his bath in the morning to his seventh note to ask

11
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:38.910
what in his note to ask with, to, to his notes, to his wife,

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.360
to all of his proceedings in parliament and everything he ever did. It's like,

13
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:43.290
moment by moment,

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.400
you take someone like Quanta out on the planes and you've got pretty much

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.380
nothing. And so what you have, what you do have are, you know,

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.850
flashes that are seen by say the S the Spanish originally, or the French,

17
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.140
or Mexicans or Texans and Americans as they come through, you're,

18
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.440
you're seeing them in flashes on as they're presented to you,

19
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.560
because there are no parish records. There's no legal records,

20
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:10.770
there's no interviews, there's no things like that. That's so stuff.

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.210
<v 0>Yeah. It's so Stein,</v>

22
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:16.830
but that's one of the weirdest things about where they are today in 2019,

23
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:21.750
this idea that they don't have really a reservation

24
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:24.420
or specific giant chunk of land is theirs.

25
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.660
They sort of preserve at least some of this history.

26
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.250
<v 1>Yeah, no, it's, um, it was a peculiarity of Oklahoma that, that, that it,</v>

27
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.520
that it went that way because there are other states, as,

28
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:37.590
as we've talked about earlier, who have, who do have large, uh,

29
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.390
large reservations to this day. But, um, yeah, so it's, it's so,

30
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:46.020
and when you get, if you're writing about them, when you get to, um,

31
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.540
sort of the, the, the post reservation period, so let's say into the 1880s,

32
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.690
1890s, the world does change in terms of, you know,

33
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.160
things are being written down,

34
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.940
Quanta Quanta becomes a big part of his societies,

35
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.530
settling up cattle, leasing deals, he's founding a school board. I mean, he,

36
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.330
he does all these things that, you know,

37
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:10.020
that you wouldn't necessarily think a glorious chief of the Comanches would do,

38
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.290
but he does those things. And, and those are very trackable. I mean,

39
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:15.990
you know exactly what he's doing and you can research them.

40
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:17.640
And in conventional ways.

41
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
<v 0>I was fascinated by the pod rituals to now, was that a natural,</v>

42
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.850
normal part of Comanche life,

43
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:27.250
or is this something that he adopted from other tribes? He.

44
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.720
<v 1>Did it from something that had gone on, on the border, on the Mexican border,</v>

45
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.690
but it be, he became the founder of the native American church,

46
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:38.430
which had a payoti ritual in which he, and it became famous for him. Um,

47
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.180
and so there was a,

48
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.920
if there was this great a place I would really like to go back to in American

49
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:46.860
history would be to, uh, Quanta's house,

50
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.030
Quanta got his cattlemen buddies to build him. You, first of all,

51
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:54.120
he wanted the U S government to build him a house. Cause Kona was pustular.

52
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:56.790
And could I please have a house? I said, no, you can't have a house.

53
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.790
So he went to his, uh, cattlemen and they built in this house,

54
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.330
magnificent house and like 4,500 square feet,

55
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.050
double porch with these giant white stars and the roof,

56
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:10.000
it became known as satisfies house right there.

57
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.170
That star house it's fallen down, but are now, but yes, in its heyday,

58
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.110
it looked really. So that still exists to this day. It does.

59
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.560
And it's about to fall down and they found, uh, well, this, uh,

60
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.390
a guy who lives in, uh, cache or Lawton, Oklahoma, and who doesn't,

61
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.540
who has been unwilling to accept,

62
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.620
help or money from everybody from the Comanche nation to set right there,

63
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.430
there's always had the stars on the, yeah, I did, because he,

64
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.920
he saw that U S generals had these stars in their collars and he wanted,

65
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.600
he wanted more than they had. Wow. And, but that's,

66
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.290
that's that sits there and cache Oklahoma, and I've been in it,

67
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.810
but it's gotten so beat up now that they've,

68
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.590
they don't let you go in at any more, but it sits there. So, so yeah, so we,

69
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.180
as long as we have that there in 1895, if you went there in the,

70
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.990
I say early 1890s, you, it would have been one of the most amazing scenes.

71
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.440
We had people like Geronimo coming to dinner. Roosevelt came to dinner.

72
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.130
We Nelson miles, the great general came to dinner. He, he had a,

73
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.820
I think it was a Swiss, Mexican cook. He had six wives.

74
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.290
He had had 1921 children, 19 who grew to adulthood.

75
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.370
That house is full of kids. It would have been surrounded by lodges.

76
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.980
And the reason it would have been as cause people,

77
00:04:23.981 --> 00:04:28.840
his own tribe had come in for help money or pay for a funeral or,

78
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.490
or, or going back to the payout, a payoti ritual, which is a healing ritual.

79
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.200
And so you would have seen one of the great scenes in the American west. And,

80
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.810
and people went when he died in 1911,

81
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:44.920
people found out that he had given most of his money away, um, in,

82
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.530
in to all these people who had come in, asking for his help,

83
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:48.520
he had in fact helped them.

84
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:52.030
And given most of his cattle ranching money away that he had made.

85
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.930
<v 0>Now, this house is owned by one individual. Yes. And so, but,</v>

86
00:04:56.931 --> 00:05:00.640
but it's a historical landmark and no one's preserving it. They're not doing.

87
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.670
<v 1>I don't know all the details of it,</v>

88
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.850
but it's owned by Wayne Gibson and his sister, as far as I know still,

89
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.460
and they've owned it for a while. They don't want any help.

90
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.660
It was that house was put into an amusement park years ago to preserve it.

91
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.410
That was owned by Wayne's uncle, as far as I know. And so it was taken apart.

92
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.880
It was, was it taken apart? I don't know. They did move it though.

93
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.860
<v 0>They moved it. So this is not the original location.</v>

94
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.581
<v 1>Where it's at right now.</v>

95
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:28.750
The original location was out on what turned out to be later to be a Fort sill,

96
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:32.200
gunnery artillery range. And so they, they moved it.

97
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.530
And so Quanta's, um, uh, daughter,

98
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:38.800
I guess it was moved it down into cash and then it was moved one more time into

99
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:41.620
this amusement park, literally, uh,

100
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.430
that when I went into this amusement park, it was like something out of a,

101
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.950
I don't know, a Spielberg movie. I mean, you go,

102
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.160
I was told the house was back there and I couldn't really believe it,

103
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:55.990
but so we go in and you're going by these defunct old roller

104
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:59.510
coasters that are all overgrown with vines, like sleeping, beauties castle,

105
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.690
you know, and, and there's cows everywhere and, and,

106
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.960
and rides and carousels all grow all overgrown.

107
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.050
And then you go through a series of houses that were also moved there,

108
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:12.290
like Frank James, his house or something, and keep going,

109
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:16.610
keep going in the back there. That thing was, the house was sitting there. Wow.

110
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.870
Now it is his, he owns it. He's been approached, as I said,

111
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.490
by all sorts of different people,

112
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:25.490
consortium's of people with money who want to buy it or,

113
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.710
or just save it, you know, from literally the Comanche nation I know,

114
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.581
has wanted to,

115
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:36.500
and Texas tech has and some Dallas people and any number of people.

116
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.400
And so to my knowledge, thus far,

117
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:43.700
he refuses to sell or, or to.

118
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.770
<v 0>Take their help. Is that him right there?</v>

119
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.200
<v 1>I think that is that's him. Wayne Gibson. Yeah. Yeah. Hey,</v>

120
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.320
so he's a perfectly nice guy. He, he it's it's, uh,

121
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.490
he feels that house is very special in his family and it is indeed very special,

122
00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.900
but he won't the last time,

123
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.460
the last tour I got with him as you're going up the main stairwell,

124
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:07.250
there was a four foot by six inch hole in the main,

125
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.280
in the roof above the main stairwell. I mean,

126
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:13.880
you can't really have a four foot by six inch hole, no

127
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.580
rain. And the rain would just come through. And, um, but so.

128
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.900
<v 0>I do to preserve a house like this while still leaving it the way it is.</v>

129
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.800
So it's, you know what I'm saying? Like you would have to replace the wood. Now,

130
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:29.840
if you replaced the wood, is it still the same house?

131
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:34.640
Like there's arguments about boats and they've found some ancient boats and

132
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.340
they've done some rebuilding of these boats. Now,

133
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.390
all of sudden you're looking at new wood and the shape of this old boat. Like,

134
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:42.290
what is it actually.

135
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.140
<v 1>What is it? So I tell you the first time I walked in there,</v>

136
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.300
which was 15 years ago,

137
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.140
you wouldn't have needed to do that much work to it. 15 years ago,

138
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.800
you would have not have needed to eat.

139
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.770
You would've needed some bolstering for sure.

140
00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.480
And the foundation would have needed some work,

141
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:59.660
but it has gone way downhill because nothing has been done to it.

142
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:03.020
So now I don't know, but when I walked in there, you,

143
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:07.940
you really could have a good carpenter and carpenter team and a month

144
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.250
you could have shored that thing is.

145
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.090
<v 0>Christ. Yeah. That's so.</v>

146
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.980
<v 1>Sad. And I don't know how much of it, I mean,</v>

147
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:15.800
a lot of it was the problem was with all those holes in it and stuff,

148
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:18.710
it started to rot and rot. This rod is different than yeah.

149
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.160
<v 0>Yeah. And then you would have to actually really replace that would,</v>

150
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:23.420
so at the end of the day,

151
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.790
it was going to be a certain percentage of it is going to be new,

152
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:30.440
but at least you could sort of get a semblance of what it was and do your best

153
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:31.161
to sort of, I mean,

154
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:36.080
if you had like a real good architect on hand and a real good engineer

155
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.310
and someone from some sort of historical society where they could look at it and

156
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:40.641
say, okay,

157
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:45.530
this is what we want to maintain as much of this old stuff as possible while

158
00:08:45.531 --> 00:08:47.510
making sure that this thing can last for more people to.

159
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.720
<v 1>I think they could still do that, but I I'm, I'm, I'm no expert, but it's, uh,</v>

160
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.710
there's plenty of it that you can save. And there's things like, you know,

161
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:59.310
that w there's that famous. It's in my book, it's a picture of a,

162
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.370
the table Quantis table there, and you've got the tin ceiling.

163
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:04.590
That's still there and the floorboards are still there.

164
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:09.240
And those are all the same, you know, the same, uh, uh, stuff.

165
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:13.230
So I don't know. I'm no expert on it, but until the owner,

166
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:18.000
because it's his, until the owner decides to do something to it. Come on, bro.

167
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.450
What's his name? I think it's Wayne Gibson Gibson. Come on, Wayne.

168
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.740
It's ridiculous. He's a lovely guy. I'm sure he doesn't.

169
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:30.210
He just doesn't want to do that. Yeah. It's a giant part of history.
