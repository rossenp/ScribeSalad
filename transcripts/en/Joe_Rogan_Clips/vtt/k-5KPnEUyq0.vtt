00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.960
I was reading a quote today from that someone was mocking from Pierce Morgan.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.320
We was talking about the like atheists and, uh,

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.280
not knowing what happened before the big bang,

5
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.200
not knowing how no one has any answer for what happened before the big

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.950
bang and about how this made sense to him that, um, this is,

7
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.030
I think the way he was saying it was somehow or another,

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.870
it was evidence or at least in his eyes of something more superior. Oh,

9
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:31.704
here it is.

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.470
No atheist can never say what was there before the big bang.

11
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.670
They just say nothing. And they can't explain what nothing actually is.

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.670
No human brain can,

13
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.460
which is why I believe in something that has superior powers to the human brain.

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.780
Well, that makes sense. That there's definitely thi oh,

15
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:50.340
Brian Cox went after his. What did Brian Cox say?

16
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.260
If you mean the hot, big bang,

17
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:58.260
then there may be a period of rabbit expansion known as inflation.

18
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.930
This theory is able to account for the observed features of universe,

19
00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:06.610
including including the cm B power spectrum and the flatness and

20
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:09.050
horizon problems. &lt;laugh&gt; I love it.

21
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:11.850
Brian Cox just came at him with the science of, I love it.

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.450
I knew what he's trying to say. That's you do it.

23
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.650
I know what he's trying to say. What Pierce Morgan is trying to say,

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.850
and he he's he's right.

25
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.690
No one has an answer as to like why this thing became why the big bang happened.

26
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.240
It's a, this is an interesting, um, quote by this guy, we was talking about,

27
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.600
forget who it was. I wish I could remember,

28
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:30.920
but he was talking about how people have,

29
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.920
it might have been McKenna have so much faith in science and so little faith

30
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.040
in mystical things,

31
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.960
but yet science revolves on one initial theory where

32
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.590
magic took place. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; where everything came out of nothing,

33
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.990
that it was smaller than the head of a pin.

34
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.150
So everything that you see in the observable universe, including planes, trains,

35
00:01:52.151 --> 00:01:53.230
and automobiles. Yeah.

36
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.990
All of it had to have had an origin in the most spectacular

37
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.830
sorcery the world is ever known. Yeah. Like it is all dependent upon magic.

38
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.380
So he wasn't, he wasn't saying that, you know,

39
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.420
ridiculous ideological ideas of the start and birth and death of the universe

40
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.220
are, are fact. But he was saying that, look, look,

41
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.620
the fact according to scientists is that all evidence points to this

42
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:23.100
whole thing coming outta nothing, this whole thing, this whole thing,

43
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.290
existing nowhere. And with PI Morgan, I think is saying,

44
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.890
is that that gives birth. That,

45
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:31.250
that gives proof to something superior to the human brain,

46
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.090
which for sure it does. Well, here is we are,

47
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.410
this is Terrance can,

48
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.850
we were asked by science to believe that the entire universe SPR from

49
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:43.090
nothingness and at a single point, and for no discernible reason,

50
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.800
this notion is the limit case for credulity. In other words,

51
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.880
if you can believe this, you can believe anything. Well, I think I said it,

52
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.040
I said it in a paraphrasing way. That's basically the same thing. He's um,

53
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360
you know, just saying like it's, it's all nuts spent.

54
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.960
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, the, my, my, my thing is like,</v>

55
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.960
I think I like to think of it as in simulation terms in, in,

56
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.400
in the sense that if thinking of like reality and the way it's perceived and the

57
00:03:11.401 --> 00:03:15.160
way that we move through it is a kind of a designed game of, of sorts.

58
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.670
And so if I think of it in that way, like nothing and something,

59
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:24.470
nothing and something, that's just kind of, that's the core of our reality.

60
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.110
Right? We live in a binary reality.

61
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:30.870
Everything is a complex assortment of binaries that add up into a really

62
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:34.510
complex system. Right. In a way. So, but what do you think it's moving towards?

63
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.230
<v 0>What do you think.</v>

64
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.870
<v 1>About that? Well, that's, that's the thing, I think that part of the rules, or,</v>

65
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.980
or what makes it hard to rationalize like nothingness

66
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.940
or, uh, or something very,

67
00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:51.780
very fantastic is just because, because it's binary,

68
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.380
we are binary in our thought process.

69
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.420
So it's hard for us to not think of things in a binary way.

70
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.740
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so we think, oh, there was a beginning, no,

71
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:00.450
there was an ending, there was a beginning, there's an ending,

72
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.170
but really it's infinite. It's like it's paradox, right.

73
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.090
It's everything and nothing simultaneously. Mm. And, and the absence of which,

74
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.570
but, but I, I guess what I'm saying is that the idea that things are infinite,

75
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.330
that reality is infinite is kind of a good way, but kind of can be scary,

76
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.890
but a good way to think of,

77
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.360
because it doesn't make any sense why it wouldn't be,

78
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:28.160
it seems like we have a limited way of viewing what reality is.

79
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:31.800
And I think we're limited by our binary thought processes, I guess.

80
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.400
<v 0>Well, it's also interesting that we want to put any sort of limitations on the</v>

81
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.120
universe and that yeah. It's immense size. Isn't crazy enough for us. Yeah.

82
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.550
You know what I mean? I know. Or that, like, we could look at what we know.

83
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.070
That's funny if we know that the universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies,

84
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.270
like there's, there's a bunch of competing theories as to what happens,

85
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.510
you know, with black holes and whether or not there's multiverses,

86
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:58.910
there's a bunch of competing theories, right? Yes. Right. But the,

87
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.420
one of the most profound ones that it was ever explain to me is that there's a

88
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:06.660
super massive black hole in the center of every galaxy. And it's exactly,

89
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.340
I think one, half of 1% of the mass, the entire galaxy. Oh, really?

90
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.780
It works out with that. So the bigger, yeah. So the bigger galaxies have bigger,

91
00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.580
super massive black holes. Exactly. And the, the concept is that it's,

92
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.930
there is a real possib ability that going through that black hole,

93
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.810
you would encounter an entirely different universe.

94
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.170
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; with hundreds of billions of galaxies.

95
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.810
Each galaxy have a black hole in the center of it, go through that black hole,

96
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.610
an entirely different universe. So each one, each universe,

97
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.890
when you have hundreds of billions of galaxies, there is hundreds,

98
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.040
billions of universes through those black holes. Yes.

99
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.400
And each one of those galaxy or each one of those universes has also

100
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.040
hundreds of billions of galaxies. And each one of those has a black hole.

101
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.960
You go through that hundreds of billions of galaxy.

102
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.600
That the whole thing is fractal.

103
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 1>Exactly. Just like just keeps happening. People.</v>

104
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.120
<v 0>There's a resistance. No, come on. Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:04.121 --> 00:06:08.080
There's a thing like an instant reaction to resist that notion as if the

106
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.440
universe itself isn't already the most incredible thing of magic. Right.

107
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.400
I know like, what do you care if it's infinite? Why is that?

108
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.080
Why would you even resist that? Well, because.

109
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.310
<v 1>That, the part of the binary thinking it's like,</v>

110
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:21.150
you want something to have an end. It's like, it's, it's, it's a,

111
00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:23.710
it's a way for us to survive. But like, you know, it's like, oh,

112
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:28.110
there's an end to that. That creates a, uh, a need to survive.

113
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.710
But when you think of things in an abstract, like, like, well,

114
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.190
if something is just infinite, infinite, infinite, what does that mean about us?

115
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.380
It's like, that's the question, that's the thing to ex blower,

116
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.900
because then you have to renegotiate your, your, your relationship to reality.

117
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.980
Yeah. Which is.

118
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.860
<v 0>Pretty sick. We have,</v>

119
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.220
at least we'd like to take comfort in the idea that the universe has.

120
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.940
At least there's a certain parameter to it. No. Now it's 14 billion,

121
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:55.060
light years. That's it? That's it. No more, no more. Okay.

122
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.460
As if you can even understand what 14 billion.

123
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.970
<v 1>Is, there's no way it could be that number. &lt;laugh&gt; it seems more like 19.</v>

124
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.930
<v 0>But whatever that number is, they don't the way Cox explained it to me. Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.890
That you and I believe Sean carro explained it this way as well. There's a real,

126
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.770
there's a real lack of understanding about what goes beyond that,

127
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.040
because it takes a certain amount of time for light to even get it to us. Yeah.

128
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.480
And that time that it,

129
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.960
that the light doesn't move fast enough to reach us from further

130
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.840
events. Yeah. So like, if you had something from like 200 billion,

131
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.800
light years ago, maybe the light wouldn't even get to us yet.

132
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.160
<v 1>Yeah. There's things that, yeah. I mean, we're living in a time machine.</v>

133
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.950
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, that's when you see that's the other mind.</v>

134
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.110
When you're looking this guy and you're seeing a galaxy or a,

135
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.910
any sort of star, like in the deep, deep, deep distance of space. Yeah.

136
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.390
The light coming from that thing left a million years ago. Yeah. I know.

137
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.310
<v 1>Or way more, you're literally just looking at the past.</v>

138
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.660
<v 0>Is if you had, imagine what is the closest star to, uh,</v>

139
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.340
our star in the, the seeable universe, when you look up at the,

140
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.300
the night sky, it, the dog.

141
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.020
<v 1>Star, how far away is that? A star? Sometimes things are called stars,</v>

142
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:18.020
but they're planets from old school times. And I could be wrong if.

143
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.810
<v 0>You had a guess was the closest, how.</v>

144
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:22.690
<v 1>Many light office and tar, uh, I.</v>

145
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.610
<v 0>Don't know. Yeah, that sounds great. Uh, alpha and tar, is it, how much is it?</v>

146
00:08:26.611 --> 00:08:28.650
How far is that? Four.

147
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.050
<v 2>4.3 Light years from earth.</v>

148
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.250
<v 0>Wow. That's not too bad. That's hops, skip.</v>

149
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.330
<v 1>And that jump. You go to the speed of light, take you four years. That's.</v>

150
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.650
<v 0>Like the Hawaii of outer space that like,</v>

151
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:41.880
they go there and there goes a pits stop there before they come to earth and the

152
00:08:41.881 --> 00:08:42.920
aliens come, they wanna chill.

153
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.400
<v 1>I hope so. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

154
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.680
<v 2>Right. So hold on. There's a, this is.</v>

155
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.520
<v 1>A, oh. Some new, so I breaking these. No, not really. No, I'm.</v>

156
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.800
<v 2>Sorry. It's a binary pair.</v>

157
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.640
So I imagine that means that they move around each other.

158
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 1>A little bit. Yes. They orbit around each other. There's technically.</v>

159
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.120
<v 2>A third star Proximus Inari, which is,</v>

160
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.920
cause it says those are an average of 4.3. This one's 4.22.

161
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.360
So it's technically closer.

162
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.120
<v 1>But nice. I guess that average, so two are closer than the one on one day or.</v>

163
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.230
<v 0>Do they know if there's planets around those stars? &lt;affirmative&gt; so they, um,</v>

164
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.630
they didn't even know there were other planets for sure.

165
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.830
<v 1>Other than our solar system.</v>

166
00:09:20.831 --> 00:09:22.950
I know isn't that crazy till just a couple decades ago.

167
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:26.830
It's it's so amazing to me, it's like shining a flashlight in the ocean. Yeah.

168
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.790
You know, like that's what space is like, it's like, you're,

169
00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.070
you're moving a beam, but like,

170
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.340
things are constantly changing at different distances and you can see better

171
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.660
under certain circumstances and you can see at different times. So like,

172
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.620
it's kind of like a big existential party. Yeah. You're like,

173
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.140
I think I'm making sense of this. Yeah.

174
00:09:44.141 --> 00:09:46.860
And then there's all these theories and then someone catches another angle.

175
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:48.700
They're like, no, no, no. I mean, yes.

176
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.020
A little bit of what you guys were thinking, but also this and they're like.

177
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.940
And they just keep adding to it.

178
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.130
But I don't know if we're gonna find necessarily anything. Um, well, when.

179
00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.810
<v 0>You talk to physicists about the subject and they try to explain to you how they</v>

180
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:02.810
even reach these conclusions. Mm.

181
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.530
And how they know that there's black holes out there in the first place and that

182
00:10:06.531 --> 00:10:10.250
these theories of like these, these,

183
00:10:10.251 --> 00:10:14.530
these theories of multiverses and yeah. That's my favorite and brains.

184
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:19.320
The membranes that there's like in theory, like lines of universes,

185
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:21.120
then we collide with each other occasionally. Yeah.

186
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.560
<v 1>Yeah. What the? That's what I think ghosts are by the way. Woo.</v>

187
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.640
Which was like in, uh Intertel was it inters cell?

188
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; one with, yeah. With Matthew mod.

189
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.520
Is that the start MCCE dare. I know.

190
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.000
I'm pretty sure it was mod quest guys, vision quest.
