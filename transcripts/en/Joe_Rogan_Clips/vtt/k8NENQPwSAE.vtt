1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I mean, I think about how much,</v>

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.250
um, like how many mental health tools I need. I don't, I'm not, I am like you,

3
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:13.710
I have mental health problems. I've had anxiety in my past.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.460
I had debilitating hypochondria that I overcame,

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.900
man. I should really write a book about it. I should write,

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.040
kill your hypochondria before it kills you because it was debilitating.

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.430
<v 1>It was debilitating.</v>

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
<v 0>And it was, I wish people don't get past that. Oh, my therapist was like, you,</v>

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.830
how did you do this? But it was basically, I took, um, okay,

10
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.580
so it was kind of a three-prong attack because I'm like,

11
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:46.050
I can't live like this because hypochondria truly makes you feel insane

12
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.030
and you know, you can objectively know I'm crazy, but your mind gets stuck.

13
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:53.280
It's like OCD. And so it's,

14
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.150
it's kind of based in OCD because you get stuck in a loop.

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.270
Like I would just get stuck in a loop, for instance,

16
00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.240
like there's something wrong with my lip. There's something wrong with my lip.

17
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.420
There's something wrong with my lip. There's something wrong. I don't know.

18
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.080
Or just get stuck in that loop. Or I have throat cancer. I have throat cancer.

19
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:13.410
I have the, you know, I would just be like stuck in this crazy loop.

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.730
It's insane. It's insane. Did it come slowly or did it, it got worse,

21
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.520
you know? No. Um,

22
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.960
I think I come from like a long line of hypochondriacs though now because my mom

23
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:26.100
used to have, you know, those,

24
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.770
do you remember those books before the internet where it was like,

25
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:31.830
if you have this, it was like a choose your own adventure, but it was like,

26
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:34.890
if you have this symptom before the internet, there are these books.

27
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.520
Or he'd be like, if you have these, this symptom go to page 233,

28
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:42.540
and if you have this and I remember my mom would use those quite a lot.

29
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:47.520
So I think she has some of it. Um, my dad is just a big worrywart, so,

30
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.240
um, I have that kind of neurotic energy, I believe.

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.280
But I think too,

32
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:58.110
I was smoking a lot of weed and I mostly got it when I was hung

33
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:02.280
over. Like that's when it would be the worst is I would be hung over. So anyway,

34
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.940
I had.

35
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.220
<v 2>To realize what you did to your body. I think.</v>

36
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.070
<v 0>I just had, I had to attack it from,</v>

37
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.290
from three different places.

38
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:14.730
So the first is the actual, um, I was like, all right,

39
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:16.380
I'm going to rewire my brain.

40
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.960
And I set myself out to do this and I put a rubber band on and I did that stupid

41
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.970
thing, but it totally worked where if I was like,

42
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.160
there's something wrong with my lap and I'd snap my rubber,

43
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.700
rubber band and I'd be like, I'm healthy. I am healthy.

44
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.240
I would just replace it with, I am healthy. And if I come up with an idea,

45
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.440
I read somewhere that it's a good way to help with like repetitive thoughts or

46
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:42.150
to just help yourself. It, I mean, I was training my dog at the same time too.

47
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:45.240
And I was like, this is kind of like dog training.

48
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:49.710
I just have to interrupt that, you know, like that, that firing.

49
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.050
And there's that whole idea of what fires together, wires.

50
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:54.720
It's not even an idea. It's like what fires together, wires together.

51
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:58.470
So every time the other thing I had to do was be a deployment.

52
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.760
What fires together, wires together.

53
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.590
So it's this concept of whatever you're kind of thinking

54
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.460
and acting on it. It just creates like a pathway,

55
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.600
a neural pathway in your brain that gets stronger and stronger if there,

56
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.010
um, if it's like the, like, for instance, if I,

57
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.220
so this is why part two was replacing the thought,

58
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.550
but I also couldn't act on it. So I couldn't go look in the mirror.

59
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.040
I couldn't go Google anything. If I thought I had cancer,

60
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.210
I had to cut myself off from acting on because a lot of people who have

61
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.460
hypochondria they'll they'll obsessively,

62
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:36.700
Google they'll go get tested for everything.

63
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.540
They'll spend thousands of dollars getting tests. Luckily I was not on,

64
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.550
I didn't have insurance.

65
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.360
I was too poor to really like lean fully into my hypochondria that way. Um,

66
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.080
and I just had to stop myself from the action because that, you know,

67
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:52.630
anytime you have a thought and you act on it,

68
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:56.500
it reinforces that connection that like mind, body connection.

69
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:59.680
And it would reinforce that pattern of worrying.

70
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.270
And then I had to start observing. I kept, this is very, I guess, too,

71
00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:08.410
it's very like, um, CBT, so cognitive behavioral therapy.

72
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.330
I didn't know this is kind of what I was doing,

73
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:13.000
but I would keep now they have very,

74
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.180
it's like you keep a record a thought what they call a thought log.

75
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.920
And I would just document when I had the thought, what brought it up?

76
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.290
Like what triggered that back?

77
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.230
Cause there's always kind of a trigger and then what action I took and what

78
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.500
action I could take to replace it. And so I,

79
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.480
sometimes it's just not acting on it at all.

80
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.620
And then I started working with therapists on all the things that were

81
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.540
underpinning those, um, the, the triggering thoughts.

82
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:43.180
So one was like, I couldn't hold joy. I just,

83
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.960
anytime I felt like I was excited about doing anything. I was going to Hawaii.

84
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.070
That was when I was like perseverating on my lips. And I couldn't, it was like,

85
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:55.840
I could not enjoy anything without my brain telling me that everything was

86
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:59.110
going to and I was going to die. So I had to look at that.

87
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.700
Where does that come from? Feelings of worthlessness upbringing, whatever.

88
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.500
Then the other one was shame around sexuality. Like there was just some,

89
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.050
a lot of shame around, um,

90
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.800
like I was pretty promiscuous when I was drinking a lot and I didn't,

91
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:19.720
I wasn't always proud of the men I woke up with and it happens to the party

92
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:23.850
girls and, you know, I was an engineer,

93
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.210
I was an international sleds. And, um, there were some,

94
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.240
there were some like guilt I'm Catholic to raise Catholic.

95
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:34.530
So that got squirted in before I had a chance in hell.

96
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.050
And so there was lots of shame around that,

97
00:05:37.051 --> 00:05:40.650
that I had to really look at and deal with. And, um, and yeah,

98
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:44.760
so I just started looking at all this stuff and I like, it took me, it was work,

99
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.810
it was fricking work and now I'm like completely free of it.

100
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.900
<v 2>I don't, yeah. Congratulations.</v>

101
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.820
<v 0>I mean, I, I definitely,</v>

102
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.310
I feel like I can live and breathe and I can just be present was big.

103
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.190
And then I think a lot of people forget that, you know,

104
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:06.110
drinking and substances are not a coping mechanism. They can be, if you,

105
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:11.000
if you are not using them addictively but for many people like drinking

106
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.790
is they'll be like, I have a coping tool it's drinking. I'm like,

107
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.520
that's that a coping tool exacerbates.

108
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.870
<v 2>It or not.</v>

109
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.640
<v 0>So I had to quit that and I was joking just like how many things I need to</v>

110
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:27.050
do to start my day. I'm like, I wake up, I meditate. I have to like, you know,

111
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:31.100
I have to work out or I'm a crazy person. I've got to sweat. They're just,

112
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.960
I just know what I have to do. And people it's important. I think instead of,

113
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.570
and people ask me all the time, how I deal with the online hate and all that.

114
00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:43.550
I'm like, I just go work out. That's my answer to everything.

115
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.670
<v 2>Yeah. That's an answer though,</v>

116
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:50.230
because he requires effort and it requires it like as much as it's difficult

117
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:53.260
when you're sitting down in front of a computer to overcome procrastination,

118
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.170
right. Multiply that times 10.

119
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:01.310
And it's getting to the gym because the physical discomfort of you like

120
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.970
your mind while your frame of mind, you.

121
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.460
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.
