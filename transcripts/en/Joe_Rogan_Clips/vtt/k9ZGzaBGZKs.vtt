00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, this message.</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:08.130
Is this something that you have sort of developed over the years of arguing with

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:08.960
people about.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.530
<v 1>No, it's mostly from, uh, what we did at whole foods.</v>

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.880
Cause I had no background in business. Right? I'm an entrepreneur. I didn't,

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.020
I started here right in Austin. That's right. First store here, 40,

7
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:21.970
over 42 years ago.

8
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.840
<v 0>Jesus. You look great. How old are you? 67 look. Very good. Well.</v>

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.940
<v 1>Thank you you right now. Look when rolling.</v>

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.750
<v 0>Up. You're eating all that whole foods, eating all that healthy whole foods.</v>

11
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.290
That is one thing that you guys did do. That's very interesting. Right?

12
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:40.520
You created a market where like, if you tell people I go to whole foods,

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.290
you know, people are like, Oh, well you care about your health. Like you're,

14
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:49.190
it's synonymous with healthy foods. Even in the name,

15
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.570
whole foods.

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.220
<v 1>That was our brand when we were up in calmer. And then when we got really rich,</v>

17
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.890
uh, America loves the up and calmer,

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.700
but then once you have become really successful, you're making a lot of money.

19
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:06.650
They start to turn on you. Oh no. Well we became whole paycheck. Who said that?

20
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.570
I don't know, but whoever did I wish.

21
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.210
<v 0>I never saw it. You never saw that until right now.</v>

22
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:14.840
You just on yourself in a way that I never, all I heard was whole foods.

23
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:17.310
I never heard whole paycheck. Then you, your.

24
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.370
<v 1>Team didn't do good research. Have.</v>

25
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.580
<v 0>No team. So does this, when you sold the Amazon?</v>

26
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.211
<v 1>No, no.</v>

27
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.450
The whole paycheck thing has been around for a long time because the whole

28
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:28.250
paycheck, meaning. Cause it's so expensive. Yes.

29
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:32.420
Because initially when we were up in calmer, you, if you shot that whole food,

30
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.010
you were showing everybody, you were sort of,

31
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.650
you were with it and you were hip and cool.

32
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.520
And then the narrative went sour because it's like, um, it's,

33
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.700
you're a fool for shopping there because you can get the same food cheaper

34
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.740
elsewhere. So you're going to whole paycheck.

35
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.390
So the narrative turned a negative so to speak. Um,

36
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.670
I still see that pretty much all the time.

37
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:56.420
Although since our merger with Amazon, we've cut our prices many, many times.

38
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.320
How'd you do that? Amazon allowed whole foods to think long-term again,

39
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.410
we needed to cut our prices. But when you're a public company,

40
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.410
if you're selling something for a dollar and you say, you know what,

41
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:10.220
we need to sell this for 90 cents and you start selling it for 90 cents in the

42
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:11.054
short run,

43
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.590
you just cut your sales 10% because you're just not selling any more of it over

44
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:19.190
the long-term people will realize, man, I can get a good deal for 90 cents.

45
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.830
They used to pay a buck for it and they start to shop with you more. And,

46
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:23.210
and your S your sales will go up.

47
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.690
But when you're a public company and the market's very short-term oriented,

48
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:30.200
you pay a heavy price in the short term for reducing your prices.

49
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.130
And Amazon is willing to think longterm and let whole foods do that.

50
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.710
<v 0>Just Jeff Bezos got that long money son.</v>

51
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.990
<v 1>He has a long money because he's had,</v>

52
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.040
he's had a lot of brilliant ideas and put together a pretty, pretty good team.

53
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.080
<v 0>Yeah. What keeps that guy working when you, when you have 150 in the bank,</v>

54
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.750
150 billion, what keeps you going?

55
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.710
<v 1>And it doesn't have it in the bank. He's got it in stock. Few in the,</v>

56
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.040
he's got a few in the bank. Probably. I feel like he could probably relax.

57
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.830
I mean, I think I, the same thing that keeps me going at age 67, I mean,

58
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.480
uh, building something's great fun and building whole foods. I don't, I mean,

59
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.210
I've got plenty of money, Joe. I don't need to work. I just like it.

60
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.790
<v 0>You still run whole foods. Like, what's your relationship there? I'm still CEO.</v>

61
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.280
So you still work long hours.

62
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.720
<v 1>I don't work as long today as I did when I was in my twenties and thirties.</v>

63
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.060
There's no question about it. Cause I was putting a lot of 80 hour,

64
00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:27.650
weeks and year after year after year after year now you're building something,

65
00:03:27.651 --> 00:03:31.920
you know, it wasn't work. It was play. I was having a blast. It was fun.

66
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.550
<v 0>Elon Musk is famously said that if you're in a tech startup and you're not</v>

67
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:39.510
working 120 hour weeks, you won't succeed. Yeah.

68
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.450
<v 1>I never been at a tech startup. So I can't speak for that.</v>

69
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.330
The grocery business wasn't quite that hard, but we did put a lot of 80 hours.

70
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.870
Seems.

71
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.580
<v 0>Like not a lot of time to sleep.</v>

72
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.540
<v 1>And I'm a great believer in sleep. Sleep is high. Like how many.</v>

73
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.750
<v 0>Hours are left? How many hours are in a week? Well,</v>

74
00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:59.220
let's say there's 24 hours, 168 hours a week,

75
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.240
160. You only have 48 hours to sleep. That is ridiculous. You won.

76
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.460
<v 1>So that's well, I don't know if you,</v>

77
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:09.900
all you did was that 48 hours divided by seven that's almost seven hours a

78
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:12.900
night. If all you did was work and sleep. I don't know when he eats.

79
00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:16.650
Maybe you have to eat when you're working, you have to eat. When eating,

80
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.350
you got to go to the bathroom. Sometime you got to scratch that out.

81
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.540
<v 0>So you sleep seven hours a night and just stay at work. Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.560
<v 1>I don't actually think you have to put a lot of energy into build anything,</v>

83
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.260
but um, if you're doing it right,

84
00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:34.020
we talk a lot about conscious capitalism is about higher purpose.

85
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.200
If you have a purpose, that's animating you. It doesn't feel like work.

86
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:41.100
It feels like play. It also attracts people to you that share that same purpose.

87
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.570
<v 0>This is something that I find very frustrating and people that don't recognize</v>

88
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:49.080
that it is incredibly difficult to build a successful business when they just

89
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:51.660
want to tax the out of people and take all that money. Like,

90
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.410
do you think it's easy to make something like whole foods?

91
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:59.030
Do you think it's easy to make a company like Tesla? Do you think it's easy?

92
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.160
It's not easy. It's an insanely difficult task.

93
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:03.690
That's why most people don't do it.

94
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.590
But when someone does do it and they have become successful,

95
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.370
then other people start looking at it and go, well, they have all this money.

96
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:14.730
They should contribute more or they should do this. Or, you know,

97
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:15.890
you're talking about, uh,

98
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.630
some people have suggested some extraordinary tax rates in order to get us out

99
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:24.510
of this current recession. And, uh, uh,

100
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.930
then I talked to business people and they say that is the exact wrong approach

101
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.510
because that's actually gonna stifle business and businesses.

102
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:32.400
The only thing that's going to bring us out of this,

103
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:37.110
if you incentivize businesses to take risks and to be open and to

104
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.020
make more profits than more people are going to get jobs,

105
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.210
then the economy bounces back.

106
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.980
But if you give them a gigantic tax burden,

107
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.740
they're going to be less likely to take chances.

108
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:54.180
They're not going to be able to survive that. And people on the outside,

109
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:58.820
who've never built a business like whole foods. They don't to see that.

110
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.700
<v 1>They don't see it. Um, the reality is,</v>

111
00:06:03.701 --> 00:06:08.230
is that people like an Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos,

112
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.570
um, they are they're good capital allocators, so to speak.

113
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.980
They're not going to waste that money.

114
00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:19.810
That money is going to be reinvested to create new and more

115
00:06:19.811 --> 00:06:24.190
dynamic businesses that will help the innovations will help our society move

116
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:26.800
forward. When you just redistribute that money,

117
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.310
it there's no more additional innovation. It's just, it's just,

118
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.360
it's being consumed.

119
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.100
This whole idea that it's consumption that drives the economy is

120
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:37.600
fundamentally a myth.

121
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.990
It's mostly creativity and innovation that drives the economy.

122
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.890
So we need to keep that money in the hands of our most creative people,

123
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.060
which are entrepreneurs and creative business people. And for some reason,

124
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:52.720
I probably, I think because of envy, it seems so unfair. Again,

125
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.920
we in a win lose model.

126
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.880
If Jeff Bezos has $150 billion,

127
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.740
then that's unfair in some sort of cosmic way. That's unfair.

128
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.680
And they believe that some or another others have less.

129
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.970
So there's like this fixed pie and Jeff took a big piece of it or, or, or,

130
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.330
or Elon Musk is taken a big piece of it, but it's not a fixed pie.

131
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.290
That's the wrong metaphor. Innovation ism is continually growing the pie.

132
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:18.251
And in fact,

133
00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:22.240
humanity is demonstrably better off because of the capitalist because of the

134
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:22.660
innovation.

135
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.090
<v 0>Let me play devil's advocate. Cause this is the way they look at it.</v>

136
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:29.320
They would say, well, when you get to that sort of a position like a Jeff Bezos,

137
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:31.300
we have $150 billion.

138
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.160
You can exert your influence on people in a way that's detrimental to

139
00:07:36.161 --> 00:07:39.850
society. You've achieved too high of a position.

140
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.240
You have too much power and you will probably lose,

141
00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:46.810
use that power to loosen regulations,

142
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.790
to bribe politicians or influence politicians and to get

143
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:55.750
laws passed that are better for your business and stifle competition.

144
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.760
<v 1>I think that's a powerful argument. And if, and when it happens,</v>

145
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:02.860
you have to push back against, you have to resist it.

146
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.990
I think most business people are not doing that.

147
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:08.320
I think I don't see that Jeff's trying to pass or I,

148
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.380
or I don't see Mo I don't see Jeff trying to pass.

149
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.980
<v 0>No, I don't think he is. He's on. I'm not saying he is. If he was boy,</v>

150
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:18.140
would they come after him? Yeah. Cause he's bawling so hard. They'd be like.

151
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.320
He is doesn't have enough.

152
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.930
<v 1>But I know that before when whole foods was,</v>

153
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.460
we were a public company for 25 years and we had the government go after us a

154
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:30.640
few times, uh, for, uh, they tried to stop our,

155
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.230
we tried to make an acquisition of a,

156
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.280
of a company called wild oats back in 2007, we actually made the acquisition,

157
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:37.810
but the FTC tried to stop it.

158
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.250
We ended up going into court with them and we actually won in court and very

159
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:45.960
interesting. The FTC has their own court and they,

160
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.950
after we won in the federal courts, they said, well,

161
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:49.600
now we want to take you into the, our court.

162
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.600
<v 0>Oh, terrific. They have their own court. They had their own court.</v>

163
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:55.170
Don't you wish you had your own court take you to whole foods. Court.

164
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.090
<v 1>I'll take you to the whole town court. Right. But you know, the people's court,</v>

165
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.730
you don't win in the FTC court. You don't win in that court.

166
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.040
So how many people have won in that court?

167
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.060
I think when I've looked at it at that time, this back in 2007,

168
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:13.770
I think 46 of the 48 previous cases. This is from memory. So I could be wrong,

169
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.320
had lost. They should go to court. Someone should take them to,

170
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.300
but here's the thing I asked our attorney, so, okay.

171
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:20.520
We're going to lose in this court, in their court, then what happens?

172
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.950
This isn't well, then you appeal that back to the federal courts.

173
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.580
And then after that, if they want to, they would go to the Supreme court.

174
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:27.241
If they'll take it. I said,

175
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:30.720
how much is it going to cost me to just fight him in their own courts?

176
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.330
They said, it's going to cost you $30 million legal fees.

177
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:37.050
Not to mention a lot of executive time. And it's like, man,

178
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:38.700
30 million and we're gonna know we're gonna lose.

179
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.270
And then we're gonna have to spend another $30 million to go to the appeals of

180
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:44.820
beyond that. The lawyers love it. By the way,

181
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.360
of course they want you to do it like divorce lawyers. Yes, exactly.

182
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.040
Let's love it. It's how people fight. Not talk. Don't talk,

183
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.200
don't try to work this out because he's going to try to you,

184
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.540
don't try to steal your money. He's going to try to steal that money from me.

185
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:01.830
A piece of. Look at him, look at him. Um, so again, so what did you do?

186
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.070
You wind up settling. We ended up, yes. We ended up,

187
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.280
they let the merger go through and we agree to sell off a bunch of stores.

188
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.040
And that was, that was the best we could do.

189
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.160
How many stores you have to sell off? Uh, we,

190
00:10:15.161 --> 00:10:19.990
we put up about 30 for sale and we,

191
00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:24.780
we only about about, I dunno, I think five or six, we sold about five or six.

192
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:30.410
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
