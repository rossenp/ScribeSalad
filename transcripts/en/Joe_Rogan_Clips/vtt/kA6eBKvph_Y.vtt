00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.853
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.010
So you brought up MK ultra and ultra was a government program

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.830
run by the central intelligence. 80, uh,

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.430
agency originally started as something called Bluebird in

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.310
19 48, 49 morphed into artichoke.

6
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:21.780
And then in 1952 became MK ultra. It was a mind control program,

7
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:23.190
a brainwashing program.

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.650
The CIA was trying to learn how to control people's behavior

9
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.990
without their knowledge. Now,

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.640
this is all came out in Senate and congressional hearings in the seventies.

11
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.780
It was exposed, but nobody knew about it until 1974,

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.980
when Seymour Hersh,

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.960
the New York times reporter reported on the front page of the paper. So, um,

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
their main objective was to commit or to create what they call a hypno program,

15
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.770
assassins, people who would kill OnCommand, uh,

16
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.980
popularly known as mutt Manchurian candidates.

17
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:03.330
After a book that was written in 1962 and later became a movie and then a movie

18
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:08.010
again, uh, the people would be through drugs and hypnotism.

19
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.020
The objective was to get people to go and come in an act of murder

20
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:17.910
against their moral code and have no memory of their

21
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.010
programming, uh, and B amnesia, even of the act after the fact often,

22
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.590
uh, that was just one, that was our main goal,

23
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:28.680
but they were also trying to create couriers people, you know,

24
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.790
military people that they could implant messages, send them, you know,

25
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:37.350
across dangerous areas. Whether at that time it was the Vietnam war,

26
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.400
uh, and deliver messages and then have them wipe from their,

27
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:45.540
their memory in case they were captured, uh, they had all kinds of objectives.

28
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:48.570
So Roger Smith was, um,

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.430
supervising Manson when he became exactly what he was

30
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:53.971
able to do.

31
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:58.830
Exactly what the MK ultra program had been trying to create and do for at that

32
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.450
point about 15,

33
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.800
17 years when it was all exposed in the seventies.

34
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.050
And there were these hearings first, um,

35
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.950
the Rockefeller commission hearings and the church hearings, and then finally,

36
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.720
uh, senators, Ted Kennedy and Daniel anyway held hearings. Um,

37
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.470
the CIA admitted that they had done this, but they,

38
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.780
no one would say exactly what they did.

39
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.080
All the records had been destroyed when the two people who ran it,

40
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.861
Richard Helms,

41
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:30.360
who had become the director of the CIA in the sixties and Dr. Sydney Gottlieb,

42
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.480
who was kind of the mad scientist who, um,

43
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.400
had supervised all the, all the, they had safe houses in San Francisco,

44
00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:40.620
New York, Los Angeles,

45
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:44.370
where they would experiment on people that were Lord and into these, um,

46
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.460
apartments and houses that were either look,

47
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.690
look like profiteroles or hippie communes or whatever. And, um,

48
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.770
the people who were working at the Haight Ashbury free medical clinic that was

49
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:58.380
run by another Smith, which makes it a little confusing.

50
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.480
But Dr. Smith who founded it, um,

51
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.400
he had given an office to a scientist named jolly west Lewis,

52
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.230
J west, who, um, was when,

53
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.000
when the hearings occurred in the seventies,

54
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:17.410
identified as a top MK ultra researcher. He was an academic,

55
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.870
uh, come out of the military,

56
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.110
had been at the Oklahoma university of Oklahoma university,

57
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.850
university of Oklahoma, sorry. And then UCLA running the psychiatric divisions,

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.590
he denied ever being involved in MK ultra. And this was one of the moments,

59
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:35.170
I think it was 2001, when, you know,

60
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.460
things really kind of shocked the course of my

61
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:43.960
reporting was I learned that west had been at the same place that Manson

62
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:48.670
was in the hate and the summer that Manson became exactly what the CIA was

63
00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:49.780
trying to create.

64
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.270
And I knew actually I interviewed west about seven years before for

65
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.340
a story I did about celebrity stalkers,

66
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.630
the people who were obsessed with stars and then only to kill them or try to

67
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:05.860
kill them. And he was an expert in violence, hypnotism brainwashing,

68
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:10.630
and he was the chair of the psychiatry department at UCLA at that point, uh,

69
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.380
he was dead when his name came up in the Manson story.

70
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.430
And there wasn't a lot of, I mean, I guess there was a lot of Google then,

71
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.560
or a little bit, but when I did a little research,

72
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:24.460
I found out that there had been these allegations that he'd been involved in MK

73
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:28.870
ultra. He always denied it. He was never prosecuted, never even investigated.

74
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:29.920
He went to his grave,

75
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.340
threatening to Sue anybody that said he would have anything to do with this kind

76
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:36.790
of a program, again, through another long story.

77
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:41.500
But I got access to his files, which had been left at UCLA, uh,

78
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.270
and never, they had never been processed when I called and went.

79
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:49.150
When I made the request, it took him two or three months to process the papers.

80
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.020
I went through them through the whole summer looking for a needle in a haystack

81
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.180
and it was intuition gut.

82
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.570
I just thought there might be something there and sure enough,

83
00:04:58.571 --> 00:04:59.590
I eventually found it.

84
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.950
It was correspondence between jolly west and Sydney Gottlieb.

85
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.550
The doctor that ran and Carol ultra beginning in 1953,

86
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.050
about Kentucky conducting experiments on people without their knowledge,

87
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.970
to get them to, uh, have a near fix, uh,

88
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.420
amnesia of the acts, uh, after they were programmed and, uh,

89
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.560
everything that he had been accused of and denied.

90
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.240
He did not only did he do it,

91
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:29.350
he created the blueprint for the whole program with Gottlieb. Uh,

92
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.740
the fact that all these kind of, uh,

93
00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.470
interesting research programs merged at the hate at the

94
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:43.390
clinic and then Manson came out of it with the power to do exactly

95
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:46.870
what then Kyle too, I've been trying to create for up to that point,

96
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.690
I thought was worth investigating further.

97
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:52.360
And that's why I kept going and going and going.

98
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.340
<v 1>They did a lot of crazy back then. Are you aware of operation midnight,</v>

99
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.203
midnight.

100
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.250
<v 0>That those were the safe houses in San Francisco? Well,</v>

101
00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:01.570
that was the brothel version.

102
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.880
<v 2>Of it where they, they lured.</v>

103
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.320
<v 1>These Johns into these brothels and then dose them up with LSD and studied them.</v>

104
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.460
Yeah, George Hunter.

105
00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.140
<v 0>White was the head CIA guy and he would sit behind a two way or one way</v>

106
00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:18.730
mirror and watch the Johns would be dosed with LSD.

107
00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:22.330
They tried aerosols or just drinks, different things,

108
00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:26.200
and then they would study their behaviors and aerosols. Yeah. Aerosol sprays.

109
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.950
Yeah. Yeah. But.

110
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.230
<v 1>That would get the prostitutes too then. No, no, the.</v>

111
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.690
<v 0>Prostitutes would get them in there and then they go to the bathroom or</v>

112
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:32.170
something.

113
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.570
<v 2>Or did they in the bathroom again.</v>

114
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.430
<v 0>The problem is the records are so scant because Helms order Gottlieb</v>

115
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.260
to destroy all the records in 1973, when the two men left the agency.

116
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.030
And the only reason anybody ever discovered that it existed was a whistleblower.

117
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:52.990
Somebody who used to work for the state department who remembered that there

118
00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:57.040
were records in a warehouse and they were just financial records from the

119
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.540
beginning of the program.

120
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.010
And 52 until the end and the possible end in 73.

121
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.390
And, uh,

122
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.860
it was just financial records of where research took place.

123
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.380
How much was spent, what kind of equipment was bought,

124
00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:13.000
but nothing about the content.

125
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.380
The guy that found that ended up testifying to Congress and working with Seymour

126
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.540
hers to expose it was named John Marks.

127
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.230
He wrote the first book about MK alter that came out in the mid to late

128
00:07:23.231 --> 00:07:25.930
seventies, called the search for the Manchurian candidate.

129
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.180
And after he wrote his book, he never S you know, he spoke, uh,

130
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.100
did a little bit of a tour and then retreated into obscurity and never

131
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:40.480
would do an interview again until I approached him in the early two

132
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:44.950
thousands. And when I told him what I had, what I had found in west files,

133
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:49.360
these documents, he agreed to meet with me at his townhouse in Washington, DC.

134
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.040
And he told me, he said,

135
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:55.120
the reason I stopped talking or writing about this was people were camping out

136
00:07:55.121 --> 00:07:59.740
on my front lawn, you know, telling me that they'd been victims of MKR altar.

137
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.150
He goes, I couldn't go anywhere.

138
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.320
And my whole life became crazy because everybody thought that they were subject

139
00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:09.430
to this because nobody knew they did these drug tests on prisoners,

140
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.860
hospital patients, Johns hippies,

141
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:15.730
people that had no idea that this was going on for 25 years.

142
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.880
So Mark's became the authority.

143
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.000
So he had never given an interview until he met with me.

144
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.280
And when he looked at my documents at that point,

145
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:29.110
I think I had about 10 or 12 or 15 pages that grew eventually because I

146
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:31.180
kept going back to the files and getting more.

147
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.440
He said it was the most unredacted, uncensored,

148
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.330
uh, account of what the real objectives were and what was really being done.

149
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:41.980
He had never, he said, if I had had that,

150
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:44.530
my whole book would have been different. Um,

151
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.910
so that's one of the problems about saying, well, how much did they do?

152
00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:52.720
Or how far did they go? There's barely any record.

153
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:57.330
And that's another reason it took me 20 years. Cause I trying to find out, uh,

154
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.340
whether or not Wes had actually interacted with Manson and where the girls,

155
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.650
I mean, I knew he was in the same facility.

156
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.260
I knew that everybody that worked there because I interviewed everybody that was

157
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:07.860
alive,

158
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.000
most of them were still alive back in the late nineties and early two thousands.

159
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:15.000
When I did this, they all said, oh yeah, Charlie was, you know,

160
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.170
we knew it was Charlie and the girls they'd come in every day or every few days

161
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:23.670
to see Roger and Wes was there recruiting subjects.

162
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.100
Now west, while he was there,

163
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.000
that summer had opened something called what he called the Haight Ashbury

164
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:32.700
project. And in his, uh,

165
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.930
correspondence and papers that I found, he called it a, uh,

166
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.190
laboratory disguise as a hippie crash pad. And, uh,

167
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.910
and just like the operation midnight, uh, safe house,

168
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.690
they call them safe houses, which were disguised as, uh, you know,

169
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:51.840
bordellos and that type of thing or brothels. These,

170
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.940
this was an apartment that was decked out.

171
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.170
Or as he called it tricked out to look like a communal hippy place,

172
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:02.250
he had six graduate students and I have in his letters to them before they came

173
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:06.180
to work in this, he goes, grow your hair long, wear jeans,

174
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.210
dress like hippies and lore people in there.

175
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.420
So they ran that for the summer of 67.

176
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.040
And Wes was getting people from that Haight Ashbury free medical clinic on

177
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:20.850
Clayton street and sending them around the corner to Frederick street, uh,

178
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.350
to participate in that God Lord. And, um,

179
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.300
I got the diaries of some of the graduate students who were there and they all

180
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:32.040
in these diaries said,

181
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.130
we have no idea what we're really supposed to be doing here.

182
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:38.040
We feel like this whole thing is a cover for something else.

183
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:43.080
What does jolly want? Why is he making us bring these people in? So, uh,

184
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:43.520
and.

185
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.750
<v 1>Doing that to graduate students,</v>

186
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.650
telling them to bring people in and drug them up, imagine telling them, well.

187
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.860
<v 2>Some of the mine apartment, I'm sure they, it, because they were also, you know.</v>

188
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.680
<v 0>Encouraged to use LSD. Sure.</v>

189
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.470
<v 1>I mean, imagine being a graduate student,</v>

190
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.580
and this is your project on people, I mean, that sets up.

191
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.390
Even if you leave that program and go on to do legitimate work,

192
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:10.520
the ethical foundations of your career are set up in such a strange way.

193
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.550
You're manipulating people against their knowledge.

194
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.710
<v 0>Well, they didn't know who they were doing it for.</v>

195
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:20.300
That's why they were always questioning it. So, um, you know,

196
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.510
I don't know how I found one or two of them after.

197
00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:25.670
And they were very careful talking to me.

198
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.270
I'm sure they felt like they were going to go to jail. Well, that's the thing.

199
00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:32.450
Yeah. Um, if any of these experiments or whatever was going on,

200
00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:36.860
resulted in a death, there's no statute of limitations on murder, right? Um,

201
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:37.881
I mean,

202
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:42.770
that's one of the biggest disappointments of my book is that people like west

203
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:46.340
aren't alive to answer for that, to answer to this.

204
00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:49.070
And it was really frustrating for me because again,

205
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:53.210
his name was on the front page of the New York times in 1977,

206
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.960
they had the major hearings about MK ultra.

207
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.870
And it identified him as the head of the psychiatry department at UCLA,

208
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.440
very prominent doctor or researcher. And he said he had nothing to do with that.

209
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:09.850
He'd never used LSD on humans. And he wouldn't, uh,

210
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.970
he said they had asked him and he said, no. Um,

211
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.600
I have all these letters between him and the guy who was running the program,

212
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.790
describing how they're going to do it,

213
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.730
hide it from his colleagues when he started it,

214
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:24.640
he started at Lackland air force base. He was, uh,

215
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.140
running the psychiatry department at the hospital there in 1952 when he was

216
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:31.090
there running that hospital.

217
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.410
That's when he started his experiments on prisoners, human subjects,

218
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:37.030
and one letter to Gottlieb, he says,

219
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.500
eventually we have to take these experiments out into the field. Oh, Jesus.

220
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.080
Exactly. What does that mean? Well,

221
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.170
if you're having gotten through a chapter 11, yet you.

222
00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.170
<v 2>Haven't gotten to the Jimmy shaver case a.</v>

223
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.770
<v 0>Year after maybe Jamie did a year after, uh,</v>

224
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.660
west contracted with, um, the CIA to do these experiments.

225
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.780
July 4th, 1954,

226
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.980
a three-year-old girl went missing from the parking lot of a bar,

227
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.020
uh, at about 11 or 12 at night. And her parents, it was a heat wave.

228
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.740
They couldn't sleep. They went to the bar, they brought their two kids.

229
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.070
They let them play in the parking lot at midnight. Uh,

230
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.600
the little girl disappeared.

231
00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:24.760
They organized a search party about three or four hours later. They, uh,

232
00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:29.800
went to a gravel pit and, uh,

233
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.430
two arrow to airmen had called or two

234
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.650
itinerant guys had called the police, the local sharer and said,

235
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:43.480
there's a guy here that wandered out of the brush with scratches

236
00:13:43.481 --> 00:13:47.980
and blood, no shirt. And he doesn't know how he got here, who he is.

237
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.090
Uh, the police came, his name was Jimmy shaver. He was an airman.

238
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.990
They did a search and they found a little girl's body, not too far away.

239
00:13:55.991 --> 00:13:59.230
And she had been raped and murdered, uh,

240
00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.850
by this guy who had no memory of doing it. The guy had no history of,

241
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.400
uh, violence. Um,

242
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.420
he had a couple of kids and he was a flight instructor at the school.

243
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:12.160
He'd been in the military for a number of years.

244
00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:15.970
I think it was in his early thirties. Well guess who became his, uh,

245
00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.130
psychiatrist in preparation for the trial jolly west who inserted

246
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:26.020
himself into the case and then extracted his memory from him using sodium.

247
00:14:26.021 --> 00:14:29.260
Pentothal where he admitted to the, the murder.

248
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.520
Now in the context of what we found out west was doing and what his objectives

249
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:36.100
were at that same time,

250
00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:40.750
it raises huge questions about this was an experiment gone wrong.

251
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:41.980
You know,

252
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:45.310
that he was part of one of these experiments at Lackland air force base,

253
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:48.370
where he was signed up, uh, during the trial,

254
00:14:48.371 --> 00:14:51.410
it came out that he had had treatment for severe migraines,

255
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:56.000
experimental treatment at Lackland. Um, that's another, you know,

256
00:14:56.001 --> 00:14:58.570
a smaller sub chapter in the book, but.

257
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:02.170
<v 1>Does it describe what kind of experimental treatment he received? No.</v>

258
00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:06.630
<v 0>No, because nobody, I mean, I have all the testimony.</v>

259
00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.780
There was actually a re a trial or retrial and sentencing,

260
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.490
and every time it came up, it was really frustrating because he never testified.

261
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.480
So they w it was either his wife or his mother who would talk about it.

262
00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:21.250
It was mostly his mother saying, well,

263
00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:25.480
all I knew was they wanted him to be involved in this two year study, uh,

264
00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:29.290
to try to relieve his, his migraines. He would have such horrible migraines.

265
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:33.070
He would put his head in buckets of ice water. Um,

266
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.820
the people who described and countering him that night when he was arrested and

267
00:15:36.821 --> 00:15:40.690
immediately taken out of the Sheriff's custody by the military police and

268
00:15:40.691 --> 00:15:45.460
brought to Lachlan, and then back to the sheriffs, um, he was in a trance.

269
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:50.380
Uh, the, the doctors tested him for alcohol because they thought, well,

270
00:15:50.381 --> 00:15:54.160
maybe he's drunk. He had no, uh, just a little bit of alcohol in his system,

271
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:58.720
but he wasn't drunk. And, um, after the fact,

272
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.340
they found out that he had w I mean,

273
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:05.710
I don't want to get into this cause it's really getting into the weeds,

274
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.320
but he had hallucinated, uh,

275
00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:12.850
that this little girl was a cousin who sexually abused him as a child.

276
00:16:12.851 --> 00:16:15.370
And he was trying to kill her. Her name was Beth rainbow.

277
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.370
All this stuff came out of the trial. Um,

278
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:23.320
jolly west in 1955 sent, uh,

279
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.890
a report to Sydney Gottlieb, which nobody had seen.

280
00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:31.570
And it was another document I found in his files announcing that he had learned

281
00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:32.710
how to,

282
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.300
or develop the technology to remove true memories

283
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.890
and replace them with false memories and a human subject without their

284
00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:45.940
knowledge, which was one of the main goals,

285
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.720
the biggest goals of the MK ultra program. And again, when the CIA,

286
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.150
when they had the hearings in the seventies,

287
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:56.620
the CIA said nothing was successful. Everything we try was a failure,

288
00:16:56.621 --> 00:17:00.580
it was a waste of money. We shouldn't have done it, uh,

289
00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:03.310
and not, not just be,

290
00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:06.910
but most experts think that that was a cover that they didn't want to admit that

291
00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:09.370
they had developed these technologies that were effective.

292
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:13.330
They also claim that they had released everything they had.

293
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.160
I found the same report where west said that he had learned how to replace true

294
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:21.730
memories with false ones without a person's awareness. Uh,

295
00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.780
but they had removed that from the report and then release it to Congress.

296
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:31.030
So that's a crime right there, you know? Um, so there's a lot of that stuff, uh,

297
00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:31.960
in the book.

298
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.190
<v 1>So the speculation is that this guy through these experimental treatments,</v>

299
00:17:36.191 --> 00:17:41.110
that they had dosed him up with LSD and experimented using these

300
00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:45.640
MK ultra techniques and did that to him and induce some

301
00:17:45.641 --> 00:17:46.660
sort of.

302
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.330
<v 0>Well, this is speculation. I'll there for this. Uh,</v>

303
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.560
the guy had no history of violence, uh, never been arrested,

304
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.280
a stellar upstanding citizen.

305
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.950
His only problem was he had these horrible headaches.

306
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:07.500
All of a sudden he shows up by a small girl's body who had been brutally

307
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:12.060
murdered with no memory of doing it a year earlier,

308
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:12.781
Dr. West,

309
00:18:12.781 --> 00:18:17.490
who became a psychiatrist within a week or two possibly had

310
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.570
experiences with them before, but there was no record. Uh,

311
00:18:21.571 --> 00:18:25.350
when I tried to get the record from the medical center at, um,

312
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.160
Lachlan, his file that his name was shaver.

313
00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:34.140
I think it was S a to S I was

314
00:18:34.141 --> 00:18:38.850
missing. So were shaver would have been in the medical records. It was gone.

315
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.290
So I couldn't find out whether he had actually participated in any kind of

316
00:18:43.291 --> 00:18:44.820
experimental program there.

317
00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.270
<v 1>So is the speculation. And again,</v>

318
00:18:47.271 --> 00:18:49.940
this is speculation that he did commit the crime,

319
00:18:49.941 --> 00:18:52.580
that he was somehow or another induced into committing this crime.

320
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:57.020
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. And again, this is speculation. It's completely circumstantial.</v>

321
00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.050
The objective was to get people who would go out and do things,

322
00:19:00.051 --> 00:19:03.020
not even necessarily kill that. That was the ultimate goal,

323
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.680
but to do things against their will against their moral code. Right. But.

324
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.020
<v 1>How would they know that this child would be there?</v>

325
00:19:09.021 --> 00:19:11.000
How would they know if she wasn't targeted?

326
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.900
So was it just that they'd put it into his head to go do.

327
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.720
<v 0>Something, anyone something clicked and went wrong.</v>

328
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.860
So it wasn't a precise thing. No, no, no. Um,

329
00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.960
nobody really knew what else.

330
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.540
This was the very early days of experimenting with LSD in the,

331
00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:32.160
in the early 1950s, west was one of the premier researchers in last,

332
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.290
but he was still new to it. Um, he had actually come out of,

333
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.300
he had first gained national attention for being one of four or five doctors who

334
00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:43.850
treated Korean prisoners of war,

335
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.800
who were returned to the United States after they had made confessions of

336
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:53.690
spraying the Korean countryside with illegal biological weapons, um,

337
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:57.560
the United States, so that we don't use that that's against the Geneva codes.

338
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.990
Um, and these guys were brainwashed by the, the north Korean,

339
00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:05.120
Chinese Soviets. Uh,

340
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:09.680
so when they were brought back after the war west and four other psychiatrists

341
00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:14.480
were assigned to deprogram them, what a lot of researchers believe,

342
00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.390
um, is that they actually

343
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.920
brainwash them into thinking they had been brainwashed by the Koreans where they

344
00:20:21.921 --> 00:20:25.670
actually were telling the truth because there's a lot of evidence has come out

345
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.630
recently. It's five, six years ago that we did use these weapons in Korea.

346
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.240
Oh boy. Double cross. Yeah.
