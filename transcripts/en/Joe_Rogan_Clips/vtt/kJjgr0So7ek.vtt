00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It just changes. And I also know that I don't really</v>

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.160
know that much and it's different every time anyway, but some,

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.360
I really like when you have a loose concept of what you're doing,

4
00:00:14.361 --> 00:00:17.840
there's certain parts that aren't gonna change much. And the rest you discover.

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.910
So the first iron man, I mean, John and I and the,

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.590
and the writers or John and I, we, we were just would write you write a line,

7
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:27.270
I'll write a line. And then we would,

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.430
we were literally watching the puppies be born as we did it,

9
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.150
frustrating for people who not Gwyneth,

10
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:37.190
cuz she can look at a piece of paper and then go, okay, I get it.

11
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.460
And she's got it all memorized. She's amazing, but okay.

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.140
What's for the highest good.

13
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.180
Sometimes it's very self-indulgent to come in and like, you know,

14
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.540
hand out new pages or say, oh, I'm not saying that. So feed me that,

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.420
you know what I mean? You need an environment of respect, but I, I like,

16
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.900
I like discovering things.

17
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.420
<v 1>How much of acting is managing the,</v>

18
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.170
those weird relationships that you have with these other people that you're

19
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.210
acting with? Like you,

20
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.050
you've made some references to like people changing other people's lines and not

21
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.730
being prepared. I got outta acting for that. Very re uh, this,

22
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.330
that was the thing that I, I went from a world of standup comedy,

23
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.610
which are just a bunch of crazy people to actors,

24
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.520
which are a bunch of crazy people, but in a different way. Yep.

25
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.280
And the managing all the different characters and all the different

26
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.680
personalities. How hard is that?

27
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.680
That seems like that could really get in the way.

28
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.760
<v 0>Well, yeah, sure can. And it's like a thumbprint, every time you're on a,</v>

29
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.840
a new project, it's a completely different, you know,

30
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.030
finger a print. You, you never know what you're gonna get.

31
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.910
And sometimes projects seem blessed and sometimes you could say they're

32
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:53.550
cursed. But again, my, uh, Susan Downey,

33
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.790
Esquire was talking about this yesterday. She goes,

34
00:01:55.791 --> 00:02:00.550
it's the only thing you can't overcome as a creative producer on a big movie or

35
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.660
anything is in, in principle, no matter what happens, you can fix it. Uh,

36
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:09.140
we lost the light. Oh the thunder. The weather came in. Okay. He got sick.

37
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.540
Oh she's oh, she's pregnant. Okay, great. Uh, change the costume.

38
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.660
You can't overcome personalities.

39
00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.260
<v 1>Yeah. The relationships that people have with each other,</v>

40
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.500
do you meet up before you commit to a role? Do you ever say like, I,

41
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.490
I wanna meet captain America and find out what the that guyss really like?

42
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.530
&lt;laugh&gt; like, by the way.

43
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.330
<v 0>Um, &lt;laugh&gt; I mean, I, I love that you think I had to have the authority.</v>

44
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.050
Did you cast this guy or wait, let me get a taste of him. Tell you.

45
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.330
<v 1>Stick around. No, I just say saying' really,</v>

46
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.330
I'm really interested in doing that,

47
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:42.210
but can we all have a group dinner or something like that? Yeah.

48
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.850
Can I meet these guys? Find out someone.

49
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.760
<v 0>Mo is always let's mind meld. Let's get together. Let's work weekends.</v>

50
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:53.320
Let's spend time together cuz you can't replace that

51
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.080
familiarity, but so you have to try to build it.

52
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.240
And sometimes it happens very naturally.

53
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.520
Like I adore Chris Evans. I can't even tell you why he's a,

54
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.040
he is a Boston guy. He's technically an such a brilliant actor,

55
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.040
but he also doesn't take himself seriously. He's flaky.

56
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:14.360
But he's the first guy you would want to have your back if something went down

57
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.680
he's and, and,

58
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.870
and yet we're different enough where I feel you like by being who we are and

59
00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:25.590
then both having those characters, we were able to, I think, uh, I thought,

60
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.110
I thought civil war was a special moment in the,

61
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.910
in the arc of the Marvel films about turning one against the other and what it

62
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:36.310
meant. And uh, and uh,

63
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.660
so sometimes you just get lucky as a matter of a whole Marvel universe,

64
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.380
possibly without exception just happens to be a really well,

65
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.860
uh, uh, what do you call that when you, uh, uh,

66
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:54.460
when you put together something curated group of souls? Mm.

67
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.290
<v 1>Well, it's interesting because people take superhero movies seriously.</v>

68
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.080
Now,

69
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.570
like now superhero movies are films that happen to be about superheroes.

70
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.130
Whereas, you know, for the longest time superhero movies were.

71
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.610
You know, the TV shows were kind of clunky. There were, there were campy,

72
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.770
you know, it was Batman with the silly pants on and Robin and

73
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.680
everything was bang. Boom, bang. Remember,

74
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:24.160
you'd see the big boom in front of the, the.

75
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.840
<v 0>Screen. Absolutely. And yet who was in the first Superman? Brandon?</v>

76
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.160
<v 1>Yes. Right. So there was always.</v>

77
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.280
<v 0>A seed of an attempt to legitimize something that</v>

78
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:38.560
was otherwise two dimensional. Yeah. Superman.

79
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.470
<v 1>Was probably the first film that really did that. Right. And then Batman. Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:46.030
And then the Batman series, but again, how many Batmans have there been?

81
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.550
<v 0>Right. I'm I, I wanna see what Pattenson does.</v>

82
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.990
<v 1>Oh, that's right. He's gonna be Batman now. I like that guy.</v>

83
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.510
We've how many Spidermans have there been that that's the most right?

84
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.473
<v 0>Three.</v>

85
00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.260
<v 1>Only three. Yeah. And th three hulks, right?</v>

86
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.500
At least 1, 2, 3, not counting the TV show. Yeah.

87
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.780
<v 0>Counting the TV show four counting.</v>

88
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.500
<v 1>The TV show. Oh, you're right. Eric bannana you're right? Yeah. Norton. Yep.</v>

89
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.700
Mark, mark. Ruffo R who I think is he's my favorite. Ah.

90
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.970
<v 0>He was just born for it. Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.730
<v 1>It's perfect. You believe.</v>

92
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.770
<v 0>Him? Yeah. And again, his whole thing was what's. My action is like,</v>

93
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.130
you know what? I, I got an anger problem.

94
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.770
<v 1>How do you guys manage this giant CGI thing?</v>

95
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.010
Like how does that work? Like when you're on the set,

96
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.850
like that seems like one of the weirdest parts about acting in some of those

97
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.720
Avenger films. Yeah. Is how much of it actually digital.

98
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.960
<v 0>Yeah. You just kind of get used to it. Um, uh,</v>

99
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.120
all digress. I did a movie with, uh, Richard linklatter called, uh,

100
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.080
a scanner darkly and it was, rotoscoped so great movie. I love that movie.

101
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.960
Love him. And, um, and Keano and I, and Woody and Winona,

102
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.200
and it was this cool thing. And we would shoot these scenes and he would say,

103
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.880
oh, you can just leave your, uh, your body mic on the outside. Cuz we're,

104
00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:10.714
justpainting the whole thing.

105
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.240
So that rodoscoping is a great metaphor for essentially what

106
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.270
Marvel movies became when sometimes you would even go in,

107
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.670
I'm supposed to come in and like, you know,

108
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.990
throw something and it was off camera. Uh, but everything else was great. Oh,

109
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:28.630
we'll just move your arm later and you go, wow.

110
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.230
So you never want to rest on your laurels and say, you know,

111
00:06:32.231 --> 00:06:35.710
but after a certain while I was like, why am I wearing this,

112
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.580
this, uh, this football suit?

113
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:43.660
Just put some dots on my shoulders so I can move more freely. And they be like,

114
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.900
all right, I go to, honestly, what are you really using this,

115
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.140
all this stuff I'm wearing for, they go for reference. I go, great.

116
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:53.460
So I'll wear it for one take and then I'll take it off and then I'll relax a

117
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:56.220
little bit. But then other people would be like, or I bet you'd be like,

118
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.650
I'm stuck in this thing, Dominic, you know, it was paid purple.

119
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.570
So everybody got to join in on the joys and the misies

120
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.170
of the, uh, of the, the technical challenge of doing it.

121
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.170
And speaking of Ruffo by the end, because he's smart Hulk.

122
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.850
He literally, they were just making him big wherever he was. And they'd put a,

123
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.400
a little, you know, a, uh,

124
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.240
a piece of PVC with a big Hulk head up about five feet over where his head was.

125
00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:25.640
And he was just there in a green suit.

126
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.480
So in a tracking suit with like his package out, you know, and he'd be like,

127
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:34.400
let me just at least tie like a little Sorong around was, come on guys,

128
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.480
you know, whatever, you know.

129
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.510
And so I think mark went about out as far out into the Ioni

130
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.630
sphere of, uh, of CG as you can.

131
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.830
<v 1>How I didn't get the whole smart hu smart Hulk thing. I didn't get how they,</v>

132
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.430
how he figured that out. It wasn't really, yeah.

133
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.750
Like Hulk is supposed to be Hulk, right? It's supposed to be the altar.

134
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.580
It's like one you control. One is one is the, the genius scientist. Exactly.

135
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.473
And one is the beast.

136
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.220
<v 0>But after so many times, and again, this is the genius of the people who, who,</v>

137
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.780
who break and shape stories over there. Figging his team as they go, oh,

138
00:08:12.781 --> 00:08:15.460
he's Hulk. And then he's not Hulk. He's Hulk. It's a big battle. Oh,

139
00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:19.500
he's so conflicted. What if he could meet himself in the middle? I,

140
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:24.330
and then what corner have we painted ourselves in by having him meet

141
00:08:24.331 --> 00:08:27.450
himself in the middle? Cuz then you can't ever, if that doesn't work,

142
00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:29.090
you can't go back to the way it was. You've done it.

143
00:08:29.091 --> 00:08:32.890
Or you can go back to the way it was. So I just think that the,

144
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.490
the real genius of the Marvel creative team is they and the Russo brothers who

145
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:41.600
did the last few aveng infinnity Warren end game, is they go,

146
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.640
we love riding ourselves into a corner.

147
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.920
We love it because then it, it activates all of those.

148
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.120
How do we get out of purgatory juices? And then you get the next right idea.

149
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.720
<v 1>Now when you guys sit down and when you first receive a script for one of these</v>

150
00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:03.320
things, uh, do they consult with you? Do they discuss this with you?

151
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:07.080
Do they just lay it out and say, this is, this is the character act. How do you,

152
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.760
how do you feel about this? What do you think?

153
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.120
<v 0>Yeah. And, and by it's changed over time. Um,</v>

154
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.630
I think if you're one of the folks who has their are standalone movies,

155
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:19.390
like Scarlett has black widow coming out, I think you take a, I,

156
00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:22.830
would you take a, a bit of a different, uh,

157
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.510
tack in how much meaningful? I think the phrase,

158
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.510
the legal phrase for actors and studios is meaningful consultation. Uh-huh uh,

159
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:36.460
not script approval because then anybody could to hold a studio hostage,

160
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.300
cuz I don't approve this 30 million that you're trying to spend right now.

161
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.900
So your schedule's fine. When.

162
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.700
<v 1>You say I don't approve,</v>

163
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.500
I picture a bathrobe and I picture fine China and TEAC cups.

164
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.580
That's what I picture. I don't approve. And then just storming off.

165
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.050
<v 0>I've had my moments too, cuz I'm so passionate about story. Um,</v>

166
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.500
but again,

167
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.690
after more seat time with the same people and new people coming in and,

168
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.930
and getting a, a pretty brutal education on what kind of, uh,

169
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.090
process these movies require, you, you,

170
00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:15.530
you just start trusting more that they're thinking on your behalf.

171
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:19.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and also little things are easy to change.

172
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.360
Big things become a inconvenience to the higher. Good.

173
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.680
And at what point do you want to pull the Airbreak on

174
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:32.920
something where the trains, you know, already leaving the station?

175
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.550
<v 1>Well, I would imagine it would be a fine line that they, they want the,</v>

176
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.430
the actor to be comfortable with the character and they want some,

177
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:46.350
and maybe some feedback would be beneficial, but they're also, they have a path,

178
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.350
a vision that they've created. Yeah.

179
00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:52.950
And they would like to see you somehow or another at least morph slightly to

180
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.003
get on this path.

181
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:59.420
<v 0>Yeah. And by the way, after I had my, I second round of kids with Susan, I,</v>

182
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.220
I became both artistically.

183
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.140
I had a bit of a Renaissance when I was doing the third iron man.

184
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.980
And then after that too, I was like, well, now I'm gonna do this Avengers.

185
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:14.340
And there's so many moving parts and it's so difficult just to get all these

186
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.500
schedules to coincide and get everyone together that I'm not gonna be like, oh,

187
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.450
I'm not feeling it &lt;laugh&gt;. So again, it's that thing.

188
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.290
It's a it's sometimes whether they say, uh,

189
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.650
faster or alone further together,

190
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.250
sometimes you can only think about further because you gotta get downfield.

191
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.490
Other times you're thinking, Hey, this is my moment to run and I need,

192
00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.840
I need a little help and a little approval and I need a little leeway,

193
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:41.400
but that's any creative endeavor.

194
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.160
<v 1>I would imagine when you're involved in something that's so epic when it's</v>

195
00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.940
actually over.

196
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.960
It probably almost seems surreal cuz the production is so massive.

197
00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.160
There's so many moving pieces. There's so many special effects.

198
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.840
So many things that you, you have to sort of visualize while you're doing it.

199
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.400
And then after it's all over, you're done. And what is a,

200
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.440
like what, what is a big Avengers movie?

201
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.280
How many months are you involved in this?

202
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.183
<v 0>Well, I mean,</v>

203
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.440
it could be some part of 18 months to two year,

204
00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.630
depending on how far out you are and then four to six months of principle

205
00:12:16.631 --> 00:12:19.390
photography and then additional photography and then post.

206
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.790
And then I always include promotion, you know, from, uh, um,

207
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.190
yeah, from soup to nuts I think is the phrase soup to nuts.

208
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.510
Yeah. I, how does that work? That's a dual silver phrase. One of my, uh,

209
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.260
oh one of my great, great, uh,

210
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:38.940
friends and probably one of the greatest, uh,

211
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.300
big movie producers of all time. We did, um, the Sherlocks with the, him,

212
00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:47.500
he did the matrix series. My misses was running his company for 10 years. Kiss,

213
00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:50.340
kiss, bang, bang, which is, I think in some ways the,

214
00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:55.170
the best film I've ever done wound up being a calling card. Uh,

215
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:59.410
it came out and it, it bombed and, but John Faro saw it and he said,

216
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:00.610
this guy could do an action movie.

217
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.170
And so that wound up being my calling card into the Marvel universe.

218
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.160
<v 2>Okay.</v>
