WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.750
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.840
<v 1>Is back to the subject of a capitalism, capitalism,</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.560
and Marxism and socialism this, uh,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.330
right now we're in a wave of this, right. It's become more popular now. Uh,

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.840
I would say over the last, particularly during the Trump administrations,

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.510
the concept of socialism, at least it's become more,

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.620
more publicly discussed then, uh, anytime that I can remember in my life,

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.150
why do you think that is?

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.630
<v 0>I think it's because the generation that's coming up is, I mean,</v>

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.300
you have to understand the academic community is,

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.410
is I always say the intellectuals have always been the enemy of

12
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.360
business, uh, enemy of certainly the enemy of capitalism.

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.140
And, but why is that? I think because in a,

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.490
in a market society, uh, which has been rare in history,

15
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:54.170
we haven't mostly had market societies,

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.010
but they're not very important in a market society. Uh,

17
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.820
the intellectuals aren't very important, generally, not as important to know.

18
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.490
<v 1>Are they the ones that inspire the minds of the people that create in and</v>

19
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.820
maybe innovate in the end.

20
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.260
<v 0>They don't have the same social status that the entrepreneurs have, uh,</v>

21
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.930
an Elon Musk or Steve jobs or Jeff Bezos.

22
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.750
I think it's an.

23
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.000
<v 1>Ego issue. The social status.</v>

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.240
<v 0>Issue. Think about it this way. If you're you're, you're going to school. Okay.</v>

25
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.420
And the people that end up teaching the universities were always the smartest

26
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:30.410
kids in the school generally. And they, and they did well in school. I mean,

27
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:34.830
smart in terms of doing well in school and they go on to college and then they,

28
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.960
they, they go and get a PhD and then they, they,

29
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.310
that's all they've known as school. That's, that's been their universe, right.

30
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.960
And they excelled at it and they were smarter than the other kids in school.

31
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.970
And now these other kids, they,

32
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.720
they go to college and they get a degree in business and they're in a fraternity

33
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.620
and they make a lot of friends and relationships and I think,

34
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.960
and they make more money than the intellectuals do.

35
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.330
And that seems like that's completely unfair.

36
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:04.280
It's an unjust world that this less smart people are making more money than

37
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:08.360
the smart people do. And they have more status in the society. And I think,

38
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.620
I think that's under,

39
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:14.420
under underlying it is a resentment or an envy of a society that

40
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:17.450
doesn't judge them to be as important as they judge themselves.

41
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.080
<v 1>That's interesting, but I think it's a very flawed perspective.</v>

42
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.130
And first of all, the term smart is a weird term.

43
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.780
<v 0>I said, smart. In terms of school,</v>

44
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.800
I didn't say in terms of street smart or ability to do things,

45
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.190
to connect with people, uh, there's emotional intelligence.

46
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.420
I'm merely saying they're good at taking tests, writing papers, uh,

47
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.550
abstracting thoughts, essentially.

48
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.470
<v 1>Yeah, but this is what I'm saying. That just the term smart,</v>

49
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:48.440
it's almost like the promise. That's like a blanket term, right?

50
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:49.850
It's like drugs, you know,

51
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.270
like applies to a bunch of different things that don't necessarily seem to be

52
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.104
related.

53
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.880
But the people that are interested in that pursue

54
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.450
the fact that they can't understand that there's an intact like Elon

55
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:07.150
Musk is a great example. If you don't think Elon Musk is intelligent,

56
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.730
you're either did not. You're in, you're not very.

57
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.890
<v 0>Intelligent yourself. You don't think Elon Musk is intelligent.</v>

58
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.790
<v 1>You're delusional or you're a liar or you're in denial, right.</v>

59
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.240
It's one of those things, there's something wrong with the way you think. Well,

60
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.650
he's clearly intelligent,

61
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.090
but there's people that call him a fool and that like the guys running like four

62
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.640
different businesses simultaneously, they're all successful.

63
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.580
And he's innovating with, when it comes to space,

64
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:34.060
travel in a way that you would assume that someone has to dedicate most of their

65
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.150
life, just singularly to that task,

66
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.260
to be able to figure out past NASA how to shoot a rocket up into space and have

67
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.930
it land. Right. And then reuse it. No,

68
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:48.640
one's been able to do that besides him or up until he did it. And I think, uh,

69
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.680
Jeff Bezos's company is doing the same thing. Yeah.

70
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.800
<v 0>Um, blue origin. Yeah. They're,</v>

71
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.100
they're obviously two of the great entrepreneurs of this particular area.

72
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.100
<v 1>But I don't think Jeff Bezos is actually engineering these things.</v>

73
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.450
<v 0>But if you think about it, the intellectuals have always disliked business.</v>

74
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.170
They've always discriminated against the merchant classes. The Jews in the West,

75
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.250
Chinese in the East,

76
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.200
there's really been no historical period where intellectuals praised business,

77
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:17.580
maybe a little bit around the time of Adam Smith up until probably

78
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.490
Ricardo and Malthus wrote in the early 19th century.

79
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.990
That is for the most part business, people have been seen. They're disruptive.

80
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.550
They change things. They upset the status quo there. They innovate. Well,

81
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.590
a lot of people don't like innovations, it's threatening.

82
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:34.410
It changes a change of social status.

83
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:37.890
It changes wealth relationships, uh,

84
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.110
that it's almost like, uh,

85
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:42.660
capitalism is like a genie that got out of the bottle.

86
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.260
And they're trying very hard to stuff the genie back in the bottle as much as

87
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:50.400
they can. And I think if you think about it that way, you'll understand.

88
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:53.160
We're never going to win the intellectuals over. I mean,

89
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.080
I speak in universities all the time and the students I'm an entrepreneur.

90
00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:02.460
I self-identify that way. Students love. When I talk about conscious capitalism,

91
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.760
I say, you can do good and you can do well. There's no contradiction here.

92
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:08.340
You're not, you're the good guys here. You're not the bad guys,

93
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.090
people about this. I do. I did not. I've debated a number of socialists. And.

94
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.980
<v 1>What, what is their primary argument?</v>

95
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.120
<v 0>Their primary argument is, is that business is greedy and selfish.</v>

96
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.530
And it's about motivations. That, that, that,

97
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.770
that business people have the wrong motivations.

98
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.710
And a lot of ways conscious capitalism is an answer to that.

99
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.730
It's a complete answer to that because in the book and in conscious leadership

100
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:32.940
as well, we're basically arguing that business.

101
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.240
Isn't primarily about maximizing profits.

102
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.710
Business is primarily about creating value for other people and through creating

103
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:43.380
value for other people, you do make a profit,

104
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.020
but it's the value creation that comes first.

105
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.950
The profits come second in exchange, right? And it's almost,

106
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.600
if you are creating value,

107
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.200
then you are profitable and then you can reinvest those profits and you,

108
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.460
and you have this upwards spiral. Um,

109
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.630
so that's that business has this potential for higher purpose.

110
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:06.710
It's not primarily about greed. Greed is found in human nature. Joe,

111
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:09.440
it's not just found in business people. There are plenty of greedy,

112
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:13.580
governmental officials, plenty of greedy politicians, greedy lawyers,

113
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.290
greed is endemic to the human nature business. People either have no more,

114
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.360
no less than it. It's just part of who we are.

115
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.590
<v 1>Has anyone ever laid it out in a way that's very compelling?</v>

116
00:06:23.591 --> 00:06:26.170
Like when you have these debates with socialists and someone,

117
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.700
has anyone ever laid it out in a way where they have a point where you see their

118
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.683
points.

119
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:33.663
<v 0>You always,</v>

120
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.600
the best way to do a debate is completely understand the other side's position

121
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.690
and understand it as good or better than they understand it.

122
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.560
And so I've read widely in socialistic literature.

123
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:49.330
I think I do understand it. It's, it's, it's a type of utopianism. It's, uh,

124
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.750
it's an attempt to change human nature. If we would all be,

125
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.920
if we would all love each other. And if we'd all share equally, uh,

126
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.460
then the world would be a better place. And Hey, guess what?

127
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.370
It probably would be if, if we were naturally that way,

128
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:04.780
but we're not naturally that way. We,

129
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.310
we look first generally for ourselves and our own families. And then our,

130
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.110
and our growing circle of relationships that we develop. We want, we don't,

131
00:07:14.111 --> 00:07:18.760
it's not natural to, it's natural to want your own children to have advantages.

132
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:22.530
That's, that's just human nature to want your children to flourish because you,

133
00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:26.080
you raise them. You love them. And somehow, or another to say,

134
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:28.720
that's unfair is cutting against human nature.

135
00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:31.690
People are always going to look for, for advantages or privileges,

136
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:32.830
so to speak for their children.

137
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.870
<v 1>People don't like when people have advantages and have, and have victories,</v>

138
00:07:37.871 --> 00:07:40.690
because then someone has to lose. And when someone loses,

139
00:07:40.691 --> 00:07:45.490
they equate that someone losing with a bad feeling with that person being

140
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:46.870
victimized, like there's some.

141
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.140
<v 0>Sorry, here's the big idea we talk about in conscious leadership,</v>

142
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.980
we have a chapter called find win, win, win solutions.

143
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.380
The metaphors that we use to think about society tend to be very

144
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:00.310
binary,

145
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.680
good versus evil light versus darkness win versus

146
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:09.280
lose. And so they tend to think of business as a win lose game.

147
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.490
Somebody wins and somebody else's losing,

148
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.530
but the beauty of capitalism is it's a win-win win game. It's an infinite game.

149
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.700
It's a game because the customers are winning or they wouldn't trade.

150
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:24.160
The employees are winning how the customer is winning.

151
00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:26.260
They're getting products and services at a, at a,

152
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.910
an and there's competition to make those services and products better.

153
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.820
Uh, the employees are winning because they have jobs and opportunities to grow.

154
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.630
Benefits are paid and they do that voluntarily,

155
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.830
not forced to work for any particular company.

156
00:08:41.831 --> 00:08:43.780
They do it because they think it's in their best interest.

157
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.290
When for the employees, the suppliers who are trading with the business,

158
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.930
they're winning as well, or they wouldn't make the exchanges.

159
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.810
Investors are winning or they wouldn't make the investments.

160
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.200
And the larger society is winning because business is the engine that creates

161
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.500
all the money that goes into nonprofits and governments without business,

162
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.570
there is no government and there is no,

163
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.670
and there is no nonprofit sector because those are ultimately supplied through

164
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.050
what business creates. So businesses, a win, win, win game.

165
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.130
All of these tech holders are winning and that's why capitalism lifts society up

166
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.390
socialism is an attempt to reverse that back to a win lose game.

167
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.110
And that's why it always fails. And that's why capital.

168
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.850
<v 1>That was an attempt to bring it back to win, lose game. In what way?</v>

169
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:32.750
<v 0>It, it, it, th the ones that are winning, so to speak the business,</v>

170
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:35.720
people are clamped down. So they're not allowed to win. It's like,

171
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.470
we're going to take your success and we're going to redistribute it. So that is,

172
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.870
again, you said earlier on incentives matter,

173
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.770
but we're going to take away the incentives for business to really flourish and

174
00:09:45.771 --> 00:09:49.700
succeed. They should do it from altruistic reasons.

175
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.040
And we may do some things for altruistic reasons,

176
00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:53.930
but you cannot build a society around it.

177
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.260
<v 1>When you're talking about win-win win. This is a very,</v>

178
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.380
in many ways it's I see what you're saying,

179
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.480
but there are things that are negative that are associated with

180
00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:10.010
profit and innovation and particularly expanding industry, right?

181
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:14.180
Particularly environmental impacts. Like when you talk,

182
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.700
when you say win-win win, like there's,

183
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.730
there's very rarely when you're,

184
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:24.320
especially when you're dealing with creating and designing and building

185
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.460
things, you've got a negative impact in some way,

186
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.600
environmentally too.

187
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.640
<v 0>Two points. Um, first of all, historically, socialism has been far worse,</v>

188
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.180
worst polluter than in capitalist countries. Well,

189
00:10:38.181 --> 00:10:41.210
if you just look at the environmental destruction that the Soviet union left

190
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.350
behind it, it was a contender.

191
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.370
<v 1>Wait disaster. Right. But that's this, this is socialism done wrong, John,</v>

192
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:47.810
we're going to do it right here. Has.

193
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.910
<v 0>Done it. Right, Joe. No, one's done it.</v>

194
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.860
<v 1>Right. But the Soviet union is a bad example.</v>

195
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.391
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:58.220
But all of Eastern Europe where there there's no incentive to protect the common

197
00:10:58.221 --> 00:11:01.790
good in socialism. And they don't.

198
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.420
When the government has a monopoly of all decision and power making,

199
00:11:05.421 --> 00:11:08.150
they don't tend to look out for the environment. That's one of the myths.

200
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.550
<v 1>Can wait agency from people and you,</v>

201
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.850
you take away their desire to improve and do better.

202
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.630
And without incentive, people just don't perform the same way.

203
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.090
<v 0>But the beautiful thing about business,</v>

204
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.100
let's concede a partial truth to what you said, that there will be

205
00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.950
unintended negative consequences, as you say, environmentally. Well,

206
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.410
that's why you have to regulate business to a certain extent.

207
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:36.980
That's why you have to make people responsible for their environmental

208
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:41.450
pollutants and because Bennett business innovates and has an incentive to

209
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:42.890
innovate, um,

210
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.880
business can innovate and create solutions to those environmental problems.

211
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.190
<v 1>Okay. Let me stop you there for a second. When you say,</v>

212
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.230
make people responsible for their environmental pollutants, then we're,

213
00:11:53.231 --> 00:11:56.950
we're going to have to deal with another aspect of capitalism. And that's the,

214
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.050
the fact the special interest groups and lobbyists have on politicians because

215
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:05.920
they create laws that shield these big businesses from consequences,

216
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:07.000
from these negative actions.

217
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.360
So by saying that they have to clean up their problem,

218
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.830
the only way that's ever going to happen is if they're not protected,

219
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.650
if they don't use that influence and money. Totally agree.

220
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.210
So this is where I think a lot of people have a valid argument

221
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.460
against capitalism. Capitalism is kind of over our, our, our,

222
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:30.130
our system of government in a way,

223
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:34.510
because money has gotten so deeply involved with super PACS and

224
00:12:34.511 --> 00:12:35.201
lobbyists.

225
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:40.060
And there's so much money involved that it changes the way

226
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:41.560
we govern things.

227
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.380
<v 0>Is that a flaw of capitalism or is that a flaw of government?</v>

228
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.240
<v 1>I think it's a flaw of government,</v>

229
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.000
but that government has been influenced by capitalism,

230
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:54.460
by capitalism's desire for universal growth, for constant growth.

231
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.900
<v 0>The sad truth is that humanity is not perfectible.</v>

232
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:04.530
We can never create the perfect system and the attempt to create the perfect

233
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:08.310
system. The perfect saying to me, the good capitalism is not perfect.

234
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.170
It does not because human choices and what people want various people

235
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.213
to, uh,

236
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.390
capitalism will sell cigarettes to people because that's what people want.

237
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.570
It gives them pleasure, but it's bad for their health, but they're, they're,

238
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.440
they're giving people what they want. It's the same thing in,

239
00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:28.320
in any type of externality. That's not,

240
00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:33.270
that's not deliberately done to harm the society. It's sort of a by-product.

241
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.860
<v 1>This is why win-win win. Doesn't really work. It's not really, win-win win.</v>

242
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.330
It's win most of the time,

243
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.260
but with some negative consequences that are better than the alternative, right?

244
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.480
<v 0>But what you strive for is to,</v>

245
00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:50.010
is to take those externalities or those negative consequences and try

246
00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:54.900
to through good government to, to minimize them or less than them.

247
00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.360
I'll give you an example. So you used to live in LA. Well,

248
00:13:57.361 --> 00:13:59.640
when I went to LA back in the early eighties,

249
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.820
it was like going to new Delhi today.

250
00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.930
I couldn't see my lungs hurt less than 24 hours,

251
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.580
but through good regulations,

252
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:13.320
the error in LA is a fraction as polluted as it was 40 years

253
00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:15.180
ago, we have been able to clean it up.

254
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.100
That is an example of how you can take the worst impacts of industrialization

255
00:14:20.101 --> 00:14:21.630
and ameliorate. Them are less than.

256
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.600
<v 1>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

257
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.750
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

258
00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:33.180
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

259
00:14:33.181 --> 00:14:36.870
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

260
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.860
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

261
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.690
That's all we're asking. Go download Spotify, Bubba.
