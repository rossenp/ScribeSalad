00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>Hey, Joe Rogan podcast by night, all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.220
<v 1>Jones wrapped the overlook and yanked his shoulder.</v>

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.930
<v 2>It was, yeah. I get so nervous for a guy. How.</v>

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.230
<v 3>Good is John John dismantle club? It was like you all you're good.</v>

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.880
Check this out. Yeah. If I see one more advertisement for Logan,

6
00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.770
I'm about to bust bust.

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.980
They are really coming hard with the Logan ad God,

8
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:28.040
get it out of my face and alcoholic and aggressive.

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.460
<v 2>I like the way this guy. I liked the way customers moving guys.</v>

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.930
Sad side to you right now.

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.880
<v 3>It goes through in wrestling too is very underrated,</v>

12
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.750
but Clover can grapple the best of Blackbelt Abu Dhabi competition.

13
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:42.710
He's a monster. Oh, good. Kick. More knockout,

14
00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:44.930
power Clover cloaks.

15
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.610
<v 2>Great boxer, man. Nice uppercut. Oh boy. Be careful.</v>

16
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.550
Okay. Alright. Alright. Let's calm down. Calm down.

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.600
Glover also is the wrestling. Ah, that's right on. Good.

18
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.893
Cause it'll cook.

19
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.620
Summerstone Gustin loses again at some point he's a little nervous, right?

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.863
He's a little merits.

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.530
<v 3>Lost a Johnson and his hometown was Mia for a year. Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830
<v 2>It's tough when you're the hometown hero, man, while.</v>

23
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.130
<v 1>It's awesome.</v>

24
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.360
So you train so hard for this one big moment and then you lose and you got to

25
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.160
like reassess, like where am I? He was on billboards and. He's still only 30.

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.400
That's another thing to think about with Alexander is 30 years old.

27
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.020
He's in his athletic prime. She's a little.

28
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.080
<v 2>Nervous right now. I feel like how dare you? A little hesitant.</v>

29
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.830
I dare you judge this man. I'm nervous.

30
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.010
<v 1>I'm gonna have him tweet about your writing. Don't you dare to</v>

31
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.660
how funny would that bias and trolling me about.

32
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.240
<v 0>My writing. Oh.</v>

33
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.610
<v 2>Oh, there you go. That's a right. [inaudible] wow. Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.653
He's

35
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.220
[inaudible] because of that rumble fire son.

36
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.100
Tell him what keeps you. I don't like going away from that right hand.

37
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.670
Oh man. Man. Gustafson's good though. Oh,

38
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.600
it's called little checkup there. He's waking him up called call. Wake me up.

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.070
<v 3>All right. Cause she's just avoiding it. That's smart man. Good movement.</v>

40
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.360
That's the Overeem tactic there. Are you going away? Deal for him?

41
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.820
<v 5>Remember we started doing that and it worked.</v>

42
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.530
<v 2>Long legs. Look at this. Look at this long arms. Who's.</v>

43
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.530
<v 1>The one dude that Nate quarry Fox that was literally running away from him.</v>

44
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.770
Caleb stone. Caleb Stein. That's right. And Nate quarry was,

45
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.930
was Cohen after him like this. Yeah. Yeah.

46
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.170
But I think he gets hurt in that fight. No, he covered his eyes. Yeah.

47
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.640
No it wasn't hurting that fight. He wasn't that.

48
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 2>Funny. He had an injury. Yeah. He hurt his foot. He his foot up running.</v>

49
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.520
That was a terrible.

50
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.020
<v 3>Fight. Wasn't good. It ruined Caleb's career. Yeah,</v>

51
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.580
people were so [inaudible].

52
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.090
<v 1>Poked him. He poked him. Jesus.</v>

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.280
<v 3>Well, I guess if he put his hand down first, then he hit him with the uppercut.</v>

54
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.940
God.

55
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.220
<v 2>It. He poked him first and then.</v>

56
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.020
<v 1>To see in the replay went.</v>

57
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.280
<v 3>If this is in New York. Oh, Glover wins the fight. No, no contest.</v>

58
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.670
<v 4>That is the worst part.</v>

59
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.100
<v 1>Of fighting is he's IPOs. Glover's fun. All.</v>

60
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.270
<v 4>Right. Oh yeah. Oh, he's lucky that I missed him. Missed. Yeah.</v>

61
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.300
Yeah. Yeah.

62
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.350
<v 1>Let's see if they can get a bit. Oh man. Look at that right in there.</v>

63
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.720
That's the worst, but that's the other side? Hmm? Is he? Oh,

64
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.070
[inaudible].

65
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.790
<v 5>Do you get poked? And bolt-ons ain't that a pitch?</v>

66
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.590
Or maybe it's like squinting with.

67
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.420
<v 3>His left glove. We're saying I'm good to fight. Get out of the way.</v>

68
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.600
That's what you want. Some of those guys be like, I don't know. It's tough.

69
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.710
Go over there. Get the out of my way.

70
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.490
<v 2>Bye guys. For a street. Most Kung Fu guys are onto something. Oh they,</v>

71
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.830
they were on some Eagle, claw tie guy. Paul tiger and Eagle.

72
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.473
I use both.

73
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.600
<v 1>Brian. Did you see that video? Where the Tai Chi guy fights the MMA guy?</v>

74
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.230
It's whole and it's. I did not. It's uh, it lasted like a few seconds.

75
00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:13.350
You said maybe I told him I may got crushed with them.

76
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.910
And then the MMA guy had to go into hiding because apparently people in China

77
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:21.900
want to kill him because it's like a disgrace to the Chinese martial arts.

78
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.100
So it's not a martial. It's part of that. Right-hand beats. Oh.

79
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.750
<v 2>Beautiful opera. Cut down all day long. You can get out too.</v>

80
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:32.040
It's a nice oper man.

81
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.460
<v 3>Gustafson looking slick, dude. I'm terrified. [inaudible] him and John man.</v>

82
00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:39.900
That's the fight. It.

83
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.790
<v 4>Might be Mike.</v>

84
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.490
<v 1>Well, now that rumbles out of the picture, I mean, Gustafson,</v>

85
00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:47.850
you got to remember did knock out. Jimmy marijuana is a right-hand over the top.

86
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.490
I wonder how they handle that. Now they've been training together, you know,

87
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.860
gastronomic, beat Manama. Yeah. He knocked him out.

88
00:04:52.861 --> 00:04:55.800
But I wonder how they handle that because if man was still in the mix,

89
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.600
if they do eventually have to cross paths again, I.

90
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.050
<v 3>See that again. Well, it's so thin.</v>

91
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.490
<v 1>On there. So they have to, they have to fight again. It's almost like flyweight.</v>

92
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.510
Like who the is there?

93
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.530
<v 2>You, you, you look at this running away. That's deliberate and then stop all.</v>

94
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.380
We clipped him with that upper cut again again with the upper cut.

95
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.930
<v 3>To the left. Get up, get out of there. There you go.</v>

96
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.600
See that's that's the tactic. I'm not mad at this tactic. Cool.

97
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.100
Swinging for the fences too. Oh, backache. We got five rounds of this boy.

98
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.400
I love this fight, man. Dustbin, John too.

99
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.410
<v 2>Are you kidding? I'd love to see gusts and John too. I don't know.</v>

100
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.710
I'm saying dumb that everybody.

101
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.880
<v 1>Listen again. Gustafson 30 years old. He's still young.</v>

102
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.840
A lot of fight.

103
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.690
<v 3>Left. Joe had a lot of fights too though.</v>

104
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.170
<v 1>Yeah. He has had some wars too. Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.050
<v 6>No. Not as far as DC was a ward.</v>

106
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.230
<v 3>John was a war and you got a beating I'm rumble.</v>

107
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.430
Yeah. Other than that, it's kind of fakes the take down.

108
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.750
<v 1>This is an interesting fight.</v>

109
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.090
The way it's playing out Glover is chasing him down. Man.

110
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.970
<v 3>Blew past and hope he can get them pinned. Just got to get inside that room.</v>

111
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.130
There. It is not one of the time that with an overhand,

112
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.940
right?

113
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.773
<v 1>It's gotta try,</v>

114
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.410
but you gotta remember his right hand is the one that's up his shoulder on his

115
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.240
right. It's. It's up.

116
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.470
<v 3>I get up. I love this.</v>

117
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.850
That's the best you want me to help you out this I outta your giant.

118
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.080
Should I secure? How about this golden state Cavs?

119
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.680
You guys are gonna talk basketball. I'll throw up,

120
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.930
throw up on this table. I will watch that basketball walk. You.

121
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.040
<v 1>Guys. It goes in the net and I get so excited to have a good, buddy. It's crazy.</v>

122
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:42.800
When the ball goes in the net, I've never seen anything like it.

123
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.050
Jamie gets mad. It's not what it's about. It's about all the things.

124
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.230
It's put more important things. Both fluidics. It's both boots,

125
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.190
both players in the world, coach, you know which one it for coaching.

126
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.700
<v 2>It is a great sport, but you know no, which they're making a lot on the line.</v>

127
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.110
I met Jamie and.

128
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.220
<v 1>Jamie's sneakers and he makes fun of Underarmour's.</v>

129
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.550
<v 5>Like you weren't on the rumor. Like what's wrong with Underarmour? Like.</v>

130
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.050
<v 1>In the world of like sneaker, sneaker, dorks. Yeah. Welfare is under armor.</v>

131
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:14.510
Like shark. Shop's got 200 pairs of sneakers.

132
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.160
<v 7>And the rank rank and clothes. Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.470
What's it like four or five in the list of hierarchy.

134
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.060
Wouldn't be dog trainer. Ryan. Yeah. Yeah. We'll talk. Yep.

135
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.660
<v 1>Here we go. Round dos.</v>

136
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.490
<v 8>Do, do, do two</v>

137
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.100
double jab at Gustafson.

138
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:45.010
Very interesting fight. How's your dog.

139
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.350
Great. Okay.

140
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.560
<v 2>You got a German shepherd. I got a German shepherd or boy, girl.</v>

141
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.350
Is she cool with your kids? The best?

142
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:56.620
I'll never have another dog besides German shepherd. Really a working line.

143
00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:58.390
Shepherd. There's nothing. I've had dogs my whole life.

144
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.360
They're just different animals. They're so keyed in to you.

145
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:05.500
They listen to you and they're wary of strangers, man. They don't around. Yeah.

146
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.640
Amazing watchdogs talks, but they can dissent. They can not dog aggressive. Uh,

147
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.020
they stay with you at the best. I love him. Mr. Shop's going to get.

148
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.430
<v 1>One. I liked German shepherds too.</v>

149
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:19.190
What I don't like is ones that don't get trained well and they bite kids.

150
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.440
<v 2>No that you don't. That's why you get a dog with about pups talking about dogs.</v>

151
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:26.380
[inaudible].

152
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.550
<v 3>Belgium. [inaudible] train today. I thought it was a Monday. I'll let you know.</v>

153
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.890
<v 1>A lot of people. Don't like Belgium, Alamos. Cause they're,</v>

154
00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:34.090
they're almost a little too.

155
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.660
<v 2>Far, but he's got a, he's got a special, this one I saw the picture. He sent me.</v>

156
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.950
He saw that pick this thing will inhale and intruder. Yeah.

157
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.930
Those one of the don't play. They cut again. Pop, pop. What?

158
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.140
Cut is I what happened? Head button. I don't know. But God, since plan now,

159
00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:51.400
look at us. Look at us. Look at us.

160
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.260
<v 1>Brian was talking about working dogs and.</v>

161
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:58.230
<v 2>I'm obsessed with Brian. Just the shots, like give him that he does</v>

162
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:01.860
[inaudible].

163
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.550
<v 3>And the fighting. Talk about cars and turn up. Yeah, what's happening.</v>

164
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.390
<v 2>I only have so much in my brain brothers. You know what it is, man?</v>

165
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.390
You've never for driven one. Probably. Yeah. That's all I need though.

166
00:09:11.391 --> 00:09:15.290
Right now. Careful with that runaway close.

167
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.610
I'd rather him tie him up and.

168
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.190
<v 1>On and get punched in the face. He's bleeding bad out of that.</v>

169
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.350
<v 3>Picked apart on stage in the middle of the octagon cage. It's yeah.</v>

170
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.430
<v 0>[Inaudible] oh, trouble, big.</v>

171
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.540
<v 3>Trouble. When's the last time we saw that last time I saw a cloud Lockhart,</v>

172
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.650
Tyrone Woodlands. Oh, of course. Oh boy. Wow. What a combination spring elbow

173
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:46.250
kid. I've seen that on dummies now.

174
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.500
<v 1>Gustafson coming alive. Golf.</v>

175
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.250
<v 3>Sustenance, Tony man. The real deal. Chava. Chava.</v>

176
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.010
<v 2>Sang it a long time ago. I'll give that. I'll give him that.</v>

177
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.690
The one thing he's right about with fighting.

178
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:58.670
<v 3>Was Gus. Look at his face.</v>

179
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.420
<v 1>Glover's face. This is a mask. It's a mess right now.</v>

180
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.410
<v 3>But again, glow is that guy. He has so much knockout power. It's like one shot.</v>

181
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.730
Oh great. Body shot.

182
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 1>Yeah. Very good. Cardio would be an issue for him. Maybe.</v>

183
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.000
<v 2>I remember the broken nose. Brendan.</v>

184
00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:16.970
You trained with cuffs and you spar with him were both these guys. Yeah.

185
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.810
I remember you saying that way before. You're like he's the real deal.

186
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:21.950
<v 3>Uh,</v>

187
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:26.180
best I've ever trained with hands down Gustafson by far really the biggest freak

188
00:10:26.181 --> 00:10:31.160
I've ever seen. I can't believe it, man. He was so good at everything. Like,

189
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.550
you know, outside. I knew he was really good. Uh, his size.

190
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.120
I watched him spar with uh, you know, a world champion boxer,

191
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.710
it literally eight rounds and just do work on the dude, straight up boxing,

192
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.350
a world champion who was the wheelchair? I forget the guy's name.

193
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:48.440
You know how many belts are some guy, you know? But he, he,

194
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:51.440
he literally went in there and did work at him and jumped out with three rounds

195
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:54.710
with me. I, it was, I was, I mean, wow. So.

196
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.960
<v 1>Sparring with him, just patched it up.</v>

197
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.780
<v 3>And him up. Got one over two.</v>

198
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.000
<v 2>Sheriffs. Still in this fight guys. He was straight up. It's.</v>

199
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:06.020
<v 3>An extreme is gone. Don't knock them out. Alexander. Do not knock them out. Wow.</v>

200
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.520
Yeah, it was crazy. I wonder.

201
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.700
<v 1>If Alexander ever thought about it? I actually just boxing. I don't know.</v>

202
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.000
Nice front kick to the side of that. Oh Jesus. He telling.

203
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.560
<v 2>You man left over is doing work still. Let's.</v>

204
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.150
<v 3>Fight with that. John Jones fight it to me.</v>

205
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.730
That's a great greatest light heavyweight fight of all time.

206
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:26.930
I was so thrilled with that fight, man. Amazing. Because it was finally,

207
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.280
Jonathan's kinda met his match.

208
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.100
Granted John probably had two hours of sleep and do a bunch of lines of Cokes,

209
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.250
but still at the time it was good. I.

210
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.850
<v 2>Don't like this running away. Cause Glover's going to time this, man. You think?</v>

211
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.520
I think so. I, it worries me. And all you use the fighting.

212
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:43.880
Have you ever seen that happen? Yes. With Mr. Hogan

213
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.340
with Mr. Overhang. I don't teach them.

214
00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:52.700
I don't teach my students to do all the time. So.

215
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.670
<v 1>Let me, you guys this, while we're watching the fight,</v>

216
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.490
what's the best setup to do a fight companion.

217
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.420
Cause I'm building a Fike opinion studio in the next place. I.

218
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.660
<v 2>Feel like we should have punching bags that we can hit out of frustration or</v>

219
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:05.270
anxiety. Well.

220
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.180
<v 1>What I'm thinking is, well,</v>

221
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.050
the way we're sitting here across from each other and watching the fights is not

222
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:14.110
totally ideal. I'm thinking round table. Yeah.

223
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.330
More like a semi-circle like a half moon.

224
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.830
<v 3>Oh that's cool. Yeah. I almost like an analyst desk. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

225
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.000
<v 1>And then the TV there, but this way we're all be like kind of cool.</v>

226
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:26.760
That's what I've been thinking. Good. I do like that idea,

227
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:31.020
but we should have a desk, right? It's good to have a desk for drinks and stuff.

228
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.390
So I'm going to set up a second thing just in front of a big TV and I'm thinking

229
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.640
Nope, big TV. Like even bigger than this project. Good idea. No, no, no, no, no.

230
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:45.690
Like 110 inch LCD back you.

231
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.890
<v 2>This combo beautiful. Could also be we can ask a big couch. I wonder.</v>

232
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.530
Would that make us too tired? That's what I'm thinking. I.

233
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.520
<v 1>Think these chairs are the. Yes. These chairs, these, uh,</v>

234
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.310
these are people keep asking. Alto is not a sponsor.

235
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.720
Ergo Depot sent me these they're from there. They're called Capisce goes in.

236
00:13:03.721 --> 00:13:05.850
There are ergonomic. Tommy buns has these.

237
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:10.770
Now Tom singer has these in his podcast to go to ergo. What depo? Depo chairs.

238
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.500
E R G O T depot.com.

239
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.800
And these chairs are excellent because they're comfortable,

240
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.380
but they're also ergonomics.

241
00:13:18.381 --> 00:13:21.990
So like you sit up straight because you sit up straight after the end of the

242
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:23.850
show, your back doesn't hot at all.

243
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.670
Definitely don't do a couch for the no couches.

244
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:29.070
I think these chairs are it for podcasts.

245
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:33.270
I think I've found the holy grail of podcast chairs are. They're amazing.

246
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.330
The question. So the question was what kind of setup should we have?

247
00:13:36.331 --> 00:13:38.370
Like side tables and I think, no, I think,

248
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.130
I think a table in front of us is the one I sent mood.

249
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.700
Brian's always bringing wine and cheese and and yep. Yeah.

250
00:13:44.701 --> 00:13:47.880
We're always going to want to slide things down to each other and stuff.

251
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.660
<v 3>Then you should have like just a area that it looks like a F like an old school</v>

252
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.500
telephone booth and it's called conspiracy theories. And then Eddie goes.

253
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.210
<v 1>In there. What I'm going to have is a second thing with experts on Skype,</v>

254
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.050
on standby. Waiting. Every time Eddie says something crazy,

255
00:14:04.051 --> 00:14:07.800
I'm going to press a button and boom, Neil deGrasse, Tyson. You're on the line.

256
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.350
<v 2>Do you know what I think we should have?</v>

257
00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:13.110
We should have a grill and somebody should be cooking. Oh

258
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.740
[inaudible] oh my God. Oh my God. Glove is in serious trouble.

259
00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:22.680
Serious trouble. Let him up brain. No.

260
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.160
<v 1>No, no, but Glover's in some serious trouble here, man. If you want me to cover,</v>

261
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.860
she might or he might get grounded out.

262
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.740
<v 4>Or you got a posture up and oh, he's [inaudible] oh God.</v>

263
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.623
Oh my God.

264
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.920
<v 1>I have a Bosch neuter 1500,</v>

265
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:45.850
which is a huge commercial smoker for the studio. [inaudible].

266
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.270
<v 2>It should be a cooking show. We should have somebody cook.</v>

267
00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.850
<v 1>I'm way ahead. Even listen to my podcast or no, I'm doing cooking shows.</v>

268
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.320
Thank you.

269
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.210
<v 2>I'm going to do cook. Oh, the last one I did with Tom Papa.</v>

270
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:58.340
<v 1>We talked about it. We're going to sit down and eat dinner.</v>

271
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.110
I'm going to cook it on the show. Right?

272
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.050
We're going to sit down and eat dinner on the podcast and you're gonna hear a

273
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:08.030
lot of this. Oh, he's going for the arm bar. It will drive you nuts,

274
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:10.310
but you will know that it's going to be happening.

275
00:15:10.311 --> 00:15:11.960
So hopefully it won't drop you. And also.

276
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.630
<v 2>It'll be, it'll be a fight companion. So we'll be eating game.</v>

277
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:19.420
We'll be eating Manmeet, drinking, amazing wine. Come on. Don't be a party.

278
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.290
Well.

279
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.990
<v 1>What I'm thinking is we're not going to do that during five companions,</v>

280
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.570
then there's too much going on. So eating more talking. No,

281
00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:29.620
it's going to be like a show. We sit down and have a meal. You know,

282
00:15:29.621 --> 00:15:33.430
you watch those Anthony Bordain shows. He's talking to some lady in Sardinia.

283
00:15:33.431 --> 00:15:36.160
You don't even know what the hell she's saying. And it's interesting, right?

284
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.400
Like I love a good meal having a good meal.

285
00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:43.090
And I'm going to bring guys like Hank Shaw have him cook for us. Oh, nice trip.

286
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:43.924
I saw.

287
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.730
<v 2>I love Hank Shaw.</v>

288
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.600
<v 1>Who's a world-class game chef and a hunter. Right?</v>

289
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.041
<v 3>What about this?</v>

290
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:54.010
What if we get like some Hooter girls to like refill our con on stuff?

291
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.500
<v 2>Oh, oh. Oh.</v>

292
00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.920
<v 3>Well, Brian's doing all the meat and cooking. You're all about that.</v>

293
00:16:02.921 --> 00:16:05.710
And I want you to couple of smoke shows to fill up our coffees.

294
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.583
All of a sudden I'm.

295
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.980
<v 2>[Inaudible] last time Ian brought his girlfriend over to be quiet,</v>

296
00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.070
paid to shut the.

297
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.570
<v 1>Up. They don't get paid enough. That's not impossible. I mean, it's, I'm,</v>

298
00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:19.630
I'm offended. If you see.

299
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.140
<v 3>Wonder woman, women only women only went to the,</v>

300
00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:25.780
I went to the period screenings with just women. I liked it.

301
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.370
I liked the premiere. Anyways. Let's get back to these Hooter that refill

302
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.250
you guys in or not, man. I want something to do with peer pressure.

303
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:40.150
Peer pressure. I guess I am. No, they just feed us like beef, Turkey, beef.

304
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:43.090
<v 1>Jerky. Feed it to you. That's weird. Something wrong with your hands,</v>

305
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.260
but I'm definitely gonna bring in, um, some chefs and have some food cook, dude.

306
00:16:48.261 --> 00:16:51.220
That's a great idea. Jamie pull up the Yoder 1500.

307
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.150
You could show these mothers that.

308
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.970
<v 3>Is landing all day long.</v>

309
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.910
<v 1>For behind the jabs. So he's like blinded.</v>

310
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.550
<v 3>By the Japanese so long. You can get away with it.</v>

311
00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.800
<v 2>Line blind them and bring them up gossips and looks fantastic.</v>

312
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.100
He beats everybody.

313
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:11.500
<v 1>Do you think he beats Jon Jones? Really?</v>

314
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.370
<v 3>If Jon Jones fought him with this long of a layoff,</v>

315
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.600
like let's say they were going to fight.

316
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.410
And I don't know when you've taught OSP. Yes. He gets up. Oh, look.

317
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.220
<v 2>At this. Look at this. Creative really thinks so that's interesting.</v>

318
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:26.320
<v 4>Oh. I'll.</v>

319
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.180
<v 1>Tell you what he looks outstanding here tonight.</v>

320
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.070
<v 2>Oh, Gloria with the lover is still in this fight in every way. Clover's.</v>

321
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.890
<v 1>A animal. He's fighting for his life. Man is fighting for his crews.</v>

322
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.860
What he's doing, I mean he's 37 years old. He doesn't have much time left.

323
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.233
And these are,

324
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.360
these opportunities are few and far between headlining a major card.

325
00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:46.630
Like he can take a shot and he's go over saying, come.

326
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:50.910
<v 3>On, come on. They're both fighting for calling them in. You lose this one.</v>

327
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.110
Come on.

328
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:55.560
<v 1>To Clover. So aggressive. It's crazy. Even getting tagged, like he's getting,</v>

329
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.460
he's still in this. See that baby right there.

330
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:04.160
<v 2>See, that's a sick, that's a sick grill machine. Of course.</v>

331
00:18:04.161 --> 00:18:07.190
Rogan has to go extreme with the grill. That's a smoker.

332
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.580
<v 1>It grows. It smokes. You can do everything on. Not just.</v>

333
00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:14.900
<v 3>Spit out. Let's toss a zebra in there. Uh,</v>

334
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:15.763
I need a zebra.

335
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.280
<v 2>What are you eating now? What do you have in your freezer? Mostly elk.</v>

336
00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:23.510
<v 3>Gosh, I feel about 400 pounds. What about some ribs? I love ribs. Let's see.</v>

337
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:24.890
That's what I'm talking about. I shot a pig last.

338
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:29.600
<v 1>Month. I still have some thighs. We ate the ribs ready, but I uh,</v>

339
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.110
I have some, yeah, I did. I not need. I didn't need all the ribs. Are you.

340
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.240
<v 2>A barbecue guy? Do you have a you're.</v>

341
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.290
<v 3>Looking at that? Oh man, we should have a grill off because I can grill my off.</v>

342
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.850
I have to have a grill off [inaudible].

343
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.420
<v 0>How.</v>

344
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.040
<v 1>Do you grill? What do you do? Do you a charcoal guy, gas, gas guy.</v>

345
00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.290
That's not even a grill. I want to hear those commercials.

346
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:56.720
<v 3>Filets ribs, fish salmon, especially. That's a oven. Nah.</v>

347
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.230
<v 4>Son, some weird oven. It's the Tesla of grills.</v>

348
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.530
<v 1>Justin Timberlake and Christopher. I need to hear this. It's selling nothing.</v>

349
00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.160
No.

350
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.820
<v 3>They both own a Timberlake. Owns a part of this company. That makes.</v>

351
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.070
<v 2>Sense. Antioxidant infusion not just.</v>

<v 1>Drink actual juice. You what? You juice. You own berries. Watch this.</v>

353
00:19:17.451 --> 00:19:20.640
Look at this combination. Boom.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.950
They fall down there. He went back in the tricks. by Gustafson. Look.

356
00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.730
This is God.

357
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:40.610
<v 1>Sam. Glover's tough. Yes. So he can be.</v>

358
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.890
<v 3>Sharp as a knife. 10 years from now.</v>

359
00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.580
<v 1>TRT. Get them on TRD. Everybody. The whole buddy, the whole.</v>

360
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:48.350
<v 2>Crew. Everybody cooling the garage.</v>

361
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.200
<v 1>We've got a problem with cyborg. Everybody catch up.</v>

362
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.120
<v 2>Here we go. I love sidebar.</v>

363
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.120
After that podcast you did with her Brendan. Thanks man.

364
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.090
You didn't love her before. I loved her anyway, but I didn't know her,

365
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:04.920
but she's a beast. She's awesome.

366
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.350
<v 1>As a fighter. She's a beast, man. There's no.</v>

367
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.440
<v 2>Question about that. It seems like a good person too though.</v>

368
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:12.420
That's what I like about her. Here we go.

369
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.770
<v 3>That uppercut is coming from Stockholm.</v>

370
00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.380
<v 1>Oh, it goes to the body with a whip.</v>

371
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.753
<v 4>Whoosh.</v>

372
00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.250
<v 3>They didn't want that brought worse. Right? So.</v>

373
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:31.440
Come on, come on. It's crazy to me. That globe is just still pumping away.

374
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.230
<v 1>It looks like he's still pressing around looking to knock them out and yeah,</v>

375
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.310
we're in round four.

376
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.450
<v 3>Clover looks how you would make a fighter and a video of Jesus. Just.</v>

377
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.030
<v 2>Faking that. Oh God, that left over.</v>

378
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.380
<v 1>Comb with the right-hand over the top.</v>

379
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:47.830
<v 3>How Clover doesn't train with like any super camps or nothing. Really? No,</v>

380
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.300
not even kind of like a gradual.

381
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.880
<v 1>Right? And yeah. That's what he does now, right? Yeah. Yeah. He has.</v>

382
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.240
<v 3>A school in Connecticut. Didn't he go to ATT for awhile? Yeah he did.</v>

383
00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:03.420
But he lives in Connecticut answering place to live at all the places to go.

384
00:21:03.421 --> 00:21:07.500
You're from Brazil and I moved to Connecticut and I wonder why lady lives.

385
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:11.180
<v 4>There. What? Yeah. You live in two.</v>

386
00:21:11.181 --> 00:21:13.650
Parents had a house in Connecticut for 10 years. So one of the few.

387
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:17.730
<v 1>Places I never perform, I gave up yet. Yep. How come the inside joke.</v>

388
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.790
People getting mad. People from Connecticut or sending me messages. Come on,

389
00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:23.610
bro. Do they have a big city though? Yeah.

390
00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.120
Hartford elbow me. It's not a big city, but.

391
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.550
<v 3>It's definitely a city you've been there for ESPN. For Bristol.</v>

392
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.810
You feel like that's all there is. And

393
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.680
[inaudible] why the are they there doing taxes?

394
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.220
<v 1>Oh, they're there because it's right next to New York city.</v>

395
00:21:38.221 --> 00:21:41.340
And you can get a nice LAR large plotter. Well, that makes sense.

396
00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.010
The big rich investment bankers live in grant. Make sense?

397
00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.980
Where a David Letterman lives. Yeah. David Letterman lived there.

398
00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.870
Got himself up a state. I.

399
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.270
<v 3>Bet that a huge estate bowling. He balling</v>

400
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.360
date. Oh. I.

401
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.270
<v 1>Don't think he does anything anymore though. Dude, Dave is, uh,</v>

402
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:02.000
I think he's just kinda like chill at night. Counts as money. I think.

403
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:06.800
<v 3>Yeah. Jeff Foxworthy is crib in Atlanta is a cat.</v>

404
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.030
I'm sure he's got some Gulf Jeff on the redneck tour.

405
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.750
<v 1>Yeah, him and, uh, Ron white.</v>

406
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:20.670
<v 2>I love that podcast. You did with him Ron? Right? Great. Okay Dave. Oh my</v>

407
00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.820
[inaudible] that's Dave Letterman.

408
00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:27.480
<v 3>Holy. That's what the goal is going to run like in 30 years. Oh man.</v>

409
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:31.140
He looks like Glover takes her like God didn't uh, Dave have heart surgery.

410
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.630
I feel like he had a holy. Yeah. I feel like he had a heart surgery. Oh my God.

411
00:22:36.631 --> 00:22:37.590
He looks horrible.

412
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.560
<v 1>It just looks like he's [inaudible]. I</v>

413
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.393
 remember when Tim Allen became Santa Claus. Yeah.

414
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.010
<v 4>Yeah. I love it. It gets to us all.</v>

415
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.950
<v 2>I looked at a picture of me with 10 years ago when I was 40.</v>

416
00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.740
You always handsome. You look exactly the same. I don't know about that.

417
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.050
You're so delicious. Thank you buddy.

418
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:56.940
That's that's what I've been looking for on a Sunday.

419
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.520
It was on Brian Day and now it's turned.

420
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.580
<v 3>Into now. It's okay. What point in life do you just say we have you money.</v>

421
00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:09.120
You say you life. Or you just let your body go and just eat whatever you want.

422
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:10.080
Sure.

423
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.860
<v 1>A lot of people are doing things, but when you're in the public eye, like, oh,</v>

424
00:23:13.861 --> 00:23:16.410
he clipped him with the right hand over the top. When you're in the public eye,

425
00:23:16.411 --> 00:23:18.510
like a David Letterman, like most of your life.

426
00:23:18.511 --> 00:23:21.600
And then you decided you decided to not do that anymore.

427
00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.780
Then it becomes kind of interesting. You can relax.

428
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.180
<v 2>Because you have to be disciplined about your look and make.</v>

429
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.290
<v 1>Up. Look at that 10 years ago. Look at that cutie pie or similar item.</v>

430
00:23:31.291 --> 00:23:35.520
Not so much. No, you look exactly the same on dude. I appreciate that. Yeah.

431
00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:40.110
30 to 40. That's where you really dropped off, but 40 to 50 you're maintaining.

432
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:42.270
<v 3>Where you kind of maintaining my, it seems like you work out.</v>

433
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.920
<v 4>More. Now I do work out every day. It doesn't do much.</v>

434
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.080
You hear someone's alarm going off? Yeah, I do good ears.

435
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:54.400
I think I have bad ears by the way. You probably do Sage.

436
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.360
<v 3>Son. Yeah. I'm always asking my wife to turn the box.</v>

437
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.080
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Years of getting boxed in my ears again. Yeah. Boxed.</v>

438
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:06.460
<v 3>Up borough. Clover is, just not go away.</v>

439
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:12.340
He didn't get the menu or the memo. Yeah. Got kicked to the body there.

440
00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:13.683
We're good.

441
00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.780
<v 1>We're looking for that knockout punch man. That's a fact always there.</v>

442
00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:24.490
<v 3>Scary thing is if, if Alexander slows down a little bit,</v>

443
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.080
it's good for him. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. Oh my God.

444
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.750
That combo stuff. He needs to stay in the middle of the shotgun.

445
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:36.100
<v 1>Yes. It looks as good as he's ever looked in this fight. And it really does.</v>

446
00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.060
Being in that light. Heavyweight is so fluid and his movement is excellent.

447
00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.740
This is a big fight for him, man.

448
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.580
<v 3>Oh boy. For both of them, it's kind of career defining, to be honest. Yeah.</v>

449
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:50.830
I hate to be with Jesus. Thank you so much stream.

450
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.410
What's going on here? Beautiful.

451
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.350
<v 1>It's an artistic performance, man.</v>

452
00:24:56.351 --> 00:24:59.590
It really is the way he's been hiding that upper cut.

453
00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:02.890
This is my favorite tool up in that. Is he your favorite?

454
00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.190
You have a unique insight knowing exactly how good he is.

455
00:25:06.191 --> 00:25:07.900
Having trained with them. You know, there with.

456
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.930
<v 3>Both of them with Clover. I just, you know,</v>

457
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.560
I understand what he's doing in his pacing. And he's like the Terminator.

458
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.430
He's very similar to it.

459
00:25:15.431 --> 00:25:18.700
That's why I'd love to see him in DC fight because I've trained with DC and M

460
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.610
they had very similar styles was just this relentless,

461
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:26.100
relentless forward pressure. You're like, God relax. Slow down.

462
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.980
Relentless.

463
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.000
<v 1>To you're running like eight miles. I see you run in like some long distances.</v>

464
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.190
Where are you running? Outside my crib.

465
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:37.390
You just run the beach or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Concrete.

466
00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.930
<v 3>In those campaigns shoes. But my knee's up. So I'm suing cam. Why are you.</v>

467
00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.120
<v 5>Why are you running on concrete when those sand is right there? Uh,</v>

468
00:25:46.121 --> 00:25:49.240
I don't know. Cause I like to run, but isn't like sand better for.

469
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.200
<v 3>You because the,</v>

470
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:54.780
I run the SEMICON so I do is I run one Santa Monica stairs and I run a mile,

471
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:58.180
two stairs, run a mile three. So it says when a mile, that's what I'm doing.

472
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.900
That's.

473
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.650
<v 1>Crazy. So the stairs always a sprint and the mile is yeah. Yeah.</v>

474
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.850
<v 3>But my knee yesterday was like, nah, let's take a break bro. Way too big. Yeah.</v>

475
00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.690
You're a heavy guy. What do you weigh? Like two 40 ish. 42 38.

476
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.270
<v 1>Yeah. That's a lot of weight to put on the knees. I know.</v>

477
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.790
<v 3>Man. I got to figure it out. I gotta do something. If you guys know what to do,</v>

478
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.680
it's inside of my knee. W okay. Let me ask you this. Sometimes.

479
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.730
<v 1>About this UFC training facility, like who's going to go there.</v>

480
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:25.920
I'm sorry. It's just.

481
00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.790
<v 3>Good news. And they're going to pump Bain like products into the body, just</v>

482
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.670
in between.

483
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.100
<v 1>Division in between rounds. He steps in a crouch.</v>

484
00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.980
<v 2>By the way. I'm sorry. But look at the Glover and round four,</v>

485
00:26:38.981 --> 00:26:41.980
after all that punishment, keeping his head, he looks very fresh.

486
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.190
One of the problems with Glover.

487
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:48.630
<v 1>Is he's so boxing oriented in his attack and with a guy like Gustafson,</v>

488
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:51.060
he has such a large reach disadvantage.

489
00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:54.840
So he's constantly moving forward, but he doesn't throw kicks.

490
00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.340
<v 3>Oh, Gilbert, uh,</v>

491
00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.720
stop kicking because he got taken down early on, but his kid, he had kicks too.

492
00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:05.210
I don't, I just abandoned it. Keep him away with us.

493
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.060
<v 1>Clover. Like Glover has always got to move.</v>

494
00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.950
<v 2>Into boxing. Well changes again, boy.</v>

495
00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.000
<v 0>Oh my God. Oh my.</v>

496
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.570
<v 2>God. Whoa, God. What a way to win.</v>

497
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.210
Gustafson. Poor Clover. Oh Jesus Christ.

498
00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.750
<v 3>I don't like seeing that at all. I don't.</v>

499
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.800
<v 2>Like seeing that at all. I don't like seeing that at all.</v>

500
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.950
<v 1>Assistant is a beast. That was.</v>

501
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:35.120
<v 2>Brilliant. God. That was brilliant. That was brilliant, man. Holy.</v>

502
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:40.280
This is in Sweden. Stockholm. Come around it down in Stockholm.

503
00:27:40.281 --> 00:27:43.250
He's a hero. He's a hero. He's a legend there.

504
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.410
The heartbreak he went through when.

505
00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:50.300
<v 3>He lost a Johnson there, man, I was there, man. I felt like crying, crying.</v>

506
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.110
<v 1>That they were walking out of the arena with their head low was,</v>

507
00:27:54.111 --> 00:27:57.440
it was rough and it was a bad beating too. You know.

508
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:01.130
<v 2>Redemption redemption. What a Viking, what.</v>

509
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:05.900
<v 3>A fight. Ademption redemption is John Jones, beats DC and Anaheim.</v>

510
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.490
They do Karen Jones. Alexan Guston Stockholm title. Good.

511
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.910
$500,000. It would mean you're not.

512
00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.850
<v 1>Going to do it in Stockholm. They do it in Vegas. The real money is in Vegas.</v>

513
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.480
Unfortunately. That's. That's just how it goes.

514
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:23.090
But that's the reason why we haven't been in Dublin yet for a Conor McGregor

515
00:28:23.091 --> 00:28:23.924
fight being.

516
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.000
<v 3>In soccer, stadium.</v>

517
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:31.000
<v 2>Oh, Jannie keeps doing the same combo. Oh,</v>

518
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.190
how quick was that right away. Right? Stupid, fast.

519
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.250
<v 3>A dude. And he's like, not enough. Huh? There you go. Oh, beautiful.</v>

520
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.113
<v 1>Timing.</v>

521
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.380
See the way he swung that right-hand into look how he's swinging the right hand

522
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.480
and over the left guard. Look at this, watch this.

523
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.770
<v 2>See, look at swings that right-hand over the top Hoover's.</v>

524
00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:55.070
<v 3>Corners like D do you want to kind of avoid the uppercut? He's like, nah,</v>

525
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:57.200
we'll keep doing this. It's nothing we can do.

526
00:28:57.201 --> 00:29:01.220
We just gets hit and hit by these calls. What are you going to do? God,

527
00:29:01.221 --> 00:29:04.100
that was brilliant, man. Brilliant performance. Yeah.

528
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:07.940
Like when you were saying how global just missed it a little bit.

529
00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.630
Like that box him with his wrestling style via rampage.

530
00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.920
He had been jammed him verse rampage in the prime. That's a fight. Yeah.

531
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.340
He could.

532
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.190
<v 1>Have won, but you know, what's interesting is that he just,</v>

533
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:21.950
cause he doesn't throw very many kicks. I mean,

534
00:29:21.951 --> 00:29:23.630
he might've thrown 10 kicks that whole fight.

535
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:28.100
He's always moving into boxing range and he's getting chewed up on the way in

536
00:29:28.101 --> 00:29:31.130
and it's tough as he is. He's still getting tagged over and over.

537
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.970
<v 3>It's 2017. If you're just boxing, you're screwed, man.</v>

538
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.820
A guy who's just boxing doing well in the UFC. Yeah.

539
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.100
<v 1>You're right. You're right. You really have to do.</v>

540
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:44.440
<v 3>Every highest level. Just can't do it anymore. Like guys figure it out. Yeah.</v>

541
00:29:44.441 --> 00:29:45.610
You really have to be able to do everything.
