00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.000
What do you think about today's era of boxings but particularly the heavyweight

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.240
division. I mean, it's, it's real exciting right now.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.080
<v 1>I think it's coming back. Yes. I think coming back, you know, Ruiz don't mm-hmm,</v>

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.080
&lt;affirmative&gt; sneak through the picture and then, and,

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.000
and I like that because here's a guy you look at,

7
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.750
you may think he can't fight. Right. Fight him, dude. He can.

8
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.390
<v 0>Fight. Yeah. Oh, that Andy Ruiz can throw some.</v>

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.750
<v 1>Combination. Oh yeah. Sure. I'm like, and I was,</v>

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
I was telling a friend of mines. I would tell a friend of mine. I said,

11
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.310
now I said, they picked the wrong guy. He said, what you talk about, man,

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.580
that point he don't look like he said, I said, he just look like that.

13
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.220
He can fight. I said, I spar with it. I say, he,

14
00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:50.140
the first person I ever spared that I say, I never want to fight. Really?

15
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.940
Yeah. I said, but he was that he was that good. I'm saying, you know,

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.740
now at that time I was, I, I, I was, uh,

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.970
46 and so he had to be probably ninth team.

18
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.330
And I just said, and, but that my first time ever seeing a guy and I say,

19
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450
uh, I don't wanna fight him. &lt;laugh&gt; I just,

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.930
I was glad that I retired after 46.

21
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.810
<v 0>Oh, he has beautiful combinations. And you look at his body and you say, oh,</v>

22
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.050
that's a guy that's overweight. But underneath all that fat,

23
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:22.400
there's an in athlete.

24
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.600
<v 1>Why? But that's what I'm saying. I, you know, so it, you just can't,</v>

25
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.040
you just can't go by eye. How it look these days. Cause Anthony.

26
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.000
<v 0>Joshua looks like a Greek. God, we sure did. I mean,</v>

27
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.800
he looks like he's carved outta a stone. Oh.

28
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.600
<v 1>Yeah. He knocked him down. That guy got up and knocked him down three.</v>

29
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.520
<v 0>Times. Crazy. And then you got Deontay Wilder.</v>

30
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.670
Who's one of the craziest heavyweight knockout artist ever. I mean,

31
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.830
that guy has preposterous power.

32
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.390
<v 1>Wait, you know, I'm you know, and cause people asked me about him. I said, well,</v>

33
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:55.750
you know what I said, only thing I can say he from Alabama too.

34
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.950
&lt;laugh&gt; I said I'm from Alabama. So I'm in the water, God up. I said,

35
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.460
but it's his confide. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know, Dion.

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.900
He, he, he, he go in, he go in and he fight his fight.

37
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.980
And, and when he can see that shot, he threw it in and everybody, buddy,

38
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.780
he get wild at the end. I said,

39
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:20.660
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; least he know the guy hurt though. Right? Right. I said,

40
00:02:20.661 --> 00:02:24.730
he don't get wild before the guy get hurt. Right. I by he know the guy hurt.

41
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.130
I said, so he can,

42
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.650
he can take chance to throw in loop his shot back mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cause the

43
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.210
guy hurt. I said, but at least he's smart enough to know.

44
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.450
But I remember the time when he got hurt, he got knocked down and all that.

45
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.850
And one thing did these shows, he had confidence.

46
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.730
Cause people don't have confidence. They get hurt. They started trying to run.

47
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:46.600
Right, right. When he got hurt, he came forth.

48
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.560
And that's the reason why he was able to buy that round.

49
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.600
Then the next round he knocked the guy out.

50
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.400
<v 0>Well, Ortiz and him are gonna have a.</v>

51
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.440
<v 1>Rematch. Yeah. I'm telling that's the guy that it was.</v>

52
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.360
<v 0>To the, and Ortiz is no joke. He's a dangerous fighter, man. That.</v>

53
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.760
<v 1>That's reason I couldn't figure out why you were give another chance.</v>

54
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.560
&lt;laugh&gt; which shows his confidence. Confidence. He showed confidence.

55
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:09.960
Cause the fact that the man now ain't nobody,

56
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.200
even after that fight want to fight ort steal. They said, nah, true.

57
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.270
I'm gonna wish him to go away. Yeah. Right. Because he's a good fighter.

58
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.750
And he he's one of the most, most clever fighters out there. Yes.

59
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.310
And that's the reason I'm like, okay, hell he, you did it one time. Okay.

60
00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:30.390
You know why?

61
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.270
Let him knock somebody else out and let him upset somebody before he come.

62
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.950
<v 0>Back and Ortiz is getting old. I mean, no one even knows how,</v>

63
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.100
how old he really is. Cuz he's from Cuba.

64
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.620
You know this speculation that he's 50 years old, people don't even know.

65
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.780
<v 1>Right. They.</v>

66
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.660
<v 0>Don't. But he's an amazing fighter.</v>

67
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.260
He's so skilled outta that Cuban amateur program.

68
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.340
I mean his boxing is just top notch and he had Deontay in all sorts of trouble,

69
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.381
but you're right.

70
00:03:56.381 --> 00:04:00.330
While the showed that he could overcome adversity and that his power that's one

71
00:04:00.331 --> 00:04:02.490
of the more impressive things about him. His power doesn't go away.

72
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.050
He keeps that power like deep in the 12th round.

73
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:09.650
When he knocked out Tyson fury or knocked down Tyson fury in the 12th round,

74
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:10.610
it looked like it was over.

75
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.290
<v 1>But that's what I'm saying. I'm saying, yeah, this what you talking? What?</v>

76
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:19.170
You talking confidence. And I'm like, and I told him, I said, look, man,

77
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.800
I, I said, I said, you only person.

78
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.520
I know that tall and lighter than me. &lt;laugh&gt; that's true. Right.

79
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.760
I'm I'm like he, he fight two 30. He fight two 13.

80
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.280
<v 0>He was 2 0 9. When he fought Tyson fury 2 0 9, the day of the fight.</v>

81
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.600
That's crazy. I said.

82
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.120
<v 1>That one said, I'm like, I'm, like I said, now,</v>

83
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.830
that's what you told confidence in all this. Yeah. And I kinda, I said,

84
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:47.670
you know, but he don't worry about it. Right. I'm like, you know, no,

85
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:51.110
he don't care. See, see, and that's what, that's why I like it.

86
00:04:51.111 --> 00:04:54.190
Certain people to me, with me, everybody said, man, you,

87
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.630
they started talking about this stuff. I said, look, I care about that.

88
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.910
I can fight, man. Yeah. And you know what, when he,

89
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.860
when he saw talking to people and people get scared of, cause he say, look man,

90
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.580
I can fight. I know what I could do. Yeah. He know he, he, he,

91
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.060
all he gotta do is hit you with that big right hand.

92
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.220
<v 0>Yes. Or the left.</v>

93
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.180
<v 1>Hand, I just thought was hand. Cause he, he,</v>

94
00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.140
cause I seen him when he hit this boy where he, now I'm doing little hook.

95
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.820
I said, man, I got, he, he got a.

96
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.330
<v 0>Hook there. Well, 12th round, it was a right hand and a left hook behind it.</v>

97
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.210
Snap Tyson's head back. Yep. But I mean, Tyson, Fury's incredible too, man,

98
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.690
that guy got up after that.

99
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.770
99% of the people on planet earth would still be out cold after those two

100
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:34.290
punches. Wait.

101
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.050
<v 1>Wait, what, what? I'm what I try to get people to see.</v>

102
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.890
I say now the referee then supposed to let him get up. Most people,

103
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.720
most fighter would get up. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but the referee,

104
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.240
well dive on your, jump on you.

105
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:52.840
Won't let you get cause cause for you to lay flat like that for four or five

106
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:55.440
seconds, they ain't supposed to do that. Right. Most.

107
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.200
<v 0>Referees would've called it off right there. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.760
Well thank God he didn't well.

109
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.840
<v 1>Well, you know, I'm out for sure. Cause it messed up the whole thing.</v>

110
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.280
He would have been the temp and, and, and so now they.

111
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.401
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

112
00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.480
but aren't you excited that he got up and then Tyson fury went up winning the

113
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.190
rest of the round.

114
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.440
<v 1>Well wait. Yeah, he did. He did did,</v>

115
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.950
but still when you do the thing, right.

116
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.670
Your job for to be safe a fighter. Right.

117
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.230
<v 0>And I see what you're saying. So you think the referee should've probably saved.</v>

118
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.750
<v 1>Yeah. The referee supposed to do with it. My own thing. Cuz I'm if it,</v>

119
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.190
anybody is, they would've did it. You know.

120
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.910
<v 0>What bothers me? What bothers me is the count was more than tens.</v>

121
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.140
But that's what I'm saying. That's what bothers me.

122
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.700
What bothers me is I think it shouldn't be the referee going one, two,

123
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:46.660
it should be a number like there should be like a, a timer.

124
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.380
<v 1>They do have a timer. They had a timer. This is how, you know, they, they had a,</v>

125
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.220
they have a guy with a referee and thinking he count two.

126
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.940
<v 0>Right. But he's counting. But I want a number,</v>

127
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.570
like a digital clock that shows you 10 actual seconds.

128
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.410
I think they should have something like that.

129
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:06.930
Cause to leave it up to the referee, some referees like 1, 2, 3 other referees,

130
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:10.770
like one, two. And that's not seconds.

131
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.570
That's not seconds subjected.

132
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.170
<v 1>Because you know what? Cause even after that,</v>

133
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.440
the referee racial glove look at this couple other seconds.

134
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.000
When you look at it, he had about 30 seconds. He had 30 seconds.

135
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.720
And then they said, oh he, he recovered. I said, but you know,

136
00:07:27.721 --> 00:07:30.960
they went and did that to anybody else. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. I said,

137
00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:32.520
but how, but now,

138
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.200
now what bothered me was what bothered me. I said, how do you,

139
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.070
I said, he go any other country and fight.

140
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.350
And they other and the guy, dude, him like this, they stop the fight.

141
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.190
Right?

142
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.110
<v 0>A lot of referees would've stopped that fight. I said.</v>

143
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:52.270
<v 1>They, I say stop the fight. Yeah. I said, now I said,</v>

144
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.830
how is it when somebody can come in your country

145
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.860
and, and, and they, and you give them the ups. Right, right, right. I said,

146
00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:05.420
I said, I said, I said, something's wrong with that? I said, I.

147
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.140
<v 0>Just think it was cuz it was such a big fight.</v>

148
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:10.300
Like everybody wanted to see that fight. It was such a huge fight. Well.

149
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.180
<v 1>You know, I'm saying, even though I'm saying you go in, in other country,</v>

150
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.300
you know, if that fight close anywhere, you are not kidding.

151
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.090
Right. Right. You getting it. Right. And, and you could like, just like, like I,

152
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:27.330
I, I I'll hit that guy. The guy, the guy didn't even throw no punches,

153
00:08:27.331 --> 00:08:30.930
some of rounds. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they said, I remember they asked the guy.

154
00:08:30.931 --> 00:08:34.210
I said, how could you win around when you didn't throw a punch in that round?

155
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.210
<v 0>The only person who's ever done that is Willie pep. &lt;laugh&gt; right.</v>

156
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.480
Willie pep won round by being a slick defensive fighter. Yeah. Yeah.

157
00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:45.920
But he was so impressive that people gave him the round anyway. Yeah. You know,

158
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.360
that's a, that fight was, uh,

159
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.280
that was a fight that begged for a rematch just begged for a rematch.

160
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.240
And it bothers me.

161
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.600
It's one of the things that bothers me about boxing sometimes is that these

162
00:08:56.601 --> 00:08:59.960
fights, they don't, they don't come to fruition. And then if, I mean,

163
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.000
he almost lost in his Tyson with that LA that cut in his last fight. I mean,

164
00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:08.240
that was a bad cut. Yeah. They could have stopped that fight, you.

165
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:11.200
<v 1>Know, but see. Yeah. Cause, but you know, they, they stopped it.</v>

166
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:16.190
They stopped it when they wanted to stop it. So you gotta understand who,

167
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.470
who, who leading this thing off to a point where that you got to get

168
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.630
in the game with me in the bar game. I just wanted it to be right.

169
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.150
Cause I know how,

170
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.510
how important it is for anybody who put they

171
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.220
life online to be a fighter. And won't you say? I,

172
00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.420
I, it was fair. I did it.

173
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.020
I did my all at least I got my opportunity.
