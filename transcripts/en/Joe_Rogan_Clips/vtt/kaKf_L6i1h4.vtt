00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, that was a,</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.160
that was a rough one, man, but it's, it's interesting how, uh,

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.200
Francis has bounced back Francis just Newing everybody. Now it's just that.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.033
<v 1>Mental hump.</v>

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.600
<v 0>He had stuck on. Right. He had to go through that one fight. Mm-hmm you know.</v>

6
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.190
<v 1>The thing is sometimes we get these fighters coming into the see, and they've,</v>

7
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:21.431
you know,

8
00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:24.670
they're so talented that they they're in the UFC fairly early in their career

9
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:25.990
before they've had any real lessons,

10
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.670
especially if they've just starched a bunch of guys mm-hmm,

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.750
&lt;affirmative&gt; like they come in at, you know,

12
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.390
10 fights into their career and they've knocked everyone out in the first round.

13
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.990
There's no real learning process there because they've not found anyone to

14
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:36.824
challenge them.

15
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.870
So then they get into the USFC and then we get to see them go through that

16
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:44.180
process in the UFC. And I think that's what we've seen within Garu, you know,

17
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:47.900
it took him get into a world title for someone to really show him something in

18
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:51.540
his game that made him feel vulnerable. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. And then,

19
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.740
you know, we've watched him go through that process. Like in, in the moment,

20
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.460
it's really annoying because we wanna see a mad fight, but in hindsight,

21
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.420
you can kind of look at it and go, well, I appreciate that as part of his,

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.010
any now. And you know, I understand where he was at.

23
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.290
<v 0>You gotta give Steve a credit for taking bombs in that fight.</v>

24
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.250
I mean, he took bombs in that fight, especially in that first round. I'm like.

25
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.570
Francis is always in it when he's standing in front of you,

26
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.170
when he's standing in front of you, he's always in it. But Steve,

27
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.000
a managed to do us slide away from most of 'em the ones he got hit with,

28
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.400
he went with them, rolled with them, the ones he got hit clean with,

29
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:33.920
he just absorbed and kept going and ground him out. So.

30
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.960
<v 1>Here's a question for you then.</v>

31
00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:38.200
Do you think you take punches better if you expect the person to punch hard?

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.920
Probably because I would say that he took bigger punches from,

33
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:44.430
in Ghana out fight than the, than the punch from DC.

34
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.750
And I would say he was probably more vulnerable to the punch from DC because he

35
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.830
probably wasn't expecting DC to knock him out.

36
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.190
<v 0>Could be, could be wouldn't expect to get caught like that in the clinch either.</v>

37
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.550
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it was a really perfect utilization of the clench work

38
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.070
combined with that crazy big overhand. Right? Yeah. I mean,

39
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.020
he really set him up perfectly for that.

40
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.100
And it was something that obviously was a part of his repertoire.

41
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:09.220
It was not something that was just, oh,

42
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:11.940
it was just happened to be there for the moment he set him up for that. Mm.

43
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.500
And that, that was just the perfect right hand.

44
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.340
And he caught him when he was looking. I mean,

45
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.300
he just didn't didn't know that punch was coming, clipped him, dropped him,

46
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.300
put him away. The real question is what's it gonna be like,

47
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.970
now that he knows that DC and knock him out. I mean,

48
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:27.930
is he gonna fight from the outside, try to land big shots.

49
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.290
He's gonna avoid the clinch at any cost. Now he's got a,

50
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.490
a big he and reach advantage. Can he keep DC off of him? Yeah. And then also

51
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.970
when a fighter has had a lot of wars like him with junior Del Santos,

52
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.520
the first fight, there was a war, right. I mean,

53
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.760
he's had some wars in his career, true fight. The in Ghana fight,

54
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:52.360
the strew fight was a war. He got stopped in that fight. Yeah.

55
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.400
You know how many the Mark Hunt fight, right? Mm. That was.

56
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.360
<v 1>A war. Yeah. War. He, he dominated that one from top position as well.</v>

57
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.000
<v 0>And even Aster overing fight. I mean, that first round was chaos.</v>

58
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.840
It was chaos until he wound up stopping him.

59
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.360
How many of those can a fighter have?

60
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.600
How many of those can a fighter have before we see them start to fade in front

61
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.001
of our eyes.

62
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.040
And I'm not suggesting that we saw that with him because he was able to

63
00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:20.430
withstand the scary, his heavyweight striker in the sport.

64
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.750
And I think the DC punch was just a punch. He didn't see. And it was perfect.

65
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.750
Yeah. And it just put him away. Yeah.

66
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.310
<v 1>I'd be surprised if it happens again first round.</v>

67
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.670
I'd be surprised if it happens again, because I think he's,

68
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.150
he is gonna be far more respectful of the fact that DC's got power now, for.

69
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.270
<v 0>Sure. You're.</v>

70
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.190
<v 1>A hundred percent. Right. And like,</v>

71
00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:41.540
you go back to his us debut and like he did fight long, like used,

72
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.300
used to use a real good long jab and a Loic. And like recently he's,

73
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.780
he's kind of crowded his work a lot.

74
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.060
He steps in very close with that right hand, which often, you know,

75
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:51.020
offered the cling to DC.

76
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.180
<v 0>He's just KA in so many people that I think that he's like, it. You know,</v>

77
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.180
I'm just gonna get in there and just bombs away with these people. I mean,

78
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.140
he makes it exciting.

79
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.330
It's I think he is the least appreciated successful

80
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.290
heavyweight champion ever. And I don't understand it. I don't understand it.

81
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:12.690
He's got everything. He's a, uh, you know, he's a firefighter,

82
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.610
an active duty firefighter. He's a knockout fighter.

83
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.410
He mean he knocked out ver doom,

84
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:20.280
moving backwards with a perfectly placed right hand end.

85
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.840
He's a animal. I mean, he fights super exciting.

86
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.720
He's been smashing everybody. He stopped,

87
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.040
he won more heavyweight title fights than anyone in

88
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:37.480
history. He defended the title four times. No, one's been able to do that.

89
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.600
That's how crazy that division is. Yeah.

90
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.590
And still does not get the respect he deserves.

91
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.390
<v 1>And he seems off this week as well. Good. Like, like.</v>

92
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.670
<v 0>Active duty firefighter, man. Guy's an animal. Yeah.</v>

93
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.710
<v 1>He just, he seems annoyed. I just,</v>

94
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.790
I wonder whether that's gonna play into the fight cuz I got the impression from

95
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:57.150
him that he'd not watched the, the previous fight.

96
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.300
I got the impression that he'd not watched the first DC fight really. Uh,

97
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.060
so that, see, that concerns me because then the idea of,

98
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.180
of what happened in his head might be very different to what actually happened.

99
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.020
<v 0>Well, God, do you really think they would let him not watch? I Don that.</v>

100
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.980
<v 1>I don't know. I don't know. I mean, there are some fighters that do,</v>

101
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.780
it just blows my mind and the way he was talking in an interview is like,

102
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.770
like it's, you know, and the other, the thing,

103
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.210
the thing that concerns me more is that he was talking about how he was winning

104
00:05:26.211 --> 00:05:29.210
that, that first round, you know, he felt like he was controlling the fight.

105
00:05:29.211 --> 00:05:31.890
He was, he did a lot of good things until DC caught him.

106
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.370
So if he starts banking on that being, you know,

107
00:05:34.371 --> 00:05:37.730
just one of those punches that he got caught with, he might not, you know,

108
00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:41.930
give DC the credit for, you know, opening that vulnerability up. Yeah. I.

109
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:42.761
<v 0>Think, think for sure,</v>

110
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:45.760
he must have heard all the different people discuss tactics though.

111
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.880
It just doesn't make any sense to me that he insulates himself that well.

112
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.520
And for sure his coaches over it strong style, they've definitely, oh.

113
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.400
<v 1>They've watched it for sure.</v>

114
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.840
<v 0>They've watched it. Yeah. They understand what to,</v>

115
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.760
so maybe he relies on his coaches and their guidance of him during training and

116
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.600
for sure he knows a DC knocked out.

117
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.680
So what he's gonna do is go in there and fight, like he's trying to get it back.

118
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.760
The, the question is,

119
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.880
is he gonna be able to use that long reach and that height and that power on the

120
00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:13.720
outside and keep DC the away from him?

121
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.030
Cuz he's got a considerable height and reach advantage.

122
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.030
Can he stuff those takedowns can he keep DC from getting on top of him?

123
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.430
Can you know? Yeah. If he can do all those things, he can get very interesting.

124
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.430
Yeah. And if DC, you know, he's undefeated at heavyweight man. I mean,

125
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.990
I think that's really where he shines you look at what he did to Josh Barnett

126
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.110
throws him through the air,

127
00:06:34.111 --> 00:06:38.140
like a rag doll when he was in the Strikeforce grand PR did he was a monster at

128
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.980
heavyweight, you know, and the wrestling's unparalleled.

129
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.860
<v 1>Yeah. So do we get Jones at heavyweight then? I hope.</v>

130
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.300
<v 0>So. I do. I really do. I think he wants to do it at light heavyweight though.</v>

131
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.420
I think he wants to prove a point what.

132
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.140
<v 1>DC wants to do it at light heavyweight. Yes.</v>

133
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.380
I didn't think he wants to lose that weight again. Does he? I.

134
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.090
<v 0>Mean, what I had heard was that he wanted to fight at heavy weight.</v>

135
00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.650
If he fights John for a third time, that's what I had heard.

136
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.330
And I think I might have heard it from him. Huh. And he,

137
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:08.810
but I would EUR if I was in his camp, I'd say, all this dieting, bro,

138
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.450
what look you do, you know, when you have a belly, you people up,

139
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.210
you know? And he doesn't worry about food.

140
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.650
He doesn't worry about cutting weight.

141
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.440
He and he is fast for a heavyweight much like Andy Ruiz. You know,

142
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.000
I think there's a benefit in that. There's I mean,

143
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.760
obviously people there's people that knew that Andy Ruiz

144
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.320
was a really talented boxer coming in,

145
00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:33.440
but there's other people that looked at his body and dismissed him.

146
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.680
But when you see the efficiency of those punches, like,

147
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.630
and the fact that he's able to cork so many punches in close mm-hmm

148
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.190
&lt;affirmative&gt; whereas Anthony Joshua with his giant arms and his long length

149
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.590
gets a little bit smothered by that closer distance, closer distance.

150
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:53.110
And Andy's just dropping bombs on him over the top and big power to him too,

151
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.430
man. And perfect, perfect mechanics, like so fluid.

152
00:07:57.431 --> 00:08:01.420
Everything's just smooth and fluid who knows, man.

153
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:03.260
Maybe DC's the best heavyweight of all time.

154
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.260
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I mean quite possibly.</v>

155
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.140
And there's something to be said for that for Zika as well.

156
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:09.100
There's an efficiency that comes with that, you know,

157
00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:10.980
like you look at Anthony Joshua and yeah. I mean, he,

158
00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:12.300
he looks like a physical specimen,

159
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.500
but the drawbacks would be obvious over round. Whereas an, you know, Andy Ruiz,

160
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.890
DC, they can just, yes, they just keep flowing and it, and it's, you know,

161
00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:22.290
those punches are more about the, the momentum, you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

162
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.450
you need a certain amount of muscle mass to get the movement started and then

163
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:27.610
you maintain it with good technique. You know,

164
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.610
like an additional amount of muscle is not gonna make up for a heavier punch

165
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.100
really.

166
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.550
<v 0>Right.</v>

167
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:37.450
And he's talked openly about being far stronger in training as

168
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.600
a heavyweight than he was as a light heavyweight. He just felt better. Yeah.

169
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.640
I think it's his weight class. I really do. I think his, you know, look,

170
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.800
he beat the greatest of all time. I mean the greatest on paper of all time,

171
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.160
at least at least on paper, I feel like performance wise,

172
00:08:53.161 --> 00:08:57.520
there was moments where Kane Velazquez was in his prime where I said like,

173
00:08:57.521 --> 00:08:59.920
that's the that to me, I mean,

174
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.720
I know it doesn't play out on paper because he was injured multiple times at a

175
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:07.960
gang of surgeries. But when he was in his prime man, he was terrifying.

176
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.880
He just didn't stop. He didn't St he had Welcher weight, Colby,

177
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:16.110
Covington style endurance as a heavyweight man. He didn't make any sense.

178
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.390
And he's slightly bigger than DC.

179
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.630
Everywhere is until like reaching high and every sense. Yeah. And you know,

180
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.590
and he could you up on the feet too. I mean, he could do everything.

181
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:29.110
He was so efficient and smooth and just relentless. Relentless.

182
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.310
Yeah. No one more relentless and came Velas in his prime for him.

183
00:09:33.311 --> 00:09:37.820
It was almost like his body couldn't handle the strength of his brain.

184
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.460
Mm. Like his mental toughness was so incredible.

185
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.740
His body just couldn't keep up with it. His body just starts blowing things up.

186
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.820
&lt;laugh&gt; cause his minds just pressed forward, go, go, go. You know,

187
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:53.140
his in his cardio was just preposterous. Didn't even make sense. Yeah.

188
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.930
DC looks in good shape at the open workout yesterday. I,

189
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.890
I think he's expecting a harder fight this weekend.
