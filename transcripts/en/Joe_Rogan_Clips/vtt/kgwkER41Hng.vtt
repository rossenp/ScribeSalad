00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.280
<v 0>So for you with this 22 hour window of not eating,</v>

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.560
what do you think the benefits are other than your energy and slight spikes in

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.080
no epinephrine and some other hormones?

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.680
<v 1>Well, I don't think there's sufficient evidence at this point in time,</v>

5
00:00:14.681 --> 00:00:17.120
that time restricted feeding is gonna impact my longevity.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.350
So I think that's the big claim. And it's the a claim. What is the,

7
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:21.990
what is the claim.

8
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.910
<v 0>Like? What are they saying? Oh.</v>

9
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.870
<v 1>I mean, I think the claim would be that fasting mimicry, which could be,</v>

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.883
you know,

11
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.390
like what say Valter Longo talks about where you do a five day hypo caloric diet

12
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.430
of 750 to a thousand calories a day for five days followed by 25 days of ad

13
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.910
lium, feeding, meaning whatever the hell you want. Um, uh,

14
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.340
in terms of total caloric content, um, you know, the claim is, well,

15
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:49.340
that's gonna enhance longevity and, uh, or, you know, doing a 16,

16
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:54.060
eight or 18 six is gonna enhance lifespan. So just to take a step back, um,

17
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.700
I, I am only aware of, uh,

18
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.370
three things that have you universally extended lifespan across all model

19
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.130
organisms. So if you think of like all you carrys right,

20
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:10.410
if you go from yeast to worms, to flies, to mammals,

21
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.970
the only things that uniformly extend life, um,

22
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.290
or almost uniformly is caloric restriction and or dietary restriction.

23
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.600
So total reduction in calories during the lifetime and or reduction of certain

24
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.640
subsets of those calories. So there's a super famous experiment that was done.

25
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.920
Um, actually if anyone's interested, I wrote about it,

26
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:32.960
it's on my blog somewhere, but it's basically this,

27
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.640
the best experiment ever done in chloric restriction was between monkeys.

28
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.480
And there was a group at the NIH and a group at the university of Wisconsin,

29
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.960
and it was like a 19 year experiment or something like that.

30
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.870
So you could really study the impact of caloric restriction over these things.

31
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.510
And that experiment showed us that caloric restriction, extended lifespan.

32
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.150
If you had a really diet and it did not extend lifespan,

33
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.110
if you had a really good diet Hmm. Counterintuitive,

34
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.750
but it also spoke to the idea that dietary restriction probably mattered.

35
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:05.100
So in other words, if you're eating a regular eye of McDonald's every day,

36
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.260
and then we put your counterpart eating 70% of McDonald's every day,

37
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.940
that's going to move the needle. But in the Wisconsin, uh, in,

38
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.860
in the NIH experiment, when you took the monkeys that were eating kind of,

39
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.380
it wasn't their natural food, but it was less horrible food.

40
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.890
The colo restriction did not extend life span.

41
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.490
So that through a wrench in everyone's understanding of caloric restriction,

42
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.930
and there are certain strains of mice that also don't seem to be enhanced in

43
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:35.770
terms of lifespan, meaning just time on, on earth. Um,

44
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.690
but for the most part, nutrient deprivation, um,

45
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:41.570
pretty ubiquitously extends life.

46
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.200
The second thing it uniformly extends life across this is a drug

47
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:51.200
called rapamycin, which is kinda like my favorite drug in the whole world.

48
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.320
I mean, meaning it's like, I think it's the most important drug in,

49
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.400
in terms of this space,

50
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.720
not necessarily because it's a drug that we'll all be taking though.

51
00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:01.120
I do believe that is the case, but more importantly,

52
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:05.400
because of what it's taught us about the nutrient sensing pathway and its

53
00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:09.680
target, which is this protein called to the target of rapamycin or mTOR,

54
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.680
as you probably heard of it is mechanistic target of rapamycin and rapamycin

55
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.960
inhibits that. Now it's a bit complicated because there's two variants of it.

56
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:21.070
There's something called mTOR complex one and mTOR complex two.

57
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.670
And if you take rapamycin day in and day out every day, which for example,

58
00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:26.950
transplant patients do,

59
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.910
it's an immune suppressant that doesn't seem to really extend lifespan,

60
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.990
but if you take it in a pulsitile way,

61
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.670
you selectively get this mTOR one inhibition without the mTOR two inhibition,

62
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.020
that seems to longevity big time. And how does that work?

63
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.380
How would you take it selectively? Well, um,

64
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.140
this is sort of one of my main clinical interests, um, because I,

65
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.940
uh, obviously I'm waiting for the day when I can start taking it and ultimately,

66
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.700
you know, feel that it's safe enough that I could give it to patients. Um,

67
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.290
ex if I'm extrapolating from all of the best data out there.

68
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.850
So that's looking at the work that's come out of a guy named David Sabots lab.

69
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.450
David's, um, a guy at MIT. He's a professor.

70
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.410
He's actually the guy that when he was a medical student, um,

71
00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:11.650
doing his PhD in 1994,

72
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.210
actually discovered how rap micin works in mammals.

73
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.810
He's actually the guy that coined mechanistic target of rap micin mTOR as a, uh,

74
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.440
name him. And so now, whatever we are almost 25 years later, um,

75
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.560
you know, he's still running the powerhouse lab that understands it.

76
00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:30.240
So if you look at all of the literature, that's coming out of their lab,

77
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.360
coupled with a guy named Matt Kalin at the university of Washington,

78
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.440
who's doing rap mic and studies and dogs along with the work done by

79
00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:40.480
someone named Joan man,

80
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.470
who was at the time at Novartis is now at a company called restore bio and a few

81
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:47.310
other people. I,

82
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.030
my intuition is that somewhere between two to six milligrams,

83
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.510
every five to seven days is probably the sweet spot. Um,

84
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.390
but you know,

85
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.950
am I confident enough in that to say that we should all be taking it? Not yet.

86
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.700
There's a couple things that like,

87
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.340
I want to be able to measure before we do that. But, um,

88
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.620
you know, in the animal data, the stuff's remarkable.

89
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.420
If you look at Matt cab's dog data, it's remarkable. Like what,

90
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.420
what are they doing with it? Well, so for, so you, you own a dog, you know this,

91
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:22.130
right? I mean, if you, if you look at outside of euthanasia accidents,

92
00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:24.650
how do dogs die? They basically die of cancer and heart and, and,

93
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.290
and they get dilated cardiomyopathy.

94
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:28.170
So it's a different type of heart disease than humans get.

95
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:31.530
They don't get atherosclerotic disease, they get heart failure, their,

96
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.330
their hearts just get too, too, too big. And their rejection fraction,

97
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.890
which is the amount of blood,

98
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:38.650
the percentage of blood that leaves the ventricular chamber with every

99
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.930
contraction that that number goes down, bad. Things happen.

100
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.920
Been now to put that in perspective,

101
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.480
you and I sitting here a couple of normal fit dudes,

102
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.000
we probably have a resting ejection fraction of 60%.

103
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.000
And if like we went out there and like killed it and worked out as hard as we

104
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:58.160
could at peak, we might get that up to 80, 85% ejection fraction.

105
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.640
So once the ejection fraction gets below 30%, you know,

106
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.040
a person starts to become very symptomatic. Well,

107
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.320
Matt took these dogs that had low ejection fractions to begin with.

108
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.760
And I forget what the exact number was,

109
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.150
but it might have been like below 40% or below 30% put them on

110
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.030
rapamycin for 12 weeks.

111
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.510
And in just 12 weeks saw an absolute 10% improvement. So not didn't,

112
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:26.470
that means not, it's not going from 30 to 33,

113
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:30.710
that's going from 30 to 40% EF improvement. Um,

114
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.470
in other words, it's, it's hard to measure an effect in 12 weeks of a drug. Um,

115
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.940
and certainly you're not gonna be able to measure a longevity impact over that.

116
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.220
So much of the study that's being done with this is looking at surrogate markers

117
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:46.180
that we assume would pretend longevity.

118
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.860
So Matt's work focusing on, um, the ejection fraction,

119
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.860
uh, manics work was focused on immune response, which again was,

120
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:57.460
so this was the turning point for me. This was like December of two,

121
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.050
2014 was like,

122
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.090
when everything in my professional world shifted in terms of my interest

123
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.690
towards like rapamycin is the thing I want to know everything about.

124
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.930
Because when I was a surgical resident, you know, we used to give rapamycin out,

125
00:07:11.931 --> 00:07:14.010
like it was cotton candy to all the transplant patients.

126
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.640
It was an amazing drug that revolutionized transplant for physiology,

127
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.920
because it had far fewer side effects than massive doses of prednisone and

128
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:24.360
things that we used to have to give patients.

129
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.760
Now you could give them much less prednisone and you could give them rapamycin

130
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.800
or cousins of rapamycin, like FK 5 0 6.

131
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.680
<v 0>And what you're doing with that stuff is you're suppressing the immune system.</v>

132
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:36.880
So the body doesn't reject the organ. Exactly. Now when you do that,

133
00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:40.310
does that leave them susceptible to illness or disease? It does. Yep.

134
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.230
Would that be the case with rap micin in person taking.

135
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.510
<v 1>It for longevity and that's the million dollar question. And so I think in two,</v>

136
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.030
so in a moment I want I'll, I'll tell you the story of how rapamycin came to be,

137
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.750
cuz I think it's the most interesting story in biology,

138
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.790
certainly in the last 25, 30 years,

139
00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.380
but when it was approved in 1999 by the D it was for this

140
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.180
indication, it was an immune suppressant.

141
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.980
It was 10 years before anybody figured out that, oh wait,

142
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.740
this could also extend life. And there in, you had this paradox, which was,

143
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:14.380
wait a minute, how can an immune suppressant extend life? I mean,

144
00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:18.740
everybody acknowledges that immunity is a core, you know, element of health.

145
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.610
And so in December of 2014,

146
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.330
I feel like it was like almost Christmas day.

147
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.610
I remember thinking this is like the best present I've ever got. Um,

148
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.410
manic group published this paper,

149
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.850
which they did in a group of about 320, uh,

150
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:39.690
65 year olds ish. So they put them into four groups. There was a placebo,

151
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.640
there was a group that got, and it wasn't actually rapamycin.

152
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:46.240
It was ever everolimus, which is an analog of Remy.

153
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.273
It's basically the same drug.

154
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.840
So there was a group that got one milligram every single day,

155
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.600
five milligrams once a week, 20 milligrams, once a week,

156
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.400
they did this for something like eight to 12 weeks.

157
00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.240
And then they washed out meaning they got nothing for eight to 12 weeks and then

158
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:01.600
they were hit with a flu vaccine.

159
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:05.200
And then the scientist measured the immune response,

160
00:09:05.201 --> 00:09:08.000
doing these really complicated assays where you look at T-cell function.

161
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.200
So relative to the placebo, AC paradoxically, all groups.

162
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.070
And I say paradox because even the group that got one milligram once a day,

163
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.150
all saw an increase in immunity, which is a good thing.

164
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:24.630
But the five and 20 group saw an even bigger response.

165
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.070
The people who just got five once a week or 20 once a week saw an even bigger

166
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.090
response.

167
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.750
But the group that took 20 once a week had more side effects and the biggest

168
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:35.420
side effect of rap mice and acutely is these awful,

169
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.740
awful mouth sores called Atos ulcers. They're nasty. They're brutal.
