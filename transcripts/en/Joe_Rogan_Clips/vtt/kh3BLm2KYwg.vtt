00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 1>I guess we should start off with, um, what made you write this book?</v>

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.270
What was the motivation for doing this? Yeah.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.110
<v 0>So I'm a, I'm a philosopher by training, um,</v>

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.670
and philosophers have always been kind of really eager to, to invest,

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.730
to test ideas and try to weed out weed out the bad ones. That's,

7
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:23.220
that's kinda what we philosophers do.

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.810
And a lot of times that doesn't make us particularly popular. Um,

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.030
but I argue in the book that the philosophical method of bullet belief testing

10
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:35.310
called SETA Socratic method, right?

11
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:40.170
Famous process pioneered by a Greek philosopher thousands of years ago.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
Basically if you test ideas with questions and then toss out the ones that don't

13
00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:45.810
withstand scrutiny,

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
that's a way to strengthen your mind's resistance to bad ideas.

15
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.310
Um, so, so here's the, here's the kind of the skinny on this.

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.540
And I think that the people who get this concept are going to be the thought

17
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:02.940
leaders of the next few decades. Um,

18
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.510
we know our bodies have immune systems and their job is to hunt down

19
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.040
parasites and pathogens and eliminate them.

20
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.540
And some of those antibodies actually consume

21
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.790
pathogens in our body. Now, the new information,

22
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.370
which is just now coming together in salt,

23
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.390
in philosophy and in the sciences is that our minds have immune systems,

24
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:34.350
just like our bodies do only a mental immune system.

25
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.700
His job is to hunt down and remove mind parasites

26
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.620
or bad ideas.

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.360
Never seen you speechless before.

28
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.910
<v 1>I'm not speechless. I just didn't know if you were done with your sentence.</v>

29
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.110
I understand that the mind parasites can

30
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.260
ruin your mind and that these, uh,

31
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.310
the concept of mental immunity of some, some sort of mental immune system,

32
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:02.460
but like what, what kind of mental immune system are you talking about?

33
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:05.100
Are you talking about meditation? Are you talking about, uh,

34
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.200
a specific way of addressing issues and problems and how do you factor in things

35
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.190
like emotions?

36
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.880
<v 0>Yeah. So let me start simple with a little thought experiment.</v>

37
00:02:14.881 --> 00:02:17.970
Maybe play along with me here. So this is kind of a story.

38
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.200
So imagine we are sitting around a bonfire,

39
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.690
tossing back a few beers. Okay. And I say, Hey, Joe reached into the fire there,

40
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.290
grabbed me one of those hot coals and hand it to me. What do you say?

41
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.230
<v 1>I say, I'm not really interested in doing that, Andy.</v>

42
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.670
<v 0>Okay, good. And, and what, what, what, what,</v>

43
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.050
what went on in your head that made you say.

44
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.040
<v 1>That? Uh, it seems like I'd get injured doing that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.180
<v 0>So you ran a little simulation in your mind and you concluded that</v>

46
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:52.440
that would be harmful. Yes. Right. That was your mind immune system at work.

47
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.060
That simulation run. So basically I was serving up an idea, a suggestion, Hey,

48
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.580
Joe, do this for me. You a little simulation in your mind,

49
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.900
you identified that idea as a bad one. You,

50
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.710
your mind's immune system was strong enough and well-functioning enough to spot

51
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:12.460
this bad idea and you came out, you, Andy, reach into the fire and.

52
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.670
<v 1>Go that hard. And that's true.</v>

53
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.700
<v 0>I'm just trying to, I'm just trying to think, try to speak.</v>

54
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.410
<v 1>Is that my language? Okay. I might say that if we're in front of the fire,</v>

55
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:28.090
honestly, I mean, be like, Hey man, you. Um, but yeah, I see,

56
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.070
I see what you're saying. So, but how do you,

57
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.950
but it seems a little bit more complicated when you're addressing ideas,

58
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.470
because one of the problems with these ideas is, uh,

59
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.050
some of them were very attractive. Yes. You know,

60
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.940
like I was watching the dumbest video yesterday where

61
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.870
people were thinking that when they're getting the, uh, COVID vaccine,

62
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.990
that they're getting microchipped and they're approving it with magnets,

63
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.360
they were sticking magnets on themselves.

64
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.050
And the magnets were clinging to the area where they got the COVID shot.

65
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.930
<v 0>And they were from this, they were.</v>

66
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.080
<v 1>Concluding that you're getting microchipped and then somehow, or another,</v>

67
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.990
this magnet was being held in place. So I.

68
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.690
<v 0>Take it. You would call it, you would think of that as a mine parasite.</v>

69
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.610
<v 1>I don't know what that is. I mean, I think it's a, it's either a hoax or.</v>

70
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.710
<v 0>How about a conspiracy theory? Can we go there?</v>

71
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.500
So let me tell you a second story. So our first example, there was a, uh,

72
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.730
of your mind mental immune system functioning properly to spot a bad idea and

73
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:27.180
say, Nope, you're not welcome here. Right, right.

74
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.260
Now let's take an example of a mental immune system misfiring. Okay. All right.

75
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.650
So, um, this is a story about Fred, the flat earth.

76
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.870
So Fred dies. He goes to heaven. St. Peter meets me at the pearly gates.

77
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.140
He says, come on in Fred, you're our lucky customer number 100.

78
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.930
You get a chance to chat with God. Wow.

79
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.340
So Fred marches right in to God's inner sanctum and says,

80
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.970
so God, I've been a conspiracy theorist, my whole life, a flat earth,

81
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.000
or my whole life I got to know, is the world flat?

82
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.910
Or is it round God shakes?

83
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.540
His head does a face Palm and says, I'm sorry to say Fred,

84
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.520
but the world is very round Fred's face register shock,

85
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.860
and then recognition. And he said,

86
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.320
this conspiracy theory goes higher than I thought.

87
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.503
<v 1>Ah, ah,</v>

88
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.720
That's probably exactly what they would do too well. And especially.

89
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.990
<v 0>The flat earth or well, and what does this joke,</v>

90
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.190
tell us about the conspiracy mentality, right.

91
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:33.100
And you say that's exactly what it would do because I think you understand

92
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:34.600
something about conspiracy thinking,

93
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.060
which is that a conspiracy theory infected mind becomes

94
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:45.010
so good at generating antibodies to fight back against

95
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.950
even good information that it'll,

96
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.020
that those antibodies will attack the good information.

97
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:52.810
So here's God telling you the truth right. In your mind. And,

98
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.190
and Fred's mental antibodies just rush in and add,

99
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.240
dismiss it as part of a even deeper conspiracy that that's.

100
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.140
So, so questions, doubts, suspicions. Those are the mines,

101
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.090
the mines antibodies, all right. And they can go nuts. They can,

102
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.990
they can go on hyper active, um,

103
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.560
in the same way that the body's immune system can go haywire and attack your

104
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.423
body itself.

105
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.710
Your mind's immune system can go haywire and your questions and your doubts and

106
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.410
your suspicions can attack your mind. Okay.

107
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.220
<v 1>Um, um, I think one of the problems with, uh,</v>

108
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.160
conspiracy theories and people that believe, uh,

109
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.990
foolish things is that they don't really seek the truth.

110
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.010
They seek something that confirms what they want to be true,

111
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.040
and they ignore things to the contrary.

112
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.470
<v 0>And there's even a word,</v>

113
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.250
psychologists have a word for this called confirmation bias. Right.

114
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.970
I'm sure you've heard of it. Um, yeah, it, it feels good to be validated.

115
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.690
And so a lot of times we come to a belief that makes us comfortable.

116
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:03.230
That feels good to us. And then we just seek out information that confirms it,

117
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.800
but we actually dismiss or ignore or, uh,

118
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.590
diminish anything that might conflict with it.

119
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.500
But the problem is that'll send you down a rabbit hole.
