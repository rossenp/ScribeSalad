1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, you should tell Joe about how the,</v>

2
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:10.080
the government program Allsop was created directly because George wrote this

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.290
book about a little place called skin Walker ranch with the government was

4
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:17.480
studying this property that happened because of his books,

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
some DIA guys, what you should tell the story of the place. Yeah. But you, yeah,

6
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.150
right. Yeah. Yes.

7
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.650
<v 1>Yeah. I think you got to, I think you've got a little.</v>

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.240
<v 0>Misled on, tell him, tell him how the governments that he had started,</v>

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.150
you know, from your work. It's fascinating. Some.

10
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.130
<v 1>Of it, some of it stems back to Lasar.</v>

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.220
So we did that story and the series in 89,

12
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.250
1 of the first people to call me after that was a guy I'd never heard of before

13
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:46.040
named Robert Bigelow, a billionaire, he calls me up and says,

14
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:49.130
I was really interested in that I've been interested in UFO's for a long time.

15
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.030
Can I help you? Meaning can he help fund me? I said, I work for a TV station.

16
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:55.850
I don't need any help, but he was not to be deterred.

17
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:58.130
He then reached out to Lasar. They had a little,

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.490
he started meeting with them and, and pumping up for information.

19
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.360
And that really amplified, uh, Bigelow's lifelong interest in it.

20
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.770
He created something called knits, the national Institute for discovery science,

21
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:14.750
which he, he made a science advisory board of the best and the brightest in the,

22
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:17.420
both the UFO field and the field of consciousness.

23
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.820
So they're looking at two questions. Is there,

24
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.070
is there life elsewhere in the universe? Is it here?

25
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.160
And it is a do humans survive after death.

26
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.050
And he assembled this board, a former CIA guys,

27
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.010
two former astronauts men who had walked on the moon, Dr. Edgar Mitchell,

28
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.070
Dr. Hell, put off physicists, um, psychologists, uh,

29
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.180
really a brilliant little think tank to take on these two topics.

30
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.930
I was allowed to be a fly on the wall for some of it, not all of it, but some,

31
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.210
and I told Harry Reed about it, uh, in 1996. And he said, can I go?

32
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.900
And so he showed up and sat in on the meetings and he was kind of hooked.

33
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.220
Harry Reed was the first person I told about Bob Lasar outside of our newsroom.

34
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.780
When I, before we aired the stories he had,

35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.640
I'd known him since he first ran for Congress in 1982,

36
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.930
then he becomes Senate majority leader. So he had always had an interest in it,

37
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.500
but he didn't want it to be known publicly that does not help your re-election

38
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.860
chances. So in 2005,

39
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.960
we write the book about skin Walker, ranch needs. That team bought the ranch.

40
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.620
They were on the property for seven or eight years at that point and had

41
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.110
hundreds of different incidents that they investigated.

42
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.160
They approached it like scientists would, they looked for prosaic explanations.

43
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:35.180
They look for gravity anomalies. They look for, look for psychoactive plants.

44
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.450
Could there be hallucinations caused by magic mushrooms or something?

45
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.710
Are the witnesses lying?

46
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.190
They investigated the background of the family that lived there and they found

47
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:47.660
out that they, it could not be explained that all the range of activity there.

48
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.180
So it was not only you have activity we're talking well,

49
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.780
we starts with UFO's because that's what got their attention. The,

50
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:58.460
you went to basin in Northeastern. Utah has always been a UFO hotspot.

51
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.920
Everybody lives there basically has seen them balls of light orbs,

52
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.570
structured craft daylight, nighttime in 1976,

53
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.130
a guy named Dr. Frank Solsbury, uh, wrote a book about it, the Utah UFO display.

54
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:16.330
And he took hundreds of these cases that have been collected by the locals.

55
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.450
There was a local science teacher named junior Hicks, who,

56
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.270
because he had taught generations of kids, uh,

57
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.420
science in that area when they people would see UFO's,

58
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:28.960
they'd call up junior Hicks. And he went, men go and investigate them.

59
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:31.300
And he had had hundreds and hundreds of files.

60
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.750
He gave them over to this guy Solsbury who wrote a book about it. And he said,

61
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.760
these are real, you know, they're going on.

62
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.950
But junior Hicks would disregard any high strangeness cases that came along with

63
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:46.240
the UFO's, anything weird, Bigfoot, ghosts, anything like that.

64
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.010
He thought it was too incredible. And he,

65
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:50.980
and he discarded that Bigelow buys the ranch.

66
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.890
He hears about these stories going on on this one,

67
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:56.230
property flies in meets with a rancher.

68
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.310
And by this time that rancher and his family had lived on the ranch for 20

69
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.490
months. And they were so scared that he,

70
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:07.120
his wife and his two kids were all sleeping at night on the floor,

71
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:10.810
in the same room, because it had messed with him so badly. Um,

72
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.210
their property had had ghost type activity. Poulter guys kind of things,

73
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.940
trickster activity. Uh, for example,

74
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:22.540
the wife goes shopping to the grocery store. She buys it,

75
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.420
all this food comes back, uh, puts it on the table,

76
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.400
takes out and puts it in the shelves. Leaves.

77
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.770
The room comes back in all the foods back in the bag.

78
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.530
She would take a shower in the morning locks,

79
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:36.760
the door puts a towel and a hairbrush on the cabinet gets out of the shower

80
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.600
door, still locked, hairbrush and towel are gone. Dad's out in the field.

81
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.160
He is digging a post hole using a post hole Digger, happy piece of equipment.

82
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.840
He stops for a second wipes.

83
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:50.950
His brow looks back and it's gone and they find it two weeks later up in a tree.

84
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.150
They start hearing voices at night and in the air speaking a strange language,

85
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.350
they start seeing shapes, um, outside the window at night, big lurking,

86
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:02.260
humanoid shapes, hearing heavy footsteps outside,

87
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.420
then hearing heavy footsteps inside.

88
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.590
Then their animals started being mutilated cows, uh,

89
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.430
would the tracks would lead out into the snow and then just be gone.

90
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.860
Cabs mutilated cut up with surgical precision cats, uh, wiped out, cut up,

91
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.840
carved up dogs that were vaporized hundreds of these incidents. Um,

92
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.880
they, they would see holes in the sky like a great big hole in the sky

93
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.960
and things flying in and out of it. Now this rancher college educated guy,

94
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.550
grounded, uh,

95
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.930
strict religious guy thinks the government is trying to run him off his

96
00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:40.450
property. So he's out there at night lurking with a gun,

97
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:42.910
trying to catch whatever government agents are doing this stuff.

98
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.820
And it's not government agents. It was something else.

99
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.730
They start seeing UFO's of all shapes and sizes.

100
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.700
The first one they saw was like a, they thought it was a Winnebago.

101
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.540
This ranch is a beautiful place. Um, and it only has one way in.

102
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:56.374
And one way out,

103
00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.200
they see these two lights that look like headlights down in the third homestead.

104
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.100
How did this guy get past the house here and get down there? He must be stuck.

105
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.730
Let's go down and help him out. The lights start coming toward he and his son.

106
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.430
Then they go up into the sky, up over the trees and then gone. Um,

107
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.530
these different kinds of orbs, uh,

108
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.150
the white ones that were intelligently controlled, not fireflies, not bugs, uh,

109
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.720
blue ones that would go. They seem to touch the,

110
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.720
the fear center in your brain. They'd get near them.

111
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.130
They look like a little bigger than a soft ball made out of glass with a

112
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:34.190
swirling blue liquid, scared the hell out of the animals.

113
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.760
And then it scared the hell out of the, the,

114
00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:39.350
the people to this literally drove them to their knees with fear,

115
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.170
these red orbs that would stampede the cattle.

116
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.730
They lost so many cattle that they began to think that they were going to go

117
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.820
under. They had these four prized bowls. I know I'm jumping around,

118
00:06:49.821 --> 00:06:54.200
but there's a lot of stories that these four prized bulls, 2000 pounds,

119
00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.610
each behemoths very expensive animals because they were raising seven tall

120
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:03.530
cattle, had them in the, in the, uh, corral and the, the husband and wife.

121
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.590
They always felt like they're being watched. He says to the wife,

122
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.070
as they're driving to town, man, if something happens to one of those bulls,

123
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.030
we'll go wonder will be done. They come back a half an hour later,

124
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.240
all four of the bulls are gone. They jump out, they're freaking out.

125
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:19.220
Where did they go? Did somebody steal them? Are there?

126
00:07:19.221 --> 00:07:23.780
Rustlers looking around all over the place in this corral is a metal trailer

127
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.860
where they used to store, uh, tools. And there's only one door into it.

128
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.650
And it's raw. It's locked with this heavy piece of wire.

129
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.860
The door is still locked. The wire is still on there.

130
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.960
The guy just as a last resort,

131
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:40.760
he looks into the grading on top of a trailer and there's the four bowls inside.

132
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:43.460
Door's still locked. They're all crammed in there.

133
00:07:43.461 --> 00:07:44.780
Now you could take a forklift.

134
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.080
You could have a team of 50 people and they couldn't get those bulls in that

135
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:53.000
trailer. But there, there were, he yells to his wife, Hey honey,

136
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.930
they're in here. And when he says that the bulls wake up as if out of a,

137
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.790
a trance kick the door down and all got out the needs team,

138
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.390
which had been on the property for a couple of years. At that point, um,

139
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.770
fly in. They had been in Las Vegas. They fly back in, they look around,

140
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.170
they check out the animals. The whole corral,

141
00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:14.180
which has made out of metal had been magnetized.

142
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.740
So whatever technology was used to get those bulls from the corral into that

143
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:22.370
trailer left a magnetic signature. They were there on the property,

144
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.790
the knits guys for several years, Bigelow owned it for 20 years,

145
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.900
but eventually they gave up whatever this thing was, this intelligence,

146
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.990
it did not like being stocked and it played tricks on them.

147
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.560
And they never made the stuff public because what are you going to do?

148
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:40.190
Write a paper about this. Who's going to print it. You can't make a, uh,

149
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.020
a documentary about it. Cause.

150
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.620
<v 2>They weren't there with cameras. Evidence. Well, well,</v>

151
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:48.850
all this we're saying those cattle mutilations, I guess that's some evidence,

152
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:53.110
but that's the only evidence of cows and we can mutilate cows. What,

153
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.730
what about all this other stuff? Like for the.

154
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.700
<v 1>First months when the rancher is there,</v>

155
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.450
they don't have any evidence because he's not a paranormal investigator. Um,

156
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.360
they're not taking photos or something. They want it to go away.

157
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.930
So they don't have any evidence of that except for what the rancher told them.

158
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.560
But then they talked to the larger community and the same thing has been

159
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:11.760
happening to all the neighbors.

160
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:16.290
The guy that lives next door had lost all these cattle as well. Sees the craft.

161
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.770
Sometimes these craft would float around.

162
00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.560
They looked like a stealth fighters with Christmas lights around them floating

163
00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.190
around silently. Again, I guarantee everyone else. No, not really. I mean,

164
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.110
so Bigelow puts up cameras all over the property and you

165
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.710
have them focused here where some activity had happened before.

166
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.160
The thing moves over here. Uh, you, you move the pop,

167
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.270
the cameras and focus there. It goes away toward the end of the study,

168
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.250
whatever it was that was there ripped the one of these cameras would re rip the

169
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:51.000
shreds. If they're up on top of a telephone pole, 30,

170
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:54.780
40 feet in the air and there's wires that are secured all the way down the

171
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:58.200
telephone pole. And they noticed that one of their cameras goes out.

172
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.160
They figure, well,

173
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.920
there was another camera on another pole that should have a view of whatever it

174
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:04.980
was that tore this up. Some kind of animal, whatever. Well,

175
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:09.720
whatever it was was invisible. And I know it's very frustrating.

176
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.830
It certainly was for them. And for me to try to write about it in that, uh,

177
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.520
this thing didn't want to be caught. It wanted to demonstrate it,

178
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:19.890
that it was there, but it didn't want to have evidence.

179
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.290
The calf that was mutilated was in, I know it's, it's,

180
00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.780
it's a lot to handle the calf that was mutilated. It was a Sunday morning.

181
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.570
It's 10. O'clock on a quiet morning. It's daylight.

182
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:33.240
The rancher and his wife are there by themselves.

183
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.910
They're tagging newborn calves, tagged their ears.

184
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.870
And they tagged this one right by the ranch house, 50 yards from their home.

185
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.900
And they go off across the property. It's a clear day.

186
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:47.430
It's unobstructed that their dog is with them and makes a noise that points them

187
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:51.630
back toward that first calf that they had, uh, tagged. And the,

188
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.340
and the dog indicates that something's wrong.

189
00:10:53.341 --> 00:10:57.780
And they see the mom cow is dragging its leg and going around in a semi-circle

190
00:10:57.930 --> 00:11:00.270
it's in distress. They go running back over there.

191
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.080
And this calf had been completely stripped of flesh, nothing left,

192
00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:05.940
but hide and bone.

193
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.140
And one of the femur bones had been ripped out and thrown on the side. Well,

194
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:13.200
they call in the needs guys. They bring in trackers. There are no tracks.

195
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.310
There is no human tracks. No, no vehicle tracks, no animal tracks.

196
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.590
The thing had been completely stripped of blood.

197
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:24.330
There's not a drop of blood on the ground. It's gone 75 pounds of meat gone.

198
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.490
Again. It's a time period of 30 minutes. Um,

199
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.180
is there a team of commandos that comes in and does that, uh, special forces go?

200
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:34.223
Yeah.

201
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.400
<v 2>And there's, this is there's evidence of this. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

202
00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:40.220
Can we see that? Yeah. Where is it?

203
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.350
<v 0>I made it, I made a movie called hockey. The skin Walker it's it's in there.</v>

204
00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:46.670
Right? Is that the only place?

205
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.700
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. It's probably, it's probably a, some other places. There's photos.</v>

206
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.380
<v 0>On video. I mean, I I'm with you, man. What's.</v>

207
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.030
<v 2>The speculation about like, why,</v>

208
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.290
why would they do this and why would they do the cattle mutilations? Like,

209
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.270
what is, is there any speculation?

210
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.120
<v 1>Some, uh, so some of it is a demonstration. I mean,</v>

211
00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:08.460
it seemed to be a demonstration to get their attention.

212
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.050
This trickster element has been reported in other places around the world. Uh,

213
00:12:13.051 --> 00:12:17.370
there's no hotspot, quite like skin Walker. And I know how weird it sounds.

214
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.920
There is no spotlight that because it's never,

215
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.050
there's no spot that's been studied to that extent.

216
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.680
The needs guys were there for well, big loan.

217
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:27.660
The property for 20 years needs was active for seven or eight.

218
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:32.700
Then another secret study funded by the government came in under an organization

219
00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:36.360
called bass. Um, that was the money that Reed got.

220
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.630
You got $22 million. It went to Bigelow as a contract.

221
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.530
And they hired all these people and fanned out all over the world to try to find

222
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:46.740
UFO information, but other related phenomena,

223
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.690
things that wouldn't seem normally to be, uh, connected to UFO's, but which are,

224
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.790
uh, a guy from the DIA had read the book and became interested.

225
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.230
And he asked for permission to go to the property. This guy's a double PhD,

226
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.460
a brilliant rocket scientist who had seen it and thought there were national

227
00:13:05.461 --> 00:13:07.470
security implications, the hole in the sky,

228
00:13:07.471 --> 00:13:09.600
in particular with things coming in and out,

229
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.720
he wondered if someone was using technology to make these things,

230
00:13:12.721 --> 00:13:14.880
film that hole in the sky. No, again,

231
00:13:14.881 --> 00:13:18.840
that's when the rancher is there by himself. So he's not, it's not a UFO guy.

232
00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:19.590
He's not trying to.

233
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.120
<v 2>I understand. Um, but is there any evidence of anything weird,</v>

234
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.700
anything other than mutilated cows?

235
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.610
<v 1>Well, let's see the,</v>

236
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:34.020
the video of the camera that was torn up by something invisible.

237
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.100
They had something that did.

238
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.220
<v 2>So in the video, you could see the camera being torn apart. You.</v>

239
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.710
<v 1>Can't see anything. You can't, there's nothing.</v>

240
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.670
You can't see anything you can see before it happens. Uh,

241
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:45.960
it's normal and afterward.

242
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.100
<v 2>I think you're humble. It's time is taking place between before and yeah.</v>

243
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.410
<v 1>I can't remember, but I mean, could that be hoaxed yeah. If Bigelow wanted to,</v>

244
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.770
but again, they weren't there too in the beginning, at least for niches,

245
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.150
they weren't there to, uh, to try to prove that aliens are visiting.

246
00:14:03.151 --> 00:14:06.330
They're just trying to figure out why all this weird stuff is happening in one

247
00:14:06.331 --> 00:14:09.330
spot. It mixes in a lot of, uh,

248
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.300
native American lore that got mixed in the picture.

249
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.960
But it's been going on in that you went to basin for 200 years.

250
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.180
Why don't know. I mean.

251
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.330
<v 0>Our government has studied the medic. So like, what is evidence?</v>

252
00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:22.920
It's so frustrating to me too,

253
00:14:22.921 --> 00:14:26.700
when I was introduced to the skin Walker thing through George man,

254
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.790
I I'm with you. Like, what's the evidence what's going on.

255
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.780
The weight of evidence is when you talk to people in the area and they all have

256
00:14:33.781 --> 00:14:37.860
these commonalities, some people died of exotic cancers from burns,

257
00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:40.500
from above where lights came down and hit them. And that's evidence,

258
00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:44.880
their face is completely irradiated and they died. So there's the cows.

259
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.700
Yeah. So you have a scientist like Dr. Colin.

260
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.830
<v 2>Hold on for a second. That's where they found it though. Look at that.</v>

261
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.480
Just what in the con th that is so crazy. Now,

262
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.990
did they scan the area to look for another spot where it could have been

263
00:14:59.991 --> 00:15:01.610
slaughtered before it was moved to this area?

264
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.750
<v 1>Well, that's what they concluded is it had to have been taken somewhere and</v>

265
00:15:04.751 --> 00:15:06.760
slaughtered and then brought back. But who does.

266
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.720
<v 2>That little larger please? Can you just, um, zoom in on that?</v>

267
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.690
Because that doesn't look very surgical to me that looks click wolves.

268
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.880
<v 1>Yeah, it was there's no sisters.</v>

269
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:16.900
<v 0>Oh.</v>

270
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.370
They actually did an analysis and it was done with two types of metallic tools.

271
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.950
<v 2>But look at all the jagged edges, they.</v>

272
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.580
<v 1>Said they, so they took samples and they send them to, to pathology labs.</v>

273
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:31.690
Didn't tell the guys what they're looking for. You tell us what you can see.

274
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.380
And they, the pathologist said that two instruments had been used.

275
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:38.680
One was a heavy machete type instrument that had been hacked.

276
00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.940
And then there is a scalpel that had surgically removed a lot of the flesh

277
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.230
underneath, but it looks.

278
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.130
<v 2>Like something killed it. And then they moved it to that spot. I mean,</v>

279
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.570
if I had to guess the way it's eaten though, I mean, it looks like, well.

280
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.290
<v 1>There's no teeth marks. There are metallic marks, the metal teeth.</v>

281
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.080
<v 2>Mark, a slice sliced.</v>

282
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.540
And so something sharp sliced.

283
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:06.460
<v 0>It. So I think the bigger point is this was happening on this ranch with owners</v>

284
00:16:06.461 --> 00:16:10.510
prior to owners, prior to owners, I got to talk to a lot of people.

285
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:15.310
So here's the deal, the connection of this. So George does this thing.

286
00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.140
He reports on this for 20 years that the government is now studying this ranch,

287
00:16:20.141 --> 00:16:24.070
right? Because of deployment or because of all this weird stuff,

288
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.540
why is the government spending money through OSS app to study this ranch and

289
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:29.111
other things?

290
00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:33.280
And that's where it gets really interesting what happens after with our

291
00:16:33.281 --> 00:16:35.320
government programs. So that's what you do. This.

292
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:40.390
<v 2>Is before we get to that, this image, like the jagged edges around the rib cage,</v>

293
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.710
that's supposedly sliced. That looks like hack hacked. Okay.

294
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.160
<v 0>I mean, look, it could, let's say it's people doing this, you know,</v>

295
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.700
to farmers to get them out of there. Let's say it's some program. I mean,

296
00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.970
although the cattle mutilation thing, you gave me a stack of documents,

297
00:16:54.971 --> 00:16:57.610
this big has been studied by the FBI.

298
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.710
It was it's happened all over the country. No one has ever been caught,

299
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.170
not a single person,

300
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:09.790
more than 10,000 cases with all the same types of cuts. I mean, this is not, no,

301
00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:10.570
I I've seen.

302
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.270
<v 2>A lot of that. It's really weird there. Isn't really weird.</v>

303
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.760
And the lack of blood is the weirdest part of it.

304
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:20.260
Cause if you see like what makes sense to me, um,

305
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.030
is that something killed that they, they butchered it.

306
00:17:25.031 --> 00:17:26.590
They chopped all the meat off of it.

307
00:17:26.591 --> 00:17:30.670
And then they removed the carcass from that area and dropped it off there. Yeah.

308
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.730
That's what it looks like. If I had to guess is what mids thinks.

309
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.560
There's no way that it was killed right there because you're seeing fresh,

310
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.740
clean hay underneath it everywhere. There's no blood,

311
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:43.570
which doesn't make any sense at all.

312
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.540
<v 0>I think the question is, is this a government program? Is this something,</v>

313
00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:49.470
or is this a scare tactic? It's been happening since the fifties?

314
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.400
Like what a weird.

315
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.150
<v 2>Scare tactic.</v>

316
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:54.690
It's a click on that one below at Jamie that the brown one with the green. Yeah,

317
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:57.750
that one please. Thank you. That's that's a weird one too.

318
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:02.550
Like this is like a whole cutout and there's a bunch of these they've found all

319
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:05.850
over the country and weirdness like Oregon's removed,

320
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.420
but the weirdest part about it is it's almost always, there's no blood.

321
00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.100
<v 0>Just investigated one, which I never thought I would do,</v>

322
00:18:13.101 --> 00:18:15.920
but I got a call from a guy in Texas to see it physically. Yeah.

323
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.090
So right before lockdown, I go out and I'm like, this is so wild.

324
00:18:20.091 --> 00:18:22.280
I got to check this out. The guy calls me.

325
00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:25.610
It's a pretty Freshy one at this point. Now I'm no expert,

326
00:18:25.611 --> 00:18:28.520
but I went and got samples and took them to labs and this sort of thing to see

327
00:18:28.521 --> 00:18:32.480
if there were tools used. So you got here's my, did you get my pictures of this?

328
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.810
It on your phone? I'll show you after I got on my phone. Yeah.

329
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.050
So I got ready for great photos. Weird.

330
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.243
<v 2>Listen, man.</v>

331
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:44.180
Airdrop them to me now and we'll send them to Jamie and we'll put it up on the

332
00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:44.990
screen so other.

333
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.370
<v 0>People could see it. Okay. So let me, after the show is not going to help.</v>

334
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.581
<v 1>While you're looking.</v>

335
00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:53.600
I'll tell him about one of the theories about the academy relations that Dr.

336
00:18:53.601 --> 00:18:56.330
Keller, her doctor, Colin Keller developed was that the,

337
00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.160
somebody is tracking the spread of like mad cow freons through the food

338
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:01.970
supply.

339
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.720
And that they'd been doing it under the guise of UFO's since no one would take

340
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:10.280
UFO's and cattle mutilation, seriously, they just do it in helicopters.

341
00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:14.360
And there, instead of just stealing these cattle, they're tracking how far this,

342
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:19.400
these indestructable prions travel through the food supply because it's in a

343
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.110
cattle it's in pigs, it gets, uh,

344
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.930
fed into chickens and things of that and feed it's in deer. Uh,

345
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.710
it's called chronic wasting disease. And in some circles, it's.

346
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:33.830
<v 2>Just weird. Well, just wasting diseases. Isn't that a,</v>

347
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.820
that's a different prion disease then I'm mad.

348
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.680
<v 1>Well, it's a variation Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, I think too. So, um,</v>

349
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.070
the same kinds of things in different species, um,

350
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.640
it is indestructable again. So you hit a deer,

351
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.750
that's got this and you grind it up and you feed it to pigs, the pigs, get it.

352
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.340
Yeah. And then, um,

353
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.310
and then it could be passed on to other species and it shows up in different

354
00:19:58.311 --> 00:20:01.790
ways. Kelleher was exploring the idea. Well, whether or not it,

355
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.110
it might be the cause of Alzheimer's or a version of mad cow in humans.

356
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.550
Do you, um.

357
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.210
<v 0>They're all going to you right now. This is, this is a recent, oh,</v>

358
00:20:11.211 --> 00:20:14.180
it says downloading. So, oh, I'm downloading them.

359
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.640
<v 2>And then, okay. Right, right, right. Are you on the wifi?</v>

360
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.320
<v 0>No, but it's coming through here. It's about to go to you. It says waiting.</v>

361
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.940
Okay. Got it. Yeah. I mean,

362
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:26.580
I guess this does highlight because this is my very limited amount of,

363
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.640
can you send those to Jamie, to Jamie? [inaudible] yeah. Sorry.

364
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.650
<v 2>Should should've had to do that right away. It's ready to roll.</v>

365
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.420
Is airdrop is open.

366
00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.190
<v 0>I don't see you bro, bro. Hold on there year ago, young Jamie.</v>

367
00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.750
<v 2>So this is, um, this is the stuff that you physically encountered.</v>

368
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.860
Okay.

369
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.240
You physically saw this and I'm looking at these images right now and we're

370
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:53.230
going to show them short in a second. And this is a, you said Texas? Yeah.

371
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.300
Where in Texas? Um.

372
00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.270
<v 0>Gosh, what was the name of it in the panhandle? I'm yeah. I'm blanking.</v>

373
00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.690
So, so here's the deal. Oh yeah, that's it.

374
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.630
So I made the movie based on George's work of

375
00:21:09.631 --> 00:21:11.610
the same title, hunt hunt for the skin Walker. Right.

376
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.590
And that movie was telling this story about how the United States government was

377
00:21:16.591 --> 00:21:20.100
studying this property land because of UFO's and weird stuff.

378
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.660
That and weird stuff included things like cattle pull up this one.

379
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.180
<v 2>There's a lot of weird images, man. This, uh, the,</v>

380
00:21:28.181 --> 00:21:30.600
the skin removed around the face.

381
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.640
<v 0>Right? So this was my, this is my first chance to see this for myself.</v>

382
00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.230
Cause last time I was on your show, it was the,

383
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:41.790
the ones in Oregon had just happened up at that ranch. And I thought, well,

384
00:21:41.791 --> 00:21:46.110
okay, if I'm ever going to do it, now's the time to do it. So I go,

385
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.950
I get this call now, remind you, this is a rancher. This is like,

386
00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.680
this is their livelihood. It's this huge,

387
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.530
huge area of land stop right there.

388
00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:00.330
There are very religious community. Nobody.

389
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.860
We go out to the middle of this land and in the middle,

390
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.730
there's this dead cow, no blood, no blood.

391
00:22:08.731 --> 00:22:10.240
And he had seen it prior. And,

392
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:14.640
and the reason he called me is because in my movie you could see the special

393
00:22:14.641 --> 00:22:18.030
kind of slice, like a jagged slice that is common to these types of things.

394
00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:20.610
They think are real mutilations. And he is looking at it. He's like,

395
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.210
that's exactly like in the movie. And this is a straight shooter.

396
00:22:24.211 --> 00:22:27.270
He's a religious guy. He had to ask his pastor. If he could even like,

397
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.320
go on camera with me, it freaks him out. So he sees this.

398
00:22:31.321 --> 00:22:32.970
Now he sees dead animals all the time. And.

399
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.310
<v 2>He saw this cow, you said before.</v>

400
00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.020
<v 0>Accidentally he was out shooting BB guns with his kid and he's on this big part</v>

401
00:22:40.021 --> 00:22:40.291
of land.

402
00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:44.190
And he sees this down bull and he goes over to it and he's looking at it.

403
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.760
And it's unlike anything he has ever seen in all of his years before it had

404
00:22:47.761 --> 00:22:52.380
surgical cuts. There is no doubt somebody killed,

405
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.930
cut up this animal. Would those classic like the ear gone, uh,

406
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:02.490
two types of tools, like a scissor type. But by the way, I tried to cut it.

407
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.870
It is not easy to cut.

408
00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:08.640
So they had sharp tools and then there's like a very thin slice type

409
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.490
kind of cut. So I got to take it, get samples,

410
00:23:11.491 --> 00:23:15.720
take them to labs and try to see what type of tools did this.

411
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:20.550
How did they do this with no blood on the ground and all the soil around it was

412
00:23:20.551 --> 00:23:23.190
dead. So I was like, well, why is it all dead? Is that a natural thing?

413
00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.670
So I took soil samples and took them to a lab. And again, I'm outside of my,

414
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:32.430
this is weird to me, but I think it's a real phenomenon.

415
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.020
Somebody is killing these animals. However you want to say it.

416
00:23:37.021 --> 00:23:37.741
Some things,

417
00:23:37.741 --> 00:23:42.630
someone is killing these animals in a highly specified technical way that

418
00:23:42.631 --> 00:23:47.570
has been repeated since the fifties on our FBI has studied

419
00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:48.260
it.

420
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.760
He has shown me so many reports of these in association with discs

421
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.713
saucers.

422
00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.850
<v 2>This guy have any association with disks or software.</v>

423
00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:01.660
<v 0>No, he's just a guy that owns the, they just found.</v>

424
00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.800
<v 2>This cattle free weirdly, weirdly mutual. Somebody killed it.</v>

425
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.580
<v 0>Yeah. And he's like, is this demonic? Is this some sort of Satanist thing?</v>

426
00:24:09.581 --> 00:24:11.950
And I said, I don't think so, man, this goes back in history.

427
00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.300
<v 2>Okay. Like I'm looking at the cuts is specifically, they're very unimpressive.</v>

428
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.550
What? That does. It doesn't look like a laser.

429
00:24:18.551 --> 00:24:22.510
Did it or some how long it'll be sharp scalpel. No.

430
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.380
<v 0>It was like a, it was like a cerated. One was a cerated tool and the other,</v>

431
00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:27.070
that's the thing.

432
00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.350
<v 2>I'm saying. It's like something that we could do. Oh.</v>

433
00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.710
<v 0>Absolutely. We'd have to somehow do it though. On,</v>

434
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.920
in Texas land where the guy would shoot you in the face.

435
00:24:35.921 --> 00:24:38.500
If you go and try to touch one of his casts, that's the other thing.

436
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.820
No one's ever been caught. Never since what's weird. Yeah. It's weird.

437
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.670
<v 1>It's frustrating too. I mean, I've been to the ranch,</v>

438
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.390
the skin Walker ranch in the basin, more than two dozen times.

439
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.180
I've never seen anything. I've interviewed the neighbors.

440
00:24:52.181 --> 00:24:53.440
I've interviewed the scientists.

441
00:24:53.441 --> 00:24:56.080
These are PhD level guys who had seen this stuff.

442
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.980
A lot of times they'd have cameras that fail. I mean, it's, you know,

443
00:24:59.981 --> 00:25:03.790
you've heard that story before and this very convenient that it happens just

444
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:05.290
when some giant disk shows up,

445
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.610
but it does happen that their car batteries would die in the same spot. Um,

446
00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:12.670
whatever it was messed with them. And maybe it's humans,

447
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.260
maybe it is human technology,

448
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.690
but no humans were ever found to be doing this stuff.

449
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.180
But needs was there for all those years.

450
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.510
They didn't want to tell anybody about it. They shared the information with me,

451
00:25:22.511 --> 00:25:27.010
but you can't publish it. W w there was no real physical proof.

452
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.880
So they just left it there. And I had tried to do a documentary, ended up,

453
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.850
I talked to him in a, let me write a book about it. But, you know, if,

454
00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.780
if people,

455
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.310
if you're looking for physical evidence and solid proof and they don't have it,

456
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:39.850
you.

457
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:41.950
<v 2>Know, what is the, what's the primary theme?</v>

458
00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.250
Are there any primary theories of why they do this to cows?

459
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:49.390
Why someone's doing this to cows? You know.

460
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.390
<v 0>You need to catch somebody and ask them. I mean, you know, that's, that's,</v>

461
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.540
that's really weird that no one's been caught.
