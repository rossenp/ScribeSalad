00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.543
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.750
That's an interesting thing that I see today that I find really strange is that

4
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:10.050
people that are denying evolutionary biology, I mean,

5
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.250
there's decades of research being done.

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.500
Why people behave the way they behave, what women are attracted to,

7
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:18.600
what men are attracted to and what the spectrum is.

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.940
<v 0>And then they say scientist, racist.</v>

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.660
<v 1>Yeah. That's, what's weird. Science is sexist or your science.</v>

10
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.060
It's fascinating to me when people don't want to look at it because it

11
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.650
doesn't support their ideology.

12
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:36.030
They want to deny all this research deny all these really objective

13
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.100
geniuses that have been studying all this stuff.

14
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.810
And the best minds in the field have come to these conclusions based on just

15
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.390
insurmountable amounts of data.

16
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.260
<v 0>Yeah. So fine. Patriarchy. Yeah. I have a shirt that says I am the patriarchy.</v>

17
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.260
You know, like, no matter what you throw at me, I'm just going to embrace it.

18
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:59.520
I'm gonna show you. Yeah. Israel. There is a patriarchy.

19
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.840
There's also a matriarchy.

20
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.350
You need to handle your matriarchy and stop worrying about the patriarchy.

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.950
Because if you handled your matriarchy, the patriarchy wouldn't be your problem.

22
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.810
The problem is you don't want to be a woman.

23
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.310
<v 1>What do you think is a good piece of advice for women on how to be a woman?</v>

24
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.773
A good piece of.

25
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.733
<v 0>Advice like.</v>

26
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.450
<v 1>Hotep, Hotep teaches women.</v>

27
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.670
<v 0>Hotep teaches women. What's a good emotional control, emotional control.</v>

28
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.170
And uh, so, so the number one problem I see with women is, uh,

29
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.200
um, this is a lot here, right? Um, all right, let's go here. Okay.

30
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.920
Women let their friends, they tell their friends, they business. Yes.

31
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.130
<v 1>Stop that. Stop telling your friends your best stuff.</v>

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.660
<v 0>Like when I have problems with, you know, my girl or, you know, or in the past,</v>

33
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.110
when I had problems with women, I ain't run back. Yo, guess what? Know?

34
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.210
We don't do that.

35
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.020
<v 1>Yeah. If my friends do that, they better be laughing. Right.</v>

36
00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.520
If my friend goes through it,

37
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.350
he's not going to believe with his shake said to me,

38
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.410
if they give me a hard time, but if they go to the new moon,

39
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.490
she wants me to quit my job. Like, Hey, don't do that to me, man.

40
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.260
Put that on me. Yeah.

41
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.340
<v 0>You know? Um, so, so, so I think women also,</v>

42
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.650
you have to understand that they're,

43
00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:20.280
they're giving this information to a friend who is also single.

44
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.760
When a woman gets in a relationship, she loses a friend, right?

45
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.160
Because now you have less time to spend with your bestie.

46
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:28.170
So the besties jealous of the relationship.

47
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.640
So whenever you go back and tell her,

48
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.410
she's never going to give you sound advice.

49
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.220
She's always going to take your side. So you have to judge your friends and say,

50
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:38.190
well, if I'm giving this information to my friend, is he an objective friend?

51
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:40.410
Or is she a subjective friend? She's going to feed my ego.

52
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.990
And if you can't analyze that on your own,

53
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:44.940
then you'll never have peace in your relationship.

54
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.280
Because the worst thing to do is here's the problem.

55
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.720
Then relationships built on trust.

56
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.690
So if a man and a woman coming together and you tell all my business to your

57
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:55.680
friend, where's the trust. Where's our privacy. We have none. Right?

58
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:57.420
We have none. We don't have a relationship.

59
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:00.430
You have a relationship with your friend. So go be with your friend.

60
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.630
I don't got time to be, you know, I, something happens in my personal life.

61
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.470
I'm going to go tell this strange girl what happened in my personal life.

62
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.950
Something I told you that was private to relate it to something else that could

63
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.050
be happening in our relationship. You know what I mean? Yeah.

64
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.000
<v 1>Yeah. But I think we have different instincts.</v>

65
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.610
Women have the instinct to gossip. They love it. It's just,

66
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:22.090
it comes from that hunter gatherer culture, where back in the day,

67
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.170
that's what happened.

68
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.170
The men would go out and try to hunt the food and the women would stay home and

69
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.340
they would talk. Yeah.

70
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.110
<v 0>Absolutely. Yeah. Again, discipline yourself, women. Yeah. Ladies,</v>

71
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.300
another thing, get a hobby. Healthy. One. Women don't have hobbies.

72
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.950
Their hobbies are all consumers.

73
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.270
<v 1>So Amazon don't have hobbies. All of them, not, not all. Oh,</v>

74
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.890
I know women with hobbies, all.

75
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.723
<v 0>Of them.</v>

76
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.940
<v 1>But.</v>

77
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.880
<v 0>You know, in my book I say, you know, say all, cause it gets to people going,</v>

78
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.240
um, get some upset. Yeah. It gets people going. Cause they always go, oh no,

79
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.060
it's some, it's like, I know it's some Jamara, you know what I'm saying?

80
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.800
But I say all just to get people going, but majority women don't have hobbies,

81
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.930
you know, do something that is, uh, cause they're inundated with advertising,

82
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.100
you know, their, their hobbies become consumerism and oh, oh you know,

83
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.730
retail therapy or, you know, I do makeup for fun. No,

84
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.480
you don't do makeup for fun. That's not what you do. That's not a hobby.

85
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.370
Makeup's not a hobby. I'm sorry, ladies.

86
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.090
A hobby is something that develops your, your individual person,

87
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.470
something that makes you better.

88
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.130
<v 1>Some kind of a discipline, right.</v>

89
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.780
<v 0>Some way to express yourself. So.</v>

90
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.790
<v 1>Physical thing that you.</v>

91
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.410
<v 0>Do. Yeah. Like, so like one of my hobbies is chess. Right. That helps me focus.</v>

92
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.280
When I, when I see that my attention span is getting short.

93
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.050
Cause I spent too much time on social media.

94
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.900
I go to chess and I'll spend time on chess to bring that back to reality.

95
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.210
You play.

96
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.100
<v 1>Physical chest or do you play online? Uh.</v>

97
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.840
<v 0>Online. Yeah, I can do OTB but you know, I do most of the TB, uh.</v>

98
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.070
<v 1>Over the board. Oh.</v>

99
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.660
<v 0>What's that? That means physical.</v>

100
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.230
<v 1>Oh, that's how the, that's what you call it. Yeah. Yeah. Do you do speed? Chess?</v>

101
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.210
We, you hit the timer. Do you do regular chess?

102
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.100
<v 0>All on. I do speeches. I do a five minute games. That's impressive.</v>

103
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.200
Yeah. Yeah. It's it's, it's a whole nother one.

104
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.300
<v 1>Scared of chess. I've always been scared of chess.</v>

105
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.170
I have an obsession with games, real problems and chess is, uh,

106
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.930
it's one of I've played it a little bit. Yeah. But I'm like,

107
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.490
this could take over my life.

108
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.850
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, um, uh,</v>

109
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.380
if I'm not careful I'll be sleeping and, and playing chess.

110
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.650
Oh yeah. You know, like sometimes I'll be chilling.

111
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.980
Like we'll be having a conversation and I'll space out and be doing chest

112
00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:40.510
problems in my head. Uh, so that happens sometimes, you know, a lot,

113
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.850
especially on days that I play a lot of chess.

114
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.210
<v 1>I remember Howard stern was really getting a chest and he was taking private</v>

115
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:49.450
lessons. He was talking about all the time and I think he found the same thing.

116
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:52.120
Do you remember that? I think he found the same thing.

117
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.210
I think he just got too obsessed with and was like, I can't do this anymore.

118
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.940
Yeah.

119
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.930
<v 0>Yeah. Well, one of my life goals is to be a chess master one day. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.510
<v 1>And when you say chess master, what do you have to do to be a.</v>

121
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.000
<v 0>Master? Okay. So you have national master,</v>

122
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.920
then you have a international master and then you have a game master or

123
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.980
the GM. I forget what it's called a national master.

124
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.720
You have to participate in. I believe one of the, tournament's one of the, uh,

125
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.060
I forget the Federation. Um,

126
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.600
but you have to enter one of these tournaments and you have to place a certain,

127
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.650
uh, you know, I think it's maybe top two or top three at a certain tournament.

128
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.830
Don't quote me on this stuff, but you have to go through the tournament.

129
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:32.480
And I think in order to become international,

130
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:35.870
you have to first become national master and the national match,

131
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.280
you can go be international if I'm not mistaken. And then, you know, GM.

132
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.380
<v 1>Do you ever see the video of Eddie Fisher or Bobby Fischer when</v>

133
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.690
Bobby Fisher was walking down this row of chess games and he was playing like

134
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.300
10 different games simultaneously? Yeah.

135
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.230
<v 0>Yeah. Um, uh, the, the, the, the champ now, uh,</v>

136
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.720
Carlson does something similar, uh, where Carlson will, uh, play,

137
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.370
you know, several people or help play without a board that always interested me.

138
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.090
<v 1>People do that. This dude I knew who went to prison,</v>

139
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.950
was playing pool holidays, play out in white Plains, executive billiards.

140
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.010
And this kid was a chess master. It's like a 16 year old. I don't know,

141
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:23.510
master muse, chess genius. Right. 16 year old kid. Um,

142
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.180
and he was playing with this dude who was like in his forties,

143
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:29.660
who had been in prison. He learned how to play chess with no board in prison.

144
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.890
So they was just sitting across from each other, talking, saying the moves.

145
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:37.250
And then they would both like recognize where the pieces were on the board.

146
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.480
Really interesting.

147
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.640
<v 0>Yeah. I mean that,</v>

148
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.920
that level of visualization is where humanity has to take itself.

149
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.470
You know, that's why I say chess is great because it allows you to visualize.

150
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.420
And in order to manifest your desires in this world,

151
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:56.870
you have to be able to visualize what you want. The more you can focus,

152
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.760
the more you can visualize the better your mind is I believe because our life

153
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:05.900
is based upon visualization. You see what I'm saying? Um,

154
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.300
uh, women need to get back to that to.

155
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.450
<v 1>Visualizing goals. I think.</v>

156
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:16.820
<v 0>Women are, are very spiritual. So, uh, in Africa it is this,</v>

157
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.800
uh, oh man, I'm slipping on my studies. I studied this a long time ago, but,

158
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.470
uh, the man is, uh,

159
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.180
holding the child and the woman is pointing up to the sky. Right. And it's like,

160
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:31.130
the man is like that earthly thing.

161
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:35.060
Like we handled things in a physical and the woman's sorta like that into

162
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.980
intuitive being women have to get back to being that intuitive

163
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:44.060
being, because if you notice our women always seem to warn us about stuff,

164
00:08:44.061 --> 00:08:45.560
right? Like, oh, don't do this. I'm like,

165
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.050
I should've listened to her at that time. You know what I'm saying?

166
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.360
They have to get back to their spiritual nature.

167
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.920
And I think a lot of them get away from that.

168
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.530
And that will ground them to when they won't need so much emotional support from

169
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:58.830
friends and family, because they're back in their spiritual nature. Well,

170
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:02.880
how does a woman do that? You can start with meditating, you know, meditate and,

171
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.290
um, being happy, which is being alone with yourself. Um,

172
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.320
a lot of people can't be alone with themselves. Yeah. You know,

173
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:12.900
they always need like some sort of device or something.

174
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.110
<v 1>Interesting that it's attractive when people are capable of being alone. Yeah.</v>

175
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.570
Like I remember these two girls were talking about some God that one of them was

176
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:26.130
dating and she goes, yeah, he's really into his career, which is a huge turn on.

177
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.660
I was like, oh, that's interesting. Yeah. He just needs time. He's disciplined.

178
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:32.730
He works all the time. He's always working on his career,

179
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:37.500
which is a huge turn on. I was like, well, you two little Cluckers.

180
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.140
<v 0>Well, women have to get back to that too. Like,</v>

181
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.640
y'all gotta learn how to pick a good man.

182
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.600
Sometimes yell at picking crap men based upon the money or things that they

183
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:46.410
have.

184
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.450
You're going in relation to your funding is a hundred thousand dollars in debt.

185
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.570
And he's a dude. Right? He's got these things.

186
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.930
I think women have to get better at seeing potential in men.

187
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:55.681
<v 1>But don't,</v>

188
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:59.280
they have to be tricked a few times before they could see the problems. Yeah.

189
00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.080
<v 0>That's the problem. That's.</v>

190
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.640
<v 1>A dirty thing for a girl. Let some loser, you and go, God it.</v>

191
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.550
Yeah. Yeah. I had them thought I had a winner.

192
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.930
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I I've been a victim of that. I was not a victim, but you know,</v>

193
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.480
I've done that to women myself. Sorry, ladies, you know?

194
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.440
Yeah, yeah. I'd done some wrong stuff.

195
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.110
<v 1>Well, it'd become a different person as time goes on. Yeah. You.</v>

196
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.190
<v 0>Grow from it. Part.</v>

197
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.990
<v 1>Of evolution of human. Yeah.</v>

198
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:25.890
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

199
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.360
<v 1>Yeah. I, I think, uh, society's expectations on women are, um,</v>

200
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.450
it's very difficult for a man to understand it. You know,

201
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.720
we see it from the outside, but to feel it as a woman,

202
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.340
that's got to be very different. I mean,

203
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.520
and there's a lot of women out there that are looking for a man,

204
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.410
like a successful man.

205
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.200
They're looking for a successful man and they want attach themselves.

206
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.040
And that's like, that's the goal. Yeah. There's not, that's not a goal of men.

207
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:53.580
So it's, it's very difficult for us to understand that our goal for, you know,

208
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:56.610
obviously we're generalizing, right. But our goal is to be successful.

209
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.080
<v 0>Right? Well, you can't, you can't know what man you want,</v>

210
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.000
unless you know who you are.

211
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.710
And a lot of people are getting in relationships without being in relationship

212
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:11.940
with themselves first. So when, um, you know,

213
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.950
in order to have a sound relationship,

214
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.130
you have to know your socioeconomic stance

215
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.810
is sad. When you get into a relationship with a conservative and you're liberal.

216
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:29.370
And then I start arguing about Donald Trump and the relationship breaks because

217
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:32.790
he's on one side, these are the conversations that you need to have upfront.

218
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:36.240
And if you don't know where you are politically and socioeconomically,

219
00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:39.840
for example, they say a lot of relationships break up because of money. Right?

220
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.770
And you got one person's a bad spender. The other one's thrifty, right?

221
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.460
These are the conversations you can have first. How do you manage your money?

222
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.830
No. Are you good with your money? You know,

223
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.710
and if you guys don't agree with how you want to pull your resources and how you

224
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.650
want to pull your money and what you want to do with it in the future, you know,

225
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:59.020
some people, you know, you might get in relationship with a girl and she's like,

226
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.170
oh, I want to push. And I want a land Rover. And I'm like,

227
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.090
I want a business. I want a VC. You know what I mean?

228
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.880
So you have two people that are going separate directions.

229
00:12:09.881 --> 00:12:12.310
One's going as consumer route, one's going into pending, you know,

230
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:15.430
producer route. So you have to first see, are you a consumer?

231
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:17.920
Maybe you need to be a con, what a consumer are you a producer?

232
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:20.980
You don't need to be what to consume, what you need to find someone as producer.

233
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.560
So if you, if you agree on social economics,

234
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.480
you'll have a better relationship with people,

235
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.360
but you have to know what you want out of life first.

236
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.600
And then find people connect to based upon that and not the physical looks and

237
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:32.434
all that other stuff.

238
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:36.940
<v 1>Most people think they want something because it's very difficult to attain.</v>

239
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.990
They see these things and they go, oh, that's the tr that's the prize. Yeah.

240
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:41.470
Well, you know,
