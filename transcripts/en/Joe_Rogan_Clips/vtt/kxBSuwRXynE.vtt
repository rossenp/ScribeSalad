00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. No,</v>

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.270
it's when people pick mushrooms and they go out and pick mushrooms.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.290
The real issue seems to be that there's some mushrooms that are edible that look

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.370
very close to mushrooms, very similar to mushrooms that are very poisonous.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.720
<v 1>True to the uninitiated and the people who have not learned.</v>

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.110
But once you learn the Shantrelle, you will not mistake it.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.010
Nothing looks like a lion's mane mushroom. Once you learn lion's mane,

8
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:27.780
mushroom is hard to mistake it.

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.480
So there are some lookalikes and with Emma Nita,

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.180
[inaudible] the destroying angel and with a Patty Strom mushroom,

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.690
which is commonly cultivated and collected in Asia.

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.700
Many of the mushroom deaths in north America have come from, uh,

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.120
not displaced, but, uh, peoples, but people who've come from Asia.

14
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.350
And because they're secretive and the language barrier and the culture of being

15
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.400
wild collectors,

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.750
they then mistake the destroying angel for a powder straw mushroom.

17
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:01.350
That's a real common mistake. There are other people who said that, well,

18
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:04.710
it just looked at a bubble. That's a really dangerous thing to say,

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.040
because you have to know species individually, right?

20
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.430
There's a there's edible species of Amanita and there's poisonous ones.

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.410
There's deadly poisonous ones.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.010
<v 0>I'm Anita seems to have a lot of controversy as far as its efficacy,</v>

23
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.660
far as like it's psychedelic efficacy that I don't know anybody that's ever

24
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:22.494
really tripped off.

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.970
<v 1>Mascara or eminence. Oh man, do I have a story please?</v>

26
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.210
<v 0>Oh my God. Because everybody that I know, like,</v>

27
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.310
and that was something that McKenna talked about as well,

28
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:33.960
Terrence talked about while he was alive.

29
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.520
He said that it seems that it's a genetically variable seasonally,

30
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:41.400
variable pre perhaps even environmentally.

31
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.670
<v 1>All those things are partially true. I've eaten em,</v>

32
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.410
they miscarried four or five times.

33
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.680
Miami miscarry has the red mushroom with the white dots. As a fairytale.

34
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.980
Mushroom is perfectly legal, Santa Claus mushroom. Um,

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.280
it contains a musi Mol Musker on an EBIT tannic acid,

36
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.700
actually very small amounts of mustering,

37
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.590
but the muscular manic symptoms cause salivation and sweating. Um,

38
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.030
and I tripled my friend on, on eMoney to mascara area.

39
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.010
And uh, and um,

40
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.300
I looked at him and he was foaming at the mouth and I had all these bubbles

41
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.270
coming out of his mouth, hang up, man, dude, you look like you have rabies.

42
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:23.040
He goes, you should see what you look like. So, but then Emin mascara, I've,

43
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.730
I've eaten that a few times and people do boil it in water,

44
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.060
throw away the water twice and they can make it into an edible mushroom.

45
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.650
But it's, it's not that great of an edible,

46
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.060
but there's another restaurant called amnio Panther. Rina Panther,

47
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.370
Rina is a kick-ass mushroom.

48
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.710
It has five times or more the amounts of [inaudible] almost

49
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:44.910
no Muskegon.

50
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.900
So the salivation effect an enemy mascara.

51
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:53.730
So I have a, had a very good friend. We are not friends anymore,

52
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:55.110
unfortunately. Um,

53
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.500
but I was in charge of the herbarium at the evergreen state college.

54
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.520
And I freeze dried M that a Panther Reno they're called Panther cops.

55
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.270
They're brown and color, and they have dots. Very good.

56
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.820
The Panther cop, perfectly legal mushroom and extraordinarily powerful.

57
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.780
So I was living up in Darrington, Washington and his cabin.

58
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.490
I was a logger hippie for a few years.

59
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.710
And so my friend Dave came up and I had these freeze dried mushrooms

60
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:25.780
from the herbarium. And I said, let's go ahead and eat these.

61
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.750
And I had read in the literature and almost no one had eaten them.

62
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.730
So I made an omelet and I, and we cooked it up and he was much lighter than me.

63
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.220
So I thought, well, I should have two thirds of the omelet, right.

64
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.930
Because he's lighter than me. And so we ate the mushrooms, run 10 o'clock.

65
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.840
And, um, we're living in this cabin,

66
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.340
but across the Creek was a scar square Creek camp run. And it was the,

67
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.090
we call them the Winnebago people, right back then in the seventies,

68
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.960
I hitchhiked across country. 13 times never Winnebago never picked me up.

69
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.180
So they were always the enemy. And uh, so we were long-haired hippies.

70
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:04.210
You know, we ate these mushrooms and we thought for entertainment,

71
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.860
let's go look at the Winnebago people. So we met,

72
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.280
it was so close. I don't know why we drove our car,

73
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.010
but we drove the car out of my cabin.

74
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.970
We went down like a half a mile and we turned left into the Sparky campground

75
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.980
and we parked the car and we wanted to go up to a beautiful view spot.

76
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.720
And so we walked through the Winnebago people and their families and everything

77
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:33.130
else. And, and we got up onto a Ridge and we thought, this is a great few spot,

78
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.270
but we're waiting there like an hour, no effect, you know?

79
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.150
And I thought the dad was like, wow, maybe these aren't that potent.

80
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.710
And then right after we said that,

81
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.060
I looked at Dave and I said, David, do you see that? He goes, yeah,

82
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.860
we waited a few more seconds than this big distortion field.

83
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.640
And we had a beautiful view of the volcanoes and the valleys are big view scape.

84
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.670
We could see the air with had become sort of this liquid.

85
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.620
And then it started coming on stronger and stronger and stronger.

86
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.800
I'm like, oh my God, this is getting intense.

87
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:11.080
We better get the heck out of here. Go,

88
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.140
go home where it's safe because this is coming on. So strong.

89
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.800
So we come down off this little,

90
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.480
this little plateau and we had to come down through the Winnebago people and

91
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.680
then, oh my God. And here,

92
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:27.220
we're walking a thing about am Anita's and Muskeegan Panther Rina,

93
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.500
you have doll yellows and Browns,

94
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.850
but you feel like this giant and you're moving a slow motion.

95
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.810
Every step you're taking, you know,

96
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.390
you feel like this giant by moving really slow. And,

97
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.010
and then I came to Winnebago's of no end. There were hundreds of feet long.

98
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.570
I'm trying to walk past this little bagel. And like, when does this Winnebago,

99
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.750
when I end, I keep on walking further and further. And then, oh my God.

100
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:57.100
And so then we're really just really, really high. It was ridiculous.

101
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.460
I had a really flux camera and we came up to the car.

102
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.250
And so for some frigging reason, I locked the car.

103
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.410
And so I had my key, I looked at my key and I look at the lock. I went,

104
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.800
Pam missed, oh, okay. Pull the key back missed.

105
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.030
But Dave goes, you okay? I go, I'm fine. He goes, do you want me to drive?

106
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:23.600
And I go, no way, dude, I'm this high, there's no way I want you to drive.

107
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.980
Right. And so I did it over and over again. Then magically just for repetition,

108
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:29.330
it just made it into the lock.

109
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.160
So I unlocked the door and I get into the car and I dropped my camera

110
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.380
and then I'm in the car and I'm trying to get my key. And I thank God.

111
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:43.490
I didn't get my key in. I was not safe to drive. And then Dave is going like,

112
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.590
oh my God, Paul or so freaking high right now. And I go and I say, well,

113
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.690
let's go home. I said, it's not drop my camera.

114
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.970
And I went over and I looked at the ground, there was my camera. I picked it up.

115
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.230
Dave, I dropped my camera, dropped my camera again.

116
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.400
Oh, wow. Dave, I brought my camera, picked up my camera, go

117
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.920
drop. My camera, did this over and over and over again.

118
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.710
Repetitive motion syndrome kicked in.

119
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.230
This is a very common symptom of Amond at Panther Rina.

120
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.970
I dropped my karma dozens and dozens of times, how did it look at the end? Well,

121
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.230
it was shattered, but Dave goes, Paul, you should look up.

122
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.360
And a whole bunch of people from the Winnebago community had lined up holding

123
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:31.250
their children in close proximity,

124
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.780
watching this repetitive motion syndrome where I'm just constantly picking my

125
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:38.060
camera. So they're watching you for entertainment,

126
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:39.860
where you went to watch them for entertainment.

127
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.250
And now they're freaking out because I have this repetitive motion syndrome and

128
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.550
I'd take one step. Uh, Trump, my camera. Wow. Dave,

129
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:49.160
I dropped my camera and I pick up my camera gun.

130
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.370
I go through and I just want my camera. Whoa. It dropped my camera again.

131
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.980
Now this speaks to the busy workers and the busy workers.

132
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.990
The word berserk came from the Berserkers and Scandinavia where the legend has

133
00:07:59.991 --> 00:08:04.580
it, that there were these, these, the Scandinavians, um, um,

134
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.680
the Vikings were surrounded and outnumbered, uh,

135
00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:09.560
and they were going to be killed the next day.

136
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.250
And they ate a whole bunch of empty and miscarried and a big, big soup.

137
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.470
And a legend has it. And it's not been confirmed, but this is the legend.

138
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.550
This very commonly reiterated is that they drank a whole bunch of [inaudible]

139
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.550
soup. And then they went and the next day,

140
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.240
even though they're massively out numbered,

141
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:31.910
they took off all their clothes in the attack, the enemy naked with swords.

142
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.270
And that's where the word berserk came from the preservers.

143
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.070
So I'm having this berserker experience of repetitive motion syndrome and I'm

144
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:42.450
dropping my camera over and over and over again.

145
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.330
And I looked up and the parents were holding.

146
00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:47.030
Their children are totally freaking out. You know, I said,

147
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:47.811
we got to get out of here.

148
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:51.380
So we left the doors open on the car and I'm taking one or two stops,

149
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.930
dropping my camera and picking it up, dropping my camera.

150
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.580
We finally made a pack. He, he disappeared.

151
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:58.950
I didn't know if the Dave you're on your own on dude. I have enough.

152
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:00.780
I have enough to worry about no,

153
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.750
I made it back to my cabin and I get from my cabinet.

154
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:07.350
And there's a combination luck all, no, I don't need a combination.

155
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.270
Look right now, I can barely, you know,

156
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.320
I'm spinning lock back and forth spending backlog. And then, um,

157
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.600
eventually the locked has spontaneously opened and,

158
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.060
and then I fell on the ground and I started convulsing.

159
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.530
And the cool thing about convulsing was it felt good. Every time I convulsed,

160
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.740
I actually went, oh, that feels so good. So it could involve some more.

161
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.690
And I was just convulsing. Constantly. Epileptic can have electric convulsions,

162
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.680
very, very intense, but they felt good. This is the weird thing about it.

163
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:37.800
I needed to convulse because every time I convulse,

164
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:40.320
I kind of got a reset of my neurology, you know,

165
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.690
and I have a baseline and then it would spin out of control.

166
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.530
And then I had this cascade of, I stint, I stingy in thoughts, I'm going,

167
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.840
oh my God, I can save the world. I know how to do this.

168
00:09:48.841 --> 00:09:51.930
And they don't have a positional or adverbial phrase.

169
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.110
And just before I came to the object of my thought,

170
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.680
that was Einsteinian insight, I'd have a tension.

171
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.950
And then I come to the course at the end of that sentence.

172
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:04.390
And then I have another tangent. I saw death as a,

173
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.480
as a perpetual series of alternatives that never gave me the satisfaction of a

174
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:11.430
conclusive thought. And, um,

175
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:17.040
as I was just lasted for about 12 hours, you know, I, I fainted,

176
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:20.550
I went into a coma like state. So you recommended it.

177
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.980
I do not recommend it.

178
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.390
And the biggest concern besides the repetitive motion syndrome is, um,

179
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.660
hypothermia. Because if you're out in the woods or something and you're exposed,

180
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:34.080
you're not getting up. So you're you go in, it's called Soma for a reason.

181
00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:37.980
It's the Soma mushroom. It has some different causes

182
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.270
because isn't there some debate as to what Soma actually is.

183
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.330
That's what our Gordon Wasson proposed Sama and the medic literature.

184
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:46.650
There's a big debate about that.

185
00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:49.200
But the other story I like to tell is my friend,

186
00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:53.490
Dr. Andrew Weil was at the Cougar hunt Springs and, and Oregon.

187
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.893
And, um,

188
00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.100
Andy's a medical doctor from Harvard and he was walking the trail and people can

189
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:01.860
run down to, oh my God, this guy's trying to kill himself. You got to come up.

190
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.570
And Andy went up to this guy,

191
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:06.450
had eaten a whole bunch of ambient miscarry on big biker dude.

192
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.220
And it covered with blood.

193
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:13.860
And he was up on a bridge and he was swinging his legs back and forth

194
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.220
and is above the rocks. And he threw himself off the bridge.

195
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.350
Now it was only about six or eight feet,

196
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.850
but it's enough onto the boulders down below, smashed himself on the rocks.

197
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.220
And then he climbed back up on the bridge and he swung his feet and threw

198
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:31.180
himself off the bridge. So this,

199
00:11:31.181 --> 00:11:34.860
this causes repetitive motion syndrome to both of my camera.

200
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.510
Isn't marshaling.

201
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.810
That's perfectly legal as probably one of the most dangerous mushrooms that

202
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:40.441
anyone could eat.

203
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:45.240
I definitely advise not doing this because I always thought if I was ever called

204
00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:46.140
as an expert witness,

205
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.550
having these experiences and someone who was a war watching tales from the crypt

206
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.640
on TV, and they saw a knife,

207
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:58.570
it causes temporary insanity. I mean, it's,

208
00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:02.100
those type of machines are wonderful. They're peaceful, they're loving as the

209
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.290
[inaudible] right. But the AMA Nita mushrooms caused this strange,

210
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:12.910
strange sort of behavior that is really potentially dangerous.
