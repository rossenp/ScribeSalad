00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 2>This is from 1964. What is it?</v>

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.520
It's a FOIA re request made for the freedom of information act freedom of

4
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:14.680
information act for the file of Barack Husain,

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.800
Obama senior,

6
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.070
as a graduate student in the economics department at Harvard university, okay.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.310
Obama has passed his general exams, which indicates that on academic grounds,

8
00:00:27.311 --> 00:00:31.430
he's entitled to stay around here and write his thesis. However,

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.790
they are going to try to cook something up,

10
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310
to ease him out

11
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.420
all three, that is all three Harvard. People will have to agree on this.

12
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:43.730
However,

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.620
they are planning on telling him that they will not give him any money and that

14
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:50.860
he had better returned to Kenya and prepare his thesis at home,

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.620
which means he will never get his PhD. Remember when they said,

16
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:57.900
take a break to you. This is my Alma mater.

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.960
<v 0>This is the thing I an UN you know,</v>

18
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.880
there's this whole story about what happened in my early life and why I don't

19
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:08.000
talk about it publicly.

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.520
And this is why this is interacting with your story about joke thry,

21
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.600
because it's weird for a comic, not to turn that into a joke. And it,

22
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.920
wasn't funny to you in around, I don't know,

23
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.350
19 88, 19 89 Harvard university, me

24
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.070
to remain in good standing in this program.

25
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.230
<v 2>You cannot live in Massachusetts. Why? And I said,</v>

26
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.310
what, how can you tell me where I can live and where I can't live?

27
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.780
It wasn't until somebody foiled Barack Obama's father

28
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.293
in his file.

29
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.100
And I read this story that I realized that Harvard has a program for how it gets

30
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:53.140
rid of people. It wants to get rid of who are in good standing.

31
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.660
<v 0>It makes a move. It makes them move so that they can't complete their thesis.</v>

32
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.300
Why'd they wanna do that with you? Um,

33
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.690
probably because I'm disabled as the day is long,

34
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.810
probably because I took a,

35
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.890
an unpopular stance that the equations that people were working with called the

36
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:13.730
Donaldson theory,

37
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.730
self dual equations were not the right equations to be working with.

38
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.450
<v 2>And that we had somehow been assuming that they were highly peculiar to</v>

39
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.330
dimension four. And that the difficulty of the equations,

40
00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.440
which was what was giving us all these great results I had effectively gotten on

41
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:31.240
the wrong side. I proposed some equations that were, I was told,

42
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:36.000
were insufficiently non-linear nevermind. What? That means that in 1994,

43
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.120
effectively the same equations took over the entire field,

44
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.390
whatever it was. And this is like part of the idea of reclaiming your own story.

45
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.790
It was so crazy that a university would tell me what state I could

46
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:54.624
live in.

47
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.950
<v 1>Can I stop you? So the people that are telling you this, yeah.</v>

48
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.560
They're operating on a preexisting solution to deal

49
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.320
with people that they find undesirable, correct or problematic if you.

50
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.073
<v 0>A thousand of them.</v>

51
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.160
<v 1>Right? So it's written somewhere or.</v>

52
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 0>Something. I don't know. Or it's you knows like people maintain. For example,</v>

53
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.000
one way of, um,

54
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.830
&lt;affirmative&gt; getting rid of a tenured professor that's known is,

55
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.110
is that you ask the person to report on their research and you load them up with

56
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.870
teaching and you give them a lousy office.

57
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.590
And then eventually they'll just quit because you make their life. Hell. Oh.

58
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.790
So people know that there are these kind of secret,

59
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.990
quiet ways to do the undoable.

60
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.780
<v 1>Can I ask you this?</v>

61
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.460
What did you think about Cornell west being denied tenure from Harvard?

62
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.740
First of all, I thought I assumed, yeah, he already had it. I mean,

63
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:50.620
Cornell west is this loved intellectual.

64
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.940
When, when I found out they denied him tenure,

65
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.380
I was like, what the, what, how do you,

66
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.850
how do you deny Cornell west tenure? Like, what is that?

67
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.050
What did you think about.

68
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.090
<v 0>That? I, first of all, am not knowledgeable in that area.</v>

69
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.370
I think of him as a very bright superstar of some sort of

70
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.290
part academic part, social crossover, high impact human being. Yeah,

71
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.080
I was there when Larry Summers was president of, um, Harvard,

72
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.360
when he went out and said,

73
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.480
effectively too many people are using the Harvard label and we're going to be

74
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.760
reigning it in and going back to hard rigor and basics.

75
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.120
Let me tell you what people don't understand about Harvard.

76
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:41.070
Harvard is two separate structures F together.

77
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.950
One is about power and one is about achievement.

78
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.910
And the two of them are interlinked in a way that cannot be separated

79
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.510
it without the achievement,

80
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:57.430
Harvard wouldn't have this kind of glowing reputation that causes us to sort of

81
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.420
&lt;inaudible&gt; over it historically, right? Without the power,

82
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.420
it wouldn't be able to attract the money and it wouldn't be able to constantly

83
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.780
position itself. So through achievement,

84
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.340
it gets enough cache to wield power through the power.

85
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.580
It gets the resources to buy achievement.

86
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.220
And this sort of thing is not understood.

87
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.260
And I've been in both sides of this thing.

88
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.290
Like one of the things that happened, um,

89
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.970
was that the BOS commission in 1996,

90
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.970
tried to figure out how to cut social security and raise taxes without getting

91
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.290
caught because that's the third rail of politics.

92
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.930
And what they said is if we change the CPI, the consumer price index,

93
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:44.840
the way we measure inflation, because tax brackets are indexed.

94
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.600
And because entitlement payments for social security and Medicare are indexed.

95
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.800
If we claim that social security, sorry,

96
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:55.760
if we claim that inflation is overstated by 1.1 percentage points,

97
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.120
we will gain a trillion dollars in savings and the

98
00:06:01.121 --> 00:06:04.760
public won't be able to object to it because we're gonna be just adjusting a

99
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:05.450
dial.

100
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.120
We're gonna say that this dial was broken and we got some technocrats to fix it.

101
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.160
So they figured out we wanna get a trillion dollars. Over 10 years,

102
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.320
they backed out that would require 1.1% overstatement.

103
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.830
They broke into two teams. One team came up with 0.5.

104
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.110
One team came up with 0.6 0.5 plus 0.6 equals 1.1,

105
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.830
totally fictitious.

106
00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.590
They got a tr they got a proposal for a trillion dollars that they were gonna

107
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.830
steal effectively from social security.

108
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.100
And they described this act publicly Robert Gordon,

109
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.540
who is one of the five Boskin commissioners. Um, Jamie,

110
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:47.180
could you bring up something called Boskin wild versus mild?

111
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.380
They brag about these things.

112
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.820
Power wants to explain just how powerful it is.

113
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.930
And you remember the scene in the big short,

114
00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:01.170
where they're talking to these guys in Florida and saying,

115
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:03.810
why are they confessing? And somebody says, they're not confessing.

116
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:08.130
They're bragging. It's a question of what are you proud that you're able to do?

117
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.093
Right?

118
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.010
So until Robert Gordon did this PowerPoint presentation,

119
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.640
we did not have understand what happened to the work that I did with my wife in

120
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.673
economics,

121
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.200
which is that we were trying to show how you could actually compute the,

122
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.920
the consumer price index objectively using gauge theory

123
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.920
the same year they were trying to figure out how do we steal a trillion dollars

124
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.950
over 10 years, by doing funny games with the gauge called an inflation.

125
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.150
Do you, do you find the wild versus the mild? Yeah, I did.

126
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:47.070
It's just loading a PDF and it's like taking, I bailed. It's like I found,

127
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.990
so this thing perfect. If you go to, um,

128
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:57.150
uh, go about five or six slides in,

129
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.420
mm we'll see other that works. Okay.

130
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.700
1, 2, 3, keep going five. You find the word somehow,

131
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.420
keep going. Okay. Dale said one point,

132
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.300
1% implies 1 trillion in silver, social security savings. Over 10 years,

133
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.810
somehow our separate efforts came up with the 1.1% bias

134
00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:24.210
number. In other words,

135
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.570
they came up with the target, which is let's save trillion dollars.

136
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.370
And then they came up with, we have to say, it's overstated by 1.1,

137
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.490
we then broke into two groups and somehow keyword,

138
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.050
we put them numbers together and we got the target.

139
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.120
This is academic malpractice practice in the absolute extreme.

140
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.960
When Harvard was doing that,

141
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:51.240
it was acting in its power capacity and the way they did it was they buried.

142
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.480
What I think is probably the best work in 25 to 50 years in mathematical

143
00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.280
economics that happened in the Harvard economics department, which is a second.

144
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.240
So called marginal revolution,

145
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.520
where we changed the calculus underneath all of economic theory.

146
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.680
<v 1>So how does something like this happen? Is there a concerted effort?</v>

147
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.960
Did they get together? And they, they have this idea.

148
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:13.950
This is how we're gonna do.

149
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.670
<v 0>Five person commission behind closed doors that meets at the</v>

150
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.830
cousin's house of somebody on the commission in Florida.

151
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.750
And in another presentation on in Florida, Florida,

152
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.390
man &lt;laugh&gt; and another presentation. They say,

153
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.230
we solve this at the kitchen table of my cousin's house in Florida.

154
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.140
And you're just thinking like &lt;affirmative&gt; okay. So it's five guys,

155
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.660
Bob Packwood and Daniel, Patrick Monahan, Democrat, and Republican got together.

156
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.860
He picked five economists who were willing to play the dirty game.

157
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.940
The dirty game broke into two teams. They knew exactly what they had to do.

158
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.100
They found the results to put them together, to put in front of Congress,

159
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.860
to put in front of the national academy.

160
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.170
<v 1>Were they ever held accountable for.</v>

161
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.760
<v 0>This? No.</v>

162
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.610
There's an entire book called the physics of wall street in which my wife and

163
00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.250
I are chapter 10 and the epilogue, which it talks about,

164
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:09.970
they made Weinstein and Milani go away. Right.

165
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.130
So what I'm trying to talk to you about is like this,

166
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:18.480
this experience for me, I've now ever talked about this with anyone I've never,

167
00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.280
I mean, I've talked to tons of people privately.

168
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.680
This is gonna go out into the world. I was, you know, you know this question,

169
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.160
like, what has Eric Weinstein ever done? I did that.

170
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.760
I did the marginal revolution. He engaged theory.

171
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.080
<v 1>Stop, stop. No, no stop. Stop. That question is Tim Dylan joking around? Yeah,</v>

172
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.350
I know. He said, what did he, he never created the, he was, was very foing.

173
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.310
He was around.

174
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.990
<v 0>That was the funny part about it. He was joking.</v>

175
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.270
<v 1>But he's saying that because he knows you're brilliant.</v>

176
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:49.990
You understand the only reason why he can say that if you were a loser, he.

177
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.710
<v 0>Couldn't say, Joe, you don't need to make me feel good about myself. I know.</v>

178
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:52.790
But.

179
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.830
<v 1>You brought it up again. No.</v>

180
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.630
<v 0>I'm I'm saying something completely different. Okay. Okay.</v>

181
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.140
I actually have been scared of this question. What question?

182
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:06.380
That Tim's question taken seriously? Who? Who's gonna take it seriously.

183
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.060
I'm taking it seriously. Okay.

184
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.460
<v 1>No, no. You're in a weird world. Okay. Here's here's the weird world.</v>

185
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.660
You're in a world of serious intellectual. People're hanging out with straight.

186
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:18.850
You're also hanging out with Tim Dillon and me. I, and I love it,

187
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:23.410
but it's it's but the problem is like, you're, you're conflating these two.

188
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.410
<v 0>Things, Joe. No, it Joe. I'm not that angry at Tim di. It's.</v>

189
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.370
<v 1>Not, I'm not that angry. Do you hear that? You heard the word,</v>

190
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.210
you heard the word that that's a problem.

191
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.170
<v 0>Well, you're not that angry at Carlos man. See it.</v>

192
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.090
<v 1>I'm not angry at him at all. I know. And I'm not angry.</v>

193
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.210
<v 0>Angry, Tim Dylan at I'm sad. I'm sad for him, Tim di.</v>

194
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.760
<v 1>Anyway, should be sad for Tim. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</v>

195
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:42.840
He's one of the most important comedians of our time. Okay?

196
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.120
<v 0>How dare you? How dare I, it took,</v>

197
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.040
it gave me a moment to re to reflect and I realized something, which is,

198
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.560
I don't want to talk about this publicly.

199
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.120
I don't wanna say Dale JSON is the guy who buried one of

200
00:11:58.121 --> 00:12:02.240
the most important innovations in economic theory, but yet you just did.

201
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.880
I just did. And that's what I'd just done. That's what I,

202
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.120
I realized by reviewing your history and revealing your seven years away from

203
00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:13.710
the store. I don't want to be with Dale JSON.

204
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.270
I don't care about him.

205
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.110
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I wanna be associated with gauge theoretical economics.

206
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.170
I see what you're saying.

207
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.590
And what I realized is I don't wanna be associated with the,

208
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:28.430
the that happened over something called the cyber Whit equations. What?

209
00:12:28.431 --> 00:12:29.264
I just handed you,

210
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.340
one of the reasons I've held it back is that it very clearly gives an alternate

211
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:34.183
definition,

212
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.380
alternate motivation and derivation of the equations.

213
00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.860
That revolutionized gauge theory,

214
00:12:39.861 --> 00:12:43.660
which is what I was thinking about in around 19 87, 19 88.

215
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.140
And I've lived afraid of my own story because it's such an ugly

216
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.983
story.

217
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.910
The story of a guy who is not allowed to attend his own thesis defense to any

218
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:59.150
academician you hear, like,

219
00:12:59.151 --> 00:13:02.310
what do you mean you weren't allowed to you present your thesis? No, no, no.

220
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.670
I was not allowed in the room of my own thesis defense.

221
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.270
So this is why Harvard wanted you to move outta state Harvard.

222
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.550
And I got into a thing because of that, because of a conflict,

223
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.300
because also of this, because of geometric unity, because I said,

224
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.420
I want to do physics.

225
00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.580
And I have an idea about how physics goes and to be brutally honest,

226
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.710
I was technically underpowered. I am technically underpowered.

227
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.670
I was conceptually amazing. I was very creative, very generative, tons,

228
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.660
and tons of great ideas. I think I'm being honest on both friends,

229
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.020
technically under power. Okay.

230
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.340
I couldn't accept myself in this world of like, you know,

231
00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:48.700
if you play classical music, everybody's technically brilliant.

232
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:53.480
There's no technically weak people in classical music. I was like a guy.

233
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.870
It was like a, it was like John Lee in the York orchestra of, you know,

234
00:13:56.871 --> 00:14:00.950
the Cleveland symphony orchestra on one string and a guitar playing with some

235
00:14:00.951 --> 00:14:04.830
weird syncopated rhythm, boom, boom, boom, boom. Going to shoot your head down.

236
00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.470
Yeah, exactly. Mom said, let that daddy said,

237
00:14:09.471 --> 00:14:13.110
let that boy boogie woogie. It's in him and it's gotta come out. That thing.

238
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.350
I'm scared of. Why are you scared of,

239
00:14:15.351 --> 00:14:18.020
because it's my history because I don't want to go back into it.

240
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.980
I don't want to go back to being the guy begging

241
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.740
Dale JSON. Oh, pretty pleased with sugar and top.

242
00:14:25.741 --> 00:14:27.140
Let me innovate your entire field.

243
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.700
I don't wanna go back to the Harvard department and, and say the words,

244
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.700
Clifford tabs. You had Gary tabs on your program.

245
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.410
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; Clifford tubs was the guy who told me I had to move outta

246
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.730
state. Cliff. Was he related to Gary? Yeah, he is as a brother.

247
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.170
Yeah. He was the guy who held the secret seminar. And the thing is, is that I,

248
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.810
I'm not against the person in the story. I don't want to have it.

249
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.560
I don't want to be involved with him.

250
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.260
I want him to go and be successful and have a good career. But my story,

251
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.540
when I put forward those equations and he said,

252
00:15:01.541 --> 00:15:04.460
they're insufficiently nonlinear. And he said,

253
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.900
self duality doesn't have anything to do with spinners.

254
00:15:07.901 --> 00:15:10.780
Because if it did Nigel Hitchens, would've told us, okay,

255
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:14.050
not would've told he didn't say Hitchins he was wrong.

256
00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.970
And then when I gave him the opportunity, he didn't say, you know what?

257
00:15:18.971 --> 00:15:21.730
Eric Weinstein brought these equations up. And I told him no.

258
00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.970
And that thing is like something I've held open the door.

259
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.050
He's now in his mid sixties. I was like,

260
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.760
you really couldn't just say, maybe I screwed up. You should go kick his. No,

261
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.360
why? I'm joking. I know &lt;laugh&gt;

262
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.680
well, but wait a second, Joe, such a Dick. &lt;laugh&gt;

263
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:48.720
such a Dick. I had to.

264
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.790
<v 1>Come made some love. I thought you were gonna cry 30 seconds ago.</v>

265
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.710
<v 0>Do you have a tissue? No. Somewhere that, that, yeah, it was over there,</v>

266
00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:01.110
but that's this is the thing I've been running. What I realized through Tim.

267
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.350
It wasn't a question of being angry at Tim. Really?

268
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.470
I've been running away from my own story.

269
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.830
Just the way I don't like you associated with,

270
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.230
I haven't mentioned the guy who was the joke thief in this entire time.

271
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:13.860
<v 1>Yeah. I understand what.</v>

272
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.540
<v 0>You're saying. Right? It's like, why are you?</v>

273
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.940
And he entangled in this story because he has nothing to do with your life.

274
00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:19.923
It's okay.

275
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.820
<v 1>It doesn't bother me that I'm entangled with him.</v>

276
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:24.860
<v 0>What bothers me that I'm entangled with this stuff?</v>

277
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.980
<v 1>Um, I know what you're saying.</v>

278
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.810
<v 0>Because I wanna be joyous.</v>

279
00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:36.200
I want to produce pot positive things that uplift us that give

280
00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:39.640
us a hope of breaking, like the Einsteinian speed limit. You know,

281
00:16:39.641 --> 00:16:43.840
if this is wrong, I wanna know mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think it's right.

282
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.280
I think with all my flaws and all my failings and being 25 years outta the

283
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:49.114
field,

284
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.070
I believe that this story is gonna be fixed by people who are trying to shoot

285
00:16:54.071 --> 00:16:57.510
it down. They're gonna say, holy. I think there's something.

286
00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.310
<v 1>Here. Well, now we're gonna know. Right? I think I'm hoping you released.</v>

287
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.950
<v 0>It today on geometric unity.org.do.</v>

288
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:06.390
