00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 1>Experience. I heard that if you can get an inland sea salt,</v>

3
00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.410
it's better because it's not like a,

4
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:11.040
it doesn't have potential as many potential toxins that you're gonna find like

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.240
oceans.

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 0>Yeah. Along those lines. Yeah. That's what the,</v>

7
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.020
the idea about Himalayan sea salt is right.

8
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.890
Because it's no real sea in the Himalayas. Right.

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.580
I mean, what is it called? Himalayan sea salt.

10
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:26.730
Or am I just making that up or is it Himalayan salt? I think it's sea.

11
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.640
<v 1>Salt, right? Yeah. The pink Himalayan sea salt, right? Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.260
<v 0>But how was it? Sea salt. Explain that. How does that work?</v>

13
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.150
Was it an older sea?

14
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.960
<v 1>I wonder what it is. And it's similar. It's just like these big salt. Oh, it is.</v>

15
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.100
<v 0>Okay. Oh, it's just Himalayan salt. No, they're both comes up. Oh yeah.</v>

16
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:44.970
I think I've heard it.

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.530
<v 1>Like an old seed. That's no longer there.</v>

18
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:48.000
And they just have the big salt deposits.

19
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.420
<v 0>Right?</v>

20
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.220
Like that's what a lot of Montana is the great Western in inland

21
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:58.140
sea. No, like millions of years ago. Like they find seashells in Montana.

22
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.660
Yeah. It was just bonkers.

23
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.430
<v 1>Crazy. Uh, I was,</v>

24
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.870
I was in a Utah earlier in the year and I can't remember where we were just out

25
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:10.770
of salt lake. And apparently that used to be on underwater too. And like,

26
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.470
they'll find like shark teeth and stuff like that around there. Like,

27
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:15.210
and it's just, you're up on this like trail and they're like,

28
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.320
there's no water in sight.

29
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.250
<v 0>Think about that next time you see some that spent $10 million on a house on the</v>

30
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:24.480
beach makes you think that's going to stay there, man. Hey, pay for that.

31
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.100
Eventually that is not going to be here.

32
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.840
Something's going to be different in the future. It's always been that way.

33
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:34.680
Like there's no permanent like place where the water is, where the water isn't.

34
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.800
Yeah.

35
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.290
<v 1>Yeah. It is funny how we think of that though, where it's like,</v>

36
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:40.500
we see the map now and we're like, oh, okay. This is just how it is. And yeah.

37
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.380
<v 0>Maybe not. We'll look at Pangea you know,</v>

38
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500
things change pretty radically. What's up, Jamie?

39
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.960
I don't know the accuracy of this, but I just found this. Okay.

40
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.590
Himalayan sea salt is a gourmet salt with a slightly misleading name.

41
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.800
It doesn't come from the Himalayan mountains. Oh Jesus.

42
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.630
And it doesn't come from a sea. These, however, it's definitely a Seesaw.

43
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.630
So it's not a total misnomer. Himalayan salt.

44
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.490
Ashley refers to exclusively to Pakistani rock salt.

45
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.680
That used to be sea salt, hundreds of millions of years ago.

46
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
So why don't we call it Pakistan? If I was Pakistani, I'd be best.

47
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.560
Some mother are stealing our shine. You forget Jesus. You gay people.

48
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.930
No dude. That's what he said.

49
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:27.240
That's exactly what he's sending out of that again.

50
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.630
Pause for a second. I'm going to be honest. I'm going to be honest.

51
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:35.310
I did a little bit. I was like, wait. No,

52
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.580
because he likes it up with what's wrong with you, America.

53
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.980
What's wrong with you? People is the problem. Here's the problem. He said,

54
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:43.500
forget pretty clear. That's what me.

55
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:46.680
You forget you forget Jesus.

56
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.340
Barely believing gay Jesus. Is that really what he said? Yeah.

57
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.630
Let's play that again bro. Cut it off JV.

58
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.010
Wow. What happened to.

59
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 2>Oh God. that. The bachelors of basketball.</v>

60
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.430
<v 0>Okay. Yep. You forget the USA. You forget, you forget the best in the world.</v>

61
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.653
Forget. Go ahead.

62
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.000
<v 2>The wrong. What happened to you? What happened to</v>

63
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.590
you? Golf shoes? No.

64
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.700
<v 0>For gay Jesus people maybe, but maybe not forget. Jesus.</v>

65
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.180
It's like what happened? Do you not forget Jesus? There wasn't like,

66
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:34.390
there was some gay thing that was going on and he was commenting on it. I know,

67
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.640
but he's, he's so bad at English so bad. It easily could be.

68
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.010
Don't forget. Jesus is a golfer. Jesus. Don't forget. Jesus.

69
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.400
The only problem is he goes, what's wrong with you, USA. What's wrong with you?

70
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:52.510
You forget the number one. Jesus. What's wrong with you? Go back,

71
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.340
go back. Don't don't forget. Don't forget. Don't forget Jesus.

72
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.850
But he says don't forget right? One more time. Cause it doesn't make sense.

73
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.550
So breaking this down, first of all, pause for a second. You've got to remember.

74
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:10.660
He just got hit in the head a gang of times, right? I mean, what fight was this?

75
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.010
Do we remember? And look, he's got John three 16 or three 18 on a,

76
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:19.180
on a bandana around his head. He's got a Bible quote on his door for Jesus.

77
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:23.410
Not for gay. Jesus people go for Jesus. Not forget Jesus,

78
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.750
not you forget you forget Jesus it's it doesn't make sense.

79
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.680
It doesn't make sense, period, for him to say not for gay Jesus.

80
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:37.480
That didn't make sense because no, no, no. There's no rumors and saying,

81
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:40.360
don't forget to just start a rumor about Jesus being gay magic.

82
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:44.440
We were the first ones after all these years, this is what I heard about Jesus.

83
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.600
And then it becomes like everybody's talking about it.

84
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:50.800
Like you'll always tell there was a scroll. Usually with gay shot,

85
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:54.790
broke it down. Shut shop down. Jesus was getting, of course he loves everybody.

86
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.880
<v 3>Let's look at two randomized controlled trials. Two,</v>

87
00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.360
these are not observational studies. Um, the,

88
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.620
the first found that increasing red meat consumption by replacing

89
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.880
carbohydrates in the diet of individuals without anemia actually reduced markers

90
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:10.780
of inflammation.

91
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.960
<v 4>Sorry, we're just replacing what? Sorry, carbohydrates.</v>

92
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.750
<v 3>I'm sorry. So Jamie, if you want to pull this, uh, I mean,</v>

93
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:23.680
these are all on the website, kresser.co/ game-changers,

94
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:28.540
but that's that study is called increased lean red meat intake does not elevate

95
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.660
markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans.

96
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.230
<v 4>I believe it started to exist.</v>

97
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.900
<v 3>I mean that doesn't, so these are RCTs randomized.</v>

98
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.290
So-so they're actually controlling it instead of just looking at observational

99
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:45.520
data, which is subject to healthy user bias. Um,

100
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.600
these are two RCTs, so that's uh, that's one study.

101
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:50.890
And then there's another one.

102
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.820
Another RCT in women with anemia inflammation,

103
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:59.600
markers on a diet high in red meat or not different from those on a diet high

104
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.400
in oily fish. And then there are also numerous studies of paleo diets,

105
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.200
which contain meat and other types of animal protein and show that they decrease

106
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.340
markers of inflammation,

107
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:14.960
including CRP there's randomized control trials showing reductions in

108
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:19.160
interleukin six and also in tumor necrosis factor alpha,

109
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.420
uh, in these diets. So all of this suggests it's not the meat,

110
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.690
it's what you eat with the meat. That makes the difference.

111
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.920
So we have studies of chlorophyll, eating chlorophyll, rich green vegetables,

112
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.300
uh, decreases the formation of in nitroso compounds with meat.

113
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.100
We have lots of studies showing that when you eat plants along

114
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:40.934
with the meat,

115
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.710
then you don't see the effects that you might see if you're just eating

116
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:48.530
crap standard American diet, okay.

117
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.910
<v 4>Sorry. Off sex. Like S some, uh, so if an animal foods creates oxidative stress,</v>

118
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.240
you have it with the plant foods and that would have the antioxidants and that

119
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:57.950
would offset it. Is that basically.

120
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.293
<v 0>It's a little more complex.</v>

121
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.820
<v 3>Yeah. I think it is more complicated than that.</v>

122
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.680
But as I said last time, and as I, as I've always argued,

123
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.160
I'm not a proponent of current, the carnivore diet.

124
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.490
I'm not a low carb guy. I'm not a keto guy.

125
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.620
I'm my fundamental argument is just that the optimal human diet

126
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.020
contains both plant and animal foods.

127
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.760
And this focus on individual food components or

128
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.970
macronutrients like protein or fat or carbohydrate,

129
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.930
we've gotten too much. It's called nutritionism.

130
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.160
It's just focusing on these individual elements and ignoring the overall pattern

131
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:39.800
of diet quality, which is the most important thing.

132
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.950
And that's what a lot of the more recent studies are showing.

133
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:47.330
When you look at the diet pattern, the diet quality on its aunt, you know,

134
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.010
overall,

135
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.640
that's what actually makes a difference in terms of health and lifespan,

136
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.700
not how much of this fat, how much of that fat,

137
00:07:55.701 --> 00:08:00.520
whether there's red meat or white meat or fish or whatever, it's the pattern.

138
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.370
<v 0>So we talk about like some conspiracy theories or something I've seen him kill</v>

139
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:08.390
himself. I don't think he did. Nope. I think he might not have maybe,

140
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.950
maybe the odds that he did. If you had a bet. If I was in Vegas,

141
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.630
I want to give you odds. Like, Hey,

142
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:19.400
the odds he did come on that 1,000 bucks, 10%,

143
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.270
10% is where I, where I've got it. I don't, I don't want to say it's like zero,

144
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:25.610
but I think it's like 10%. I think it's low.

145
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.510
So would you plunk down a hundred bucks on 10 to one odds that,

146
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.870
that he did kill himself? No.

147
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:37.130
Yeah, probably. Yeah. You'd want 10.

148
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:39.500
You'd want more than 10 to one that he did kill himself.

149
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.200
I think there's only a 10% chance he killed them.

150
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.560
So them with these numbers here. I'm making, I don't know how you're however,

151
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.920
you're conf converting it to odds. It's falling apart in my head. Sorry.

152
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.820
I get it. It doesn't seem going no way though.

153
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.950
It doesn't seem likely. No.

154
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.870
<v 5>I'm crazy.</v>

155
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 0>That you could still do that. Did.</v>

156
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.543
<v 5>You see the Ford?</v>

157
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.260
<v 0>Absolutely. Suicide guard say they're scapegoats for a broken system.</v>

158
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.590
<v 5>Well, that's a defense. The defense is just, we were incompetent.</v>

159
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.540
Not we killed him.

160
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.350
<v 0>Dude. Who knows? That's.</v>

161
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.660
<v 5>Some weird going on.</v>

162
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.970
<v 0>Right behind the scenes, man.</v>

163
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.120
What's going on behind the scenes that somebody could sneak somebody in to kill

164
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:23.820
somebody. If that's what happened, what's going on.

165
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.970
<v 5>Side person. They don't have, they don't have to sneak somebody in that.</v>

166
00:09:26.971 --> 00:09:29.520
Person's already inside. The cameras are off, bro. That's.

167
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.460
<v 0>Crazy. Cameras were off. Cameras.</v>

168
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.170
<v 5>Were off. Oops, sorry. Yeah, the cameras come on, bro.</v>

169
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.480
I have cameras at my house. They're never off.

170
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.410
<v 6>When the cameras are off too. I've heard, repeated a few times,</v>

171
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:45.240
but not more recently that there, uh,

172
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.170
there was screaming from itself that someone heard screaming.

173
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.750
That's not stop being repeated now. So.

174
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.010
<v 5>Bro, we live in a crazy world. Yeah. That's dark. Um,</v>

175
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.500
I don't know. Hi. You're way.

176
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.671
<v 0>It's just,</v>

177
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:07.440
that's probably the biggest public conspiracy theory that

178
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:08.610
most people believe in.

179
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.810
<v 5>Do you think most people believe it was a, it was a hit.</v>

180
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.710
<v 0>I would say most people when you get there, did,</v>

181
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:18.750
do you feel like everything's right.

182
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.880
Like when you finally got to your place and you finally started when you walked

183
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.850
60 miles out there and started living,

184
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:30.360
did you finally feel like I'm in my spot? This is where I'm supposed to be.

185
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.580
Oh yeah. Like you knew.

186
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.560
<v 7>I had literally been planning to do exactly that in the Brooks range for</v>

187
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:42.450
seven years. Like that's what I was doing every day was preparing to do that.

188
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:49.700
<v 0>Wow. But what was it about it that was so compelling?</v>

189
00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:53.060
Like why was that a thing that you were so drawn to?

190
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.970
<v 7>Because when I was living in the woods before that,</v>

191
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.120
when I was in the TP in Vermont, every single day,

192
00:11:02.121 --> 00:11:06.530
I'd wake up with a smile on my face. I'd just be excited. What was going on?

193
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.120
Get up, look out, see the fog coming up off the water on the lake,

194
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.500
you know? Oh wow. There's something over there. There's a loon, whatever it is.

195
00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:16.910
There's um,

196
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.140
I was just excited about what was going on out there and I just felt really

197
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:22.100
connected to it.

198
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.050
And there are a lot of really positive aspects to being out in the woods.

199
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.040
I mean just the physical part. Like I like to stay in shape.

200
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:34.910
I like to be active and you can't help, but be active out there. You can't help,

201
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:38.810
but stay in shape. Um, I like the diet. I mean,

202
00:11:38.811 --> 00:11:43.250
once I started eating animals, I killed myself and food that I collected myself,

203
00:11:43.251 --> 00:11:45.560
you know, plant food too. It was, um,

204
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.470
that was the best food I ever ate in my life.

205
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.130
When I ate that first moose I killed. I mean,

206
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.650
I never had anything better.

207
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.570
<v 0>Just a crazy way to live, man.</v>

208
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.660
It's interesting because most people would tell you, Hey, you gotta get a job.

209
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.400
You gotta, you gotta be a normal person. You can't just go out there and live.

210
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.650
<v 7>Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that's what I told him. I said,</v>

211
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:12.270
I'm going to make a career out of this now.

212
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.050
I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out. Um,

213
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.210
but I was always confident that it was a valuable thing to do and that it would

214
00:12:21.211 --> 00:12:22.650
not only benefit me,

215
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.670
but in the long run that I would be able to share this with people and that it

216
00:12:26.671 --> 00:12:30.390
would pay off. And it did. It just took time.
