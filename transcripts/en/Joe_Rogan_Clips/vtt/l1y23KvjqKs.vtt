00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>I just that, that there's something about cults and there's something about, um,</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.870
like seeing people just hook, line and sinker, roll out the red carpet here.

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.930
He comes here. He comes here. That stuff freaks me out.

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.190
That stuff freaks me out. I think because I've seen it.

5
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.620
I seen it with martial arts,

6
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.920
especially seen it all with a lot of,

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.570
a lot of the old school martial arts schools were very culty,

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.270
very culty. You know,

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.370
I don't know if you follow dojo life on Instagram, dude.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.760
I'm just going to give you a treat here. dojo.

11
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:43.680
Life is a awesome collection of the fakest martial arts you've ever

12
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:44.550
seen in your life.

13
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.590
And something about these videos is so compelling because these people who

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.010
are the students, they know the does not really work,

15
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.330
but they pretend that it works because they're just, they're in a cult.

16
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.480
You know? And this guy's like teaching people,

17
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.480
like if someone comes to grab him, like to try to take him down,

18
00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:05.970
like some wrestler, check it out. He's going to put his hand here.

19
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.350
Give me some volume on this. Jamie.

20
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.063
<v 1>Smaller.</v>

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.820
<v 0>Small intestine. It's going to get it right from the neck and.</v>

22
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.930
<v 2>Take the bladder.</v>

23
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.270
<v 0>The bladder point right.</v>

24
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.500
<v 2>Along the center.</v>

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.620
<v 0>Of the scalp. Just making up right here, dude. Just making up.</v>

26
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.600
So we'll get homeboy's mustache behind him. He comes in, touches him,

27
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.440
hits him here right here. That's all I need to do, bro.

28
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.950
Cain Velasquez shoots up power devil. Just put that left hand.

29
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.410
Look at that is chaos. He came out on bro, get him up.

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.710
This is important. Wow. He smacks the out of him.

31
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
And this guy really believes this. That's an anti Gracie movie. He says,

32
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.830
try that. Let me try that on Hanzo. You dummy.

33
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.090
There's so many of these, but this guy has like a,

34
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.160
an awesome collection of them. Look at this.

35
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.570
The guy gets out and throws everybody to the ground. Hi, yah. I'm a master.

36
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.590
Just walk it. This man. They're all, they're all grabbing him. And he's like,

37
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.160
but I have super powers and you don't.

38
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.750
They might as well be five.

39
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.080
They might as well be five-year-olds on a playground. And one of them pretends.

40
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:23.640
He's Dr. Strange. You grabbed me. I'm going to send you back to more door.

41
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.630
<v 1>Straight forward. It didn't even.</v>

42
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.500
<v 0>Move for him. Yeah. It's so stupid. It's so stupid. But this is what I'm saying.</v>

43
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.850
These are cults. This is there's something about this that freaks me the out.

44
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.720
And I,

45
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.430
my martial arts school that I started out in TaeKwonDo school was very strict as

46
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:45.230
a lot of discipline, but it wasn't really culty, but it was every, everyone is.

47
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.670
They're all a little culty. They're all a little culty.

48
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.490
Well there's master and Mister and all that stuff.

49
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:51.540
There's always a little bit of that,

50
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:55.590
but we would go to tournaments and then we would see it full on,

51
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.120
just full on cults.

52
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.550
Like one guy would be the Kung Fu master and have all the students had,

53
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.550
I'll be at his command and he'd be telling them what to do. They're like, yeah,

54
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.080
say they'd scream it out. And just like karate kid. There's a lot of them, man.

55
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.500
There's hundreds of these weird little schools that were run by people that were

56
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:12.670
running their own little cults,

57
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.290
at least at the tournament's like you guys are getting actually compete. Right?

58
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.050
So the kids, even though they're, they're like dogs,

59
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.930
they're well-trained you know, they always listen. Yes sir. Yes, sir.

60
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.810
They still get to get on the mat and they experience loss.

61
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:30.370
They experience some form of real worldliness. Right? For sure.

62
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:33.190
It's not like the dojo. Yeah, no, but it's,

63
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.160
what's stunning about [inaudible] life is how many of them there are,

64
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.860
I mean there's and they're making videos. This is the thing.

65
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:40.420
These people like scroll,

66
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:43.630
just scroll and show how many videos this guy's got up. I mean, who,

67
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.620
I don't even know how many there's probably hundreds, but the thing is,

68
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:49.210
this is just what's on video, man.

69
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.810
Understand how people that come to these places,

70
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.670
they don't ask for competition. They don't ask to see somebody.

71
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.750
They don't know any better, but they always, but is it always like, you know,

72
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.620
oh, if I did this to a man he'd die. You know? Like, is that, is that, oh,

73
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.980
look at this one. This guy, when a guy has a, is a knife to his neck,

74
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.160
he's going to smush the guy's hand with his chin. Watch this.

75
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.280
He's going to make the guy tap, check this out.

76
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.370
The guy's got a knife right to his neck. And he's like, but what you need to do,

77
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:25.930
try it on me. As soon as he gets that knife near me. Not the same spot.

78
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.630
That's not the same spot. Right? Watch this. He's going to say, okay, I give up,

79
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.010
but I will take my hand.

80
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.200
And then my chin or make your hand hurt. Like DAS,

81
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.330
watch this guy is dumb as.

82
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.170
Hurry up and get to it. Here he goes, look, he's making him tap.

83
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.330
He's grabbing his own hand. I grabbed his own head. Oh,

84
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.930
look at that. Look at that arm bar, ferocious, ferocious at no point in time,

85
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.920
would that guy been able to stop the out of him with that giant knife in his

86
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:07.030
hand, that's just a little bit more believable than the other one.

87
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.240
It was the one right next to it. Where the guy's on the, his knees there.

88
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.770
That one right there. Watch this one. This one's so stupid. I mean.

89
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.470
<v 2>You can't reach me. Reach me with that hand.</v>

90
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.460
Reach me with that.

91
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.590
<v 0>You.</v>

92
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.270
<v 2>Cannot, you can't.</v>

93
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.580
<v 0>Reach me with that as.</v>

94
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.610
<v 2>This reach me with that hand, reach me with that. And you cannot.</v>

95
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.090
<v 0>Oh, handlebar mustaches, like straight Benson.</v>

96
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.300
But this is why I think I get freaked out by cults.

97
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.270
Is that when I was a young teenager and I started doing martial arts,

98
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.180
I saw like certain elements of that. I, you know,

99
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:48.490
I went to Catholic school for just one year when I was young,

100
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:52.210
when I was seven first grade, actually six. Right. And, uh,

101
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.990
it was horrible. And I remember thinking like that,

102
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:58.550
I can't believe all these people are just doing this.

103
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.330
Like all these people were falling along. It was like, so awful. Okay.

104
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:04.280
Enough with the, I don't want to see any more of these.

105
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:08.720
I can't there's this doctor also stupid. He's got hunters of a man,

106
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.340
but um, I recognize that like when I was young, I was like, this is not,

107
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.360
this doesn't make sense. This is just, everybody's just going along with this.

108
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.450
This is normal to leave your kids with this mean, none.

109
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.810
And all these people are, everybody's like, stay in order.

110
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:27.680
Everyone's nasty to you. And they're hitting kids. Like it was awful.

111
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.810
And I remember thinking, man, uh,

112
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.470
there's something that happens to people when they get big groups of them

113
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:35.900
together and they agree on irrational has something,

114
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:39.590
some weird thing that happens to people where everybody, this can't be right.

115
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.860
That lady is not acting in the name of God. There's no way.

116
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.600
She's a crazy mean old lady.

117
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.590
And I got to listen to her because she works for God. This is nuts.

118
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.950
Can I talk to God? Does he know how she acts? You gotta talk to him. Yeah.

119
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.980
You gotta talk through her. She's a representative. I got a phone line.

120
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.970
Your parents take you there and drop you off and leave you with these monsters

121
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:02.210
all day. You're like what? And some of them got, right?

122
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.270
Some of them got molested, not just some of them, quite a few.

123
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.460
So I think I had a healthy respect for that and fear of

124
00:07:10.461 --> 00:07:11.960
that when I was really young.

125
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.370
And then I saw some of the same elements when I started doing martial arts,

126
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.250
particularly with like some of the more ridiculous, like,

127
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.760
like really rigid traditional type styles,

128
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:25.580
a lot of Kung Fu there was a lot of like, you know,

129
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.430
for every hundred martial arts schools,

130
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.340
you had three or four that were just flat out cults.

131
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.530
I just made those numbers up out of thin air,

132
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:38.700
who is the one 51% who was the guy? Um, I think it was,

133
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.040
it was in China. That up one of these fake oh, grandmasters.

134
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.660
Then he had to go into, yeah, it was guy two of them. Um,

135
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.340
one of them happened recently. It was it.

136
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.940
That was the guy with yellow sneakers on. Right. He was an MMA guy. Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:55.070
And he this guy up.

138
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.260
They all have like two strikes to dismantle that old fart. Yeah. I mean,

139
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:04.220
it's not, it's not fair. You're dealing with someone who's delusional,

140
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.890
but it is fair because we all need to see that.

141
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.860
Cause there's some people that really did believe that guy had magic powers

142
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.280
because they run a cult. Like these people that are doing all this death,

143
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:17.180
touch that when they see their students, like they fall down,

144
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.720
they believe that they're getting jolted in some weird might maybe not a hundred

145
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:23.630
percent, but there's a small percentage of their brain.

146
00:08:23.631 --> 00:08:25.520
That's willing to not just go along with it.

147
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:29.360
But to believe this guy is something special. That guy with the yellow sneakers,

148
00:08:29.361 --> 00:08:30.550
didn't give a about that.

149
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:34.940
He just beat the out of that dude and for everybody else. But that dude,

150
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.450
that's good. You know, for that guy to,

151
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:42.260
to find out that he's not really some possessor of magic powers. I mean,

152
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:45.620
if he really did believe it, here it is. Oh, red sneakers. Different ones.

153
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.210
Maybe. No, this is it. This is it.

154
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.690
He just beats the out of this dude. I mean, real quick, he just storms him.

155
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.800
Boom, hit some of the right hand, boom,

156
00:08:55.801 --> 00:09:00.360
another right hand and just get some on the ground and beats the out of them.

157
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.020
I mean,

158
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.810
this is like maybe six or seven seconds before they stop at he's out cold.

159
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.060
Have those mats in my house. Puzzle mats. Yeah. They're in the living room.

160
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.520
My chair. I check her like that too. Oh,

161
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.080
you're an animal you keep in the living room.

162
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.560
That's the way we can just cook and do yoga. We can roll.

163
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.270
That's hard to wrestle with my son. There.

164
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.370
You'd freak people out if they came into your house,

165
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.740
if you're new in the neighborhood. So, uh,

166
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.290
you hang out with me for a minute in the living room.

167
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:29.220
Come on over and have some cacao dip into my garden. Cow. Yeah.

168
00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:33.540
It's like a mile dose of MDMs. Hey, look at my living room. It's wrestling mats,

169
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.470
nothing creepy about that.
