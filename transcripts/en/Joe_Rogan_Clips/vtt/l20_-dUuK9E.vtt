00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.120
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So speaking of Colts,</v>

2
00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:09.120
I was just thinking about this because I ended up on a cult kind of like

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.400
accidentally, I didn't have a place to stay. No,

4
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.400
I was talking to Sam Harris yesterday and we were talking about all of his time.

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.840
I didn't know that he spent like 10 years as like a wandering hippie.

6
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.910
I had no idea. Yeah. And, um, India. And so I was like,

7
00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:24.750
you know how a lot of people don't get out.

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.990
And when I was traveling for two years around the world,

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.350
I ended up on a lot of ashrams and one of them was an OSHA ashram,

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:32.184
which was that.

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.070
<v 0>Really. So I came into my room, I wrote a whole piece about it from mal mag.</v>

13
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.950
<v 1>Is leaking out of your body. And.</v>

14
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.260
<v 0>So I walked into my here, I walked into my roommate,</v>

15
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.620
Samantha Shahi who's amazing was watching the documentary and there was this

16
00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:52.700
like exercise where they dance and you go, who, who, who, who,

17
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:56.260
and it's the meditation that they made up. And I'm like, oh, I've done that.

18
00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.020
And they're naked. And she's like a course. You've done this, Bridget.

19
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.930
And I sat down, I'm like, oh my God, this is it. Wasn't OSHA.

20
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:08.530
Cause he's obviously dead. But it was his lineage and it was, it was wild.

21
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.730
It was, I was there for like three weeks. &lt;laugh&gt;.

22
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.730
<v 1>Wow. But was documentary, give your name, great.</v>

23
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.290
<v 0>New name. Uh, Sarita. Pre Sarita's. It means river of love.</v>

24
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.000
Oh yeah. But he called as gum bag. Did he? Why?

25
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.000
Because they break you down in front of people and you, you know me,

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.960
I couldn't stop laughing. And so he was like, you are a scumbag.

27
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.920
<v 1>Wait a minute. Who is, is this guy you gotta explain.</v>

28
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.800
<v 0>To me, he looks like.</v>

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800
<v 1>A guru. Like, like how it got a beard, like long hair.</v>

30
00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.600
<v 0>He was tan. He said that he was 80,</v>

31
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.000
but it came out that he was actually 60 &lt;laugh&gt;.

32
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.390
<v 1>So it's like, look how good I look.</v>

33
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.950
<v 0>And he's like, look at the shape I'm in from being here and eating,</v>

34
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.230
cuz they want you to stay.

35
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.070
And he was trying to like break me down psychologically.

36
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.830
But I think my brain is like too dirty to be washed. I just.

37
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.670
<v 1>Don't think that's a great way of putting it. I.</v>

38
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.500
<v 0>Don't think that it, it is capable. And so he was like,</v>

39
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.460
you are a scumbag out there. You don't have work. And I was like,

40
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.100
actually you're pretty right. And he is like, say it, say you are a scumbag.

41
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.500
And I had to yell, I am a scumbag in front of this whole group of strangers.

42
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.100
That's.

43
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.180
<v 1>So funny. That's so funny. It was wild.</v>

44
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.780
So this guy who was breaking down, was he socially inept? Like,

45
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.970
was it an awkward breakdown? No. No, you didn't. You didn't buy into it.

46
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.530
You just sort of went around with it for fun. I mean.

47
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.210
<v 0>I'm very curious. Right? So I like, I think the writer and me,</v>

48
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.490
and we talked about this last time, just that the, when I was like the,

49
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.250
the third and the open marriage.

50
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.090
So I remember vividly sitting just on their couch and being like, ah,

51
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:45.680
should I do this? It's so weird. But then, but it's such a great story.

52
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.793
&lt;laugh&gt; and same,

53
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.560
this whole thing happened because I was with the Sydney trust fund baby.

54
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.960
And he needed somebody to drive up to Byron bay with him. And I he's like, oh,

55
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:58.000
it's no problem. You'll find a place to stay. And there was nowhere to stay.

56
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:01.240
And he was off on boys' week in Byron bay during like Christmas.

57
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.600
I knew no speaking of knowing nobody,

58
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.120
I went to Australia on a one way ticket and knew nobody. And so I was like, I'm.

59
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.080
<v 1>One way ticket. &lt;laugh&gt; God, that's such a crazy move. How old were you? 28?</v>

60
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.120
<v 0>No, I was 30, 33. I called it 33. Yeah. And so 33.</v>

61
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.630
Yeah. I just went, it was, uh, I had been in LA kind of grinding and I,

62
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.510
and I was like, if I don't travel now I I'm. One.

63
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.550
<v 1>Way ticket is a wild move. I.</v>

64
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.590
<v 0>Do it a lot. Really a lot. Yeah. A lot. I'm kind of,</v>

65
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:31.424
so you have to figure out how.

66
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.990
<v 1>To get back, but imagine if COVID broke out right. When you landed.</v>

67
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.830
<v 0>Australia, I suck. I was stuck in, in, um, India was seven.</v>

68
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.740
I had to have somebody like buy me a ticket out that, that time an ex-boyfriend.

69
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.780
Thank you, Casey.

70
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.580
<v 1>Oh, wow. Shout out to Casey.</v>

71
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.220
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; shout out to Casey. Well, that's nice that he did that.</v>

72
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.630
Getting me outta.

73
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.860
<v 1>India. What did they do before? Like in the old days.</v>

74
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.380
<v 0>India's basically like the old days when you travel there.</v>

75
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.210
<v 1>You know what I mean? If like you needed a ticket in like the, oh,</v>

76
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.090
I don't know what the would you do?

77
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.450
<v 0>My dad traveled around the world when he was in his twenties and</v>

78
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.610
I was like, how did you do it? You know? He's like, oh, you know, we,

79
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.130
I wouldn't talk to my parents for, they have no idea where you are. Right.

80
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.130
I mean, they, you have to just do everything by paper.

81
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.360
You look for bus schedules and you get there. You know,

82
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.360
you go find a hotel when you arrive in the city. Yeah. It's crazy.

83
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.040
<v 1>How about hitchhikers? Like hitchhikers are the craziest ever.</v>

84
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:34.240
Like let's just randomly hope this person who's just gonna randomly pick me up.

85
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.760
Is he gonna kill me? Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. And then you would read stories.

86
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.280
You'd read stories about this guy,

87
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.350
kidnapped this girl and cut her hair hands off. Like what? God. No.

88
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.030
<v 0>What the? That's my biggest I'm I'm so afraid of, of that.</v>

89
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.390
Of like, that's always been in my most recent podcast.

90
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.590
I did every once in a while I do story hours where my cousin Maggie interviews

91
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:59.870
me and I was telling Al about my traveling and she was asking me and it turns

92
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.500
out I have like four new are abduction stories I completely forgot about, but I,

93
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.020
I have this, I have that fear, but it's also been reinforced by, oh.

94
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.060
<v 1>So when you joined this cult yeah. And they, they, they break you down,</v>

95
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:15.980
they say, you asked, come back. How what's this accent? Like, what was it.

96
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.380
<v 0>Like? It was a weird accent because he was from Italy originally. Oh.</v>

97
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.490
<v 1>And then he, how much of cult was about banging a lot.</v>

98
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.810
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; but I didn't, I only had one cult boyfriend,</v>

99
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.770
but he encouraged polyamory. And I think my cult boyfriend saved me,

100
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.690
my cult boyfriend. I mean, um, why did he save you? Well, because he was, uh,

101
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.090
he had just come there to kinda recharge.

102
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.720
He was in getting his degree in philosophy and he had occasionally come and he

103
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:44.760
was a musician and then he left and went to Melbourne.

104
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.640
And then I went back into the city to drop him off and we weren't allowed to

105
00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:53.320
drink or anything. And this is when I was still partying, like, um,

106
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.360
a legend and &lt;laugh&gt;

107
00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.200
and I got three bottles of wine and I drank an entire bottle of wine in the

108
00:06:02.201 --> 00:06:02.420
park.

109
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.400
And then my friend came and took me back to the ashram and I was hammered and

110
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:11.280
I was crying and making a scene and, and he was like, what are you drinking?

111
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.920
And he said, do you have enough for the rest of everyone? So then everyone,

112
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.390
Dr. Then he let everyone drink was weird. Yeah. Then it became like a,

113
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.310
it was a weird thing. You guys started partying. But then I left, I,

114
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.670
I was texting my, I call him SI trust one, boy. I was like,

115
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.830
kept me the outta here. I want a steak. We, it was during the, um,

116
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.790
playoffs and the, I think the Patriots were in.

117
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.750
And so I was breaking into bars up and down, like Byron,

118
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:40.420
very they to try and see the playoffs. It was wild. That was.

119
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.603
<v 1>What did they eat?</v>

120
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.260
<v 0>Oh, so we had to wake up at five and we didn't have,</v>

121
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.860
we had a, it was a wood grill. We had a grill, but we put wood in it.

122
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.220
And that was how we cooked everything, cooked, everything over.

123
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.250
So we had to get his fire started. It was all the, again, um, with some,

124
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.170
like if we got cheese was like a treat and, um,

125
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.970
we would have to get the fire going to even like make coffee or Poage or

126
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.450
anything. And then we'd make lunch right after breakfast was done.

127
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.370
And then there was no dinner, just like whatever was left over from lunch.

128
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.970
<v 1>Really mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so it didn't eat for.</v>

129
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.120
<v 0>And we had to do four hours of work to stay on the Astrom like hard manual</v>

130
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.000
labor. &lt;laugh&gt;.

131
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
<v 1>Four hours a day. Yeah. Just for.</v>

132
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
<v 0>Your room and board in the Bush. In the Australian Bush. Wow.</v>

133
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:33.840
Like what kind of stuff? Well, there was this Malaysian way of raking.

134
00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:36.680
That was really interesting where we would mow,

135
00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.070
but then you'd rake it all into and you'd have to put it in a tarp and take it

136
00:07:41.071 --> 00:07:42.350
all way out of these fields.

137
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.870
And it was like a really interesting way of taking away all the scraps.

138
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.123
We had cold showers,

139
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.990
there were all kinds of bugs and trying to kill me all the time. Um,

140
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:56.470
it was wild. It was a wild, it was a wild experience.

141
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.020
And God there were so much drama because everybody was swapping partners.

142
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.140
&lt;laugh&gt; like so much drama.

143
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:06.180
It was supposed to be this place where you go and meditate and get in touch.

144
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:08.100
And it was like, as the TP turns,

145
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.500
it was just like non &lt;laugh&gt;

146
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.260
nonstop drama with like all the, and he encouraged it and loved it. And that's,

147
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:22.130
what's weird about these place is they use that to manipulate you and to

148
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.070
staying.

149
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:26.530
<v 1>Oh my God. Have you ever talked to Adam ETT about his cult experiences? No.</v>

150
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.010
Yeah. You know, Adam from the comedy store. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he?

151
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.810
He's the creative director, the comedy store.

152
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.730
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he's coming on the podcast soon to

153
00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:34.610
talk. I love Adam. I love Adam too. Yeah.

154
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.770
He's the best he he's he's got a crazy cult background. No way. Yeah.

155
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.200
My friend Todd, who's a great guy. Like not a cult member at all.

156
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.480
It's just super normal guy. He watched the first, uh,

157
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.920
episode of wild wild country. And he was like, this looks great.

158
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.680
&lt;laugh&gt; he was like, they're having so much fun. I go, I know. I know.

159
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:58.240
But stay with it. &lt;laugh&gt; stay with it. Cuz in the beginning you're like,

160
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.440
oh yeah, like regular life is. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like our society is. Yeah.

161
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:04.960
Wouldn't it be great. We just, well,

162
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.000
all loved each other and we all embraced our fears and understood our, our,

163
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.080
our position in the universe and we're kind to each other and, and, and let go,

164
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.870
let go of all this fear and our, this and what,

165
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.830
what better way to do it than to get a bunch of like-minded people and move to

166
00:09:18.831 --> 00:09:19.630
a, a spot in.

167
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.590
<v 0>Oregon? Well, that was that in the piece I wrote about it.</v>

168
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.470
I said I had a lot of conflicting feelings because it's amazing how quickly my

169
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.390
bio rhythms adjusted to waking up at five or six, you know,

170
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.900
living just the lack of waste. We had the compostable toilets,

171
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.180
so that poor, the poo became manure, you know, like manure &lt;laugh&gt; um,

172
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.900
this was the same on the weed farms too.

173
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.220
And it's nice to just not feel like you're,

174
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:49.420
you're creating all that waste because I know that every time I get like a

175
00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:53.180
package from Amazon, I'm like, Ugh, right, this is not sustainable. Right.

176
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.380
It's all waste. It's just
