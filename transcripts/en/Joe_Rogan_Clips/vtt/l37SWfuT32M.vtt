<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 1>Experience. I want an eye.</v>

3
00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.640
I want to know how the divorce laws came to be.

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.510
I do. I want to know, I, somebody must have written a book on it.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
I just want to know how we got to this place where, um,

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.420
you know, first of all,

7
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:22.410
this idea that you have to live in the style of what you become accustomed.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.790
<v 0>I help you here. I can help you in a couple, couple ways. Here's the big one.</v>

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.350
Lawyers make a lot of money. If there's a large settlement.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.460
So.

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.450
<v 1>It's lawyers. Yes.</v>

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.440
<v 0>Lawyers don't make a lot of money. If there's no settlement, you know,</v>

13
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.910
Phil Hartman, when he was getting divorced,

14
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.180
one of the things that he said to me, I go, dude, just give her half, come on,

15
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.420
man. You make a lot of money. He goes, it's not half. It was crazy. He's like,

16
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:48.690
it's two thirds. He goes, I'll lawyers get a third. It's got dams gambling.

17
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.050
And I've had friends that have gotten divorced. And even though they were,

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.730
they had come to an agreement with the acts like, let's listen, will this, this,

19
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.310
and you'll get this and I'll get this fine. Then the lawyers jump in.

20
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.130
He's trying to you. And this no, they're trying to you over. You got to.

21
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.080
<v 1>It's exactly the plot of the movie, marriage, WC and marriage story. Oh,</v>

22
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.240
it's terrific. I was, again,

23
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:13.980
it at the beginning because it was about an actress

24
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.160
and a theater director and I was like, Jesus Christ.

25
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.090
Can't you at least pretend that there are people in America,

26
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:25.530
not outside of your exact circle. There've been so many big movies, you know,

27
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:29.640
that are just about your world of show business, have a little creativity,

28
00:01:29.641 --> 00:01:32.040
make them something else, but okay. I got over that.

29
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.690
And then it's just a terrific movie about it. There's no bells and whistles.

30
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
It's just, we're married. We seem very happy. And then, well,

31
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.480
we're not happy and we're going to get divorced. And then, um,

32
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.980
we're going to just, just do it amicably and not getting lawyers involved.

33
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:52.890
And then it all falls apart. And once it goes down,

34
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:54.390
that path that you're talking about,

35
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.280
it just becomes as vicious as anything without guns.

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.480
<v 0>I had a friend who got divorced and no, no family. Okay.</v>

37
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.330
No children didn't have children. And, uh,

38
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.800
it dragged on for more than I think almost three years.

39
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.590
And even though they had come to some sort of conclusion,

40
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.190
he was paying for his wife's lawyer. I go, it's like,

41
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.460
you're paying for the general of the army. That's trying to kill you.

42
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.390
You're paying.

43
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.680
<v 1>For someone to you in the. Yeah. You're getting in the, bro.</v>

44
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.770
I have seen so many men broken bias stated every time somebody

45
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:33.840
says, uh, you know, they,

46
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.230
people unfortunately get a horrible disease like cancer. And they say,

47
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.340
I couldn't have gotten through it without my wife. I always think. Yeah.

48
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.330
And maybe she gave it to you. I don't mean of course, literally,

49
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.860
but I just mean that when you're in a bad relationship, the stress,

50
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.270
we don't know what contributes all the things to cancer,

51
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.410
but that certainly is I'm sure one of them and then going through a

52
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:03.490
divorce like that, I've seen people, like you say, just broken.

53
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.960
<v 0>They get wrecked. And it's a system.</v>

54
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.650
The reason why the divorce laws are set up the way they're set up, people think,

55
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.870
oh, we're protecting women horseshit.

56
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.190
They're doing it so that they can extract the maximum amount of money out of the

57
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:19.600
mail. That way the lawyer gets the biggest chunk that they could possibly get.

58
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.050
Most lawyers have a working on a percentage basis, right?

59
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.620
Especially if a woman doesn't have as much money or if she's, you know, the,

60
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.200
the lawyer will come to our look, we've got a deal here. We'll,

61
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.450
we'll figure this out. Don't pay me now.

62
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.970
We're going to make sure we get you the most.

63
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.680
We'll we'll take care of it all in the end.

64
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.860
And this is what has happened to several of my friends that have been divorced.

65
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.910
And you know what it is once you see it, what I get and I understand,

66
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:47.590
and I accept and I, uh, I support is child support. I mean,

67
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:51.190
I've, I grew up with a deadbeat dad. My dad never paid for.

68
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.200
And I have many friends that have also experienced a lot of financial hardship

69
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.710
growing up because their dad was a piece of and didn't want to pay for their

70
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.830
children. But people very close to me, including my wife.

71
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.750
But when there's a big difference between that,

72
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.530
a man taking responsibility for his children is a big difference between that.

73
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.020
And alimony, alimony is creepy.

74
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.500
There's something creepy about like my friend, like I said,

75
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:21.850
didn't even have a child with this woman. He is still paying her by the way,

76
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.103
this the same guy,

77
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.090
very good friend of mine has been divorced for 14 years has been

78
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.360
married for 12 to a new woman,

79
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.980
still paying the old woman. And my joke was like, you her so hard.

80
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.300
She can't work. Like she literally can't work. Cause he he's a wealthy man.

81
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.410
He made good money and he works really hard. He's uh, he's,

82
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:48.070
he's not in the business. He's a, he, you know, he has a real job and he works,

83
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.320
you know, long hours every day.

84
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.090
And he has his own business and he has to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars

85
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.730
to someone he doesn't even talk to anymore because he used to fight.

86
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.920
<v 1>Guys. Couldn't ya? I knew of a guy who was a doctor who</v>

87
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.770
went to jail every night because he couldn't make the payments. Oh God.

88
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.980
And they would like let him out on weekends to do rounds and stuff.

89
00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:14.020
But he was it's.

90
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.120
<v 0>I got a better one for you. I want to get in. Great. Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.570
Dave Foley who's on news radio. Sure.

92
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.830
When he was getting divorced was when he was on news radio.

93
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.160
So it was a financial peak, you know, he was a star of the show.

94
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:28.480
He's making a lot of money.

95
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.700
And so his payments to that were set up for that. Sure.

96
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.160
So this is in Canada, right? And he,

97
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.190
the judge tells him why he's he tells the judge,

98
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.660
I don't make that kind of money anymore.

99
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:42.460
That was an extraordinary time in my life.

100
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.580
It's very hard to make that kind of money. You know, I'm an actor. I just,

101
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.450
the doctors,

102
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.370
the judge rather says your ability to pay has no relation

103
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:52.990
to your obligation to pay.

104
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.250
<v 1>Now think of that. Just pause here for a moment.</v>

105
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.430
What a statement and where else would we say?

106
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:02.683
<v 0>It's insane.</v>

107
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.010
And we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars,

108
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.390
hundreds of thousands. Like as if he supposed to conjure this up,

109
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.090
like his career is about, was supposed to magically resurrected,

110
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.880
wrecked itself in some reading and financial.

111
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.950
<v 1>It's usually the man still who probably has the more money and is paying the</v>

112
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:22.820
woman. Yes.

113
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.980
It's very inaccurate to stick to how we have come to think about women as equal

114
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.140
and strong and able to do everything we can do. But when it comes to this,

115
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.250
it's like, ah, we got to take care of them, but they're suddenly there.

116
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.960
It's like a very dependent.

117
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.520
<v 0>I think it's a scam that's set up because the men in general are in control of</v>

118
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.820
the finances or make more money and they can extract more money from.

119
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.710
<v 1>Them. Turning it down. Yeah.</v>

120
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.530
<v 0>I mean, that's, that's why the system, I think is set up the way it's set up.</v>

121
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.670
It's it's dark, man. I mean the only time it's happened,

122
00:06:55.671 --> 00:06:58.790
the other way that I know of is Tom Arnold, Tom. Oh.

123
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.250
<v 1>Yes, it does. It does.</v>

124
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.270
<v 0>Even the other one. He's one for the males. Right? We got one on the board.</v>

125
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.090
There's like, if the board was like, here, it was,

126
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.070
it would be a billion scratches on one side and four lines

127
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.920
of the one through it. And then next to it, there's like Tom Arnold.

128
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.900
<v 1>I never uncouple of the dudes never understood the concept of marriage</v>

129
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.980
because when people would say, why don't you want to get married? I'd say,

130
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:29.780
why would I invite the federal and state government into my

131
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:30.770
love life. Very important.

132
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.090
<v 0>Well, you have to have it. Otherwise. It's not real.</v>

133
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.830
If you don't get it signed piece of paper, what the do you have?

134
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.280
<v 1>Just your feelings for that other part.</v>

135
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.200
<v 0>Good enough. How should I tell her friends?</v>

136
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.460
She's got to tell her friends that he really cares brainwashed.

137
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.070
<v 1>But he really.</v>

138
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.903
<v 0>Cares.</v>

139
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.810
<v 1>I think you can see she's trained you to say the right answer. Well,</v>

140
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.830
I think that's how crazy. I think that's a crazy backward way to look at it.

141
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:00.530
That without the piece of paper, it's not real. It's not real.

142
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:04.820
Whatever you have with someone emotionally, uh, that's rich, real.

143
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.190
The paper is what's fake the paper.

144
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.310
<v 0>I'd be worried about divorce. Cause we're never getting divorced.</v>

145
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.650
I'm not worried about you. You're doing like, why,

146
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.980
why you're getting so upset about this bill? Just sign the paper. Okay.

147
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.230
Get married. We're going to be together forever.

148
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.460
I don't know what you are worried about.

149
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.970
Jesus Christ and freaking out about don't. You love me.

150
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.090
You're freaking out about a divorce. We're not getting divorced.

151
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.830
We love each other. God sign it. And then when you sign it,

152
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.100
the darkness clouds roll over. Ha.

153
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.520
<v 1>But also like humans change. It's like we,</v>

154
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.460
so it's so funny when you're you can say about anything else. Well,

155
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:42.710
I'm not married to it. You know? Do you want that thing there?

156
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.300
I'm not married to it, but with a human, the thing that's most malleable,

157
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.600
we're like, yep. I'm going to marry you. Well, but you know what?

158
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:52.790
For some people that works fantastically.

159
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.840
<v 0>Term limits, they have a marriage terms. I don't think.</v>

160
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 1>That's a real thing. I think it is.</v>

161
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:03.960
<v 0>Good. Yeah. Google it. Some countries have like a tr we did this before, right?</v>

162
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.550
Yeah. It's real. Some countries have like, you could get married for like seven,

163
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.480
seven years. Yeah. And you can decide at the end of it, you're like, look,

164
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.430
I think we're good. Let's get out of here.

165
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.810
<v 1>Yeah. Well, but that's putting a level of logic into it.</v>

166
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:22.800
That's probably not going to really obtain when the moment comes.

167
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:25.110
Because by that time you're so codependent.

168
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.900
<v 0>Those are not going to tolerate that. They're gonna, let me ask you this.</v>

169
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:32.400
How long have you been with bill? And he wants a term limit, right? Like God,

170
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:34.620
you guys are gonna be together for forever. What are you doing?

171
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.040
Get the term on it. Because if you stuck with Dave, I bet Dave, what? Nasser?

172
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.970
He's not like that. Dave might be a little boring. Maybe it's not as funny,

173
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.710
but he's a solid guy. And you would assign the contract. You'd be fine, girl.

174
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.420
<v 1>It's really fine.</v>

175
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.050
It's like when agents are competing to sign you and they're like,

176
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.210
you didn't read for that. Oh, I could have gotten it yet.

177
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.060
<v 0>Yes. There's a financial incentive with anything things,</v>

178
00:09:57.061 --> 00:09:59.010
get squirrely what I'm saying.

179
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.450
<v 1>Yeah. But it also, you know, I remember you, it's funny.</v>

180
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:04.590
You mentioned Tom Arnold.

181
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.270
I had him on the very first episode of politically incorrect,

182
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.290
I think with Roseanne and they were talking about marriage and he said,

183
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:15.720
the great thing about marriage is, uh,

184
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:20.190
when you have a big fight and somebody says, I'm leaving, you can go. You can't,

185
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:25.140
we're married. And I got what he was saying. Some people like that,

186
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.220
that you have this,

187
00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:31.140
this self-imposed barrier that makes it more difficult.

188
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.470
It's like a waiting period with guns, you know?

189
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.480
Or when they make you look at the sonogram,

190
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:38.400
when you want an abortion in some states,

191
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:43.080
look at your baby on the computer screen there and tell them,

192
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.930
come back tomorrow and tell me, you want to kill that kid. You know,

193
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:48.690
you have a waiting period. You have to cool off. You can't just leave.

194
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.110
Whereas if you're not married, you can write unless you live together,

195
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:55.740
that's more complicated or kids and more complicated. But yeah.
