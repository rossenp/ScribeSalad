00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.560
<v 1>Experience. It's swear. You brought up like,</v>

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.760
I have friends who love stuff that I hate, but I don't give a.

4
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.560
The reason my special is called, I love everything is when you get to age 50,

5
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.600
there's still stuff that annoys you and stuff you don't like, but you're like,

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.840
but I know where this is coming or I, or I know why he's acting that way or I,

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.910
yeah, like, I, I don't, I'm not a fan OFM, Trump. I think he's horrible.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.270
But I also know about his childhood and how he was raised.

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.070
And I know why he is the way he is. He grew up in a monster factory. Yeah.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.310
&lt;laugh&gt; and it was really well run monster factory.

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.190
And it made an incredible monster. Like I know why he is the way he is.

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.500
So you can only go. So like, hatred is a luxury for youth. When you're young,

13
00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:46.180
you can go, this is. And then you get to 50. You're like, it's not for me,

14
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:47.940
but I don't care. Okay, fine. You.

15
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.580
<v 0>Know what? I also think it is. I talk about this often that, uh,</v>

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.700
you have children, you have child. I have daughters.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.980
And when I think of people now, I think of them as babies that grew up.

18
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.930
And when I was younger, I used to think if I, if I knew do you, now I know,

19
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.130
I think, oh, pat has always been this patent, but now I can see,

20
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:11.570
because I've seen little babies become little people and I go, oh, oh, okay.

21
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.290
You just got terrible input, terrible feedback, bad epigenetics.

22
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.570
Lot of wrong here. You're a victim of circumstance. As much as you are,

23
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.360
you know, being an. You're, you're actually,

24
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.080
you're the reason why you're an is cuz you're a victim. The case in a lot of,

25
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.113
a lot of times.

26
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.680
<v 1>Yeah. And sometimes people can become an.</v>

27
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.480
Obviously some people can become an because Trump had a lifetime of systematic

28
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.430
abuse, but also people can become horrible for, from having one bad day.

29
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.110
One bad day can set you the wrong direction. Yeah. So you,

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.270
but it's not till you get older where you suffer all those blows and setbacks

31
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.350
and reversals of fortune that you go, okay.

32
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.230
Let's maybe give someone a little bit of breathing room. Yes.

33
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.470
Even if they're being horrible, think about why they're being doing this.

34
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.660
You know, that's just how it is. Well, I also, you have.

35
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.540
<v 0>Otherwise you can't live. It's also,</v>

36
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.900
it's not beneficial to anybody to be confrontational and to be angry

37
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:14.220
about things all the time. I mean, even though it seems fun when you're young,

38
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.780
as you get older, you realize it's a, a terrible way of using your resources.

39
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.660
And it also, it doesn't create any harmony.

40
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.450
It just makes the people on the other side fight back harder.

41
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.210
Like there's no middle ground given. There's no compromise.

42
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.890
There's no forgiveness. There's no Equin Amity. There's no,

43
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:37.410
there's no moment where you feel like this is a human being.

44
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.850
And I'm a human being and I make mistakes and they make mistakes and let's

45
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:43.850
figure out how we could be nicer to each other. I mean,

46
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.720
that's what everybody would like. That's what everybody would like, the hardest.

47
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 1>The hardest thing to do.</v>

48
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.000
And you're gonna fail a lot of times trying to like keep trying.

49
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.040
Cause otherwise the only other option is the person who's you off actually

50
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.120
wins and takes over space in your mind and stops you doing the you need to do.

51
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.040
Yeah. If you're living a then centered life or a spike centered life, ah,

52
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.240
then that person runs your, that other person runs your life.

53
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.240
And think of all the jokes and albums and movies or whatever you were gonna do

54
00:03:12.241 --> 00:03:15.160
that you never did as you were focused on them. That's.

55
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.920
<v 0>Really common. You know?</v>

56
00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:18.950
And there's a lot of people that are doing that with Trump.

57
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.950
There's a lot of people that follow on Twitter while just go their,

58
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:25.630
their Twitter feed. It's just, just railing about Trump all day.

59
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.510
And I wanna go over their house and you can't anymore, but hug him and go,

60
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:32.310
Hey man, you gotta stop paying attention to this.

61
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.790
Like you're you're how much time do you have in a day?

62
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.900
How much time is spent on things you hate much time is spent

63
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:43.500
on things you love. You need to figure out a way to shift that.

64
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.940
<v 1>For me, hating Trump has become like a glass of wine.</v>

65
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.540
I indulge in it every now and then I enjoy it when he does something really

66
00:03:50.541 --> 00:03:51.160
crazy.

67
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.100
And also every now and every now and then you need to check in and go just,

68
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:56.100
what am I? You, this isn't normal. This shouldn't be happening.

69
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.500
Let's not get used to this. But then also, yeah,

70
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.890
I promote other other people stuff. I signal boost other comedians.

71
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.250
I retweet really funny tweet like that. Al has to be fun because you're right.

72
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.851
There are,

73
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.730
there are people that I love whose Twitter feeds have just devolved into.

74
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.090
Can you believe? Yes. Yeah. I, I would have a bit about,

75
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.570
am I special about how I don't have any Trump jokes because he's made comedians

76
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:23.080
obsolete. How do you write a joke funnier than this he's doing in front of us?

77
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.920
You know, it's like, he's doing this crazy and then you walk up,

78
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.840
you wanna hear a joke? I wrote about this. Everyone's like, no, I'm just,

79
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.920
I'm watching this. I'm I'm good. Well.

80
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.160
<v 0>It's all the things too.</v>

81
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.800
It's the tan and the hair and the madness and the not willing to admit that he's

82
00:04:36.801 --> 00:04:40.360
ever wrong. And it's like, Jesus Christ. This is, I know.

83
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.350
<v 1>Someone put this out as a joke. The other day was like a little graphic,</v>

84
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.110
but it is true. You know how he won't wear a mask? Yeah.

85
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.590
It'll rub the makeup off. Oh yeah, for sure. And put that as a joke.

86
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.470
He can't put a mask on because yeah. He takes it off.

87
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:57.510
He'll have this weird and he knows he, he can't do it. I bet.

88
00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:00.350
On the first day he tried to do it and went, uh, no, we can't do it. Sorry.

89
00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:00.660
Yeah.

90
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.740
<v 0>Well, why didn't Pence wear it in that, that one time,</v>

91
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.300
remember when everybody was wearing it, the Mayo clinic and he didn't.

92
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.340
<v 1>I feel like Trump bullied him. I feel like Trump was like,</v>

93
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:13.660
you're not gonna go out there with a masks. Are you, you make me look bad NCE,

94
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.020
you know, I'm too terrified.
