00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. &lt;laugh&gt;,</v>

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.800
bank's too big to fail. If the banks failed and the people fail people.

3
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.840
<v 1>That's, unbelievunbelievable manunbelievable and all this that we're spent.</v>

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.000
I mean, the veenezuela, all these sanctions, uh,

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.800
it is the venicenezuelala coup I mean, were you following that? That was insane.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.200
Well.

7
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.430
<v 0>I was it as much as you were sort of putting all as much,</v>

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.230
you were putting a very alternative view mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, uh,

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.190
as opposed to like what we're seeing in either left or right.

10
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.550
Wing publications mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you were, and,

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.510
and you faced a lot of resistance because of that. Right, right, right.

12
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.563
But you were there.

13
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.300
<v 1>Yes. Yes. I was there. And that's why I, I knew with my own, I mean,</v>

14
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.620
I saw with my own eyes, the reality on the ground. And.

15
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.500
<v 0>What do you think is happening over there?</v>

16
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.940
<v 1>So what is happening over there? I mean, if you pull Venezuelans themselves,</v>

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.340
they will say that their quality of life has lessened because of us sanctions.

18
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.780
So back in 2015, Obama declared Venezuelan national security threat,

19
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.810
very ran am. There was no threat, obviously posed to the us,

20
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.090
but it was just to kind of start the sanctions on them.

21
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:11.730
But what was the justifi justification? Who knows, who knows pressure?

22
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.320
I mean,

23
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.330
there's always been pressure because of course the us has always hated Maduro

24
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.930
and hated Huggo Chavez and the us empirere doesn't forget.

25
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:20.890
And it doesn't forgive. And, you know,

26
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:25.480
going back to 2000 who Bush tried to engineer coup against hug go Chavaz that

27
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:25.940
didn't work.

28
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.680
And so what we've done with these civil society organizations is try to foment

29
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.520
radical discontent on the ground in Venezuela to try to, you know,

30
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.920
get some sort of uprising. Um, the guy,

31
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.000
Juan wado was just some guy plucked from obscurity who was just well known

32
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.750
in George town in Washington, DC,

33
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.310
much more well known there than he was even in Venezuela. So, you know,

34
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:52.510
this was completely engineered. It was totally concocted. No Venezuelans really,

35
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:53.703
um, knew who he was.

36
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.310
I think like 80% of Venezuelan had no idea who Juan waido was, but, um,

37
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.831
you know,

38
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:03.580
the economy went into a spiral because oilpri prices dropped and they would've

39
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:05.060
been able to pick back up their economy.

40
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.500
But unfortunately the sanctions were so debilitating that it went into complete

41
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.740
free fall. Um, Venezuela's not a socialist country.

42
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.780
That's actually the vast majority is private industry. And a lot of those, um,

43
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.100
private CEOs are very anti-government. Um,

44
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.490
long story short is that the coup was, you know,

45
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:25.450
during the Trump administration,

46
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:27.970
after he slapped like 70 sanctions on Venezuela,

47
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.050
and we're talking about medicine, food,

48
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.770
all the things that they're saying that they need, right.

49
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.210
That they're trying to stage these fake aid caravan deliveries. That was all.

50
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.410
What they're doing is actually preventing the delivery from food in medicine,

51
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:41.570
from getting to Venezuelans.

52
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:45.440
And this coup was a failure because the zillions of the Venezuelan people,

53
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.760
they believe that they have a democracy.

54
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.040
They do have a democracy it's actually more free than, than our democracy.

55
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.920
There's not a dictatorship there. Um, Maduro won a presidential election.

56
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.120
Last year, he won a presidential election.

57
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.720
The us lobbied the opposition candidates to not run against him.

58
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.840
So then they can say it was illegitimate that it was a dictatorship.

59
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.173
And so he won,

60
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.880
he won the popular vote and they tried to implement all these things and they've

61
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:11.440
been blocked. And, you know,

62
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.840
the opposition keeps crying to the us that they need help,

63
00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:15.880
that they need to be invaded.

64
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.390
It's pretty disturbing when you have candidates saying slap sanctions on us,

65
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.830
invade our country, help us, Trump help us. I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous.

66
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:28.390
But when I was on the ground, I saw flourishing democracy.

67
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.390
I saw dozens of people,

68
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.950
hundreds of people who said that they love the process there,

69
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:37.670
that they believe in the Bavarian movement and that their chavemotil death.

70
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.740
And we don't understand stand because those people's voices are totally censored

71
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.180
from corporate media.

72
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.260
The only Venezuelans that we hear from in corporate media are rich opposition,

73
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.180
either, you know, expats or people who just have fled.

74
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.380
And what do we hear from corporate media? What is, what is the corporate take?

75
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.900
So this is even Elizabeth Warren, even Bernie Sanders has been terrible on this.

76
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.770
Um, I mean, it's, 's really bad. I mean, their take on corporate media.

77
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.650
If you're looking at like Fox news,

78
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:06.970
they'll say we need to overthrow Maduro and you know,

79
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.810
everyone's starving and it's a failed state. Um,

80
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:12.210
they never mentioned the sanctions.

81
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.370
They never mentioned the fact that us sanctions just from 2017 alone has killed

82
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.010
40,000 Venezuelans.

83
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.160
This was just a study out by deeper 40,000 Venezuelan have died from,

84
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.600
from Trump's sanctions, from insulin shipments,

85
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.440
not getting there primarily. Um, um,

86
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.120
a lot of other things, um,

87
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.920
medicine wise that people have not been getting and they are dying.

88
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.880
So that is absurd. You know, we,

89
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:41.110
we like to think of sanctions as kind of like the soft power or that just

90
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.710
targets elites of the country. No,

91
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:45.430
it's an act of war and that's exactly what's happening to Iran.

92
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.510
And Trump's implemented sanctions all over the world in a really devastating

93
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.310
way. But, but the corporate media will say, we need to overthrow them.

94
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:57.030
Their failed state. They're, you know, they're a dictatorship. Um, and reality,

95
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.950
no, they're not they're democracy. And they, we don't like their politics.

96
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.420
That's really what it is. We don't like the, is it about the,

97
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:06.860
that their politics, their politics are that they nationize the oil.

98
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.740
And that's really where it comes from this fake ambassador that was trying to

99
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:15.500
get into the embassy here. Carlosveio, he's an ex Exxon lawyer.

100
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.700
And you see all of these people who were involved in Exxon Mobil and all of the

101
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.060
oil industries that, um,

102
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.730
were flow INE in Venezuela before Chavez got a got elected and they just want

103
00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:27.530
their profits back. They want their money back.

104
00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:31.490
They don't like the fact that Chavez took the profits from the oil companies.

105
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.810
That's what the, that's what the crux of the problem is, Joe. Um,

106
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.730
and it's amazing. It's amazing how transparent it is.

107
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.970
So ever since these failed coup attempts over the last decade,

108
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.640
the us have been foment in regime change through the civil society

109
00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:48.680
organizations, U S a I D offshoots in the country. And, um,

110
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.400
and basically trying to foment violent unrest, violent unrest,

111
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:57.040
to the extent that they burned down streets, there's Lynch mobs. I mean,

112
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.480
when I was there during the height of the violence in 2017,

113
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.600
like 200 people died and the news just kept saying mad,

114
00:06:04.601 --> 00:06:08.040
like insinuating that Maduro was going out there with police forces and actually

115
00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:10.800
gunning down people in the streets. It couldn't be farther from the truth.

116
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.040
We looked at all the deaths, we broke them all down.

117
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:14.920
We looked at death records and, um,

118
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:18.990
we found out that the opposition Lynch mobs were actually responsible for the

119
00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:23.070
overwhelming majority of deaths in the streets. So that's happening.

120
00:06:23.071 --> 00:06:26.390
People get lynched for being black. They get lynched for being Chavezmo.

121
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.030
These people are targeting maternity clinics, hospitals,

122
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.670
basically any enclave of government services,

123
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.070
because that's what this is really about.

124
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:36.430
It's about of kind of a fascistic bent of the opposition,

125
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:39.180
wanting to take back the power from the poor,

126
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.860
the poor people got power and they didn't like it.

127
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.900
And that's what the crux of the problem is.

128
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:46.500
But when you're looking at the corporate media,

129
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.420
it's an absurdly cartoonish brush that's being painted.

130
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.620
And then if you look at the liberal media with mattow and all these other

131
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.940
people, they either don't talk about it.

132
00:06:54.941 --> 00:06:59.570
Or they say Maduro needs to let the a aidden you even saw Bernie and Elizabeth

133
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.770
Warren saying Maduro needs to let the Aidin let the aid in Maduro.

134
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.290
The aidide was the coup the aidide was, was a trick.

135
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.570
They're getting aid every day from countries that are not trying to actively

136
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:14.290
overthrow them, but we stage this big stunt on the border, um, of Columbia.

137
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.810
And by the way, Columbia's actually suffering more than Venezuela.

138
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.600
&lt;laugh&gt; Columbias in I poverty,

139
00:07:18.601 --> 00:07:22.520
there's people getting assassinated every week who are labor leaders and

140
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:23.160
teachers.

141
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.960
I went there and I talked to a teacher who's living in exile cause he's scared

142
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:29.280
for his life. Um, but we don't hear about that, right?

143
00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:32.080
Because their allies with the us, um, so it's,

144
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.040
it's cynical stunt to try to get this humanitarian international

145
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.870
outcry to say, oh, my people are dying. People are hungry.

146
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.590
It's not a matter of that.

147
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:46.350
There's no food it's that food is very expensive because there's an actual

148
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.510
economic war being waged by massive corporations in the country and just

149
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.391
external entities,

150
00:07:51.391 --> 00:07:54.950
whether it be the Trump administration or us multinationals that are

151
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:59.300
exphixxiating preventing aid in food from coming in.

152
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.860
And the a that they're they're claiming that they need to accept is basically a

153
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.700
hoax. It's a stunt, um, to try to get regime change, to, to happen. Um,

154
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.420
we just saw Richard Branson stage some ridiculous, um,

155
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.620
big concert on the border of Columbia.

156
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.980
And they had like what they said were aid trucks on this big bridge.

157
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.370
And you had CNN on the ground being like, all right,

158
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:25.730
they need to let the aid in. Why don't they let the aid in? And the aid was,

159
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.170
it was fake. It was just a truck full of like, I don't know,

160
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:30.450
like very minuscule things,

161
00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:34.770
but they wanted to try to Ram these trucks through just to get the soldiers up

162
00:08:34.771 --> 00:08:36.850
in arms and to try to get them to defect it. Hasn't worked.

163
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.720
They've been trying over and over gonna try to get to something going.

164
00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.000
And basically at the end of the day, what happened was just a,

165
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.680
a giant money grab. It was basically a money laundering scheme.

166
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.360
You look at these people who are the opposition leaders. Now,

167
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:55.200
Juan wado carlosveio, they've just stolen all the money back. Um,

168
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.920
maybe they realized the co wasn't gonna go forward,

169
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.680
but they basically ended up stealing at least 70 million and just putting it

170
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:05.000
right in these people's bank accounts. It's pretty shocking. I mean,

171
00:09:05.001 --> 00:09:05.834
you have international,

172
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:09.840
it's an international conspiracy to try to take the money back from,

173
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.720
from the people whose money is was, was basically, um,

174
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.790
ministered by Maduro for social.

175
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.670
<v 0>And root of it all. And is nationalizing the oil.</v>

176
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.030
<v 1>Nationalizing, the oil is the root of it all. And also just uplifting the poor.</v>

177
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.030
I mean, poor people got a voice and they never had a voice in that country,

178
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.230
their entire lives. And that country was, you know, it was a colonial holdover.

179
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.910
And so the bowl ofarian movement started this pink tide all across Latin

180
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:38.420
America. And, um, it was scary. It was a giant threat to the us establishment.

181
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.620
And actually that's why telesor was founded. Telesor the, the,

182
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.020
the organization that I used to sell the show to,

183
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.460
it was started as kind of a counter to this global higemony in this corporate

184
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.220
narrative, trying to overthrow these dedemocratically elected leaders.

185
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.020
But it's shocking when you see like the bank of England,

186
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.090
see seized all of this gold, that was rightfully madeuros.

187
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:01.850
They seized it illegally. All of these,

188
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.410
these banks and international bodies just stole all this money and they just

189
00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:06.770
gave it to these opposition leaders.

190
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.530
So even though the opposition leaders weren't able to take, you know,

191
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:13.210
take the power back in the country, they still have taken all the money.

192
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.520
And no one's talking about that. And everyone just like,

193
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:20.840
this is some crazy dictatorship that needs our saving. How dare you?

194
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:22.800
Who the do we think we are.

195
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.040
<v 0>We're uninformed, right? Yeah. Is.</v>

196
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.600
<v 1>That what it is? Yeah. You should check out. Everyone should check out our,</v>

197
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.880
our empire files, um, YouTube channel,

198
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.880
cause we've done extensive coverage on the ground,

199
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.830
really going into the nuts and bolts of what the economic crisis really is.

200
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:42.030
And my partner, Mike Pricener did this epic takedown of John Oliver. You know,

201
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:43.190
the liberal media is just as bad.

202
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:48.190
John Oliver did some absurdly false kind of like

203
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.590
analysis of the whole Venezuela situation.

204
00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:53.750
And we just went through and debunked every single line of it. I mean,

205
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:56.710
it was extremely disingenuous. I bet.

206
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.180
<v 0>He had someone who wrote all that. Right, right.</v>

207
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.740
So I bet he probably has no real knowledge of it, nor could you really,

208
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.620
unless you extensively studied it the way you have,

209
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.100
and especially if you have feet on the ground. Right.

210
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.900
I think that most people just in,

211
00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:16.620
in order to understand a complex nuanced problem,

212
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.410
like some sort of an international conflict that we're involved in that has to

213
00:11:21.411 --> 00:11:25.130
do with nationalizing oil, like, God, you gotta do a lot of work. You do,

214
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.731
you do.

215
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:29.170
And have you run a show like last week tonight or whatever the the show's

216
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:29.390
called.

217
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.250
<v 1>You have producers doing everything for you. Yeah.</v>

218
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.290
<v 0>Someone else is doing that. I mean, you, you find that with a lot of these,</v>

219
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.010
so- called online experts.

220
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:39.800
And when you talk to them one on one and you get them off the record without

221
00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:41.800
notes, like they're just.

222
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.040
<v 1>People, well, there's this guy,</v>

223
00:11:43.041 --> 00:11:46.440
this UN human rights investigator named Alfred dezaas that I did this big

224
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:50.600
interview with. And he said, he tried to propose this to the UN saying,

225
00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:54.800
there is no, no humanitarian crisis there. This is all fake. Yes,

226
00:11:54.801 --> 00:11:56.400
people are suffering and dying,

227
00:11:56.401 --> 00:11:59.600
but it's not because of Maduro's policies and corruptions.

228
00:11:59.601 --> 00:12:03.120
This is because of us sanctions that have exphyxiated the economy and prevented

229
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.760
any sort of recovery from taking place.

230
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.320
And the economy is still in free fall.

231
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.640
They can't work with international bodies. Again,

232
00:12:10.641 --> 00:12:13.750
we have the threats of sanctions with instant institus that now work with

233
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.510
Venezuela. So they've been isolated, they've been isolated from the world.

234
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.150
<v 0>So is the idea that they just put these sanctions in place,</v>

235
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.110
allow this political unrest to take place,

236
00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:25.670
support the opposition and then just have a slow burn until it all collapses.

237
00:12:25.671 --> 00:12:29.070
Yes. And then they come in and swoop in and, and fix everything and mm-hmm,

238
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.230
&lt;affirmative&gt; make it a part of the United States government. And.

239
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.500
<v 1>Then these people will not have a voice any longer. And, um,</v>

240
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.260
another thing that they hate is that madeuro's given 2 million free homes to

241
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:41.420
people. That's something that's completely unheard of to maybe Americans.

242
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.540
But that's one thing that Juan waido said that he would do, he,

243
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.420
he immediately implemented a new hydrocarbons law or he was proposing to

244
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:51.660
implement a new hydrocarbons law, which is again, you know,

245
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:53.420
repriatizing the oil. And also,

246
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.290
so just immediately privatizing all of the social services that Madeuro and

247
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.850
Chavez did. So it it's, it's pretty shocking what would happen,

248
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.370
um, and pretty devastating. What would happen if,

249
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:09.730
if yidos co did succeed and the whole Trump administration, I mean,

250
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.690
it's not just Venezuela. It's Nicaragua and Cuba too. I mean,

251
00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.520
we can't go to Cuba anymore. Yeah.

252
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.480
<v 0>That's a new one, right? Yeah. Yeah. When did that happen? Yeah.</v>

253
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.720
This a couple weeks ago, right? Yeah. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what was the purpose?

254
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.200
I mean, what was the, uh, rationalism?

255
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.040
<v 1>Because socialism is terrifying and we can't just let this small island nation</v>

256
00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.200
just live its life.

257
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.520
We have to create some genocital blockade that prevents food and medicine from

258
00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:30.760
getting in there too. But.

259
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.720
<v 0>What was the did, was there a justification?</v>

260
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.990
Did they say why they were doing doing this while they're imposing these new.

261
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.710
<v 1>Laws? No, its just John Bolton's bizarre speech about the troyica of tyranny.</v>

262
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.590
Remember, remember the axis of evil. Remember that? Yeah. It's a,

263
00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:47.670
now it's a Troy of tyranny. Nicaragua, Cuban. Venicenezuela it's like, wait,

264
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.030
I thought that I thought that we were fighting a war on terrorism. We're.

265
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.830
<v 0>Going off to Nicaragua too. Yeah. Cuz of.</v>

266
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:55.980
<v 1>Ortega. Yeah. They hate who leans left.</v>

267
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.500
They want to crush crush.

268
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.380
It's pretty nuts. What's happened. The Cuba one is.

269
00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:07.620
<v 0>A weird one. Right? The Cuba ones. Cause what, what has happened over there?</v>

270
00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:10.020
Nothing there's there's no, they're not. Yeah. They haven't.

271
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:10.720
<v 1>Done anything to us.</v>

272
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.100
The only thing they just did was actually give out free HIV prevention pills and

273
00:14:15.101 --> 00:14:15.810
they uh, well.

274
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.770
<v 0>That's where they up. Which &lt;laugh&gt; big.</v>

275
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:19.650
<v 1>Pharma. Yeah.</v>

276
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.250
<v 0>That's where they up. We're not into that.</v>

277
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.650
<v 1>Yeah. No it's the Venezuela. Thing's a mess.</v>

278
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.010
It's it's so difficult because it's so nuanced, but that's, you know,

279
00:14:28.011 --> 00:14:31.530
I encourage everyone to maybe check out Venezuela analysis and empire files and

280
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:33.770
telesor, if they wanna learn more about that situation.

281
00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:43.680
<v 2>I.</v>
