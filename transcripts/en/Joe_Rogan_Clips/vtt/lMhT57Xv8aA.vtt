00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You, uh, you recovered from surgery. Huh?</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.180
<v 1>Do you have done, dude? I've had a year. Yeah. Um, so, uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.170
just over a year ago I ruptured my tricep on my left arm. All right. Um,

4
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:17.040
was attempting the log press world record. And how does the world record?

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.580
So the show was to attempt the world record. Um,

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.140
I failed at 485 pounds, which would have been a new American record.

7
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.620
That's when my tricep decided to crap out. So what.

8
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.570
<v 0>Did it do? Like separate from the bone? Oh.</v>

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.220
<v 1>No, it liked my 10 and exploded.</v>

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.430
So who typically, like when a tendon tears, it's kind of like a piece of paper,

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.910
throw a couple of stitches in it and then, you know, anchor it into the bone.

12
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.450
The doctor, first thing you said when I woke up was,

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.670
so when I opened up your arm,

14
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.480
I literally had to take a step back and rethink everything I was going to do,

15
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.250
because it was that much worse.

16
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.380
<v 0>But didn't, you have an MRI to.</v>

17
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.860
<v 1>Go by, but like, so the MRI, we, it showed that it was torn,</v>

18
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.160
but he didn't know to like what extent. And when he got in there,

19
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:03.660
he realized that literally he said,

20
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:05.670
it looked like a firecracker gone off of my tendon.

21
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.860
So it took 14 sutures to put my tendon back together into something he could

22
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.210
even attach to my elbow.

23
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.660
And then another four anchors into my elbow that he had to drill in.

24
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.520
And what was the recovery like? I mean,

25
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:20.160
I still can't straighten my arm out all the way. That's about it.

26
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.050
And I got like this really cute dimple now.

27
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.310
<v 0>Oh, wow.</v>

28
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.220
<v 1>That's not a nasty scar. You're going.</v>

29
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.090
<v 0>To pull your tattoo on it.</v>

30
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.640
<v 1>Make it look a snake or that's what I'm thinking. Yeah. I mean, I think,</v>

31
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.320
I feel like a snake is too cliche.

32
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.880
Maybe it's a fuse that could be it for your forum bomb for them.

33
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.160
My husband goes, you should make it a sperm. I was like,

34
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.723
[inaudible], it's like, we can just not do that because you know.

35
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.410
<v 0>There's no need how many people have sperm tattoo to their body.</v>

36
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:51.510
That might be like the least tattooed thing ever.

37
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.140
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I'm gay and I don't even want to spare him tattoos. It's probably.</v>

38
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.990
<v 0>A girl like sad girls, you know.</v>

39
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.810
<v 1>The ones that definitely have daddy issues. Oh yeah.</v>

40
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.340
<v 0>Yeah. So the thing explodes and what is it when it does explode?</v>

41
00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:07.410
Like what does it look like on your arm? Does it pull up?

42
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.920
<v 1>So yeah, there was some, there was some recoiling going on and literally,</v>

43
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:15.000
like he said, there was just like tendon fragments, like strewn about frag arms.

44
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.030
<v 0>Literally like a bomb. Yeah. Is that just because the weight.</v>

45
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.380
<v 1>Of the log? Yeah. I mean,</v>

46
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:23.250
when you're trying to press 485 pounds overhead and your body says, no,

47
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:24.780
it just goes, what do you weigh?

48
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.660
<v 0>About 2 40, 2, 80, 2 80. Yeah. So.</v>

49
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.570
<v 1>That's yeah. That's 200 pounds over my body weight. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.260
That's a lot of weight. Yeah. So the rehab is going well for that. Um,

51
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:35.250
and then like this, this, you.

52
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.110
<v 0>Doing it. Oh yeah. This means when it blows up.</v>

53
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.720
<v 1>So this is, this is when I actually broke the record.</v>

54
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.860
So I had already had the American record at this point. Um,

55
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.000
and then got the chance. So this was like all COVID times.

56
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.140
So we did like virtual record breakers.

57
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.690
<v 0>So the judge that's an attention.</v>

58
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.520
<v 1>He was in Lithuania for this kind of looks like a white supremacist there</v>

59
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.354
though.

60
00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.590
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

61
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 1>So, yeah, that was 4 75, so.</v>

62
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.350
<v 0>Much weight now w when they do the logs, like,</v>

63
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.250
did they put weight inside the log? Oh. And the EDS ends the logs. I said, yeah.

64
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 1>Yeah. So the log itself ways, like, I think that weighed like 160 pounds or so.</v>

65
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.810
And then we had to add 20 fives and stuff to the end of it,

66
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.850
to us to get it to the contest, this.

67
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.690
<v 0>Something very primal about lifting a log too. Right. Okay.</v>

68
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.540
<v 1>That's the sport of strong man. Right?</v>

69
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.320
Like we lift stones and logs carry on our back. Like,

70
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.480
that's just what the sport is. Yeah.

71
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.910
<v 0>And so the elbow just.</v>

72
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.733
<v 1>Totally.</v>

73
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.470
<v 0>And how long did it take before you could lift again?</v>

74
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.240
<v 1>So I was like back in the gym within like two weeks doing lower body stuff.</v>

75
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.270
But the biggest, the hardest part was like getting range of motion back,

76
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:49.300
like trying to flex my elbow again, because when they did the surgery,

77
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:52.660
my arm was bent at 90 degrees. So that was a pretty comfortable position.

78
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:55.120
But getting it to straighten or getting it to bend all the way was.

79
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.050
<v 0>Horrible.</v>

80
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.200
Do they anticipate you'll ever get full range of motion fully straight?

81
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.690
<v 1>It's been a year. So, so here's the weird thing.</v>

82
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.560
Nobody can figure this out if I'm not, if I'm just here to try to raise my arm,

83
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:09.260
that's as much as I get. But if I'm pressing, like if I'm bench pressing or,

84
00:04:09.261 --> 00:04:12.700
or overhead pressing, I can get to full extension, press this cup.

85
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.410
I think it might be too light.

86
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.900
<v 0>Cambridge 10. This is where I get hurt. But this is where it blows out.</v>

87
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.133
You'll see that.

88
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.240
<v 1>I am Hitler guy the same way. Same dude. And there it goes. Oh.</v>

89
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.400
<v 0>Jesus Christ. Oh.</v>

90
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.940
<v 1>Yeah. And like, you know, I'm a certified athletic trainer,</v>

91
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:32.740
like have a master's degree in sports medicine.

92
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:35.440
So like I legit knew right away what had happened.

93
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.070
And my husband comes over to me. He's like, what's wrong. I was like,

94
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:42.220
I just tore my tricep. He's like, no, you didn't. I was like, no, I totally did.

95
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.010
<v 0>Oh, but you didn't think it was as bad as it was.</v>

96
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.220
<v 1>I mean, I knew it was torn, but like I didn't. Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.950
I didn't think it was to that level.

98
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.430
<v 0>Now. What kind of therapy do you do for something like that?</v>

99
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:57.640
Once they reattach it? What's the rehabilitation like?

100
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.910
<v 1>Um, so I mean, I, I did a lot of everything, a lot of manual therapy.</v>

101
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.140
Cause like I produce a lot of scar tissue. Um, like even now,

102
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:09.220
like my electron on like the elbow bone doesn't feel like my right one.

103
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.260
<v 0>So when you say you produce a, this.</v>

104
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.690
<v 1>Is my body naturally produces a lot of scar tissue.</v>

105
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:16.180
So that was something we battled actually,

106
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.660
because I was producing too much scar tissue too early in the rehab process that

107
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.810
was actually hindering the range of motion gains that I was supposed to be

108
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:27.370
getting. So a lot of like Graston, um, cupping,

109
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.730
I was, I did like dry needling and acupuncture.

110
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.720
And one of the, one of the first times I went,

111
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.450
the therapist couldn't get the needle through the scar tissue because it was too

112
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:44.310
thick. And the best, the way I describe it to people is like, even with,

113
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:46.240
with me, like feeling the needles, go in,

114
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.880
it felt like pushing a needle through like rubber.

115
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.450
That's how it felt for me to knock. I felt the sticky.

116
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.150
<v 0>And you think that's just cause you train so much.</v>

117
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:59.180
So your body's just so used to recovering. Must be,

118
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.490
have you talked to other guys that are strong men?

119
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.380
Do they have like similar situations? A lot of us.

120
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.380
<v 1>I like have had like the scar tissue stuff that goes on and then like,</v>

121
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.510
I actually bent a few of the acupuncture needles,

122
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:11.930
like when they were trying to do them, like she pulled them out and was like,

123
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:13.970
it was curved. I was like, oh, that's at least it didn't break.
