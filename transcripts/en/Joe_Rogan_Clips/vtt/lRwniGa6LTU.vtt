00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.400
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.600
I looked at your Instagram yesterday and you had that video of Steven,

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.360
a Smith and immediately I was like, oh my goodness,

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.440
this explains so much, play this, play, play this, Jamie, watch this,

5
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:19.960
watch this. First of all, someone needs to explain to me what's happening here.

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.910
Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.590
<v 1>Well, it looks like a Dick punch in the left.</v>

8
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.310
<v 0>I don't even think it's a Dick, unless that guy's got a two foot Dick.</v>

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.910
Look how low he's punching.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.770
<v 1>No idea.</v>

11
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.310
<v 0>Man. This guy should not be allowed to talk about fighting.</v>

12
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.950
<v 1>Yeah, look, um, just, I'm gonna cut him a little bit of slack only. I,</v>

13
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.990
I seriously, I, we had this,

14
00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:40.430
here's the thing with Strikeforce we had kind of a similar situation,

15
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.940
not like this though, by the way, with Gus Johnson. I remember with Gus. Yes.

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.380
Was trying to talk to him and I love Gus when he's talking basketball. Yeah.

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.020
I think he's got the energy and the voice that makes people like, oh wow.

18
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.700
They're gripped to the TV. This I can understand with Steven a,

19
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.780
but this is nice,

20
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.500
but you want a release after you just called someone who's a pioneer in the

21
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.210
sport. You basically call him a McCoy. Quit. You.

22
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.290
<v 0>Call a guy a quitter. First of all, he had a broken orbital bone. Okay.</v>

23
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.370
You're saying he, he was a quitter. He got his face smashed. Yeah. Okay.

24
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.810
He got cracked by one of the biggest punchers in the sport. Yeah. He, uh,

25
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.610
he has the most wins in the sport. He has the most wins by finish.

26
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.170
He has the most bonuses. I mean, come on. Yeah. He has the most fights. Come on.

27
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.040
You, you can calling that guy. Quitter. He got cracked. That's what happens.

28
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.160
Look fighting is the only sport that you could end it early. Right?

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.720
You can't end a football game in 40 seconds. Imagine, imagine if you just,

30
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.960
your front line was so strong, your quarterback was so badass.

31
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.400
You could storm a football game in 40 seconds. There'd be a different sport.

32
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.390
<v 1>Right? My concern with though, was that like, look, he's fine.</v>

33
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:46.030
He just did the video. I get it. Like,

34
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.550
it's good that you're trying to learn this sport, but I gotta tell you,

35
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.950
like DC sent me this video and he basically commented on it. And I said, I said,

36
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.590
D D's trying to protect the DC's trying to protect him. I said,

37
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.470
you cannot protect this guy. Not from this. No,

38
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:02.830
you can't call someone like cowboy surrounding or any other. I'm sorry.

39
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.900
Their top guy in any organization. I don't care if it's U FFC bell or one.

40
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.540
Any of themem all the, all these organ, you cannot do that to these guys.

41
00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:14.100
These guys lay it on the line every time we're not slapping a puck or hitting a

42
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.740
baseball case. Yes. We're really out there getting hurt. Yes.

43
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.940
And when someone calls you acquitter like that, you better be kill.

44
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.980
I'm not saying he should be careful, like watch his back,

45
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.010
but don't expect these fighters to be very is to you next time you walk in the

46
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:25.550
hall.

47
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.290
And that's the issue that I think we come across here with top fighters are very

48
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:31.170
offensive when they get offended. When things like this.

49
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.650
<v 0>Rightly so. Yeah. It's a different thing. There's the,</v>

50
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.410
the emotional cost of losing a fight is so much different

51
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.650
than losing a game. It's not the same.

52
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.360
And there's a culture in sport broadcasting,

53
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:50.240
whether it's radio or television, this just diminishing of people.

54
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.960
There's this talking that goes with sports. You know, he always falls apart.

55
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.320
That guy, that needs to give his money back. He sucks this and that.

56
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.280
And the other guy's like, oh, I can't believe you're saying that.

57
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.080
And you could do that in sports radio. Yeah. And people love it.

58
00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:07.320
Cause if you're on the job site and you're listening to the radio and you know,

59
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:09.280
your hammering nails, you're like, right. He does suck.

60
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.120
And there's a mentality that goes along with that kind of sports radio sports

61
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.280
guy talk, I hate that. I've resisted that from the beginning.

62
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.270
And I've I've on those guys. Yeah. From the beginning,

63
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.150
because it's not the same thing.

64
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:26.110
You're not talking about the same thing you're talking about fighting.

65
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.070
You're talking about unbelievable physical consequences,

66
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.150
including knock on wood in our sports. Very rare but death.

67
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.030
<v 1>Yeah, no, it's true. But the other thing though, too,</v>

68
00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:38.030
is that you're criticizing someone for being a quitter and someone who's been

69
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.340
been there in level of the game, every level, but not only that,

70
00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:44.300
but then you look like you've never played basketball or baseball or any other

71
00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:46.500
sport in your life. Either hit, admits like that. I'm sorry.

72
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.180
You cannot criticize people. And to be able to talk show,

73
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:50.580
like you're saying those talk show radios,

74
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.940
that's the energy you need to bring when you're going against someone like max

75
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:54.940
Kellerman or any of the other,

76
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:58.180
or skip Bayles and those guys go ahead and have that conversation with them.

77
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.450
But you cannot can't look like that. &lt;laugh&gt; at that top.

78
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.130
I'm sorry, man. That.

79
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.410
<v 0>Culture, the culture of the sport look, max Kellman is a different animal.</v>

80
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.370
Max Kellman is in incredibly knowledgeable mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when it comes to

81
00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:15.130
sports and, and really so when it comes to boxing, he's not a talker.

82
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.210
He's just more honest about it. Yeah. That's true.

83
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.040
But there's a lot of currency in being a Stephen, a Smith. Yeah. You know,

84
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.680
he's really entertaining that that talking that he does, he's a, he's, you know,

85
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.080
he's a, he's a guy that's fun to watch. He talks a lot of.

86
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.440
He gets real loud and everybody disagrees with him and look,

87
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:37.040
it's made him a fantastic career. That's why, and he carries that over to MMA.

88
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.680
I think it's a bad idea. Is.

89
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.110
<v 1>It a stick though? That's my thought process. Like,</v>

90
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:44.070
you know how cha has hisick like he, and like the camera turns off.

91
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.710
Colby has hisick. Yes. And when the camera turns off, they're not that person.

92
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.030
Right. Is he that person in real life?

93
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.030
<v 0>I think it blends in, you know.</v>

94
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.510
<v 1>Is he, he just now inherited that person. So that's who he is now in real life.</v>

95
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:55.750
Andrew Clay.

96
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.430
<v 0>Andrew dice, clay. His real name is Andrew Silverstein.</v>

97
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.980
And the dice man was a charact that he used to do in his act dice.

98
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:06.380
Clay is like one of the best impressionists ever. Yeah. And he does like,

99
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.220
he does John Travolta and all these different people and it's amazing.

100
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.620
And in his act he would do all these impressions and he would do this guy,

101
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:13.593
the dice man.

102
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.780
And he would do these rhymes and he put this jacket on and everybody loved that

103
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.780
so much. He just became the dice man.

104
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.930
And then after a few years he was just diceman 24 7 &lt;laugh&gt; he's

105
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.970
wearing these leather jackets everywhere. Everywhere. He goes,

106
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:28.970
he's got weightlifting gloves on every time you meet him,

107
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:32.010
he's got weightlifting gloves. He became this guy. Right.

108
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.130
And it's a thing that happens to people sometimes where people love one thing.

109
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:39.210
Yeah. You lean into your fans. And I think Steven AIT,

110
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.410
I don't know him as a human being.

111
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600
I've only met him a couple times is a nice guy. Nice guy to me.

112
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:45.520
We had a nice conversation on air.

113
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.840
We had a little weirdness cuz he was just saying,

114
00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:51.120
we didn't learn anything about Connor. I'm like the you didn't. Yeah.

115
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.680
He just destroyed cowboy in 40 seconds. Yeah.

116
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.920
Like you learn something you learn.

117
00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:57.840
He could perform under the bright lights in a giant paper view.

118
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.200
After more than a year and a half outta the game. Yeah. You learn something.

119
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:02.520
You just don't know what you saw.

120
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.200
<v 1>Yeah. I, I agree with you a hundred percent that you, he did learn something.</v>

121
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.000
Yeah. I mean like I learned something from him, like somebody who taken that,

122
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.200
that amount of time off and I'm gonna say this, um, to be Frank, obviously I,

123
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.320
I work for Bellator and I do a lot of work for them. But the thing is you,

124
00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:18.030
you can't have to give credit where credit is due.

125
00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:20.310
I give credit to all the fighters. It doesn't matter if you're in one, look,

126
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:23.710
Eddie to me is one of the best 55 pounderers to ever walk.

127
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:25.950
The face of the earth. Agreed, caught him McGregor to me.

128
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.270
I thought he did things in that fight against cabib that no other guy has been

129
00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:32.630
able to do. First off he won round. Yeah. That's something.

130
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:35.550
No one's ever people say, oh well cabib took the round off. Yeah. Cause he,

131
00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:37.580
maybe he tried to finish him at the end of the second.

132
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.420
But the bottom line is he still won the round. Yes. Okay.

133
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:41.460
And there's not only that,

134
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:44.900
but there was a lot of times and opportunities where cabib had a hard time

135
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:45.734
getting the take down.

136
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.420
We didn't see that against guys with wrestling backgrounds like Abel truillo and

137
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:52.380
those other guys where he waslinging him around winning records basically for

138
00:06:52.381 --> 00:06:53.860
the most takedowns in one fight. Yes.

139
00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:58.410
There's tons of things that Connor does that people over it can underestimate

140
00:06:58.411 --> 00:07:00.890
because he's such a knockout artist and he's so good.

141
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.570
And his stance and his style and things that he brought this to the next level.

142
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.090
And I, I, you cannot discredit what he's done in the sport.

143
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.330
What I learned from that is that from somebody who can take 15 months off and

144
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:16.610
come back and perform the way that he did against someone like Donald ceroney is

145
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.040
absolutely amazing. That's what I, that's why.

146
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.800
<v 0>You need guys like you,</v>

147
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:24.840
mm-hmm&lt;affirmative&gt; doing post-fi commentary and discussing these and not people

148
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:29.000
who don't understand the sport and practice Dick punches. Well, I &lt;laugh&gt; want.

149
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.040
<v 1>Maybe thing. It's basically maybe sitting babies really punch of babies.</v>

150
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.160
I want to ask you this though.

151
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.360
Cuz it was funny cuz I could see your face in the middle of it all.

152
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.630
How awkward is that for you to stand between the two, two of them and go,

153
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.470
what are you guys talking about? Yeah. Like, I mean I would, I would've.

154
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.070
<v 0>Preferred to talk to DC Orfeld or you aware anybody who</v>

155
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:52.310
understands the sport? I don't think it's the right way to do it. Uh,

156
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:55.630
the one gentleman to my right Michael Jamie, what is his last name?

157
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.420
He was great. And Steven Smith was very nice to me too.

158
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:00.860
And he said he's gonna get into podcasts.

159
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.020
I have no problem with him as a human being. No, I just think, uh, look,

160
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.300
I don't know. Jack's about baseball. I don't know Jack's about basketball.

161
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.740
I literally don't even know the rules. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know what,

162
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:13.700
when people foul people, I'm not sure why. I don't know what what's happening.

163
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.100
Yeah. I know MMA. I understand it. So if you want to talk about MMA,

164
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.690
I'd like to talk to MMA about someone else who knows ma yeah.

165
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.210
<v 1>The, like you were saying though, I,</v>

166
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.690
I was listen to one of your podcast the other day with Mike Baker.

167
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.290
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; okay. And he said like, look,

168
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.970
I don't agree with Bernie Sanders policies. Okay. But he,

169
00:08:29.971 --> 00:08:31.930
Bernie Sanders probably is a really nice guy. Yes.

170
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.650
But it doesn't mean that I have to like what he does in front of the camera.

171
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.650
Okay. For, for him to call him a, I don't have to like that.

172
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.330
I can still like him as a person. Yes.

173
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.080
That's what we need to make sure that we differentiate between the two things.

174
00:08:42.081 --> 00:08:45.000
Like, look, he probably is a really good guy and I actually have met him.

175
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.200
I met him at the Floyd manwether in con fight and said, hi. He said, Hey, hi,

176
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:50.360
how's it going? Like can, what do you think? And that was the conversation.

177
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:52.080
It was real quick, real brief, maybe two minutes.

178
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.080
But he seemed like a nice person at that time. But when,

179
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.920
when I was listening to him talk and calling,

180
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.120
simononi basically a quitter to me. I just lost,

181
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.120
I lost respect in the avenue that you're not supposed to be working in our

182
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:05.600
sport. Yes. Okay. And you need to make some sort of adjustment,

183
00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:09.160
whether it's Dick punching or something else that you need to figure it out.

184
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.520
You need to like, I understand. I get that.

185
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.440
It's a good idea for all people that have never covered the,

186
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:16.870
a sport to try to get into it. Okay. Um,

187
00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:20.510
maybe hold off on the videos like that for a while. &lt;laugh&gt; before you some,

188
00:09:20.511 --> 00:09:24.030
before you both do. Yeah. But I, I like that. He's trying.

189
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.790
And I'm gonna give him credit for that. And I think like with Gus,

190
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.070
there was a lot of rumblings about Gus Johnson, the very beginning,

191
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.990
but we gave him a run for a while. Yes. And I really like Gus.

192
00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:33.670
He's a great person. Always been great.

193
00:09:33.671 --> 00:09:35.580
Every time I've talked to him and met with them and,

194
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.260
and worked with him side by side as well, calling fights at,

195
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:42.620
with Strikeforce create person. But his forte is basketball and for him,

196
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.660
whatever his forte is, Steven A. Smith. Yes. He's got,

197
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.340
I think he may have to stick with that. And I think, I agree.

198
00:09:48.341 --> 00:09:51.300
They have to bring DC back in to work with you alongside. Yes. Well.

199
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.740
<v 0>DC is phenomenal. Yeah. DC's phenomenal.</v>

200
00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:56.610
And DC and me having that conversation with would've been a completely different

201
00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:58.130
conversation and it would've been,

202
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.930
it would've been better for the sport because look, there's no,

203
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.050
there's no positive in downplaying the career of Donald Sarone or what he can do

204
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:11.570
as a fighter. What that showed to me was how phenomenal Connor performed. Yeah.

205
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:16.400
That's what it showed me. And if, if either you or I was talking about cricket,

206
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.320
we were on, on TV doing commentary and cricket.

207
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.200
We would look at a place we'd look F it would be up.

208
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:26.680
And real cricket fans would be upset at us. &lt;laugh&gt; right now that's nothing.

209
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.760
That's just a sport, right? Yeah. This is,

210
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.080
you are naked in the most literal sense of the word you're you're naked

211
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:36.480
physically. You're naked. Emotionally when fighters lose, it's a,

212
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.270
it's devastating for Connor to smash cowboy like that in front of his

213
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.910
wife, his kid. Mm. His grandma.

214
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.310
And then the whole world like that is that's you gotta have some respect for

215
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:48.310
that, man. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know,

216
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.190
and this sport demands a different perspective.

217
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.110
It's it's not the same thing as a ball going into hoop. No,

218
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:58.100
it's not the same thing. As crossing a line with a foot ball it's different.

219
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.820
It's very intense and very personal. And it's also very dangerous.

220
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.340
And to, to play it off, like it's just a game. I, I just, I don't agree with it.

221
00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.860
And I just think that we have plenty of people out there that understand the

222
00:11:11.861 --> 00:11:13.660
sport. There's plenty of them. Yep.

223
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.900
There's but the thing about him is he's really popular. And Jamie,

224
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.290
when you're saying he just got a giant deal or something like that, big. Yeah.

225
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:20.730
He's the top.

226
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.650
<v 2>Paid con. I had his contract up.</v>

227
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:25.450
He's got like an extension to get like 8 million a year now or something.

228
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.850
<v 0>Like that. Yeah. And that's because he's, so his personality is so fun. It's,</v>

229
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.730
he's a fun guy to watch and people love talking.

230
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:35.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they love two people arguing about.

231
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.610
And one person's better at arguing and,

232
00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.560
and Vene Smith is really good at that stuff,

233
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.040
but it's not the place for MMA. It's just not the place. It's not,

234
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:45.640
it's not the same thing. It's, it's.

235
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.320
<v 1>Not because, um, because the guys themselves can fight. Yeah. You know,</v>

236
00:11:50.321 --> 00:11:53.320
when you see what happened last night, what Kansas and Kansas state or whatever.

237
00:11:53.321 --> 00:11:54.760
And they started throwing punches and it was like,

238
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.040
it looked like a bunch of girls throwing windmills.

239
00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.560
&lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean? Yes. Like that's really,

240
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.400
the reality of is like now if he wants to go out there and talk about it,

241
00:12:01.401 --> 00:12:03.280
go ahead and talk about it. He can say all the things he wants.

242
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:06.200
Cuz these are college kids that can't fight. Obviously we just saw. Right.

243
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.040
You know, but we're talking about professional athletes.

244
00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.640
They've their life has been around this craft. Yes.

245
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.390
And now you're gonna say things like that. It's very disrespectful.

246
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.750
<v 0>It's just so common with sports to talk about a guy who can't show up on game</v>

247
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.030
day to talk about a guy who keeps dropping the ball,

248
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.230
talk about a guy fi and you on those guys.

249
00:12:23.231 --> 00:12:25.710
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but it's just a different thing with fighting.

250
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.870
And it's also with fighting. Like you, you,

251
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.270
you have to know it or no, one's gonna respect you.

252
00:12:32.271 --> 00:12:35.340
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if don't know what you're talking about and you're talking

253
00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:37.500
about it in front of millions of people, like, man,

254
00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:40.860
that's a bad look for everybody. Yep. It's a bad look for ESPN.

255
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.100
It's a bad look for him. It's a bad look for the sport. It's like,

256
00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:46.500
there's other people that can do this. Yeah. We, we.

257
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.940
<v 1>Caught a lot of flack for Gus for a while. The Strikeforce did like, uh,</v>

258
00:12:49.941 --> 00:12:52.540
and then I think it trickled on up to the CBS and that whole, whole whole deal.

259
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.260
But then the.

260
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.130
<v 0>Ideas, mayhem, brawl. Yes. Or these things happen in MMA. Yeah. Yeah. That's.</v>

261
00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.890
<v 1>Definitely not the words you want to use in that situation.</v>

262
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.170
You know what I mean? But it does, honestly, like you just said,

263
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:07.570
it really does reflect badly, not just on, on ESPN itself, but the UFC as well,

264
00:13:07.571 --> 00:13:08.890
because they're, they're in business together. Yes.

265
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:11.330
And it kind of looks bad for both like, Hey you guys,

266
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:15.520
we need to monitor who's behind that microphone. We're representing our talent.

267
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.080
And our talent is what makes us the money.

268
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.360
<v 0>But what's funny is with Steven A. Smith,</v>

269
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.680
he's his personality and his brand is based on that kind of talking.

270
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.440
So this is all good for him. This is all good for him.

271
00:13:27.441 --> 00:13:30.360
Like the more people talk about him, better. It is for him.

272
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.000
And then he just ramps it up even more and more people are paying attention.

273
00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.480
The ratings go up and to.

274
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.510
<v 1>Until he sees cowboy in an elevator, &lt;laugh&gt; go ride a ed, buddy.</v>

275
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.870
You who's quitting now. Yeah. You know,

276
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:46.270
those are the things that I gotta tell you. You just, no, no. Think about this.

277
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.110
If he said something like that,

278
00:13:48.111 --> 00:13:51.270
about a NA Nick Diaz and they saw him in a elevator, they would him up.

279
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:54.190
They would him up legitimately. Like you would just gotta be like,

280
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:56.180
those are scenario. You just gotta be careful right now.

281
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:59.820
Cowboy's never gonna do that. Hey man. Kind of just watch what you say,

282
00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:02.260
come on man. Like that, you know my family's there, my grandmother's there.

283
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:04.180
You know, my kids's there. Right? Like, you know, let's,

284
00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:08.780
let's dial it back a little bit. That's Cowboys a, he's just an amazing person,

285
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.260
you know overall. Yeah. I, so when you're talking, yeah.

286
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:14.500
When you're talking about athletes and finder like Nate Daz, though,

287
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:15.810
he is saying to you. He's just.

288
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.490
<v 0>Gonna sock you. Look, everybody knows what happened.</v>

289
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.530
What happened is Connor had a spectacular performance.

290
00:14:22.531 --> 00:14:25.530
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; cowboy got caught off guard and he got finished quick.

291
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.570
That's what happened. Yep. All the other stuff is unnecessary.

292
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.330
Themo the emotional devastation of a 42nd K like that mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is

293
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:36.720
we have as a, with a, as a respectful human being,

294
00:14:36.721 --> 00:14:39.280
you gotta leave all that other stuff alone, all that talking.

295
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.280
If you wanna say it in the gym to one of your homies mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and

296
00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:46.400
you're just hanging out and maybe one of them doesn't like cowboy and you know,

297
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.720
and someone talks trash and that's private and no one hears it. That's fine.

298
00:14:50.721 --> 00:14:53.400
And good. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but when you wanna do that publicly,

299
00:14:53.401 --> 00:14:56.920
you wanna broadcast that and then also do it on ESPN. I think it's just,

300
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.560
it's just shortsighted. And I think it's foolish. Yeah. I'm.

301
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.040
<v 1>Gonna go a little bit more hard on the paint on guys like DC who are on my post</v>

302
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:06.840
right there. The one the videos defending him right now. That's defending him.

303
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.760
He's defending. Well, Hey man, he's trying to learn this board. He's trying,

304
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.150
I say de quit trying to tow the company line son.

305
00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.710
That's what you're doing right now. And then,

306
00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:18.790
and then I got Kendall Grove that goes on there too saying, oh, you know what?

307
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.470
I can respect the fact that he's trying to learn it. Look at this is what.

308
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.750
<v 0>He says. I think that's fine. He's trying to better understand our sport.</v>

309
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.470
It means he's a massive star who could talk from his perch and no one can touch

310
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:29.510
him yet. He chooses to try and learn the game.

311
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.540
So there's some weight to his opinion. You're a little off base champ. Oh,

312
00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.900
DC's a wonderful person. Oh.

313
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:41.140
<v 1>He's just STR it. I said, I told him, I said, look, just because Steven A.</v>

314
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.420
Smith might be good for business in the ESPN business for you later on.

315
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.100
I said that doesn't mean you gotta tow that line, buddy. Yeah.

316
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.220
I'd like to give him a hard time, but DC's one of my best friends, man.

317
00:15:50.221 --> 00:15:52.490
And he's absolutely whole ilarious and just fun.

318
00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:55.530
He likes to do this to stir the pot because like you were just saying with

319
00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:58.770
Steven Aang he likes to do this type of stuff. Yes. So keep people keep talking.

320
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:02.650
Yes. DC likes to chime in on like this. So what, like,

321
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.890
so we're here right now talking about DC in this whole situation.

322
00:16:05.891 --> 00:16:09.490
That's exactly what DC does. He's brilliant when it comes to this type of stuff.

323
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.720
<v 0>Yeah. And I I'm sure he really does love Steven as a person. Yeah. Steven, as a,</v>

324
00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:16.440
he's a nice guy. Like I said, I've met him a couple times. He's a nice guy.

325
00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:17.920
But just to like, there's a,

326
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.880
there's a style of broadcasting that sports radio and sports broadcasting that

327
00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:25.960
they do this kind of stuff. Yeah. But it, when itbleaks over into fighting,

328
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.960
fighting is just not a sport.

329
00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:31.840
Like you can call it a sport and it's kind of a sport, but it's it's sport.

330
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.070
And it's I a sense of expression where it's,

331
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:39.910
you are literally using your body to try to stop another man's body. Yeah.

332
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:43.350
And it as intense as it gets. And I think it deserves more respect.

333
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:46.310
That's just my opinion. That's how I've always treated it.

334
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:49.630
That's how I've always, when I, when I talk about fighters or my,

335
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:52.910
my concentration has always been to elevate my concentration,

336
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.620
never been to demean someone, unless there's something that they did,

337
00:16:56.621 --> 00:16:58.420
that's illegal. And there's some sort of,

338
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:01.860
sort of blatant foul that should be stopped or something that's really dangerous

339
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:06.540
that they're doing. That should be chastied. But the, the sport is, it's just,

340
00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.380
it's, it's a higher level of,

341
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.380
of consequence and risk and every, and it needs to be respected that way.

342
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:16.770
<v 1>I feel. Um, so I got a, I listened to your show quite a bit.</v>

343
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.290
And I like a lot of what you had talked about before,

344
00:17:19.291 --> 00:17:21.610
when you first got into comedy about talking about, um,

345
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.130
how some of the other comics was like kind of on other young comics kind of up

346
00:17:26.131 --> 00:17:28.130
and coming. And when you came in, it was like a different,

347
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:31.690
you try to just ingraining people like, Hey, I want to build you all,

348
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.680
all of you guys up that are with me, I'm the same set we're do on the show.

349
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.000
And we're all on the same night. Let's all just make each other look good.

350
00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.760
I feel like, especially in fighting, whether it's boxing, MMA,

351
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:42.873
anything along those lines,

352
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.480
we gotta be elevating each other to make each other better. Yes. Like, Hey,

353
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.960
this guy is good. This guy is good without talking.

354
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.800
Cuz we like yourself specifically as well as like even, uh,

355
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:56.960
myself and other guys that have shows and podcasts and start talking we're on a

356
00:17:56.961 --> 00:18:00.880
PLA on a different level of platform that can really kind of either make or

357
00:18:00.881 --> 00:18:05.280
break some people's careers. Yes. It also with also the sport is confidence.

358
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.230
Okay. MMA is uh, a confident level in some you do wrestling.

359
00:18:09.231 --> 00:18:13.950
It's a one-on-one combative sport into wrestling. MMA. Confidence is key.

360
00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.190
If my confidence is low,

361
00:18:15.191 --> 00:18:18.390
then that means that I'm not probably not gonna perform my best. And the,

362
00:18:18.391 --> 00:18:20.230
when you take a loss, it goes lower and lower.

363
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.110
When you gotta hear it from people that don't know the business like this right

364
00:18:24.111 --> 00:18:28.710
here. It's just another thing added on. And for other MMA guys to,

365
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.340
other MMA guys, all that does is tear them down even more.

366
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.500
And you could potentially, I'm not saying ruin their career, but you're,

367
00:18:35.501 --> 00:18:37.620
you're not helping them get to their goals and their levels.

368
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.100
It's better if everyone shines and we all handle ourselves with class and

369
00:18:41.101 --> 00:18:41.934
respect.

370
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:51.330
<v 3>&lt;Silence&gt;.</v>
