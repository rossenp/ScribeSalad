00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.620
<v 3>Like, did you see the.</v>

3
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 0>UFC this weekend? I didn't. And I won't. Oh my.</v>

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.333
<v 1>God,</v>

5
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.520
Brian Ortega and Alexander V Kovski had one of the craziest title fights I've

6
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:16.840
ever seen in my life. It was wild and I kind of wish I was there. I, I,

7
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.400
I was outta town for that one. That was my hunting trip. So I had a Kansas,

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.470
but God it was so good. It was so crazy. Like that was a fight.

9
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:29.070
You couldn't call because Ortega almost won twice

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.230
with two insane submissions once with a, with a, uh,

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.790
he got him on the bottom with a guillotine or mounted him rather with a

12
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.470
guillotine. And then he got him on a bottom with a triangle. It was insane.

13
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.860
And Ortega is known for his submission.

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.660
His submissions are some of the best he's got like.

15
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.900
<v 0>He's a Torrance jujitsu.</v>

16
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.060
<v 1>Guy, right. He's from the original Gracie academy in Torrance.</v>

17
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:56.740
That's where I trained keep going orient ran school and his sons,

18
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.060
you know, um, he, yeah, he and Huron and it's just,

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.810
and bro Ryan Ortega came from there.

20
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.370
A lot of it's like lineage it's lineage.

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.170
Like it's like some of the purest jujitsu that you're gonna get.

22
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.530
And when you say fundamentals like Brian Ortega has perfect

23
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.890
fundamentals, you know, Chrome Gracie, perfect,

24
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.730
perfect fundamentals.

25
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:25.360
They do everything is to like this razor char when he dove on that guillotine

26
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.240
choke, I like that is like,

27
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.280
I wish people could see how beautiful that is the way I see it. Yeah.

28
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.880
Because I know how hard that is to do the way he slipped it in.

29
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.600
He got Mount on the world champion. Yeah.

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.880
Full guillotine Mount or world champion. And that guy got out. I mean,

31
00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:43.310
he's gurgling, it's his, as deep as it gets.

32
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.350
And when you realize how good Brian Orta is and what he's in right now,

33
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.150
he's in a Mount, but he's also got his legs crossed underneath,

34
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:54.470
which is like the most ruthless Mount cuz a regular Mount you're on top of a guy

35
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:57.870
and a guy can kind of buck BTE, got his legs crossed.

36
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.510
So that kind of GI team with a guy like that is deaf. It's deaf.

37
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.020
That crazy from Australia got out where 99.9,

38
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.060
9% of the people who have ever lived would've tapped out. Yeah.

39
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.860
That Savage it's like not today. I'd rather die.

40
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.540
<v 0>I got, I did a deep dip on dig on Brian Ortega. He so good.</v>

41
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:23.300
He was on uh Shas uh, Calabasas companion. Yes. And,

42
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.090
and probably one of the most interesting human beings I've ever heard talk.

43
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.930
He's a actor and his, and he just doesn't come at as an actor,

44
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.690
which is how I come at it as like just a regular person who he's an actor.

45
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.050
<v 1>He who's acting before he did, uh, fighting. No, we don't.</v>

46
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.650
<v 0>Have to pull it up. No, no, no, no. Please let me know. So let me know. Hold on.</v>

47
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.920
Brian Ortega was in a movie with Charla booth. They were.

48
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.640
<v 2>Both in the movie, but that was like the first or maybe he's done.</v>

49
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.440
<v 1>Very few things. Was that when he was already fighting,</v>

50
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:51.640
when was that movie very.

51
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.440
<v 2>Recently with, uh, they were like was an extra, but Brian's in it. So, but they.</v>

52
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.320
<v 1>Probably Trump Brian in, because you know,</v>

53
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.960
he's already fought for the title before he fought max Holloway. Yeah.

54
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.400
He knocked out Frankie, Edgar. I mean, Brian Ortega has been a bad.

55
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.840
<v 0>For years. I heard you. Well, I got a deep dive about him and I do,</v>

56
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.240
I do a thing called open tabs where I keep all the tabs open to my safari

57
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.200
browser. And then I do a podcast about learning,

58
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:13.200
telling you about all the I learned over the weekend. Ah,

59
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.080
and I had a big Brian Ortega one, but I,

60
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.280
I took it out because sometimes with cage fighters, they don't,

61
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.470
I maybe what I say, isn't what they hear. And I don't wanna any of the moms.

62
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.710
I know.

63
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.630
<v 1>What you're saying. Like some dudes are super.</v>

64
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.070
<v 0>Sensitive. Well, I'm sensitive. I'm sensitive as. And,</v>

65
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.150
and Brian Ortega was in this movie with SLA booth and he said, he said,

66
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.390
he told this crazy story about sh trying to fight him. And I was like,

67
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:36.030
oh my God, that's hilarious. And I was like, is that real?

68
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.790
<v 1>Is that real? Yeah. Yeah. I heard the stories.</v>

69
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.380
<v 0>That is hilarious. And so, and, but Brian Ortega,</v>

70
00:03:42.381 --> 00:03:45.860
the way he was telling the story was like, it was good. Like it was legit,

71
00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:50.580
good storytelling. Like I'm like he can do jujitsu. I can tell a story. Right.

72
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.540
And the way he was telling the story was like the.

73
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.500
<v 1>Way you would do jujitsu.</v>

74
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.420
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; no, not at all. Actually, if I knew jujitsu, yes,</v>

75
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.130
he was telling it good. He was telling.

76
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.850
<v 1>Good. Watch the entire episode for free, only on Spotify.</v>
