00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, 74.</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.310
<v 1>And he's fat. And he kicked it in four days. Yeah. But I don't give a.</v>

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.650
What anybody says? What did.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.750
<v 2>They give that guy? They gave him everything.</v>

5
00:00:11.751 --> 00:00:13.100
He's the president of the United States.

6
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.820
<v 1>It works. They have a thing. If you give them everything, it works. Sure.</v>

7
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:18.110
But the fat old guy.

8
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.920
<v 2>But he's getting stuff that's very different from what you would get,</v>

9
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.240
just walking into urgent care.

10
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.080
<v 1>And see, don't go to urgent care in Encino, go to Cedar. Sinai.</v>

11
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:29.900
They'll hook you up with whatever he's got. Do you think, like,

12
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.920
is he getting things that you can't get? Yes. In all seriousness. Yeah.

13
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.850
Are you sure? How do you know.

14
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.540
<v 2>First thing is a trial drug that hasn't been approved yet?</v>

15
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.880
They're not just handing that out at Cedars.

16
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.640
Is that the first thing.

17
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.380
<v 1>That's REMS said that everyone can get that from desert,</v>

18
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.730
desert beer. Anyone can get that. Anyone can get what is the other stuff.

19
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.150
But the.

20
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.480
<v 2>Other thing he got was like the plasma related right. Therapy.</v>

21
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.910
<v 1>You can't get that everywhere. Now. Why can't you?</v>

22
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.460
<v 2>Because you're not the president of the United States.</v>

23
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.910
<v 1>Maybe the liberal media is trying to keep that from you so that you stay sick so</v>

24
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.940
they can get Biden into the white house. Everything about that. All right. Now,

25
00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:08.774
wait a second.

26
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.630
<v 2>Literally last night, because I literally was like,</v>

27
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.160
there's definitely so much confusion because the,

28
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.170
that side is ramping up the fear a hundred percent making it scarier than it

29
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:26.600
is so they can get him in to be president.

30
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.040
And the other side is definitely saying from Trump on,

31
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.950
don't worry about this thing. So it makes,

32
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:36.470
it looks like we did a good job in the economy, comes back and all that stuff.

33
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.370
So I'm like this cognitive dissonance, like what is real,

34
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.830
what I watched Tucker Carlson. He made sense for a minute.

35
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.970
And then I watched Anderson. He made sense for a minute. And I was like,

36
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.240
let me lift off into the satellite and let me just look at the world.

37
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.400
Let me see what's happening in the world. That's not involved in this election.

38
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.170
Spain, France, Moscow,

39
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.130
the Netherlands all opened up a little too much.

40
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.100
And now we're all putting restrictions back everything's spot.

41
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.130
<v 1>Yeah. But if you want to look at other countries,</v>

42
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:14.630
look at Sweden because they opened up completely and they have less cases.

43
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:17.840
And now they're back to normal. They have no masks. You go to a bar, no ones,

44
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.370
obviously it's a smaller country country. I mean, look, less people.

45
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.440
They live in different sort of circumstances.

46
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:28.670
They have mostly smaller villages other than Stockholm. But yeah.

47
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.920
<v 0>They're, they're fine. I.</v>

48
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.460
<v 2>Know. But if you look at Spain and you look at France, Moscow, I mean,</v>

49
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:37.610
these places, there is no political agenda in these places.

50
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.330
There's no political agenda. It's just, they opened up and they said,

51
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.470
let's go all open. And the cases skyrocketed, and now they have to like,

52
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.760
bring it back a little bit. It's this, the virus is a real thing,

53
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.420
eating all these extra humans and you know, all.

54
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.980
<v 1>These extra human, what the? What are you saying? The virus is a real thing.</v>

55
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:58.820
Eating all these extra.

56
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.390
<v 0>Yeah. What is that? What do you mean.</v>

57
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.990
<v 1>Kind of way to describe it is that [inaudible] eating all these extra humans.</v>

58
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.370
Yeah. We have.

59
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.420
<v 2>Extra humans right now. We have way too many humans. You can't say it like that.</v>

60
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.470
Well, it's the truth.

61
00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:17.280
You know how sometimes you have Moss that's growing and it comes up just up to

62
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:19.950
the edge of the walkway. And you're like, that looks pretty right.

63
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:22.770
And then it starts going over onto the brick and starts covering.

64
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.390
We are the MAs and we're covering the bricks now and something's showing up and

65
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:29.970
scaling us back a little. Or.

66
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.440
<v 1>There was an experimental virus that they're working on the Wu Han, what is it?</v>

67
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.790
Level four lab. And it got out Sweden.

68
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.840
COVID lockdown says, restrictions will remain for at least another year. Yeah.

69
00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:44.310
But the restrictions are very different.

70
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.650
Their restrictions are for really large gatherings,

71
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:48.600
but you can go to restaurants, you can go to bars, you know? Yeah.

72
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.740
But there's still.

73
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.370
<v 2>Restrictions. The virus is a real thing. Go all around the planet.</v>

74
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.430
And it's going to be a little bit, it's going to be till June,

75
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:57.780
by the way I heard in Denver.

76
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.380
<v 1>How did he know that in Denver?</v>

77
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.750
They're the people that told you about eating up extra human.

78
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.800
<v 2>Tell me that, uh, this pilot was talking to me at the show and he said,</v>

79
00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:13.950
his doctor of some note was saying that, uh,

80
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.240
all of our pandemics, I have lasted 18 months,

81
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.150
despite what we try to do, restrictions, no restrictions.

82
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:25.770
It runs its course 18 months is about where the fire starts to subside.

83
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:28.590
And you go back to normal, historically speaking.

84
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.240
And this one and because it's a hundred years in between pandemics,

85
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.210
nobody's around to like give you lessons from the last one.

86
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:40.950
So we make all the same mistakes. And if you go by that,

87
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:44.430
it's about June from when this virus started,

88
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.750
we're talking about June when we're back to normal, which is kind of upsetting,

89
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:53.400
but kind of nice also that you have an end date. You know, it's kind of like,

90
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.061
all right, that's annoying.

91
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:56.820
I got to wear a mask and do all this stuff and be kind of messed up.

92
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.800
But till June, that's kind of nice. I can maybe make some plans. I can,

93
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.600
I can make, uh, a 4th of July.

94
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.600
<v 1>How many businesses are we going to lose between now and June though?</v>

95
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.400
I think that the real,

96
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.240
the real issue is people putting restrictions on what people can can't do.

97
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.020
That's the real problem is you're basically giving up your constitutional rights

98
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.630
and there's, there's no real protection for you this way, right?

99
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:23.670
There's no real protection for your business.

100
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.330
There's no real protection for your livelihood. When even,

101
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.160
because even with all this,

102
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.050
you're still dealing with other kinds of horrible deaths and

103
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:37.080
other kinds of horrible things that go along with the economic despair.

104
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.770
Like how many people are going to die because of drug overdoses or depression or

105
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:44.490
suicide. Yes. These have to be factored into.

106
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.030
<v 2>Totally do. And I really get the feeling like, but there's a,</v>

107
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.380
there's the middle ground between the CNM narrative and the Spock's narrative.

108
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.040
There is the re there's the truth. And I still, I saw it in Portland.

109
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.083
I saw it in,

110
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.630
I saw it in salt lake city performed in all these places and they are all

111
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:06.260
wearing masks, but their businesses are open. Yes and.

112
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.570
<v 1>LA a long time ago.</v>

113
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.350
<v 2>Yes. They're testing. They've got the mask on. They're distancing.</v>

114
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.320
Like I ate in restaurants, but you know, that's limited capacity.

115
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:18.590
I performed in comedy clubs, half capacity. Uh,

116
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.710
but here's the thought just because of my comedic, I.

117
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.543
<v 1>Don't think,</v>

118
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.630
I don't think that that's scientific because there's aerosol, the,

119
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:28.990
the virus is carried through the air now. Yeah.

120
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.820
This is pretty much been confirmed.

121
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.490
They used to think it carried through droplets,

122
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.090
which is the reason for the whole six foot social distancing space.

123
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.690
They don't think that's the case anymore. They think it's airborne.

124
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.460
So if that's the case,

125
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.600
all that social distancing stuff is horseshit because it's in the air.

126
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.540
<v 2>But not if you're social distance and have a mask on.</v>

127
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.140
<v 1>Th th I'm telling you the social distancing thing doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>

128
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.060
Gotcha. What they're saying? Maybe.

129
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.340
<v 2>Close with a mask, but you're still in a mask.</v>

130
00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.520
<v 0>A lot of these massive holes in them. Well, yeah.</v>

131
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:01.720
<v 1>But a lot of these masks,</v>

132
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.910
like you see these paper masks that people have with the wire,

133
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.430
there's an opening in the top. There's openings in the side.

134
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.400
There's a lot of skin. I'm not saying it's not a good idea to wear a mask.

135
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:13.660
And maybe it reduces some of the droplets to go out. Maybe I'm not a scientist,

136
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:15.970
neither of you. But what I am saying is,

137
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.230
I don't know how much I think what you're getting is you're getting a lot of

138
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:23.590
people that are healthy and they're going out and they don't have it.

139
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:25.330
And they're not giving it to anybody because they don't have it.

140
00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:26.164
And you're getting away with it.

141
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.510
And everybody's wearing masks and it's good to be cautious,

142
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.020
but I don't necessarily know if you were in a room filled with people who had

143
00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:36.280
COVID and you, unless you had an N 95 mask, unless you have a real mask.

144
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.400
I don't know if those cloth masks are going to help you. I.

145
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.530
<v 2>Think they work. I mean, cause look, you, you look at these.</v>

146
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.080
<v 3>Places, what are you basing that on? I'm basing.</v>

147
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.040
<v 2>It on cities where they have the mask as a, as a thing.</v>

148
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.940
And they made it mandatory that you wear these masks and the numbers go to

149
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:55.000
everyone. Does everyone does what? Everywhere. You have to wear a mask,

150
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.460
the whole country. Well now, but it wasn't. I mean,

151
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.830
this was fits and starts and you know, people.

152
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.350
<v 1>There's all sorts of weird. I traveled protests were a big kick in the virus.</v>

153
00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:07.330
That was a giant uptick. Right?

154
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.580
<v 2>So there was a lot of people out there with no masks.</v>

155
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.040
<v 1>Not just that. They're just bumper to bumper with each other.</v>

156
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:15.580
They were right next to each other and screaming right now. It's in the air.

157
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.290
Exact, especially at nighttime,

158
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.010
they think the sun kills it like almost instantly. Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

159
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:24.520
There's been studies on UV light and UV light kills it almost instantly.

160
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.600
So sunlight and even simulated sunlight can kill it all.

161
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.100
<v 2>Look any pre-call it's it's, you're playing the odds, right?</v>

162
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.840
You want to do all the things that you can.

163
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.090
<v 1>So you want the steroids that Trump's on. That's what I.</v>

164
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.310
<v 2>Want them to. I want the vaccine.</v>

165
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:42.940
<v 1>The rock had when he was doing Jumanji that's they gave him,</v>

166
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:44.860
they gave him all the good stuff. Yeah.

167
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.780
<v 2>The really good stuff and shots in the.</v>

168
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.530
You remember when you were a kid and you got a shot in your butt cheek,

169
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:55.380
I do those things worked. That's what we need to bring back as cheap shots.

170
00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:58.820
Did they give you and your butter? I don't. I don't know, but they weren't.

171
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.630
And you didn't want to go back to the doctor and have some man take your pants

172
00:09:02.631 --> 00:09:05.060
off and make you cry in front of your mom. So you stayed healthy.

173
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.860
<v 3>I never cried on my buddy with.</v>

174
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.820
<v 2>A PMU, sticking your out of your car window to get your bags.</v>

175
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.590
That would be hilarious.

176
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.640
<v 1>If everybody's just like parked with their buck right up to their driver's side</v>

177
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:17.474
window.

178
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.210
<v 2>So look, all of this is kind of like it's going to run its.</v>

179
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:24.043
<v 1>Course,</v>

180
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:29.300
but you can do things that the revealed Trump has been treated with DEXA,

181
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.880
Metha, sewn, an immunosuppressant steroid that can cause you fork,

182
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:38.480
mood changes. Well, there's this tweets, that's it. Since then,

183
00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:39.920
I'm doing wheelies in the parking lot.

184
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.120
Since then people have posted online about their own experience with the drug.

185
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.110
Interesting and amino suppressants to that's. What's interesting too,

186
00:09:48.111 --> 00:09:52.940
is like they say that one of the things that happens with this disease is

187
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.680
you,

188
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.580
you actually don't want the immune system to react too violently to

189
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:03.080
the disease or to too aggressively to the disease. So they're given,

190
00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:06.560
I don't understand the logic behind that. Cause I'm stupid.

191
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.010
<v 2>To read that article. It was complicated.</v>

192
00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:14.000
Like it made me think how amazing the human body is. This immune system,

193
00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:16.040
like there's stages of the immune system.

194
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.910
Like it originally comes out and gives you a dose of stuff and surrounds the

195
00:10:19.911 --> 00:10:24.020
virus and then it goes up and then it ramps up and then it reboots and then it

196
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.370
like sends another part.

197
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.040
It was like four stages of what your immune system does.

198
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:31.460
And because it has to be ramped up to attack this virus,

199
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.200
it could actually hurt you more than the virus.

200
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.830
<v 1>What does DEXA methods sown do?</v>

201
00:10:36.831 --> 00:10:40.760
Dexamethazone is a co quarter co

202
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.340
corticosteroid, uh,

203
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.510
hormone that decreases the body's natural immune response reduces swelling and

204
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:51.110
allergic reaction symptoms. This magic medication treats a number of conditions,

205
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:52.460
including asthma,

206
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.210
IBS Crohn's disease and a number of lymphomas.

207
00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.190
It is used to treat COVID-19 because serious cases can provoke an exaggerated

208
00:11:01.191 --> 00:11:03.380
immune response, releasing a NAR,

209
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.800
a large number of pro inflammatory cytokines.

210
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.410
And what's known as a cytokine storm.

211
00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:14.390
I've heard of that as immunosuppressant DEXA methasone is thought to

212
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:17.720
help reduce the likelihood of the body's overreaction to the virus.

213
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.420
Research has found dexamethasone to significantly reduce mortality amongst

214
00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:26.060
seriously ill hospitalized. COVID-19 patients,

215
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:30.200
scientists have said it may prevent one in three deaths among patients on

216
00:11:30.201 --> 00:11:31.850
ventilators. Wow. Interesting.

217
00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.350
<v 2>Yeah. So they gave him,</v>

218
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.710
they threw the kitchen sink at it immediately and it works. Yeah.

219
00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:37.790
You're the president of the United States.

220
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:39.850
You should get everything they possibly have. All.

221
00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.600
<v 1>I'm getting at this by with you here is that in these times where things</v>

222
00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:46.100
are very unsure.

223
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.940
A lot of times people like to say exactly what you need to do and what's

224
00:11:49.941 --> 00:11:52.880
happening. Right. As long as people do this, we're okay.

225
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:56.830
As long as we wear a mask, we're okay. And I'm not sure,

226
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.670
I'm not sure that's the case. We're all going to get it.

227
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.300
That's what I think. Well, that is within that.

228
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:08.670
<v 2>Is the reality of what I'm saying. That doctor saying that it goes 18 months.</v>

229
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.430
<v 1>But I don't know, 18 months mean everybody gets it.</v>

230
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:13.470
You're going to come in contact with it. Right.

231
00:12:13.471 --> 00:12:15.780
And some people's immune systems just beats it.

232
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.360
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

233
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.480
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

234
00:12:24.481 --> 00:12:25.650
they're going to be available everywhere.

235
00:12:25.651 --> 00:12:29.220
But after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

236
00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:33.240
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

237
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.310
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking you just go download Spotify much.

238
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:39.510
Buh-bye.
