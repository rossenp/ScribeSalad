00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.560
<v 2>So I, when I've started, I've moved to, uh, actually I have a story with you.</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.680
Yeah. About first starting. Oh,

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.800
you were responsible for basically the first time I ever went on stage. Uh,

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.600
I mean almost in a comedy. I think zany,

6
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:17.800
Chicago might have been the first actual club I went to is either that or the

7
00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:22.150
comedy store. So I was friends with, uh, a buddy mine, Josh baker.

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.990
He was in the band prom Kings. Do you remember a band? I think. Sure. Yeah.

9
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.430
Yeah. And so we came out to LA to stay,

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.470
hang well with him and he, uh, and so they knew you.

11
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.110
And so this is, I mean,

12
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.950
I think it's 2003 or four and I I've been to a comedy maybe a year.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.540
And so we come out and then we, you invite us to the show at the comedy stores.

14
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.180
So we come watch you, we sit in the front row. I remember all this stuff.

15
00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:48.820
That's like a nightmare is a comedy. Now, when you think back then,

16
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.773
I didn't care.

17
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.540
<v 0>Had you been thinking about doing it already?</v>

18
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.940
<v 1>I already started, I moved to Chicago. So I was in,</v>

19
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.300
I was in Chicago with like Hannibal and Pete Holmes and TJ Miller.

20
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.460
And Cammel like, that was kind of the group that was in Chicago. So I,

21
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.730
we went from Chicago to LA to go, just visit. And so we hung out with them.

22
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.610
We go to your show, you introduced them at one of their shows.

23
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.850
Cause I guess you were good friends with these people or with the,

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.290
with the band or you like this band.

25
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.650
And so you introduced 'em and I remember I talked to you afterwards. Like I,

26
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:19.930
we were like at this show and I'm like talking about comedy.

27
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.680
I'm trying not to be, I I'm new. So I don't even really know what to ask.

28
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.800
You were very, very nice. And then, uh, we go watch you,

29
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.560
and then you said you gonna go up at the comedy store. And I was like,

30
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.360
it was when you gotta sign up for the open mic the week later.

31
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.240
So you signed up for the Monday to go up the next week. And I was like, well,

32
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.440
I was like, I'm not gonna be here. And uh, you go, oh, I'll call.

33
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.430
And then out me on stage, you called and said, Hey,

34
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.550
he's just in town doing this. I mean, dude, I'm a year comic. Look at this.

35
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.110
It worked out, it worked out &lt;laugh&gt; dude. They brought me up. They go, uh,

36
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.870
this next comics, uh, one of Joe Rogan's best friends &lt;laugh&gt; they were,

37
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.190
I mean, other comics were just furious and I'm like, I don't, I was like,

38
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.950
we met him last night. He's a very nice guy.

39
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.780
<v 0>That's a funny thing, man. The,</v>

40
00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:08.420
those little like nudges and like, uh,

41
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:11.340
little pieces of good like, uh,

42
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.860
like criticism or good, you know, a,

43
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.180
a praise from a comic when you're starting out. Like that could go so far,

44
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.500
so far. So from, I remember to this day, like, uh, Lenny Clark,

45
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.210
I I'd done standup.

46
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.690
I'd done it for like a year and I'd gotten paid one time before this is the

47
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:33.810
second time I ever got paid. And I opened up for Lenny Clark in Pittsfield,

48
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:35.170
Massachusetts. This was after.

49
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.050
<v 1>I think I've done this show really gig.</v>

50
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.170
<v 0>Yeah. Is it Jay's Jay's and Pittsfield?</v>

51
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 1>Was it in a hotel? Um, I.</v>

52
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.923
<v 0>Don't think so.</v>

53
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.850
<v 1>I've done a Pittsfield.</v>

54
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.200
<v 0>Massa. Oh, it was a, like a nightclub. Mm. And it was,</v>

55
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.360
it was like one of the best road gigs. Like everybody get,

56
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.560
it was a three hour drive from Boston,

57
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.560
but it was one of those road gigs where everybody would get excited.

58
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.320
And this was after Lenny had been on HBO. He was on the Ronnie Dangerfield,

59
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:03.320
young comedian, special Ronnie, whatever Ronnie called it. And so see,

60
00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:07.280
just being around him was crazy. And then opening for him was even more crazy.

61
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.120
And then after I got off stage, he was like, kid. You're really funny.

62
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.640
Like with that crazy Boston accent and man that powered me through like

63
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.310
years for through years, I was GE I was like, oh man. And I'm doing this,

64
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.630
like I'm, I'm never quitting now. Like Lenny Clark said, I'm funny. I'm.

65
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.950
<v 1>I'm good. It's the, it's the it's gigantic. Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:31.110
Like that was you doing that at that time? A, I,

67
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.710
I knew the comedy store, but it's not like I even really,

68
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.070
and then it was like going to New York and then be like,

69
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:40.300
I've already done the comedy store at, even though it open mic, it was just,

70
00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.980
I saw the world and I gotta see the world. And then talking to you at that, uh,

71
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.020
the band you were just talking about going up and like, you gotta go up like,

72
00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:50.180
you know, stuff that you would say to comics, but right.

73
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.220
It was like stuff that I didn't know at that time. And you realize, you know,

74
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.700
that, that that's enormous. Yeah. That's enormous. I did that.

75
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.610
Pitfield mask gig. Uh, I, cuz I was in New York,

76
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.610
opened up for Tony V. Oh I love Tony V. Yeah. And they,

77
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.890
I was, the host got paid 500 bucks. It was crazy. Like I was like, this is CRA,

78
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.570
I've never been paid 500 bucks for a gift. Right. It's packed, sold out.

79
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.930
I mean you just murder. And I thought maybe it wasn't a hotel.

80
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:21.240
I don't remember my wife foot with me. It was a big night.

81
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.040
They gimme 500 bucks cash. I end up later on the night I lose the $500. Oh no,

82
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.640
it just falls out. Why?

83
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.480
So the night goes from this amazing night with my wife for 500 bucks to now

84
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:35.280
we're in a fight. And uh, I, and but I mean,

85
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:37.840
I still think I tell her every day I cause at the time I was like,

86
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.110
you ever gonna remember this $500? Like I was gonna live the by that motto,

87
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.910
like I'll get another $500. I bring it up still. I mean,

88
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:47.910

89
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.630
