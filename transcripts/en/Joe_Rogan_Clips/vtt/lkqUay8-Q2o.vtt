WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I want to hear about your parasites. Oh yeah.</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.520
So what's going on?

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.130
<v 1>Well, there's still more testing,</v>

4
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:12.510
but they did find something called schistosomiasis in me. So schisto um,

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.350
is from the tropical rainforest of Africa. Um,

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.220
I think that's the only place that exists, but it comes from the snails. And so,

7
00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:22.350
because I probably baked not, cause I probably,

8
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:25.770
I have bathed in the rivers there, um, been in the rivers,

9
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.760
going across mouth. No, uh, they can get into your skin.

10
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.130
And I was real itchy for a couple of weeks there.

11
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.480
And with that was with some of the like parasites, I guess. Um,

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.410
what'd you call it there? They're like egg sacks or something that got on me,

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.650
got inside of my stomach and my liver, um,

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.580
could be potentially even in my brain, in your brain potentially.

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.740
So they don't know yet. Well, they, uh, what's today. Today's Wednesday, right?

16
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.730
One day I did my final exams and uh,

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.180
I did three full days with his doctor, Dr. Daniel. Amen.

18
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.370
He would be phenomenal for the show, by the way.

19
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.310
He's incredible to two Ted talks, millions.

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.310
<v 0>Of views. You, you, you,</v>

21
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.310
you're such a great promoter of your friends divert and you want to talk about

22
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:11.210
them. I want to talk about you.

23
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.790
<v 1>Okay. Let's talk about what's going on with you when you saw him.</v>

24
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.990
Because I kept getting jerked around by all these different doctors. It's this,

25
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:19.250
it's this it's, this it's this.

26
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.190
And I've had numerous endoscopies to go look in my stomach because why am I

27
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.490
throwing up? And um, one says it is an ulcer and other comes out and says,

28
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:30.890
your stomach's perfect inside. It's a little red,

29
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.970
but like there's no ulcer whatsoever. Um, and so I have schisto,

30
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.660
I've had an intestinal bacteria that's really bad called Shigella.

31
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.650
I've had malaria three times. I've had dengue fever.

32
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.650
So den gay was in me for at least a month. The CDC found it.

33
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.430
<v 0>In me. And he's had this parasite and you for a long time. Now how many months?</v>

34
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.790
<v 1>At least six, um, since April.</v>

35
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.150
<v 0>And have you been able to train at all during this time? Ups.</v>

36
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.511
<v 1>And downs?</v>

37
00:01:56.511 --> 00:01:59.690
So I was at the police and fire training center of Oklahoma city and they're

38
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.720
just helping them. Um, there's some really great guys there and, uh,

39
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:03.800
I was helping them in the fire.

40
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:07.130
Chief ended up putting me in the cold shower for like 20 minutes. Cause I got,

41
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:11.720
so they said I got like ghostly white and I started dry heaving and I was just

42
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:15.590
shaky all over from your parasites. Yeah, Jesus. And so it's an up and down.

43
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.230
I'll I'll start, I'll start getting in shape. I'll start losing weight.

44
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.250
I'll start. Um, I'll start feeling good. And I just crash.

45
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.880
I've had shingles five times, Joe, what? The five times,

46
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.190
what shingles is this stuff? Well, I'm, I'm starting to do hyperbarics um,

47
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.210
hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Um, got a prescription for that and uh,

48
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:38.270
that's been helping more than anything right now. Um,

49
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.320
I'm trying to have that morning routine protect my sleep eat. Right. Uh,

50
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.880
my wife helps me meal prep.

51
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.820
I have juices all through the day of the superfood coffee.

52
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:50.630
I ha I I'm doing all the stuff I can. I was on 28 pills a day, uh,

53
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.710
for four or five weeks in a row. This doctor's parasite. Yeah.

54
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.850
Well a whole parasite cleanse because they didn't have a parasite that they

55
00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:01.780
haven't found or that they haven't liked. Um,

56
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.860
that's not because I'm going so remote Joe in the forest,

57
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.080
they think I could have picked up something crazy. So they,

58
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:12.550
they just did a Lyme Lyme's disease test on me. Uh, this was on Monday,

59
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.450
so Lyme disease. They did a cheek swab from like genetics.

60
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.490
They did a hair, so they cut off like, uh, six different spots of hair,

61
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.040
glowing stocks. Yeah. So they cut that.

62
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.460
My wife was a mom or teasing me because I was like crying about it. I was like,

63
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:32.000
don't, don't cut it here. Don't cut it here. Um, so they took six spots, uh,

64
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:36.610
of hair samples from me, um, blood urine stool samples.

65
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.440
Um, they did two different kinds of brain scans on me. Um,

66
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.820
so they literally injected something that was a very minorly

67
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.440
radioactive, um,

68
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.580
in me so that it could light up all of the different spots in my brain activity.

69
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.800
So where there's too much blood flow or there's not enough. Um, and literally,

70
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.050
so one of the things I found on the scan, which I already knew,

71
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.630
but they can test, um,

72
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.460
not just stuff for like CTE or mild traumatic brain injury and TBI

73
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.850
before autopsy. Now these brain scans, um,

74
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.020
they can also test for, um, like PTSD.

75
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.220
And so there's this,

76
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.310
there's this diamond in the middle of your brain and you're only supposed to

77
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.710
have a little bit of activity. They're just very, very small.

78
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.990
But if you have this, what they call the ring of fire,

79
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.580
this diamond of red and white being lit up on the brain scans that literally

80
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:32.040
shows that you have PTSD. So Coda mirin here, do you know who he is? Yeah.

81
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.400
Dakota. That was an incredible podcast. Meant to text you afterwards. He's.

82
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.320
<v 0>He's an amazing guy and people have.</v>

83
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.230
<v 1>I heard that one go back and watch it. It's one of my favorites that you've had,</v>

84
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.600
Dakota's a legitimate.

85
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.350
<v 0>Hero.</v>

86
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.850
But one of the things that he was saying was that they injected him and this,

87
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.380
do you remember what the blocker was called?

88
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:53.350
That blockers cagey or whatever the blocker was.

89
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.170
And he described it and he said he completely stopped his PTSD,

90
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.710
cured all of his anxiety. See if you can find it, Jamie,

91
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:04.500
just so we could reference it. I remember that I sent it to my wife.

92
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.900
<v 1>She's in psychology right now. She's going to be a counselor.</v>

93
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.990
And I sent that to her because they were talking about PTSD and the teacher

94
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:12.540
said, oh yeah, that's been around for a while too. And that's what Dakota said.

95
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:12.960
Yeah.

96
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.590
<v 0>I think he made it clear. I think they made a clip that Jerry clipped guys did.</v>

97
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.043
<v 2>What's it going?</v>

98
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.700
<v 3>Ganglion? Yeah. SGB GB blocker.</v>

99
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.633
Yes. Yeah.

100
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.750
<v 0>That he said it just instantly alleviated all of his problems. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.590
Which is insane. I mean, like my wouldn't you love that the miracle cure,

102
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.870
they give you a shot. Boom. Your problems go away.

103
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.580
Did he say it lasts like a year?

104
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.280
<v 1>I think he said six months to a year, depending on a kind of,</v>

105
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.550
you have to have other traumatic stuff thinking.

106
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.720
<v 0>They're doing it even though anything wrong. Yeah. I.</v>

107
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.910
<v 1>Just want to feel great. Well, this is what's crazy. Oh.</v>

108
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:52.020
And then Dakota said that, but this Dr. Daniel. Amen. Um, who's got like,

109
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.711
he's a 10 time,

110
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:57.000
New York times bestselling author and he's got a book about PTSD and

111
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.180
um, basically he was saying that, yeah. Um, that shot really,

112
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:07.040
really does work. Um, and people have been doing it for years and with veterans,

113
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.300
um, it's one of the quickest.

114
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.460
<v 0>Do they? You have some PTSD.</v>

115
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.100
<v 1>Yeah. So he was saying this watch Dakota said,</v>

116
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.460
you just cued that up where or triggered that in my memory where, um,

117
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.600
the most common PTSD is car wrecks.

118
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.310
I think that's what to go to side. Right. Is car wrecks caused the most PTSD,

119
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.730
same spots in your brain, that diamond of fire. Um,

120
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.500
and that's something you can't avoid. Right?

121
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:34.220
You have to go back and be in public transportation or getting your own car.

122
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.620
<v 0>Of them from car accidents, not from car accidents.</v>

123
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.290
What do you think you have it from, from.

124
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.270
<v 1>Some tough stuff? Um, in the rainforest, whether it's Uganda or Congo, um,</v>

125
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.730
we've had to flee from a village.

126
00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:49.750
Whenever a rebel group came into the village next to us and they killed six or

127
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:52.870
eight people and we're all fleeing across the river and these like little pygmy

128
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.770
dugout canoes, which aren't big enough really for me. Um,

129
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.500
and we're trying to flee across the river before the sun's even up.

130
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.790
And there's like crocodiles and hippos in the water. Um, and then, uh,

131
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.130
and then a couple other really terrible things. I mean, I've,

132
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:10.750
I've held kids that have died and buried them and dug their graves. And, um,

133
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.980
that's happened numerous times. Uh, we've had machine guns pointed at us. Um,

134
00:07:14.981 --> 00:07:17.590
I won't get into that story too much, but, um, we talked about that.

135
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:20.620
One of those stories before and someone, someone I love was,

136
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:23.140
or a bunch of people that I love were with me. And, uh,

137
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.090
so that was really tough because we were unarmed and were being threatened. Um,

138
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.900
and so that was tough. Um, and then, and then some like childhood stuff,

139
00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:35.150
I think, uh, different kinds of abuses and stuff, stuff like that.

140
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.380
Somebody willing to do some public shaming and.

141
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.540
<v 0>Yeah, I don't want to lose track of what I was asked to share about your health.</v>

142
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.290
Okay. So what, what are they doing and what can they do about what,

143
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:47.680
what you have? So when you said you might have some crazy,

144
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.010
meaning you might have a parasite, they don't even know yet. Yes.

145
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.390
So that might be in.

146
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.350
<v 1>That's why the diagnosis or in blood, um, urine,</v>

147
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.180
blood stool, hair and cheek swab seal. So it's possible.

148
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.080
<v 0>That you have something that like very few human beings I've ever had because.</v>

149
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.480
<v 1>They have a deep, deep jungle.</v>

150
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.850
<v 0>Yeah. How long does it take you to get to where you go?</v>

151
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.650
<v 1>Well, it depends on where, where we go place. Um, okay.</v>

152
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:19.600
A plane from Oklahoma city to normally Chicago or Dulles or JFK

153
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.190
or Atlanta. And then we go to Amsterdam or London,

154
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.300
or is it Qatar cutter thing? It's guitar, guitar. Okay.

155
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.850
And then we'll fly either from there to Nairobi Kenya or Kigali, Rwanda.

156
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.690
And then from there you connect to, um, Kampala, Uganda.

157
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:43.210
And then from there you get a private like missions or humanitarian

158
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.370
plane. That's just you and the pilot.

159
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.210
And so you take that plane from there to you, uh,

160
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.730
from Uganda to Congo and then you land,

161
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:56.070
you do customs and then you get back in the plane and you go and you land on a

162
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.430
runway that normally they've just cleared with machetes. So.

163
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.120
<v 0>Flying, you're flying from Oklahoma. Let's just say Oklahoma city to JFK,</v>

164
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:10.220
JFK, to London, two planes. So two to London, London to Kenya,

165
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.820
Kenya, Kenya to Uganda for.

166
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.733
<v 1>Uganda.</v>

167
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.230
And then you get in the plane again to go out to the ramp. So six planes,

168
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.440
six flights, at least five planes. How many days? Uh,

169
00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.850
that's normally two or three days. Geez. And then, um,

170
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.650
30 hours or something of travel.

171
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.010
And then after that you get in a car and it could be six hours.

172
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:36.110
So where you land used to be in the rainforest,

173
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:41.720
but you drive six hours now to get to the rainforest because it's deforestation

174
00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:45.200
so bad. The deforestation in the last 25 years,

175
00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:49.070
they've cut down about the size of Texas. It's a pretty wild we've, we've,

176
00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:52.640
we've helped replant 4,000 trees, but that's not even scratching the surface.

177
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.100
Who's deforestation, everybody. Um, uh, it's a lot of,

178
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.580
uh, Chinese, U K um,

179
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.760
and outsiders that come in and exploit the rainforest.

180
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:08.960
There's a lot of mahogany in the area. Um, what is it, uh, Ebony,

181
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.390
um, there, do they get cheaper.

182
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.480
<v 0>Prices to do this? No, no, they just do it.</v>

183
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.870
They just send someone in and cut down the trees. So no one calls to do it.

184
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.750
No one stops them. So they just claim the resources they don't have on.

185
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.890
<v 1>On the border. They might have to pay some sort of bribe or tax.</v>

186
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.630
They call them that wow. Or taxes. They call them that. Yeah. VAT.

187
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.170
That's a Ugandan way to say taxes. And, uh,

188
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.840
then from there that drive that six hours,

189
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.820
sometimes it's taken 25 hours one time and another time it took 47.

190
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.650
<v 0>Same drive for drive. Why did it take 47? Oh, I.</v>

191
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.430
<v 1>Think we helped get 40 something cars out of the way, um,</v>

192
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.670
that were stuck in the mud. Um, so it's really silty there.

193
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.200
You don't call a Congo roads, roads. Um, I've never been on tarmac in Congo,

194
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.100
actually. That's why I have been in, uh, on cement in Goma,

195
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.630
but outside of Goma, there are no, uh, concrete roads anywhere,

196
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.710
tarmac roads. So, uh, I've seen an 18 Wheeler or Laurie,

197
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.760
um, three fourths of the way sunk to where his eye up to their window,

198
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.180
the driver's side window up to silt. And now they get it out.

199
00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.640
I don't know that one, that one was just kind of in the graveyard.

200
00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.790
That one was like a done. No, one's getting that thing out. Really? Yeah.

201
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.321
I mean,

202
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:26.990
you're going around mountains and you look down to the side and you'll see

203
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.430
4, 8, 12 vehicles that have flipped off.

204
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.080
this.

205
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:33.913
<v 4>Justin.</v>

206
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.110
<v 1>There's some vise videos of it, the craziest roads in the world.</v>

207
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.630
And a lot of them are in Congo. Some say Rwanda,

208
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:44.360
because there are so many Hills, it's the land of a thousand Hills.

209
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.890
And so there's so many sharp turns and then they take those turns at 40, 50,

210
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.220
60 miles an hour. And so they'll literally just fly off the mountain.

211
00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:54.100
And so you.

212
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.880
<v 0>Catch this parasite, you've gone through all these tests. I mean, this has been,</v>

213
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.700
I mean, we've been talking about on the podcast for several months now.

214
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.180
So for me hearing that you're still dealing with it is really disturbing.

215
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.410
What can they do about this? What are they going to do? I.

216
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.510
<v 1>Think getting off that cleanse, I mean,</v>

217
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:14.460
I was on 28 pills for four weeks, maybe five weeks. Um,

218
00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.650
and some of it were like antibiotics,

219
00:12:16.651 --> 00:12:19.260
but I have to stay away from certain antibiotics. Here's the thing,

220
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.940
a couple of things that I know I have PTSD, um, uh,

221
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.440
cause of my brain scans. Um, and then they see in my brain toxicity.

222
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:33.570
And so, um, the toxicity in my brain, which kind of form these little divots,

223
00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:35.310
um, but not really divots.

224
00:12:35.311 --> 00:12:38.070
It's not really changing the biology or makeup of my brain,

225
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.260
but it's just activity of my brain. Isn't fully developed right there where, um,

226
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.300
or it's it's being toxins are there that are either from meth Liquin or

227
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:51.000
from Cipro heard of Cipro. What.

228
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.000
<v 0>Is messaging? What's the first one that flow Quinn. What does that stuff?</v>

229
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.690
That's a malaria.

230
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.440
<v 1>Drug. Oh Jesus, no malaria drugs take for any reason,</v>

231
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.950
really that used to be the drug of choice for a military.

232
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.650
Now tens of thousands of our military veterans.

233
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:09.540
If you look up Metro Quinn toxicity, military times, they've done two articles.

234
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:11.670
One was just a month or two ago. Uh,

235
00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:14.760
but the first one show that tens of thousands of our military veterans have

236
00:13:14.761 --> 00:13:19.500
wrongly been diagnosed with PTSD. And it's been because of this Metro Quinn.

237
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.730
So they never saw war, the Mefloquine toxicity of the brain.

238
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.670
It's like this poison for your brain. Um,

239
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.520
and if you've taken it for like six months, you can have it,

240
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.490
it starts giving you bad nightmares. Um,

241
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:37.230
you can have different kinds of mood swings and different stuff. Um, health, uh,

242
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.340
joint aches, um, fatigue, all sorts of different things. But, um,

243
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.930
basically what Mefloquine toxicity of the brain does, well,

244
00:13:45.931 --> 00:13:49.080
tens of thousands have been wrongly diagnosed with it when they take it for once

245
00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:50.220
a once a week.

246
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.030
So you take the pill once a week and that was why it was our drug of choice.

247
00:13:54.031 --> 00:13:57.060
Instead of it being every day, where two times a day,

248
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.690
you just take it once a week. Well, when I had malaria,

249
00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:03.750
the three times I was allergic to the normal malaria medication,

250
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.270
quinine and art to fan and um,

251
00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.750
some other drugs like doxycyclin and, uh,

252
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.280
Malarone I wasn't responding to those well, I was vomiting. I was, uh,

253
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.140
I was allergic to them.

254
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.190
So Mefloquine my body digested the best or I just took it the best.

255
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.260
So the three times I had malaria,

256
00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:24.720
they gave me two in the morning to midday and two at night.

257
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.160
And so I'm taking six in a day for five to seven days.

258
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.030
And these other guys that were getting Mefloquine toxicity were taking it once a

259
00:14:33.031 --> 00:14:35.190
week for six months.

260
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.550
So I had 30 to 42 in a week's time.

261
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.360
I had six months in a week's time and I did that three different times.

262
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:43.710
Why are they giving you so much?

263
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.950
It was what my body was responding to against malaria.

264
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.760
The first time I lost 33 pounds in five days. And so I was vomiting,

265
00:14:50.761 --> 00:14:54.320
red and green blood and bile. I lost most of my hearing. Uh,

266
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.300
my peripheral vision started disappearing.

267
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.430
I had some called Blackwater fever where my urine was literally as dark as that,

268
00:15:00.431 --> 00:15:04.190
that black clock, um, take pictures of it. And I didn't,

269
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.060
I should probably should have it freaked me out. Uh, five days I didn't urinate.

270
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.220
And then when I finally did, if you Google, uh, Blackwater fever, one in four,

271
00:15:13.221 --> 00:15:16.730
one in two people that get it, they die. You didn't urinate for how many?

272
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:21.080
Five days, five days I couldn't pee. Oh my, um, uh, they were trying to, uh,

273
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:25.580
get IVs in me. My veins were collapsing. Oh, geez. Um, so that was,

274
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.260
that was pretty brutal. Um, but yeah, man, so, uh,

275
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.540
I'm getting my health better there cause I do want to fight again. How.

276
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.850
<v 0>Can you, if you have this stuff in your brain.</v>

277
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.660
<v 1>W w um, I'm journaling my road to recovery.</v>

278
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.010
<v 0>But you don't know what this parasite is. How are they treating it? Like,</v>

279
00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:47.320
what are they, how are they going to get ahead of yourself? Hopefully.

280
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:49.900
<v 1>They don't find anything. Cause it just got off those rounds of, uh,</v>

281
00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:51.640
so they're testing me for Lyme disease.

282
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.840
They're testing me for all these kinds of parasites, amoebas, bacterias,

283
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.390
you can find disease in the Congo. Well, I've,

284
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:02.890
I've been camping out here and I've gotten like a bit by five or 10 texts or

285
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:07.210
something like that. So, um, but yeah, there there's these wicked kind of ticks.

286
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.170
Um, my record is pulling five roaches out of my beard in one night.

287
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.360
So there's tons of bugs there.

288
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.070
<v 0>You know? Does, does Oklahoma have that Rocky mountain check?</v>

289
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.970
Not nothing that Northern lone star tick, the one that gives you a meat allergy.

290
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.020
Have you had that? I've I've.

291
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.800
<v 1>Been bit by that one. I don't think I have a meat allergy though. I hope not.</v>

292
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:29.170
<v 2>Yeah. That's a crazy one. Um.</v>

293
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.430
<v 0>What is it called? Uh, alpha gal, alpha galactose. It's uh,</v>

294
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.660
something that,

295
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.070
it's the reaction that this tick bite gives you.

296
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.750
It makes you allergic to this specific element in red meat. Wow. Yeah,

297
00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:46.540
you can only eat fish and like, if you try to eat meat, you'll get really sick.

298
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.640
<v 1>Wow. That's crazy. That is crazy. But they're trying to figure it out why,</v>

299
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.130
and this is going to be crazy. Um,

300
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.570
why I'm 32 and I've had shingles five times. Uh, what,

301
00:16:58.571 --> 00:16:59.680
my first time I got malaria.

302
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.420
I don't know if you can see the white in my beard over here,

303
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.750
but I got white in my beard. The first time I had malaria,

304
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.800
the second time I had malaria, I had white come out in my beard down here.

305
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.940
So your body's just freaking out. Yeah. So then now I've got shingles, um,

306
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.820
five times. Um, and then this is going to sound crazy,

307
00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:20.530
but I know I have to have a, uh, this might be too much information,

308
00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:25.060
but I know I have to have a bowel movement whenever my nose starts running. Hmm.

309
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.270
So literally whenever I have to go,

310
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:33.430
my nose starts running and running and running. How is that connected?

311
00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.490
I don't know if that's what they're looking into there like that.

312
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:40.510
That's just your second brain. And so it's it. I don't know.

313
00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.640
It's digestion when your stomach is your second brain, they said, oh,

314
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.880
more than trust your gut. Trust your gut.

315
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.410
It's got literally more neurons in your stomach than in your brain. Really?

316
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.000
That's what the doctor is saying.

317
00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:53.450
<v 0>No, that's the case with your heart as well. Right?</v>

318
00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:56.960
There's a bunch of neurons in your heart that they're realizing now,

319
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.280
like that whole idea of.

320
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.710
<v 1>Trusting your heart and trusting your gut.</v>

321
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.400
<v 0>Like these, these thought processes that people had,</v>

322
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.030
might've actually been based on some intuitive understanding of how the body

323
00:18:08.031 --> 00:18:08.360
actually.

324
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.510
<v 1>Works. It's really weird. It is weird, really weird,</v>

325
00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.330
strange everything everything's connected. Right? Everything's.

326
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.790
<v 0>Connected. That's not weird really. Okay. I mean,</v>

327
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.630
it makes sense over time and it Oklahoma.

328
00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.110
<v 1>We're like, we have no explanation for that.</v>

329
00:18:21.111 --> 00:18:22.640
And then the doctors out here were like, oh,

330
00:18:22.641 --> 00:18:25.790
that's because this is connected to this. And they did all my blood work,

331
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.210
even though they did more blood labs before I ever came out here,

332
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.500
like a week or two ago,

333
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.080
they still poked me five more times to get more blood work. Uh, because well,

334
00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:37.700
three times they were drawing blood two times.

335
00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.040
They were putting that stuff in me so they could do the,

336
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.520
so you're getting better, uh, doctors out here, more, more informed,

337
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.570
more informed. Yeah.
