00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 2>Can I ask you how you create a song? Like how, when,</v>

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:10.020
when you're putting something like that together, do you write it out on paper?

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.630
Do you just say it until you remember it?

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:15.510
Like Jay Z apparently doesn't write anything. Right, right.

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.810
Just keeps it all in his head. Do you do that? Do you write it?

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.820
<v 1>When I first started out my first time doggy-style I got two songs where I just</v>

8
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.270
freestyle. One is called GS and hustlers, and one is called the sheers knit.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.270
Those two songs. I just went in there and just freestyle,

10
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.400
whatever came out of my mind and my head at the tech.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.310
<v 2>I've been good at that for a long time.</v>

12
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.750
But a lot of times I like to make sure that I'm pinpointing a specific

13
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.883
topic,

14
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.420
a specific cadence and a specific style that I'm trying to

15
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:47.460
perfect. When I'm making a song.

16
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.520
I'm not just trying to make a record for the day.

17
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:54.780
I'm trying to make something that's going to be here tomorrow and the next day

18
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:55.614
and the next year.

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.000
<v 0>So when you said you freestyle it, you mean like when you walked in,</v>

20
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:02.850
you really didn't know what you were going to sing when you were recording it.

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.440
<v 1>Well, the song, the sheers knit was supposed to be a mic check.</v>

22
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.570
I supposed to go in there and just check the mic.

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
My check went to my check and Dre put the beat on my check.

24
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:18.030
Check 1, 2, 1, 2. [inaudible] hop it.

25
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
Stop it hopping like a rabbit. When I take the Nina Rashi. No, I got to have it.

26
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.670
I stay back in the cup, retain myself. I'm thinking about the. And I'm thinking,

27
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:29.130
well, how can I make my grip?

28
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.990
And how can I make that straight slip said, trip got to get him. Food was grip.

29
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:36.240
As I dip around the Kona. Now a Mona,

30
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.280
another mission wishing upon a stall is Snoop doggy dog with the caviar

31
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.950
and the back of the lemon, or demo the system rail.

32
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.210
I'm breaking down like Evander, Holyfield, chill till the next step of soul.

33
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.200
I make money. And I really don't love holes to take the truth.

34
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.650
I swoop in the coop. I used to let that man come on, man.

35
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.120
That was all a freestyle. I just go into that just spit from the dome.

36
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:04.260
And it just came out and Dr. Dre just maybe made it work,

37
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.010
but every song is different. You know,

38
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.210
cause sometimes a song would come to me from just like hearing some or just

39
00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:13.350
being out somewhere and be like,

40
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.220
I want to make a song about whatever I just went through or whatever I'm going

41
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.900
through or whatever is the moment. It's always a different experience.

42
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:22.770
Every time we make a song.

43
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.130
<v 0>So sometimes it's something that you actually write out.</v>

44
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.080
<v 1>A lot of times the song murder was the case. I wrote that song,</v>

45
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.140
um, because I was thinking about life after death.

46
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.750
The song was initially called Dave D a V E death after

47
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.090
visualizing eternity. Well,

48
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.050
and it was crazy that I was taking the like that.

49
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:51.270
And I had made a song called murder was the case.

50
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.580
That was about me losing my life. What, before I lost my life,

51
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.010
I did it cut a deal with the devil,

52
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.190
but then God came back and gave me another chance that was in my mind.

53
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.110
But when I wrote it, it just became some gangster,

54
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.950
but that was the premise behind it. And it was just in my head.

55
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:10.360
Like I want to write a song like this.

56
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:15.190
And then three months later I caught a murder case in real life. Well,

57
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.600
yes. So my pen was actually writing reality.

58
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.460
So I had to pull back from certain things. Let's table, maybe last,

59
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.960
you start writing about life and living instead of always writing about dying

60
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:29.794
and death.

61
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.190
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

62
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.570
<v 1>Deep. Just think about my peers, me Tupac, biggie.</v>

63
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.880
Like just think about our records. The last records that they made.

64
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.000
It was a lot of death. It has some life in it too,

65
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.340
but had a lot of death in it.

66
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.990
<v 0>Yeah. That east coast, west coast. It became a, a real,</v>

67
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.110
a real divide in the country with hip hop, right?

68
00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.770
It was because you didn't want to be on the wrong side and you didn't want to

70
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.530
like, like for example, if you have friends, right.

71
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.680
That was leaning more towards the east coast.

72
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.920
And then you had a friend that really wanted to hear west coast music.

73
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:15.700
Y'all might've been y'all friendship. Yeah. Based off of that, really?

74
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.930
It was that serious. Yeah.

75
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.400
<v 0>How did it, it went, it kind of isn't that way anymore though. Right?</v>

76
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.050
That's good. Isn't that like a good sign for the future?

77
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.190
<v 1>That's a great sign.</v>

78
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.890
There's people working together from all parts of the world.

79
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.040
<v 0>'Cause like in the nineties, that was a real problem.</v>

80
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.510
That was a real divide that.

81
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.130
<v 1>I was the, we couldn't control the media. Like we can now.</v>

82
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.820
So even back then, east coast and west coast,

83
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.370
we used to hang with each other and kick it and love each other,

84
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.360
but we didn't control the media platform. So we couldn't,

85
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:52.270
we didn't have Instagram or Facebook and none of that. Well,

86
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:56.930
we can slap up a picture of me and NAS and JZ and this person hanging out.

87
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.963
I didn't have that.

88
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.150
All you had was the media saying the east coast and the west coast.

89
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:05.590
Don't like each other, which sides you chosen. Yeah. And that's just that.

90
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.753
Yeah.

91
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.110
<v 0>And it's their job just to sell newspapers.</v>

92
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.990
<v 1>Right. And then once lives were lost and you could blame,</v>

93
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.620
you can naturally say Tupac. Okay.

94
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.140
Did somebody have something to do with that? From the east coast?

95
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:21.700
We don't know biggie.

96
00:05:21.701 --> 00:05:24.970
He got killed on the west coast that put speculation that maybe somebody from

97
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.200
the west coast asked him to do this.

98
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:30.970
Or it just kept fueling to the fire until you had people like puffy

99
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:35.830
myself, Steve Harvey, who were man enough to say, look,

100
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:36.970
we need to put an end to this.

101
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.080
And let people know that we don't advocate that we really love each other.

102
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:41.914
We're a family.

103
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.520
And we started building bridges and started doing things together and being seen

104
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:47.590
together and controlling our own narrative.

105
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:50.020
As far as what we was putting in the public side.
