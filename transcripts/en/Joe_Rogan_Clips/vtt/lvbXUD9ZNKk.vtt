00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.800
<v 2>I got a text from Pete brat, the OG, my buddy and Pete brat.</v>

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.440
Let me know about your background. Like I did not know you were a fighter pilot.

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.080
I did not know that you did you work at area 51.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.830
<v 1>I cannot confirm or deny that &lt;laugh&gt; whoa. I worked at Ellis air space,</v>

6
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:23.750
which is okay in that general vicinity. So.

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.630
<v 0>So you can't talk about like experimental or anything.</v>

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.590
<v 1>Like that. You know what I did, the first thing I did at,</v>

9
00:00:29.591 --> 00:00:32.310
at Ellis was when I flew in the Thunderbirds. Right.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.550
And then I went away for a couple assignments. And then when I came back,

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670
I was an aggressor. And if you remember the movie, top gun, you know,

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.990
Viper and all those guys that were the camouflage planes,

13
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.980
they act as the enemy forces and trained blue forces before they go off to

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.540
comment. That's what I did the second time around.

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.620
So the NES ranges are probably up in that general vicinity.

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.620
But as far as being someone that worked at that, no,

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.380
I worked at Nellis air force base. Oh, okay. We flew in that. Okay.

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.420
In that general area, but.

19
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.700
<v 0>I don't believe you. I think you're lying now. Now I think you're holding back.</v>

20
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.410
You, did you feel it, Jamie? All of a sudden he's like smiling.

21
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.010
I don't some of the answers to the question.

22
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.290
<v 1>You guys don't want guys in dark suits and shades to come in here and be like,</v>

23
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.770
uh, Mr. Smith, we needed, I already.

24
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.650
<v 0>Talked to those dudes. They're good guys.</v>

25
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:13.730
They're just trying to protect us from the aliens. You know.

26
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.410
<v 1>The crazy thing is in, in that area,</v>

27
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.250
when people used to think they would see UFOs and stuff like that, you know,

28
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:23.240
there's a book that came out a couple years ago called red Eagles that explained

29
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.880
a lot of that stuff going on and what they thought were UFOs or, you know,

30
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.080
transportation planes that were landing at some of the bases and stuff up.

31
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.160
<v 0>There. Yeah. A lot of people see wacky. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.440
The first time I ever saw a stealth bomber, I was, uh, it,

33
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.320
I was filming at fear factor in, um, Palmdale mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, which is,

34
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.550
uh, near, was it Edwards at right by Edwards? Yeah. Yeah.

35
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.310
And I saw a stealth bomber flying overhead and I swear to God,

36
00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:51.110
I thought it was Darth Vader. When you see one of those things in real life,

37
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.880
you would think,

38
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.550
especially if you didn't know mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that the United States was

39
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.470
developing one of those,

40
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.550
like when they were first developing them and flying them before they made it

41
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:02.710
public mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that thing looks like it's from another world.

42
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.740
<v 1>So it's part of you say that. So when I was on Thunderbirds,</v>

43
00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:08.140
we do incentivize for like media personalities and other people.

44
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.420
And I was out at our training area,

45
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:14.860
which is over death valley and we're talking to the Navy controllers and they

46
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:17.660
come over and say, you know, I was Thunderbird too. T-Bird two.

47
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.380
I need you to fly straight in level for five minutes.

48
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.180
So there's gonna be aircraft off your nose. I need you to, you know,

49
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.050
diverge to the right to stay away from it. And I'm like,

50
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.130
what in the world is this? So I threw my radar out there,

51
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:31.970
which just snack anything out there and I'm getting these intermittent hits and

52
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:33.850
I go, I don't see anything on the radar. Next thing you know,

53
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:38.450
I look up and I go, what the has happened. And I look up and it's a B2 that has,

54
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.970
you know, a escort plane right next to it. That comes right next to,

55
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.970
and I looked at it for the first time and I go, there's,

56
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.800
there're aliens out here. This is some kind of space.

57
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.160
<v 0>Look at that thing. Yeah. I mean, look at that.</v>

58
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.320
That does not look like it's from here. Yep.

59
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.400
That absolutely looks like it's from another world. Yeah. Like all those,

60
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.200
when people talk about seeing those triangular spacecrafts in the sky,

61
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.240
I mean maybe some of 'em are from another planet.

62
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 1>But yeah. So if you've never seen one of those and like,</v>

63
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:06.880
for me as a pilot perspective, I'd never seen anything like that. You know,

64
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.960
you hear about the F one 17 from the golf war and you see this big thing coming

65
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.120
towards you. And that's.

66
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.360
<v 0>What everybody always reports too.</v>

67
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.000
A triangular object with like th a light on each corner. I mean,

68
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:20.630
that is a stealth bomber. Yep. That's a crazy looking in aircraft, man.

69
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.750
<v 1>Yeah. So I had somebody in my backseat that was like, oh my God, what is that?</v>

70
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.710
What is that thing coming.

71
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.490
<v 0>By? And I mean,</v>

72
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.350
if we thought that we were being invaded and then you saw things like that,

73
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:31.550
flying overhead, that that is what I would imagine. They would be flying.

74
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.390
They came from.

75
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.870
<v 1>Another plane. That thing is out at Whiteman air force base. You know,</v>

76
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.710
you see it flying out there all the time. So they're folks here in a local area,

77
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.863
they'll see it taken off and.

78
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.900
<v 0>Some new ones that they haven't released yet.</v>

79
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.300
<v 1>I don't know. So I retired about eight years ago. Right. I heard a crazy story.</v>

80
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:49.420
One day that someone was hunting up in Montana and saw something similar to

81
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.900
that, that he had never seen before that like came out of the ground in like a

82
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.620
vertical type thing and then took off, which, you know,

83
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.410
the F 35 and planes like that will take off some of them vertical stance and

84
00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:01.244
then go forward.

85
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.450
But to see something that size and that scale do something like that,

86
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.970
it kinda makes me wish I was still in the military.

87
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.930
<v 0>Just so you be in the know that's right. What,</v>

88
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.250
so which one can do that and take off the F 35.

89
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.250
<v 1>Yeah. So there are a couple variance. Um,</v>

90
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.090
so the air force one does traditional rolling takeoff, but the Marine one,

91
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.960
you know, is almost like a Harrier. So the, the back engine will rotate.

92
00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.160
So it'll take off vertical. And then as it's going forward,

93
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.240
the engine will rotate back the other way to give it forward propulsion.

94
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.600
But man, just technology wise, the stuff that we're flying now.

95
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.573
So I will tell you this,

96
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.200
the first time I fought on the range against the F 22 Raptor and I fought

97
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:40.990
against everything in the world. So out of Nels with aggressors,

98
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.790
everybody comes there to train, to get prepared for combat.

99
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.150
There's no better plane in the world than a F 22. When that thing passed me.

100
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:50.790
And some of the stuff that I saw it could do, I go,

101
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.510
there's no better plane in the world. So as far as air superiority,

102
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.910
F 22 is at the top of the.

103
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.550
<v 0>Food chain. What is the difference? It's.</v>

104
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.910
<v 1>F 22 is primarily air superiority, you know, so like air to air,</v>

105
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:04.100
dog fighting long range range, missiles, uh, F 35 is, you know,

106
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:07.020
a command and control platform. It still has weapons on it can drop bombs,

107
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:10.340
shoot missiles, et cetera. But the role is a little bit different. So yeah,

108
00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:13.340
that's F 22, you go to a air show and see that thing you're like,

109
00:05:13.341 --> 00:05:15.660
is that a plane or a helicopter with some of the stuff that it does,

110
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:18.460
but fighting against that, you know, as a fighter pilot,

111
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.930
your average fighter pilot is a cockiest person that you were ever it in the

112
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:22.764
world, just like top gun.

113
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.650
<v 0>Exactly. Like the movie, that's all real. We're better.</v>

114
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.570
<v 1>Than everybody. That's our philosophy, but it is very happy.</v>

115
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.370
<v 0>You have to have that philosophy. Right. I mean, look at that, look at that.</v>

116
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.050
That's insane. Oh my God, that's insane.

117
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.770
It just shoots straight up in the sky. Yep. Oh my God. I mean,

118
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.970
it doesn't even look like a real, a real.

119
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.040
<v 1>Plane that, that is mean machine right there.</v>

120
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:44.800
So I got friends that fly that plane and, you know,

121
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:48.000
you see it a it's designed in combat, you know,

122
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.920
the United States is still gonna be at the top of the food chain, as far as the,

123
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.520
the personnel that we have, the men and women that fly these airplanes,

124
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:55.880
and then the equipment that we're flying,

125
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.360
you're not gonna find anything to match. It.

126
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.400
<v 0>That's incredible that turn that it just made in the sky. So is that what the,</v>

127
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.880
the maneuverability of it is that what's superior? What the.

128
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.600
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; why does it do that? That's insane. So thrust factoring on the back,</v>

129
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.120
you know, plus the flight controls. I mean, look, he just flat plated that,

130
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.150
and wow. The amount of thrust is coming out of it. So, you know,

131
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.430
internal avionics, the stealth capability and the maneuverability of it,

132
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.590
nothing, the world is gonna be that, but.

133
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.470
<v 0>The, they can't fly very long. Right.</v>

134
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.950
<v 1>You know, uh, it's, it's a total package.</v>

135
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.790
So whenever you go to combat or something,

136
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:33.510
you're gonna have tanker support out there. So you're gonna meet a, you know,

137
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.020
a airy fueler up at 20,000 feet and get gas and I think can external fuel tanks.

138
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.460
Uh, but the goal is to be able to plan the mission, to be able to go in escort,

139
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.820
have guys drop your bombs or do whatever and get back out with tanker support.

140
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.860
You know, there's always that philosophy without the gas, you know,

141
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:52.140
no one is gonna go. So like when I was in Iraq and stuff,

142
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:56.380
we take off in Saudi Arabia, fly a hour up, meet a tanker,

143
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.050
go fly our mission, come back to the tanker, get more gas,

144
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.130
go out and fly for another couple hours and then go back to the base.

145
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.970
How long can.

146
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:04.890
<v 0>That fly for? You.</v>

147
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.170
<v 1>Know, I don't know. It obviously depends on how hard you got the gas pedal down.</v>

148
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.570
Right? Right. I, I think in the F 16, if we stayed in full after burner for,

149
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.730
you know, five minutes, you probably run outta gas five minutes,

150
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.240
or it could be quicker than that. Now the goal is endurance.

151
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.240
You obviously want be able to stay out there to maintain the yeah. You know,

152
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:25.120
go the length of your mission. Um,

153
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.600
but you look at the length of the mission and fuel capacity.

154
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.640
And the goal is obviously to have somebody there as a backup,

155
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.280
cuz you never wanna be out there by yourself.

156
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:36.240
You always wanna have that support. You know?

157
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:38.480
So you may have guys that that's sitting back here in a, a,

158
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.630
a cap waiting for their turn to come in, you run outta gas up front.

159
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.230
Now you swap out those guys come back in. So total protection. So.

160
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.150
<v 0>Until they come up with something superior to internal combustion engines,</v>

161
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:52.190
we're always gonna be limited by the amount of fuel that they can carry.

162
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.710
Exactly. Just because of the weight. Right?

163
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.950
<v 1>So as far as endurance, yes. Now capabilities of the plane, most fire,</v>

164
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.220
the planes have a G capability of nine GS. And as you know,

165
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.420
time's a force of gravity. Do you wear.

166
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.293
<v 0>A GSU.</v>

167
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.900
<v 1>When you're in there wear GSU? So in a fourth generation,</v>

168
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.460
like a F 15 F 16 is a fourth generation fighter.

169
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.780
We wore G suits on the abdomen and down on the legs.

170
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.140
And basically what that does as you pull GS,

171
00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:20.930
you're going against gravity and blood starts to drain from your brain down into

172
00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:25.370
your lower extremities. So the GSU is just a capability to help counter it.

173
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.930
It's really a tightening restriction of your muscles, starting with your calves,

174
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.770
hamstrings, buttocks, all the way up. And we do the hooking. Yeah. The,

175
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.610
the hook you hook and that's really to hold the oxygen in.

176
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.010
And what that does is lock everything down to hopefully hold the blood up and

177
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.400
your brain as long as possible.

178
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.160
<v 0>I told you, I flew with the blue angels once mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

179
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:45.160
And when I did that, I,

180
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.640
I got to seven and a half GS mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; before I couldn't take it

181
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:49.480
anymore. So.

182
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.360
<v 1>Did you start to gray out or did it start the tunnel.</v>

183
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.680
<v 0>Vision? Yeah. It was like an elevator door was closing. Yeah. And you know,</v>

184
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:56.280
I'm doing that. Who do do.

185
00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.920
<v 1>So it's weird because people think it's, you know,</v>

186
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.640
two GS would be one greater than one,

187
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.920
three GS is one greater than two. But when you start to get above five,

188
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.040
it's not a plus one. It's exponential. Oh. So when you start to.

189
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.920
<v 0>Get to seven, so six is 10. Oh.</v>

190
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.630
<v 1>Yeah. That's what, what it feels like. Yeah. And,</v>

191
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.470
and you can't explain how it feels, but non GS is absolutely.

192
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.910
I mean, you get back home that night and from straining and everything,

193
00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:25.670
you know, measles, what? It looks like little,

194
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.110
we call 'em geasles where your blood vessels will actually start to pop. Oh wow.

195
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.990
And you get these little specs on from strain is so hard that you're popping

196
00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:36.180
blood vessels, but the goal is obvious not to fall asleep.

197
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:39.740
We call a fall asleep in airplane G uh, GLAS of consciousness. Uh,

198
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.420
G lock is what it's called. If you do that and you're in the air,

199
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.740
it may take you 30 seconds to a minute to be able to come back to any kind of

200
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.980
capacity. And if that happens, you know,

201
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.420
majority of the time is gonna be catastrophic. I.

202
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:52.660
<v 0>Uh, made it through that.</v>

203
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.220
And then I blacked out on the way back mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because I didn't

204
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.690
whole hook on the way back. Cause I thought I, I got cocky.

205
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.090
I thought we're good. And we made a hard turn.

206
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.610
And I think I blacked out at like five Uhhuh, like four and a half or five.

207
00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.650
It wasn't even that much compared to seven and a half.

208
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.730
<v 1>Yeah. If you're not ready at four, you know, people like, oh, I can do GS.</v>

209
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:12.410
You get on a rollercoaster. That's like a half a G or one G black stick it at.

210
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.330
<v 0>Exponential. And I threw up, it was double.</v>

211
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.520
<v 1>Embarrassing. Did they make you wear GSU? No, no. GSU see,</v>

212
00:10:17.521 --> 00:10:22.160
the reason they don't wear a GSU is because in close formation,

213
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.680
if you wear a GSU,

214
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.440
the GSU is gonna fill with air to help with that restriction on your legs. Mm.

215
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.560
And in the F 18,

216
00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:33.000
they have a center control stick and they rest their arm on it is the right leg.

217
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.990
And if that GSU is moving up and down, it's gonna move your control stick. Oh,

218
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.450
I see.

219
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.350
So the F 16 has a side stick controller where it doesn't touch your leg at all.

220
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:42.511
I mean,

221
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:46.110
it's like you're reclined back in the seat and the side stick controller so we

222
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.950
can wear a GSU. So won't affect precision, you know,

223
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:49.950
moving your arm back and forth.

224
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.790
<v 0>Is there any other technology that they've invented to deal with gravity like</v>

225
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.510
that? Just the sheer force of the.

226
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:59.260
<v 1>Acceleration. So not just to GSU, uh, but you will have, uh,</v>

227
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.060
induced pressure breathing, you know,

228
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:04.860
so you wear a specific kind of oxygen mask and that's gonna force air into your

229
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:07.780
system. Cuz the one thing you would hate to do is just hold your breath.

230
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.140
It's like a three second count. You know,

231
00:11:09.141 --> 00:11:12.500
you did that hook and then it's a three second count, exhale inhale right quick.

232
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.500
And as part of that pressure breathing, would you exhale and open your mouth?

233
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:19.530
It's gonna force air in with that pressure breathing system. Mm.

234
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.450
So with the two of those together, and then we combine it with,

235
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.930
you gotta be in shape, you know, you gotta lift weight,

236
00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:27.730
you gotta have some kind of cardio conditioning to be able to last cuz it's one

237
00:11:27.731 --> 00:11:30.810
thing to be strong enough to hold that, you know, G position.

238
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.290
But then you do a 45 minute, you know, dark fighting mission.

239
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.370
Your body's gonna get tired.

240
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.400
So you gotta be able to sustain that the entire time.

241
00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:41.760
So most fighter pilots are gonna lift ways. They're gonna do, you know,

242
00:11:41.761 --> 00:11:46.000
extreme cardio exercises to be able to sustain. But anything else,

243
00:11:46.001 --> 00:11:48.320
other than that, it was kind of weird back in the day,

244
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.600
it would be go drink a Coke and a bag of Doritos and get that sugar rush for

245
00:11:52.601 --> 00:11:54.960
that 45 minute flight and be able to sustain through it really.

246
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.120
It's more of a health conscious, uh, thing. Now, you know,

247
00:11:57.121 --> 00:11:58.320
the total pack is stand in shape.

248
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.960
<v 0>I guess they're just smarter now about it probably a lot.</v>

249
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.720
The blue angel guy that I flew with was a tank and they dude was S SW,

250
00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.200
he was like Yoel Romero. He was jacked. You.

251
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.720
<v 1>Know, that was philosophy. Cuz when I was on the team, I'm six one,</v>

252
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:11.800
I probably weigh 2 30, 2 35.

253
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.870
<v 0>That's large, a fighter pilot. Right? The.</v>

254
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.510
<v 1>The cockpit was extremely tight.</v>

255
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.790
<v 0>Usually they're smaller guys because is that a thing with the, the,</v>

256
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.470
the gravity it's easier to sustain.

257
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.830
<v 1>Gravity. It, it is a, it's a height limitation.</v>

258
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.750
So you can't be so tall where your head is up against the top of the canopy. Oh,

259
00:12:27.751 --> 00:12:28.370
that's all it is.

260
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.150
But you also can't be that short where you can't see where the dashboard,

261
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:32.910
but there's a weight limitation too. You know,

262
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.940
can't be below a minimum weight because if you ever had to eject and you're

263
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.100
below, let's say 125 pounds, that parachute is gonna drag you,

264
00:12:40.101 --> 00:12:43.060
you won't be able to stop. Oh. Or if you're above, you know, whatever,

265
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:47.060
the weight is 2 50, 2 65, you're gonna come down in that parachute pretty hard.

266
00:12:47.061 --> 00:12:47.420
And you're.

267
00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.420
<v 0>Probably gonna get hurt. Yeah. They can't make custom for you. &lt;laugh&gt; Nope.</v>

268
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.450
<v 1>No. And it's the same basic fighter. So the Thunderbird, it's a, you know,</v>

269
00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:56.330
it's a frontline fighter that they take some,

270
00:12:56.331 --> 00:12:58.610
they take the gun out and they put a smoke barrel in it,

271
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.930
but it's the same basic avionics, the same basic controls.

272
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.130
And it's just painted red, white and blue. Mm. You know,

273
00:13:04.131 --> 00:13:06.450
all the professionals that are the maintenance guys for the Thunderbirds,

274
00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:07.850
the best in the world, the finest in the world.

275
00:13:07.851 --> 00:13:09.450
And I had four of the finest and I was on the team.

276
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.730
They take them off of active duty lines and bring them Elli air force base and

277
00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:15.040
do all the of stuff on the planes, but.
