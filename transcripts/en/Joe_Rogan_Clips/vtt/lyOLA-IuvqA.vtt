00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 2>I decided not to go to,</v>

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.320
I could have gone to some of these places in Scottsdale or LA or Malibu. Um,

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.120
and I could have gotten massages and had the green smoothies and stuff like

5
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:12.720
that, which, which can help a lot of people.

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.120
But me after having like a 15 year off and on battle 10 years where I was,

7
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.440
I was pretty solid. Um, and I, you know,

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.150
come out of it and I'd get right back on the horse and I'd be good for,

9
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.230
you know, years. Um, I decided I needed fight camp.

10
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.230
I needed a training camp. I needed the right coaching, the right strategy.

11
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.390
And I needed people to, to, to ride me like, you know, be hard on me.

12
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.870
This is get sober. Yeah. This was get sober. So that's, that's what I wanted.

13
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.580
And so I saw out one of the toughest places in, in America to go to,

14
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.420
it's kind of a, like a 12 step completion program.

15
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.060
<v 1>It's a big book bootcamp, but it's also like a, uh,</v>

16
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.420
it's developed a little bit out of like militaristic style. And, um,

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.780
I don't know. It was really hard on you, you know, I mean, while we're there,

18
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:03.370
people were being called, you know, mask wear cloud, as you fake as. And,

19
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.570
uh, you Dr. Jel, Mr. Hyde. I mean,

20
00:01:05.571 --> 00:01:09.250
just like they would just grill people and you're up at five. Is that good? Um,

21
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.770
I, I, I don't, I don't know exactly, but it was what I needed at that moment,

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.983
really. Um,

23
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.170
it was what I needed at that moment because I needed to not run from it.

24
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.320
I needed to face it and I needed to look at the, the stuff and the.

25
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.080
<v 0>Are the people running are people that have gotten clean.</v>

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.000
<v 1>This way? Yes.</v>

27
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.680
They have a 87% success rate really for the people that do 90 days. Now,

28
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.960
a lot of 'em only do 45. Some of 'em only do 60 days.

29
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.120
And then I would say probably more than half of the people that went there, uh,

30
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:42.990
ended up leaving because of how art it was.

31
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.030
But the only reason they wanted people there is if you really truly wanted to

32
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:50.270
get sober, right? Because for years you've been stuck in the cycle of addiction.

33
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.430
And for me, the easiest way, I mean,

34
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:56.470
they explained it and I had drawn it on whiteboards a lot. But for me,

35
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.670
whenever you would have that first use, you would have this,

36
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.860
what they call an allergy set off. You, you have an AB no normal reaction to a,

37
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.220
to a substance, just like someone else can't have peanuts.

38
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.660
I can't have drugs or alcohol because when I do an allergy goes off,

39
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.060
that says in my body, I have an abnormal reaction that says, you know,

40
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.340
I know rationally that one is too many,

41
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.380
but whenever have that first use a, thousand's not enough.

42
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.420
I gotta keep having it. And this.

43
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.730
<v 0>Explained to you by these people at this rehab, or this.</v>

44
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.010
<v 1>Is just your own feeling. No, no. This was explained. And,</v>

45
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.690
and there's this doctor that's really great. His name's Dr. Uh, Kevin,

46
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.410
and he's got like a, a Irish last name, but he's, he's got some stuff on,

47
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.570
I think Netflix and Amazon. And, um, he was a Navy, um, surgeon,

48
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.680
and basically like, he ended up right himself scripts for Oxy,

49
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.920
and then he was injecting himself with other stuff. And he got put in a,

50
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.160
a prison, a military prison, that one that got taken down in, uh, like Kansas.

51
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.680
I forget what it's called, but elevens worth or something like that.

52
00:02:57.681 --> 00:02:59.560
He was put in that prison. Anyways.

53
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.760
Now he's spent his time there really trying to help people in addiction.

54
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.360
And that cycle of addiction basically is explained as after you have that first

55
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.760
use and that allergy set off. Now, you go on your spree because what he,

56
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.840
what that doctor did while he brought him up was he shows scientifically through

57
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.600
brain research that an addicts brains different.

58
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.190
Like they don't have dopamine receptors. And whenever that hits now,

59
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.590
all of a sudden it goes back to that almost hunter gatherer brain,

60
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.510
where it says, this is a priority for survival. Like,

61
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:33.030
that's why some addicts will prioritize it above food or water or family.

62
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.790
And you see 'em do irrational things. Mm. And then they go on this run.

63
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.500
And then when they, after, after that spree, after that run,

64
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.300
they come out of it and they emerge remorseful. They feel terrible.

65
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.020
I I've had moments like that. And then all of a sudden, you,

66
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.500
you make a firm resolution. That's what you back it up with. Is that what.

67
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.380
<v 0>You felt when you did it the first 30 days when you did it for 30.</v>

68
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.260
<v 1>Days? Yeah. You came out. I emerged remorseful. And then I, I promised myself,</v>

69
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.450
I promised my wife time. I promised my family, uh, friends that,

70
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:05.010
that this isn't who I want to be. And,

71
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.290
and what they say about an addict is you could hook them up to a lie detector

72
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.730
and they absolutely a hundred percent mean it that they never intend to use

73
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.810
again. But then what happens is they back with that firm resolution,

74
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.280
I promise this was the last time all of a sudden you get restless irrit of bull

75
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.760
and discontented. Well, whenever an addict gets wrestles here to bowl disco,

76
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.680
contented, I, I would ask the question. What's the,

77
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.640
what's the difference between discontent and discontented? You know, disco,

78
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.920
discontent, you might be a little restless, but discontented basically says,

79
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:35.760
well, if discontent is I'm thirsty,

80
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.920
discontented is there's not enough water in the whole world to quench this

81
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:43.390
thirst. Mm. And so you get in that place where you have this mental obsession.

82
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.030
So you have this mental obsession, you get restless, irritable,

83
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:48.230
and discontented, and then you go back to that first use,

84
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.470
and then you get stuck in that cycle of addiction again.

85
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:54.070
And that's where I lived for five years from 17 to 23 was,

86
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.910
I was just looping back and forth. So you get sober for.

87
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.790
<v 0>A little bit, then go back again. And.</v>

88
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.380
<v 1>From 17 to 23, no, I went sober hardly at all. I would get sober for my fights,</v>

89
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.940
the eight weeks of fight camp, 10 weeks of fight camp. But then that's why, um,

90
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.660
that's why grudge training center had to kick me out. You know, I mean,

91
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:16.900
Brendan was on that vote. I think Rashad Nate Mart, um, Shane, Shane Carwin,

92
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.980
uh, Dwayne bang, Ludwig,

93
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.250
all those guys that invited me on the team after I got off the ultimate fighter,

94
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.290
it was just a short while later that they were having to ask me to leave the

95
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:31.170
team. It was like a vote Elliot Marshall, uh, Trevor Whitman.

96
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.250
I think Justin Gates was just starting to come up.

97
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.690
I don't know if he was actually training full time then, uh,

98
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.410
but he was still at north, uh, Northern Colorado state or Northern Colorado, uh,

99
00:05:39.411 --> 00:05:43.280
wrestling there. But they said, Justin, like, um,

100
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.080
you, we love you, but you gotta go. You gotta go get help.

101
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.320
And it should have went and got helped.

102
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.200
But that's when I found my purpose with the pigs. I,

103
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.840
I I've heard this quote that said no act kindness,

104
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:56.240
no matter how small ever goes wasted.

105
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.960
And so I started at the local children's hospital, became a local volunteer,

106
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.680
went through night school for it later. You remember HD net and, uh,

107
00:06:04.681 --> 00:06:07.000
inside MMA with boss rutin. Yeah. Um,

108
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:09.240
those guys came out to the Denver children's hospital.

109
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.320
This was like nine months of me being sober.

110
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.320
All of a sudden now I have Rashad visiting. Um, the kids at the,

111
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.550
in Shane Carwin Dway Brendan Shaw,

112
00:06:17.551 --> 00:06:20.510
visiting the kids that I would push around in the wheelchairs and stuff.

113
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:24.310
It gave me purpose. So, and that purpose helped me stay sober. Sorry. So.

114
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.750
<v 0>2020, this was the first time you had had anything since 2000. And.</v>

115
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.950
<v 1>Like when 10, uh, it wasn't. I, I had, I'd had three pretty big relapses, so,</v>

116
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.410
so.

117
00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:35.870
<v 0>10, whole years of.</v>

118
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.980
<v 1>Sobriety, but I had relapsed three times in that time. Oh, in the 10 years,</v>

119
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.700
in the 10 years, I'd relapsed for 30 days.

120
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.220
I had relapse for nine days and I had a relapse for five days.

121
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.860
<v 0>Oh, cuz these are different relapses. Yeah.</v>

122
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.780
This is not the ones you're talking about. The recent ones with your shoulder.

123
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.480
Uh.

124
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.700
<v 1>No that led in that five day then led into a big, a big one.</v>

125
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.243
I'll go ahead and explain. I.

126
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.970
<v 0>Was confused cause when you 30 days, no, I thought you meant this year.</v>

127
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.730
<v 1>No, no, not this year. Um,</v>

128
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.610
basically March to May 15th

129
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.450
while I was out, I was out there using and um,

130
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.850
I felt so much shame and so much guilt. Um,

131
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.560
because man, I've, I've been on your show, I've been doing good things.

132
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.760
I've been, um, really trying to live the right life.

133
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.400
And uh, my marriage failed, which is okay. That happens.

134
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.080
And I just took on a lot of like shame. I couldn't, I couldn't, you know,

135
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.920
have that relationship be a success. Then whenever I went back to weed,

136
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.670
all of a out in that weed, I, I,

137
00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.870
I just kept going more and more and more and more.

138
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.190
And then all of a sudden I found Oxy, then all of a sudden I found Coke. So you.

139
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.150
<v 0>Started with weed.</v>

140
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.430
<v 1>Yeah. But then I went right to the Oxy and I would, I would,</v>

141
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:53.750
what I would do as in my addict mind, I would think it would sound rational.

142
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.630
I'll just have weed. So I don't go back to Oxy and, and,

143
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.860
and that will help me with pain if I'm injured.

144
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.300
Cuz I I'd actually hurt my neck training with Rafael a little bit. And um,

145
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.100
he was sweeping me and I, I put my head out whenever I put my head out,

146
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:10.020
I crunched right on top of my, my neck or my head.

147
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.340
And it just sent this like crunch down into my cervical neck and it was hurting.

148
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.090
I was hurting. Um, more emotionally was stuffing it. I wasn't looking at it.

149
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.690
I was stuffing it, stuffing it, stuffing it.

150
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.250
And then what happened was I felt so ashamed. I told,

151
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.210
I told my board I needed rehab. And I said, I need, I need help.

152
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.170
Like I I've relapsed and I need help. And they've always supported me,

153
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.090
but I was scared that would, they support me in this. You know,

154
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.320
if I'm the leader of the organization or the founder and the spokesperson,

155
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.720
you know, we got an incredible internal team,

156
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.360
but like we've had donors from thousands, uh,

157
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.800
thousands of donors from all 50 states and 59 countries, you know,

158
00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:57.320
did I just let everybody down? You know, and is this gonna be taken from me?

159
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.960
Is this life of purpose that I found, you know, am I gonna lose it all? Um,

160
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.240
and I felt so much shame. They, they were gonna send me to a place in Oklahoma,

161
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.600
not, not to knock it at all,

162
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.920
but I had known people from the recovery world cuz I had been going and sharing

163
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.510
my story of recovery, um, in rehabs, in, in, uh,

164
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.910
in uh,

165
00:09:16.911 --> 00:09:20.270
different sober living homes and all of a sudden I'm back to where they are.

166
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:20.590
What.

167
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.910
<v 0>Is this rehab place? You said this hardass rehab place that has a,</v>

168
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:26.230
an amazing percentage of people get.

169
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.230
<v 1>Successful. It's it's outta Dallas, Fort worth and it's called Stonegate.</v>

170
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.510
And I don't think they advertise it as that hard, but it is that hard.

171
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.900
And I wanted a place once I talked to 'em I realize I like at you and.

172
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.540
They do. They absolutely. You, they did yell at me really.

173
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.820
I had a 21 year old kid yelling at me that was over what? Uh,

174
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:47.980
over a green towel. You wanna tackle him? Uh, I was just like, bro,

175
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.020
I kinda wanted to at first, uh,

176
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:54.620
what they think is they gotta humble you and I'm like, man, life has humbled me.

177
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.650
That's why I'm year. Right? And I've been humbled enough.

178
00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.450
And now I came here to get help. And but their whole thing is if, if,

179
00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.330
if there's no, if they get to you to actually look at your,

180
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.050
if they call you on your, your, then, then you can start working through it,

181
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:09.610
yelling at.

182
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:10.490
<v 0>You over a green towel.</v>

183
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.450
<v 1>Because you, we were only allowed to have white towels that they gave you.</v>

184
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.170
So when you get there, they give you Walmart shoes,

185
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:18.280
they give you paper aware and they give you this hideous. What, what.

186
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.160
<v 0>Paper, paper, underwear, why do they have paper.</v>

187
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.200
<v 1>Underwear? Uh, cuz they,</v>

188
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.520
they take your clothes and they put 'em in a hot box and then they try to kill

189
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:28.160
if there's any cuz there's guys coming from all over the place. Right. And um,

190
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.960
I mean we, we had people that were Ivy league professors,

191
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:33.040
professional athletes explain I'm not, not sure,

192
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.200
but we had people also from like homeless shelters and what you mean hot box?

193
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.550
We a hot box kills any of the, the like bed bugs. Oh.

194
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.830
So if someone were to bring bed bugs in, um,

195
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.670
and get in the mattresses and things like that,

196
00:10:43.671 --> 00:10:45.790
like if someone came from a homeless shelter or from the streets,

197
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:46.910
how could they.

198
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:47.743
<v 0>Afford it?</v>

199
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:49.390
<v 1>Uh, I don't know. Honestly,</v>

200
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:51.750
I think there was like a scholarship program because some of the people were

201
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:55.710
paying $895 a day there, but that, I think that's what they charge insurance.

202
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.980
Um, it was expensive man. So I just went through the divorce and I,

203
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.700
I basically gave the finances we had so she could go back to school and I was

204
00:11:03.701 --> 00:11:05.900
gonna restart. And then, um,

205
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.620
then all of a sudden I need rehab and that's expensive. Um, insurance helped,

206
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.860
but then I had to do you find.

207
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.820
<v 0>Yourself? This is a weird question, but I think it's,</v>

208
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.130
I think it's valid. Do you find yourself? Oh, always in like a new problem.

209
00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.490
Do you, are you, do you create problems? Do you think?

210
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.650
<v 1>I think I try to help find a solution to problems, but I think for me, um,</v>

211
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.530
you asked me a question after we got the treatment and our shoulders, our knees,

212
00:11:32.531 --> 00:11:35.930
and you asked, what are you manifesting? Have this like sickness, you know,

213
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.240
these, all these sicknesses inside of you. I think now.

214
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.240
<v 0>I exactly how I said it. That's not exactly how I said it. I, I said,</v>

215
00:11:43.241 --> 00:11:46.600
do you wonder if you are doing that? You're right. Because sometimes people.

216
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.360
<v 1>Do. Do you wonder if you're bringing this into your life? Yeah. Sometimes.</v>

217
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:54.160
<v 0>People do create pro it's like find they find themselves in this eternal</v>

218
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:56.960
state of conflict. Like some people,

219
00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.120
they figure their way through life with very little conflict.

220
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:04.680
They're magical people. Yeah. I know a few of them it's rare. Yeah.

221
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.640
Some people are constantly engaged in some insurmountable problem.

222
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.600
And then they also go,

223
00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.790
and in your case you find insurmountable problems,

224
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:20.470
like what you're doing with the Congo and the pigmies and Uganda and the, and,

225
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.503
and helping these people,

226
00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:26.390
like it gives you purpose and it helps define your life

227
00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:31.030
in a positive way. Yeah. Then when you're not there problems come up again,

228
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.900
like all kinds of major problems. There's always something, right. Well.

229
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.300
<v 1>I've had some health problems for sure.</v>

230
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.820
And then these relapses that had happened were, were really tough. The,

231
00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:45.260
the biggest one was this one, um, in March. And let me,

232
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.660
let me tell you what happened because, um,

233
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.860
I didn't wanna go to this rehab in Oklahoma, that,

234
00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.850
that I had known people that were there that talk,

235
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:57.890
it had a reputation for people using while they're even there.

236
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.010
Cuz they could have their phones at 5:00 PM. They could have visitors.

237
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.650
They could go to Walmart two or three days a week. Mm.

238
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.490
And then you can call your,

239
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.010
your connection and they can leave it to you at Walmart.

240
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.050
They can throw it over the gate and it's on 110 acres and they can send you a

241
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:16.280
picture of where it's at. Right. And you can just go dig it up or find it and,

242
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.080
and use. And I wanted a place where there, I, I wasn't going there for that.

243
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.960
I knew I was going to get sober, but I didn't want to be around other people.

244
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.640
So they take your phone away doing that. Yeah. You don't have your phone,

245
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.650
get paper, underwear.

246
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.280
<v 0>Paper underwear, you get how comfortable or paper underwear it's terrible.</v>

247
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.830
<v 1>But you get it back. Uh, the next day or that night, however side,</v>

248
00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:35.510
the hot box I have.

249
00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.343
<v 0>To gets hot box to get your.</v>

250
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.350
<v 1>So's one day of. So that's how I get my towels back.</v>

251
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.630
I brought nice towels and I got, they gave me my towels back. Well,

252
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.070
this guy's doing room checks.

253
00:13:43.071 --> 00:13:46.790
Room checks are every day mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; at least once a day. Um,

254
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.110
and uh, anyways, they found my green towels.

255
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:52.270
It's my first like 24 hours being there at our usual.

256
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:54.510
You didn't know that you didn't know, you couldn't have green towels.

257
00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.460
They giving them back to me.

258
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.700
So all of a sudden I was using that and he gave me an infraction for, uh,

259
00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:02.100
and if you get three infractions, you lose your phone. Call that week.

260
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.720
You don't get,

261
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.380
you don't even get one phone call until you've been in there three full weeks.

262
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:08.300
Because normally when guys go to rehab and then they start calling their

263
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.460
families, they start feeling like I gotta get outta here. I gotta get home.

264
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.060
You start telling yourself this. Like I,

265
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.450
my family's more important to take care of than me right now.

266
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:17.284
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when,

267
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.890
in really you're in crisis mode and you gotta take care of yourself before you

268
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:22.690
can take care of anyone else. And so, um,

269
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:27.050
I gotten two infractions for the two green towels I had. And uh,

270
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.570
I was about to lose my phone call at the three week mark. And uh, if,

271
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:33.330
cuz you get three, if you get three infractions in those first three weeks,

272
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:34.164
you lose your phone call.

273
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.560
And I got two for things I didn't even know couldn't have.

274
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.600
What was the other one? Um, no that was the green towel. He,

275
00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:41.320
he took one green towel. He started walking off with,

276
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.560
he looked back and he saw in my,

277
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.440
my like cubby that there was another green towel there. So you got two.

278
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.560
<v 0>Infractions for the same.</v>

279
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.440
<v 1>Thing. Right? And so, um, what a Dick &lt;laugh&gt; so, but,</v>

280
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.760
but I would say that the counselors that were there and the recovery ad

281
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:54.550
advocates,

282
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.280
they're really hard on you because some of the guys that have left there,

283
00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.680
if they let them leave their overconfident,

284
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.560
that they've got their problem nicked, um,

285
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.080
then they can go right back out and relapse and that. So how do.

286
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.400
<v 0>They keep you from doing it again.</v>

287
00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.190
<v 1>For me? Well, they can't, you have to keep yourself from doing it.</v>

288
00:15:12.191 --> 00:15:15.950
No one can keep me sober. No, no, no therapist. Right? No sponsor.

289
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.550
It's gotta be me.

290
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.260
<v 0>But what,</v>

291
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:23.070
what do they do to give you the tools to let you do it yourself?

292
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.070
<v 1>I think you really start to unwind the,</v>

293
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:30.830
the tangled web of why, um, you use.

294
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.580
And for me it's always been like self worth. It's been, uh, like

295
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.740
that bullying moment when I was a kid,

296
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.060
my my record can go right back to the three things the kids told me.

297
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.540
So I dressed up for a costume party. I went, um,

298
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.420
to my middle school crushes birthday party.

299
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:53.090
I crushed there because I was dressed like a Dr. Pepper transformer,

300
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.730
24 pack of my head, 12 packs on my arms. I went all out.

301
00:15:57.090 --> 00:16:00.810
Everyone was excited cuz she loved transformers, optimist prime. I went as Dr.

302
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.690
Optimist pepper. Anyways, I get there, go to the backyard.

303
00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:04.890
And when the door opens,

304
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:08.410
I get hit with a couple flashes of light and it's them taking pictures.

305
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.970
I hear the sound of laughter. I see that no one else is dressed up.

306
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.000
And my middle school crush said,

307
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.520
I can't believe we thought you were good enough to come to my party right next

308
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:18.840
to her, a boy said you're worthless.

309
00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.720
And then my notorious bully from my third, eighth grade said,

310
00:16:22.721 --> 00:16:23.680
you should just kill yourself.

311
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.760
And so that leads to basically whenever I would relapse,

312
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.120
I would say to myself, you're not good enough. You're worthless.

313
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.390
Maybe you should just kill yourself. You know, I was suicidal at 13.

314
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.030
I didn't kill myself because my mom, I thought, what would this do to her?

315
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.430
<v 0>Do you still go back to that one day?</v>

316
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.750
Like that one day when you were a child hurt you so badly,

317
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.790
that's that's still in your mind almost as like a benchmark for who you are

318
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:52.270
it.

319
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.260
<v 1>I did. And that, that's why I've, I think I've really come to a place of like,</v>

320
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.780
self-love seeing myself that like I'm when I'm needed, uh,

321
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:01.380
well the last six months. But.

322
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.500
<v 0>Did this is after your UFC career, after your Bellator career? Yeah.</v>

323
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.780
All the amazing things you've done with fight for the forgotten all the time

324
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:09.140
would.

325
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.500
<v 1>Been the Congo. I would know it, but when I would relapse,</v>

326
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.930
I would feel like such a piece garbage.

327
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.410
I would feel like I was a disappointment to myself,

328
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:20.290
but also to everybody else.

329
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.130
