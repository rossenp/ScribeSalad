00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Speaking of fighting,</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.300
speaking of old dudes fighting Mike Tyson and Roy Jones Jr. This weekend,

3
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.134
what do you think of that?

4
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.450
<v 1>Ooh, interesting. Crazy, right? Yeah, I think it's,</v>

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.860
I think not too crazy to me, you know? Cause I know it,

6
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.810
that fighters and you know, they,

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.080
a fighter is as long as a fighter knows that people want to watch

8
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.320
they'll get in the ring if the money is right. Yeah.

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.820
<v 0>Well, while I fought as recently as two years ago. Yeah, yeah.</v>

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.920
<v 1>Yeah. But that's still, it's still ring rust. Yeah. Not as much as Tyson.</v>

11
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.160
Right. It's still ring rust. And so

12
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.950
it's going to be interesting man, because both guys are like,

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.400
not just champions, but they are hall of fame champions.

14
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.500
Most people that I've heard talk, say Roy is going to get ran through.

15
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.220
I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen.

16
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:05.600
I think it's going to boil down to which one of them are more prepared.

17
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.660
Yeah. That's what I think is gonna happen.

18
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.830
It's gonna come down to who's more prepared.

19
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.570
<v 0>Well, they are, they definitely have different sizes. You know, Roy's a,</v>

20
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.460
he's a legend. They're both legends. But Roy champion at 168 pounds champion,

21
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:26.240
one 75 beat Ruiz at, he was about 200 when he won the heavyweight title.

22
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.970
But he was never really like a business, got a natural hit. Right.

23
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.610
Tyson's a tank, right. Physically is a different person. And I don't like that.

24
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:37.880
They're switching it to two minute rounds. That, that drives me crazy.

25
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.340
But how many rounds is it? Eight, eight,

26
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:45.200
two minute rounds with what? That just means going to action. Yeah,

27
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.450
it does. But what a guy like Roy, and one of the things that Roy said is that,

28
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.640
uh, he wants to drag Tyson out. Like he's like, if Tyson's going to beat me,

29
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.000
he's going to beat me quick. He's like, I want this fight to go. He goes,

30
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.010
I want to get him tired. And he goes,

31
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:02.840
and I have much more of a chance to get him tired.

32
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:05.480
If he's fighting three minute rounds, he's like, we're grown man.

33
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.010
And I guess the WBC was pointing to a Julio, Cesar Chavez,

34
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.290
uh, I think had a, uh, a boxing exhibition recently. I think it was Chavez.

35
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.633
It was some,

36
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.190
some legend that was retired that had a boxing exhibition recently.

37
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:25.430
And it was real tired. And their thought was, you know what?

38
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.860
Instead of letting them get this tired,

39
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:31.130
let's make them just fight shorter rounds. But Roy is like, well,

40
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:35.300
this is what women fight. The women fight two minute rounds. So it got shakeout,

41
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:39.800
sexual sexist, you know? But he didn't,

42
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.190
I don't think Tyson wanted 200 rounds either. Yeah.

43
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:45.230
It would have been nice if they gave him rules.

44
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.290
Have you seen the rules for the fight? Well, there's no judges and there's no,

45
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.190
no decision celebrity judges. What kind of celeb? Haven't announced that yet.

46
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.620
Oh Jesus. And there's no winner going to be announced. Well,

47
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:55.580
there's going to be a winner.

48
00:02:55.581 --> 00:03:00.370
If Mike Tyson connects on Raj face or if Roy connects on my Tyson's face,

49
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.990
any cut, any cuts bad. If it's bad cut. It says,

50
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.070
but the outta here with that, it should be a boxing match.

51
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.950
These are legends to get a belt when it's over. Oh no, no.

52
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:13.240
You can't have participation.

53
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.190
<v 2>Trophies. But what happens.</v>

54
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.490
<v 0>If somebody gets knocked out like a winner would have ties. Listen, if,</v>

55
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.580
if Tyson knocks him out, he wins. If Roy knocks Tyson out, he wins. This is,

56
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.920
this is nonsense. These guys, listen,

57
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.460
I think to get it sanctioned in California, they had agreed to some stupid.

58
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.390
I guarantee you when that dang, when that bell goes off,

59
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.190
that is going to be a fight. Mike Tyson is not fighting any exhibitions.

60
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.990
He's going to come bobbing and weaving, swinging death with each ham.

61
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.160
And Roy Jones Jr. Is going to be moving and throwing that nasty left hook.

62
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.640
And we'll let the best man win. But that is going to be a fight.

63
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.720
I cannot imagine those two legends are just going to move around.

64
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.480
Like if you watch Roy Jones Jr. Hit the path,

65
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:02.500
have you seen him hit the pads lately? He looks fantastic. He's fast as.

66
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.520
His hands look amazing. Mike looks amazing. I mean,

67
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.400
both of them look like they're taking this very seriously.

68
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:14.050
I can't imagine a world where someone doesn't connect and some crazy

69
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.123
doesn't happen.

70
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.610
<v 1>Yeah. Um, man, this is one of those things, man.</v>

71
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:24.390
I got to see it. That's what I'm saying. I got to see this man.

72
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.420
You're going to go, right? Yeah. Yeah. I was going to go.

73
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.230
I was going to go to then, you know, they said it won't be any, uh,

74
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.570
yeah. And then I was going to go down there for the way in and everything.

75
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.463
<v 0>Well, here's something crazy.</v>

76
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.310
The distance that we are apart from each other on this table,

77
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.350
I was going to make it closer because this new studio is a little more compact.

78
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.660
But I had Mike in, at the last podcast. Mike's been on twice. He was on once,

79
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.600
about 11 months ago. And when he was on 11 months ago,

80
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.670
he said he couldn't even work out. He goes,

81
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.990
if I work out my ego get ignited and then I'll just want to destroy again.

82
00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:02.910
I want to be the Mike Tyson of all this.

83
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:06.270
I don't want to have nothing to do with that. That's my past. I'm done. Wow.

84
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.160
Then he started,

85
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:11.580
I think his wife called him fat and he started working out and he goes,

86
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.340
and I started out with like 15 minutes on the treadmill. Next thing you know,

87
00:05:14.341 --> 00:05:19.260
I'm doing two hours, two hours on the treadmill. He gets in tremendous shape.

88
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.070
And then someone says, you know, would you, would you box, Oh,

89
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:26.760
I know I'm not boxing anybody. And then they go, what about for $30 million over

90
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.770
what? 30 million. And so he decided is this today.

91
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.050
<v 2>For sure. Wow. So you lost almost a hundred pounds. That's incredible.</v>

92
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.550
<v 0>Yeah. He was probably pushing 300 pounds at one point. Not when I saw him,</v>

93
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.610
not 11 months ago. I probably overall, no he was,

94
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.130
but 11 months ago he was probably about maybe two 50 or something like that.

95
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.110
So he definitely lost about 30 pounds.

96
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.060
But so the distance between us is because he was

97
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.650
so amped up. It was like a different human being.

98
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.980
The first time we were smoking weed, he's relaxed. You know,

99
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.910
he's got Tyson ranch. Now he's selling his own weed by the way, strong as.

100
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.280
His weed is like his punches there. No joke. So first,

101
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.760
first podcast we did, we got barbecued. We had a great time. I'm like, Holy,

102
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.860
I'm getting high with Mike Tyson. Second podcast. We did, he was so intense.

103
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.350
And we were talking about like great conquers and.

104
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.570
He was talking about all these different things. And I'm like,

105
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.040
I'm nervous in the room with him. Like he's so amped up.

106
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.720
Like his forearms, you could see his whole body changed. Like he's, he's like,

107
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:40.220
he's got golf balls under this, this forearm muscle. He had just been training.

108
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.270
And you could tell he's, he's like Mike Tyson of all his mindset,

109
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.490
whether or not he's physically capable of it.

110
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.610
His mindset is like the Mike Tyson of old,

111
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.770
it was legitimately nervous to be in the room with him. Cause I was just like,

112
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.360
wow, like he's, he's ready. He's ready to go right now. And I'm like,

113
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.370
you know what? I'm going to make my table a little wider.

114
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.570
<v 3>Because if I was even close.</v>

115
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.140
<v 0>To him than this, cause this is the exact distance of the old table.</v>

116
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.040
But the new table is like, I'm going to make it about like a foot closer.

117
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.780
But if I was a foot closer to Mike like this, I probably be nervous.

118
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.680
I'd be more.

119
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.140
<v 3>Nervous, actually knows.</v>

120
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.630
<v 0>It was Mike Tyson. He was so intense.</v>

121
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.370
I'm like in order for me to do my best job of communicating with people,

122
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.720
if in case I'm across from some, you know, like amped up killer,

123
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.450
like Mike Tyson, you know, you just naturally, I mean,

124
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.020
it's not like a thing where he's going to hurt me, but you, you get nervous.

125
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.280
I mean he, he and Jamie said it best after he left.

126
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.290
You were like that a totally different.

127
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.520
<v 3>You were nervous too. Wasn't that close? I know Matt he's amped up.</v>

128
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.250
