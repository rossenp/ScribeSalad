1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And we're back. What's up. How are you?</v>

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.570
<v 1>Nice to be.</v>

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.400
<v 0>Back here. When you first came here,</v>

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.400
you were thinking about running for president. Now you're out there.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.660
We're all in it's happening. Are you nervous? No. Is it weird? No. No,

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.900
not at all. Do you feel like this is like destiny? No.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.180
<v 1>Um, I feel weird. I'm on a mission. I'm on a mission. Uh, you know,</v>

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.100
there there's a lot of issues. I think we're going to talk about,

9
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.920
about why I'm running for president. Um,

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.160
but being out and connecting with people all across this country,

11
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:35.250
bringing this message, um, really of,

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.830
of ending these wasteful destructive, uh,

13
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.630
foreign policies that have been so costly on the American people for

14
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:44.520
so long, costly on our troops,

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.060
costly on our veterans ending these wasteful regime, change wars,

16
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.390
ending this new cold war and nuclear arms race,

17
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.160
and taking the trillions of dollars that we've been spending on these

18
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.650
programs. And, and that we will continue to spend.

19
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:03.390
If the status quo is allowed to continue and investing those dollars back into

20
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.990
serving the people in our communities, serving the people of this country,

21
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.520
things like healthcare, education infrastructure, protecting our environment,

22
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:13.980
clean water. There's so much that we need to do.

23
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.530
We've got limited resources to accomplish that.

24
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.230
<v 0>These are my favorite things that you talk about. Um,</v>

25
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.780
my question is always though,

26
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.040
why do we spend so much time and money and at,

27
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:30.870
at such a Titanic human cost for these regime change

28
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:35.850
wars, what do you think is the cause like, other than the obvious,

29
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.130
if we, you have a dictator that's in place,

30
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.720
there's an obvious outcry like Saddam Hussein post nine 11. Other than that,

31
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.010
what is,

32
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.750
what is the reason why we invest so much time and energy into regime

33
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.890
change wars so much so that we've just accepted that this is a part of our gross

34
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.151
economy.

35
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.930
Like if we're going to take all the money that the United States earns and all

36
00:01:57.931 --> 00:01:58.980
the money that goes to taxes,

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.810
we just automatically put a gigantic chunk of that

38
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.340
into investing in these wars in other countries, widely.

39
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.560
<v 1>Wildly, almost without any kind of, um, traditional real accountability, uh,</v>

40
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.360
six to $8 trillion is what's estimated that's been spent since nine 11

41
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.920
alone on these regime change wars without even taking into account,

42
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.910
uh, what the costs will continue to be, to take care of our veterans,

43
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.070
those who have gone and fought in these wars and have come home dealing with,

44
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.840
you know, visible and invisible wounds that,

45
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.390
that they'll have to live with for the rest of their lives.

46
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.890
Let's start back. You mentioned Saddam Hussein. Uh,

47
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.840
I don't think it was necessarily an obvious outcry, Saddam Hussein, uh,

48
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.580
and the toppling of his regime was done for oil, right?

49
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.470
It was done for financial reasons and the architects of that Iraq war, uh,

50
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.570
sold it in the guise of, Hey,

51
00:02:57.571 --> 00:03:01.750
Saddam Hussein is working with those terrorists who attacked us on nine 11,

52
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.840
and he's going to give them his weapons of mass destruction.

53
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.150
Both of which turned out to be false,

54
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.420
false intelligence in lies that were sold to the American people,

55
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:14.890
sold to soldiers. People like me, uh, who, who believed what they said.

56
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.020
You know, I enlisted after nine 11,

57
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.010
like so many people in this country to go after the terrorists who had attacked

58
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:23.320
us on that day, killing thousands of Americans.

59
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.190
And they sold this lie, uh,

60
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.470
for financial gain for oil. You,

61
00:03:31.471 --> 00:03:34.840
you look at some of the architects of that Iraq war guys, like John Bolton,

62
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.760
who today is president Trump's national security council director.

63
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.190
And you look at what's happening in Venezuela,

64
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.630
almost the very same playbook being used, or they're selling this,

65
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.000
this regime change effort, uh,

66
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.620
threatening to use us military force to go in and topple a regime under the

67
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:55.390
guise of humanitarianism.

68
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.470
When in fact in Bolton has said this on national television that well,

69
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:03.100
we really want to make sure that American oil companies are able to go in and

70
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:06.520
access that oil rich country in Venezuela.

71
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.720
<v 0>So do you think that's why there's so much turmoil in that country right now,</v>

72
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.770
th th this is this battle over regime change because of the fact they want to

73
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.604
control the oil.

74
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.470
<v 1>I think the us coming in and trying to insert itself into</v>

75
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.830
what is happening in Venezuela is what is, what is the problem?

76
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.940
So they're doing that through a very, very heavy sanctions. Uh,

77
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.150
they're doing that through various means and threatening to use our military to

78
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:35.470
go in and topple the regime there rather than taking the approach that I would

79
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:36.310
take as president,

80
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:41.050
which is to recognize that the people of Venezuela like people in other

81
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.880
countries in the world need to be the ones to determine their governance and

82
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.361
their future.

83
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.560
Just like we wouldn't want any other country to come in and threaten to use

84
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.570
their military, to topple our government,

85
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:55.990
or to tell us who should or shouldn't be the leaders in our country.

86
00:04:55.991 --> 00:05:00.220
We shouldn't be doing that in their country. There are, uh,

87
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.780
serious issues that are causing a lot of suffering for the Venezuelan people.

88
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.060
If we really want to be helpful,

89
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.470
we should be a force to help move towards

90
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:15.790
reconciliation and peace rather than what this administration is doing,

91
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:16.900
which is, uh,

92
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.010
throwing fuel on the flames of a civil war.

93
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.170
That will be devastating, devastating.

94
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.090
<v 0>When you say, move towards reconciliation now.</v>

95
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.580
<v 1>Well, you see there's differences, right?</v>

96
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:30.910
There's the people who are with the current government in Venezuela,

97
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:32.440
and there is the opposition.

98
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.370
Clearly they have differences on what kind of future,

99
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:39.400
what kind of governance and who should lead that government, uh,

100
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.570
going forward rather than threatening to use the United States,

101
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.110
the United States coming in and trying to act once again, as the world's police,

102
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.640
uh, which by the way, throughout history has not had good results,

103
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.680
not for the people in those countries, what to speak of the cost that, uh, we,

104
00:05:56.681 --> 00:06:00.710
the people pay rather than saying, Hey, let's,

105
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.120
let's work towards peace,

106
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.590
try to push forward diplomacy and find what are the conditions that would make

107
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:10.040
some form of reconciliation, uh, going forward.

108
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.580
<v 0>Is there an argument? And I really don't know the answer to this,</v>

109
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:17.120
but is there an argument that these regime change wars, although terrible,

110
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:20.270
we would be way worse off if those weren't in place.

111
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.700
<v 1>I think that's an argument that proponents for regime change wars try to make,</v>

112
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.470
but history shows and proves that the very opposite is true.

113
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.940
Uh, look at Iraq, you can look at Libya. You can look at Syria,

114
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.440
you can look at Guatemala and Ecuador. You can look at other countries, uh,

115
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.510
Iran we're in the past.

116
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.190
We have either overtly or covertly through the CIA gone in and toppled,

117
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.640
uh, leaders of countries or dictators or regimes.

118
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.410
And the result has been more suffering for the people in those

119
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:58.190
countries. Their lives have been made worse off, not only in the short term,

120
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.130
but in the longterm and the cost. Once again,

121
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.650
to the American people has also taken a toll.

122
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.580
As we see more and more of our hard-earned taxpayer dollars going to pay for

123
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:08.990
these wars. Uh,

124
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.550
these regime change efforts that are counter to our national security interests,

125
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:13.911
counters.

126
00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:16.520
The interest of the American people encountered the interests of the people in

127
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:17.354
those countries.

128
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.580
<v 0>So is this one of those things is just a counterintuitive thing where you</v>

129
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:26.510
would think that getting rid of someone like Khadafi would be a good idea.

130
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.430
He's a terrible evil person, but they get rid of them.

131
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.770
And now Libya is a failed state.

132
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:34.580
<v 1>It's, it's horrible. What is happening in Livia as a result of that.</v>

133
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.930
<v 0>Mean you can watch slave auctions on YouTube. It's insane. Exactly.</v>

134
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.940
It's hard to imagine that an era of YouTube and slave auctions exists in a place

135
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.350
that, you know,

136
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:49.670
at least some part of the blame has to be on us,

137
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.400
supporting the rebels that went in and took out Qaddafi.

138
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.130
Like it's not good to have. See, it's one of those counter-intuitive things,

139
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.370
right. Where it's not good to have an evil person in control of a country. Yeah.

140
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.130
But it's also not good to kill them. They get rid of them.

141
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.110
And then this power vacuum, right?

142
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.190
<v 1>It's that, um, it's,</v>

143
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.890
it's hard to accept sometimes the reality that there are bad people in the

144
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:10.724
world.

145
00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:15.230
There are leaders of countries who are doing bad things against their people.

146
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.940
What the real question is,

147
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.910
is we recognize this as the world that exists in reality,

148
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.970
not the world that we wish, uh, existed.

149
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.950
And then the question is for the leaders of our country, is

150
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.130
what role should the United States play?

151
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.130
Does it make sense to try to act as the world's police,

152
00:08:34.131 --> 00:08:36.050
as we have been for far too long,

153
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.650
both as we look at what is in the best interest of the American people,

154
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:44.150
what's in the best interest of our national security, as well as, uh,

155
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.110
what impact will our actions have on the people in these countries and with

156
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.470
Libya, not only do we see strengthened terrorist groups,

157
00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:54.440
there are terrorist groups all over Libya now failed state.

158
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.770
The Libyan people are suffering, uh, now far more than they were before,

159
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.030
but we see the ramifications of that in countries like North Korea,

160
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.550
where again,

161
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.110
John Bolton and the Trump administration is talking about using the

162
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.660
Libya model with North Korea.

163
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.620
As we work towards this objective of denuclearize, the Korean peninsula,

164
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.210
uh, one of the leaders in the north Korean government just said the other day,

165
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.460
the United States government is talking about using the Libya model with North

166
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.800
Korea to get them to get rid of their nuclear weapons.

167
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.900
They don't want to end up like Libya or Iraq, where in Libya,

168
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.200
as you remember, the United States went in and told Gadhafi, Hey,

169
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:41.040
get rid of your nuclear weapons program. And we're not going to come after you.

170
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.120
And he did. He got rid of it. And what happened a very short time later,

171
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:48.150
the United States and other countries went in and took him out.

172
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:50.700
So that action and that decision,

173
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:55.500
that policy is directly undermining our national security and our efforts

174
00:09:55.501 --> 00:10:00.270
to make us and the world more safe to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.

175
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.830
<v 0>Would the argument for regime change wars being that,</v>

176
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.030
would it be that if we didn't go over there and if we didn't have a military

177
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:12.690
presence and we didn't make them fight against us, that they would somehow,

178
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:14.850
or another gain more power and they would,

179
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.390
we would deal with this evil superpower. Is this,

180
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.460
there's this like the worst case scenario for the pro interventionalist foreign

181
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:24.130
policy, right?

182
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.950
<v 1>I wouldn't even, I wouldn't even go that far. I mean, the,</v>

183
00:10:26.951 --> 00:10:30.720
the argument that's made by people who are advocating for these regime change

184
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:35.610
wars is we've got to do something to help people who are

185
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:39.570
suffering. That's generally the argument that's made. Uh,

186
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.770
and they sell this to the American people, knowing that, Hey, we, uh,

187
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.250
we ha we have good hearts and we want to help people if we can.

188
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.050
But what they fail to do is to tell the truth and be

189
00:10:52.051 --> 00:10:57.000
honest about what they are hiding behind this guise of humanitarianism,

190
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.600
right? I mean, if you look at Saudi Arabia, for example,

191
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.370
and you look at the kinds of atrocities that that theocratic dictatorship, uh,

192
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:09.510
is conducting against its own people, decapitating, LGBTQ people,

193
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:13.200
persecuting religious minorities, uh,

194
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.200
being the biggest propagator of this,

195
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:20.940
this most extreme intolerant ideology of Islam that is fueling terrorist

196
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:25.500
organizations like ISIS. And Al-Qaeda waging a genocidal war in Yemen,

197
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:29.010
killing tens of thousands of people. Uh, you know,

198
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:34.200
that murder of the journalist in Turkey, the list goes on and on and on yet.

199
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:36.690
What are we hearing from leaders in our government,

200
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:38.220
both Democrats and Republicans,

201
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.790
Saudi Arabia is a great ally of the United States,

202
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.520
but then you look at what's happening in Venezuela,

203
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.810
ready to launch our military to go in and take out another dictator,

204
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.390
ready to go in and launch our military,

205
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:56.110
ready to go and wage war against Iran. So this is,

206
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.700
this is evidence of the hypocrisy that exists between those who are waging

207
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:02.950
regime, change war in some countries, by the way,

208
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:06.970
usually countries that don't have nuclear weapons and usually countries where

209
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:11.230
they have some other underlying interests in ulterior motive,

210
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.300
which is not helping the people of those countries.

211
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.140
And then when it's convenient for them countries like Saudi Arabia,

212
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:21.310
sidling up to a country whose leadership directly and indirectly supports.

213
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.240
Al-Qaida the very terrorists who attacked us on nine 11,

214
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:26.590
who we are trying to defeat.
