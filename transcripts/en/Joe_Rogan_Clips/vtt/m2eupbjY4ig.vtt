00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.240
There's a guy who I hope someday we'll get to be on your show named Alec

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:09.240
Karakatsanis. Who's the author of a book called usual cruelty,

4
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.800
which is like my Bible now.

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.030
And it is its usual cruelty by how like LEC,

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.960
uh Karakatsanis he's got an organization called civil rights Corps and he's been

7
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.700
suing cities and counties all over the country to eliminate cash bail because

8
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.460
cash bail is at the root of a lot of these problems.

9
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.240
So mommy bale has existed since,

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.200
you know, it was a ballad since bail was invented,

11
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:40.850
whatever the hell it was a long time ago, but bill historically. Yeah,

12
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.740
it was an unsecured. Uh, um, it was an unsecured bond,

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.050
right. Which meant that they,

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.140
they figured out they wanted to charge people if they didn't show up for trial.

15
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:52.070
Right. So, but that,

16
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:54.500
what that meant is if you were arrested and you were supposed to show up in

17
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:57.830
court, if you didn't show up, they would send you a bill. Right?

18
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:00.290
And then in 1899, it changed.

19
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.230
And people realize it actually started in San Francisco strangely enough,

20
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:07.730
which is now actually leading the charge in the other direction. But in 1899,

21
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.070
they decided to start charging people upfront.

22
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.410
So you had to post bail money to be free until your

23
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:17.810
trial. Now,

24
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.250
this obviously affected one group of people, poor people, right? Because,

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.160
and you know, we always see mugshots of celebrities, right?

26
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:27.350
When they're arrested and they're smiling, right? Because they,

27
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.200
their lawyer's waiting outside to take them to a lobster dinner or whatever the

28
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:34.580
hell they're going to go do. Um, and what,

29
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.100
what happened is that soon enough,

30
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.180
and Alec taught me a lot of this stuff. Soon enough,

31
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.680
it became clear that this could be an incredible profit center, right?

32
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.770
That charging people for their own freedom. It's a billion.

33
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.780
You can't afford not to pay, but if you can't afford to pay it, you go to jail.

34
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.720
So then emerged this bail bonds industry, right.

35
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.520
Which is now a multi-billion dollar industry and how that works is if you're

36
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.400
poor and you can't afford to post bail for yourself,

37
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.780
someone will come along and say, if you give me 10% of the money,

38
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.030
non-refundable whether you're innocent, guilty,

39
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:13.490
whether your charges are dropped in an hour, it doesn't matter.

40
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.480
You give me that money. I keep it. I post the rest,

41
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.120
which usually they don't even do. It's just an understanding that. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.000
And you can go home. Now, if you don't do that, think about the consequences,

43
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:30.230
right? So you're picked up for anything. Shoplifting could be mistaken.

44
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.140
Identity could be any crime at all, or any minor thing.

45
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:36.020
Misdemeanors would make up a huge percentage of the jail population.

46
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.810
Most commonly it's just driving on a suspended license.

47
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:42.710
That's the most common cause of arrest. I think in most places in America,

48
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.570
driving on a suspended license, and they're going to put you in a jail cell,

49
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.620
they're going to deprive you of contact with your family of your ability,

50
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:56.600
to work of your ability, to take a walk of your ability to avoid, uh,

51
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.160
violence that may occur to you when you're in that cell, um,

52
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.060
of all different types. And you're very like,

53
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.680
your very life will be at risk. And so if you don't,

54
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.040
if you don't have the money to, to avoid that,

55
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.590
you're now going to be subjected to being in jail.

56
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:19.540
We have about 450,000 people in jail in America right

57
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:23.260
now, as we're sitting here, we don't know if there did anything or not.

58
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:26.710
They haven't been tried. 80% of people in jail have never had a trial yet.

59
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.820
And they could sit there for a week, a month, a year,

60
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.640
several years awaiting trial.

61
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.920
And that's why most of them will plead guilty within about 3.2 days is the

62
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:40.810
average time. But someone will plead guilty if they're in jail.

63
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.870
Whereas if they're out and think about this too, right? If you're out,

64
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:46.300
you don't plead guilty. You wait and you have your day in court.

65
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.850
And it also deprives you of the ability to defend yourself, right?

66
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:56.410
So let's say you're accused of attacking somebody, right. And beating somebody,

67
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:58.780
whatever it, whatever it might be. Right.

68
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.090
And you're in jail because you can't post bail. You can't meet with your lawyer.

69
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.010
They don't have time to come visit you in jail.

70
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.110
You can't get them on the phone readily.

71
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.460
You can't take your lawyer to the scene of the crime to show that it couldn't,

72
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:14.380
you couldn't have been there because, or whatever,

73
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:17.590
or the witness couldn't have seen you because the lights or whatever it is,

74
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:22.150
you have no ability to Mount an effective defense. If you're in jail,

75
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.190
which is why 96, 90 7% of hopeful. Now I'm just talking felonies.

76
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:30.160
But 96% of felonies, uh, conviction,

77
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.550
this country are a result of guilty pleas because people realize they can't

78
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:33.911
fight it.

79
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:36.970
And they can't afford to sit in jail because they could lose their job.

80
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.600
They could lose their home. They could lose their family if they don't,

81
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.850
if they don't either, either put up the money, which they don't have or, um,

82
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.320
or plead guilty. So this is, this is a problem that is being addressed.

83
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:50.711
Like I said,

84
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:53.710
Alec one has been winning lawsuits all over the country because it's a violation

85
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:57.580
of the sixth and the 14th amendment. You can't call it equal protection.

86
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.210
If two different people are charged with the exact same thing,

87
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.120
but the one with money goes home. And the one without money goes to jail.

88
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.710
<v 1>That is such a beautiful way to put it. And so,</v>

89
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:12.660
so clear because I've been seeing people talk about, uh,

90
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.250
different Progressive's that want to get rid of cash bail and how ridiculous

91
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:21.960
that is and what you're saying makes total sense.

92
00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:24.060
And I've never seen it laid out like that before.

93
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.780
And I didn't know that there were that many people that are in jail for things,

94
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.060
and they can't post bail because they don't have the money.

95
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.920
And so they just have to wait for trial.

96
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.600
And what percentage of them did you say, what percentage of them are, uh, what,

97
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.650
what percentage of people that get arrested? Can't post bail?

98
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.800
<v 0>I don't actually know that percentage, but I think it's,</v>

99
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.680
it's very high because most people don't have, I mean, look,

100
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.550
most Americans don't have more than $400 in free cash.

101
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.130
<v 2>This works. If you ever want to be, if you ever really want to, um,</v>

102
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.590
see the inequities here and see how the system is so up,

103
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.490
go sit, you could do it at nothing, obviously not now, but when,

104
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.720
when the world resumed,

105
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.700
so some sense of normalcy go to any criminal court and watch the arraignments.

106
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.010
All right. And if you watch the arraignments,

107
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:17.750
you will see they parade in all of the arrestees of the last

108
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:22.370
24 hours and they read their charges

109
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.190
and they will then set bail. They will make a decision on bail. You'll,

110
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:28.880
you'll notice two or three things.

111
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.040
One you'll notice that the vast majority of people in any,

112
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.850
um, certainly in any urban, um,

113
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.330
jurisdiction in any big city or people of color.

114
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.430
And I sat recently watching this happen in Tampa, Florida,

115
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.790
cause I was working on the James daily case and they did arraignments before my

116
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:53.930
hearing. And I sat with a bunch of public defenders and I listened to them.

117
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:58.790
Wince. Every time someone of color young person of color was brought in,

118
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.140
um, driving on a suspended license, possession of marijuana,

119
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.010
possession of hydrocodone without a prescription.

120
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.180
And they set their bail a thousand, 10,007,000.

121
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.980
And they would say, well that person's going to re get out or they say,

122
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:17.420
if you don't, we're going to let you out.

123
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:20.690
But if you don't pay a fine of $1,500 within 60 days,

124
00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:23.810
you're back in or he'll be back in, I'll be representing him again.

125
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:27.230
And you watch as Jason put it this churn machine

126
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.230
and you watch how these people of color are

127
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.130
treated very differently from white defendants.

128
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.050
And you, you can just assess based on the fact that the judge will say,

129
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:46.040
do you currently have a job? No. Where are you living? Well, I don't know.

130
00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:50.060
I'm going to stay on someone's couch and you start to quickly be able to do the

131
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:54.230
computation in your mind where they coming up with a thousand dollars or $500,

132
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.830
and then they will re-offend and end up right back where they were.

133
00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:01.970
And what will really be striking to you is that I would,

134
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.050
I would venture to say in the high eighties, in terms of percentage,

135
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.520
these people, what they really need is help with an addiction.

136
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.840
And if we put a third of the money that we spend incarcerating people,

137
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:19.400
keeping them incarcerated on drug and alcohol

138
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.110
rehabilitation, the incarceration rate would plummet.

139
00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.690
And the recidivism rate, you know,

140
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.550
people re-offending would plummet and not only we don't have to

141
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:36.380
hypothesize that's in fact, what happens. It happens in countries that,

142
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:37.663
you know,

143
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.300
decriminalized drugs and it happens in countries where there's not such an

144
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:42.950
emphasis on jailing people.

145
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:44.870
And there's more of an emphasis on getting them help.

146
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.390
<v 0>And to answer your question,</v>

147
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.330
do I just looked it up because this is I'm going to quote from the book usual

148
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:51.400
cruelty again by Alec Karakatsanis,

149
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.440
between 80 and 90% of the people charged with crimes are poor.

150
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:59.700
That they cannot afford a lawyer, 25 years into American incarceration. Boom,

151
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.240
black people were incarcerated at a rate six times out of South Africa during

152
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:07.110
apartheid, the incarceration rate for black people in the nation's capital,

153
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:12.090
where I live is 19 times that of white people. And it's,

154
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.320
it still goes on every day. And the, the net benefit, this is, well,

155
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.000
there is no net benefit to society. In fact,

156
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.710
it's been proven the university of Pennsylvania,

157
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:22.140
the Quattrone center did a study that showed that people,

158
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.700
they studied people who were jailed or freed for the exact same crime under the

159
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:28.080
exact same circumstances, right?

160
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.470
And this one posted bail and that one couldn't and they found that the people

161
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.300
who went to jail, even if it, for as little,

162
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:37.830
as a few days were 40% more likely to be arrested for another

163
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:39.510
felony in suing year.

164
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.280
So because their lives fall apart while they're in jail. And then, you know,

165
00:09:44.281 --> 00:09:45.420
like I said, they lose their job.

166
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:48.330
You can't just not show up for work for a few days and be like I was in jail,

167
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.210
you know? So, you know, and if I could,

168
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.270
I'm just going to read the first paragraph of the book because this really,

169
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.330
I think puts it in stark contrast, tell people what the book is. Again,

170
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:02.010
the book is called usual cruelty by Alec Karakatsanis,

171
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:06.750
which is K a R a K a T S a N I S. It's kind of a tongue twister.

172
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.400
And so the book starts off on January 26th, 2014,

173
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.490
Chanel Mitchell was sitting on her couch with her one-year-old daughter on her

174
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:16.590
lap and her four-year-old son DARS side,

175
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.820
armed government agents entered her home, put her in metal restraints,

176
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.850
took her from her children and brought her to the Montgomery county,

177
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.350
Montgomery city, jail, jail staff. Sorry,

178
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:32.700
I turned the page jail staff told Sharnell that she owed the city money for old

179
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:33.570
traffic tickets.

180
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.830
The city had privatized the collection of her debts to a for-profit probation

181
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:39.990
company, which had sought a warrant for her arrest.

182
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.530
I happened to be sitting in the courtroom on the morning that Chanel was brought

183
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:46.950
to court along with dozens of other people who had been jailed because they owed

184
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:51.330
the city money. The judge demanded that Chanel pay or stay in jail.

185
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.950
If she could not pay, she would be kept in a cage until she quotes,

186
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:59.040
sat out her debts at $50 per day or $75 per day.

187
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:00.660
If she agreed to clean the courthouse,

188
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:04.110
bathrooms and the feces blood and mucus from the jail walls.

189
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.190
An hour later in a windowless cell Chanel told me that a jail guard had given

190
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:09.030
her a pencil.

191
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.570
And she showed me that crumpled court document on the back of which she had

192
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:17.070
calculated how many more weeks of forced labor separated her from her

193
00:11:17.071 --> 00:11:21.150
children that day. She became my first client as a civil rights lawyer.

194
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.840
So, you know, that's, that's really it. You know,

195
00:11:24.841 --> 00:11:28.800
we have this mythology in America that the people in jails are bad people.

196
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.830
A lot of them are there just because they're poor.

197
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.340
There's no other reason that Chanel Mitchell or all these other people are there

198
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.030
except they couldn't pay their traffic tickets. And what do you, you know,

199
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:42.150
we talked about single parents, right? What do you do? You're a single parent.

200
00:11:42.151 --> 00:11:45.000
You have a choice between feeding your kids or paying a traffic ticket or

201
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:47.880
whatever it might be. These are not bad people.

202
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.240
And the idea that we send, uh,

203
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:56.170
like more or less like a team to the home of this woman to pull her away from

204
00:11:56.171 --> 00:12:00.880
her kids, what kind of planet is it? Is there where that's okay.

205
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.690
But it's, it happens in darkness, right? It doesn't,

206
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.030
we don't see that right now.

207
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.440
There's all this awareness being brought to George Floyd and the rest of this

208
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:13.360
stuff, which is really important.

209
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:17.470
And I'm so glad that it's coming to light and people are starting to, you know,

210
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.400
really rise up as one, right? As, as one group, as humans,

211
00:12:21.401 --> 00:12:24.340
not as black people or white people or, or any other kinds of people,

212
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:25.174
but together,

213
00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.950
but this stuff happens under it under the shade of darkness where we don't see

214
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:31.840
it. We don't see what happens in the jails and prisons,

215
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:35.500
but what happens there in Harris county where Alec won this suit recently,

216
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:37.720
and now this did a wonderful piece on this,

217
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:42.490
but about 20 people a year die in the Harris county

218
00:12:42.491 --> 00:12:46.840
jail awaiting trial, right. They're either murdered or something.

219
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:51.160
Sandra bland died in that jail. Right? Yeah. And, um, you know,

220
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:54.430
w we have to just stop. I mean, this is,

221
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.590
this is it, it it's, it's unconscionable to me. We have,

222
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.820
we have 7 million people under the control of the criminal justice system.

223
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:07.450
Right. We have more black people incarcerated right now,

224
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.490
or under control of the system than we ever had enslaved in any time in

225
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:13.360
us history.

226
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.510
<v 3>Jesus Christ. What is that? It's crazy.</v>

227
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.980
<v 0>And the amount of human potential that's lost. It, it boggles my mind.</v>

228
00:13:20.981 --> 00:13:23.590
There's probably another Lennox Lewis that could have been right.

229
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:25.900
There's another Jay Z in there somewhere.

230
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.470
I asked me mil when he was on my podcast, wrongful conviction. I said,

231
00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:32.740
how many guys did you meet in jail? Who could have been another you?

232
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.530
And he said, I can't even tell you. He goes,

233
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.580
there's so many talented people in there that just, you know, circumstance.

234
00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:39.970
Yeah.
