00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 2>There's always been that situation too, where you have these really hungry,</v>

3
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:06.314
talented artists,

4
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.440
and they get taken advantage of by whether it's executives or who,

5
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:11.800
whoever is the, the money,

6
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:15.920
people that figure out how to lock these people into some long term contract,

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.870
where the lion share of all their work and creativity is gonna be, uh,

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.790
enjoyed by the company and not by the artist themselves.

9
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.710
You always have these crazy.

10
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.230
<v 1>That part of the model. I mean, hopefully there's enough pie to go around.</v>

11
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:31.790
Everybody is kind of okay with that. I mean,

12
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.190
there's a certain number you get to where you probably don't care anymore,

13
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.270
how much they're making, cuz you're making so much also, you know, but uh,

14
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.140
but that model, the then that's that that's not a mystery, especially if you're,

15
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.460
but coming up the times I, when I came up,

16
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:47.980
like we already knew all that is if you got,

17
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.780
if you got locked into a bad record contract where somebody screwed you over,

18
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:53.460
like it's kind of on you a little bit. It wasn't like it's not the fifties,

19
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:57.460
the sixties where like we stepped into things and didn't know, uh,

20
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.580
and it has nothing with my background. I never got screwed over though.

21
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.970
The worst people I've ever met in this business from the bands, they were not,

22
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:05.730
they were not the labels because you know who they are,

23
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:08.290
you know what they're doing. They don't really change. You're not gonna be,

24
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:10.730
you won't be fooled. You know, it's the people that you,

25
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.170
you have camaraderie with that you think are in the trenches with you,

26
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.850
that you find out like those are the people let you down more that you get

27
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:19.810
hoodwinked by the business. People you that's no secret what they're doing.

28
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.450
Have you been.

29
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.970
<v 0>You've been hoodwinked by other artists. Every.</v>

30
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.400
<v 1>Everybody has really. Yeah. I just, I'm not,</v>

31
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.320
I'm not making a point about artists are. I'm just saying the, the big,

32
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.040
bad record business. Like not, not for me, not my days.

33
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.440
I've worked with some great people, you know, some really supportive, uh, um,

34
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.200
positive people. Who've been great part of my career, you know? And I,

35
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.480
I actually can't, I can only name like I can name 30 years. Maybe like one,

36
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.630
one or two people I came across who I hope I never see again in that end of the

37
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.190
business. Otherwise, like that's a pretty good ratio.

38
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.590
<v 0>That is a very good ratio.</v>

39
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.990
So essentially there's always gonna be people that take advantage of people that

40
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:57.270
don't really understand or are too eager and accept a bad contract.

41
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.590
<v 1>Yeah. But there's no excuses for not reading that. And we're just too far along.</v>

42
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.340
Like you just, it shouldn't be that easy to fool someone today.

43
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.060
<v 0>I've been offered a lot of bad contracts. Yeah. But I didn't sign them either,</v>

44
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.420
you know? Right. It's that same.

45
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.061
<v 1>Kind of situation.</v>

46
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.260
And I've been in situations where I've looked at a contract and it's,

47
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:13.620
that's the nature of most business, you know,

48
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.420
someone's gonna do better than somebody else. Right.

49
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:16.620
So when you look at that and you realize,

50
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:19.660
it looks like you are no matter what gonna do this, isn't a good situation.

51
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:23.300
Like it's, I don't take that as like a personal attacker. It's like, okay, well,

52
00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:25.010
this is isn't good for me. It's not good. What is,

53
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.530
I'll go find somewhere else to do this. Just.

54
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.450
<v 0>They're just establishing rules for the game for you.</v>

55
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.370
<v 1>But there's no conec. Yeah. Right. But they're in, they're in business. Right.</v>

56
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.890
Right. You know, it's like, again, prince, what was his, uh, what did he say?

57
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.330
They.

58
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.163
<v 0>Owned his name. Right.</v>

59
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.490
<v 1>I think it was something, uh, they I'm gonna get the quote wrong,</v>

60
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.440
but somewhere around the time where he changed his just assembly and,

61
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.600
and they said something about,

62
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.640
somebody said something to about the record business. He said, no,

63
00:02:47.641 --> 00:02:50.560
I'm not in the record business. You're in the record business. I make music,

64
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.800
you know? And that's, that's kind of, it it's that it's true, but they're not,

65
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.480
there's no, there's no similarities to them. There's no reason that you have a,

66
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.400
that you're a great talent that you should also have a great understanding of

67
00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:03.760
the business side of things. You're not really interconnected for most people,

68
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.040
but we are far enough along now where hopefully you have somebody with you and

69
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:10.560
things are more transparent that you shouldn't get locked into these horrible

70
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.040
deals.

71
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.860
<v 0>Anymore.</v>

72
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.400
Do you remember when Courtney love wrote that piece where she was

73
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.750
explaining the music? I think it was in spin Mac magazine,

74
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.110
where she was explaining the music business in terms of like where the money

75
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.750
goes and how they over artists. Do you remember that?

76
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.750
<v 1>I don't remember that, but then don't get in the music business.</v>

77
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.310
&lt;laugh&gt; that's not new. I mean, that's not, is that a revelation? Did you,

78
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.350
did you read that? And we're like, wow. Like, it.

79
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.550
<v 0>Was shocking to me because I'm not in the music business. So to me, I was like,</v>

80
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.860
wow. So that's how they do it. Yeah. I was, I was confused like when it went.

81
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.260
<v 1>Into like how much, you know, if you're a band,</v>

82
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:45.580
people bands don't do this anymore. If your band sells 2 million records,

83
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.660
everybody in that, band's probably making a lot of money buying houses. Right.

84
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.300
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that CD cost $18. Like you're making your money.

85
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:54.980
You're pretty happy. It's only down the road where someone says, okay, you guys,

86
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.740
you did buy house. Did you see how much that they made?

87
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.010
And you are shocked first second to realize you take that seat and you divide it

88
00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:04.650
up between yourselves, your band and what the record. Yeah.

89
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.530
They make a lot more than you. Mm that's why they're in the record business.

90
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.050
That's what's and they're, you know,

91
00:04:09.051 --> 00:04:10.570
some of them are too smart to be in the bands.

92
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.730
<v 0>Or not smart.</v>

93
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.290
<v 1>Enough. Well, it depends on what, what you can handle if you can.</v>

94
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.650
I couldn't handle that kind of last time myself. I don't, I don't want, I I'm,

95
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.760
I, I invent things. That thing, I don't want to be somebody who I have to,

96
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.880
my whole livelihood is reactionary to other people creating something that I can

97
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.840
now work with. Right. That's I want make it from scratch.

98
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.680
<v 0>Yeah. That's a weird situation to be in relying upon other people's creativity.</v>

99
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.640
Yeah. For you to make a.

100
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.800
<v 1>Living. Yeah. And, but, you know,</v>

101
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.040
you can do that when you don't have a com you don't have a,

102
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.630
a creative bone in your body. Some people are really good at numbers in math.

103
00:04:43.631 --> 00:04:46.590
Some people are really creative, you know? And if you recognize early on, well,

104
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.830
I would like to be, I mean,

105
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:51.470
that's a lot of the great people who work outside of bands once wanted to be in

106
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:54.430
a band, but realized like, I don't have it. I love music,

107
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.350
but I wanna be a part of it. Anyway. I wanna help someone else do great things,

108
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.870
you know? Right. But I, I'm not the guy to be in the band or the girl. You,

109
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.073
if you.

110
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.860
<v 0>Have your own music and you own your music, what is,</v>

111
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.620
what does a record label do for you in 2021?

112
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.140
<v 1>Well, what do you mean if you own your own music, if you like.</v>

113
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.500
<v 0>If you create your own music, right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, if you say you hire,</v>

114
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.900
what.

115
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.940
<v 1>Could a record label do for you?</v>

116
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.250
They have money that you don't have to promote and spend you on tour. You know,

117
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:27.090
young bands need, they can't, you know, a van or no van,

118
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.450
it costs money to tour a lot, you know? So.

119
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.290
<v 0>That's something, they basically loan you the money.</v>

120
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.330
<v 1>Yeah. That's what, that's how they can be good for a young band really,</v>

121
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.730
or any band, any, you know, it's like, otherwise you, you don't have the tools,

122
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.610
the assets to get your music in lots of places. I mean,

123
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:45.640
there's more up opportunities with social media, of course. And it's, you know,

124
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.560
look, the good news is anybody can do it now. And the bad news is,

125
00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:51.280
anybody can do it now just means it's crowded. And there's just like,

126
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:54.520
it's hard to know what anybody's up to. You know, but now record labels.

127
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:57.800
They can still have a great, they have a great purpose. Of course, you know,

128
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.640
they're, some people say they're banks, they're just funding your trip.

129
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.400
And you have, you have a big bill at the end and they.

130
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.320
<v 0>Have a connection to streaming services.</v>

131
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.200
<v 1>And yeah, they have all those contacts that, that you, uh,</v>

132
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.160
that you wouldn't have on.

133
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.960
<v 0>Your own. Now, when a person is like, say,</v>

134
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:15.680
you're a new band and you get signed by a record company, uh,

135
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.630
how does someone and find out about you? I mean,

136
00:06:18.631 --> 00:06:21.750
what is the primary way they find out about you? If it's not the radio,

137
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.030
which it always used to be,

138
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.230
do they find out about you through streaming services? Like,

139
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:29.150
are there channels that are sponsored that people get excited about?

140
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:32.510
Because they know that this channels where new interesting music gets broken.

141
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.910
<v 1>We're both gonna do some homework. We're gonna do some homework catalyst.</v>

142
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.780
And if I find out a let you know, I mean, really that's the, well,

143
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:42.060
that's the question. I don't know. I mean, because there's,

144
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.420
it's just jammed up everywhere, you know?

145
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.580
So a lot of great things about the way things work now,

146
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.100
the models that we had before were really effective too.

147
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:52.460
And at least you could put yourself on a path that if you did X, Y, and Z,

148
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:56.260
maybe your band would get a shot, you know, play your clubs, get your demo,

149
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:58.450
tape together, maybe a record, but he wants to work with you.

150
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.130
And they're gonna give you some money to practice. You know,

151
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:02.850
you make that record, you make a video and you go,

152
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:03.890
they give you some money to go on tour.

153
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:07.570
Like this was a path to maybe be in a band that was successful.

154
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.570
So you take that away. You know, it is just every man for the,

155
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:13.730
every man and woman for themselves, just, you know,

156
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:16.650
trying to find a way to quote, unquote kind, get lucky. Mm. You know,

157
00:07:16.651 --> 00:07:19.520
if you're an established act, you go out op, you got opportunities.

158
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.240
If you're doing it the other way, you're just, it's really,

159
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.280
everybody's trying to get lucky. And then by the,

160
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.400
and when someone sees what that person did by the time you figured out it's too

161
00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:30.320
late, it's gotta do something else, everyone. That's what it is. I mean,

162
00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:35.200
as far as I know, you know, but I'm also not brand new. Like I,

163
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:39.350
if I was 21 years old, they probably understand this better than I do. You know?

164
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.870
I, the way I came up was just a different, I mean,

165
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.350
it was just a different model and that's okay. That a lot of that's gone.

166
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:47.950
I mean, it's changed so drastically. I mean,

167
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.270
you remember in the late like nineties, remember,

168
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.310
you know what the diamond award was? No, that's when they had to invent it,

169
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.470
there was, you know, the gold record platinum record. There wasn't enough.

170
00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.540
People were going like 12 times platinum. So they invented the diamond award,

171
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:02.180
which was 10 billion. Whoa. The diamond award. Yeah.

172
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.500
That's how much money was going around in those days before the internet.

173
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:08.260
Really? How many.

174
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.740
<v 0>People buy CDs today? They still sell.</v>

175
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.060
<v 1>I don't know where you buy one online, I guess, I guess, uh, Amazon. Yeah.</v>

176
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.970
There's still, I mean, yeah. I mean, I, I guess you,

177
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:21.210
where are you gonna play it? I mean,

178
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.410
let's lap laptops aren't even have hard drives. I think vinyl sells more than.

179
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.050

182
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.290
it was for a while, like a bonus. If your company wanna spend some money,

183
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.570
make vinyl with you now it's kind of like, you can throw in CDs,

184
00:08:36.571 --> 00:08:38.770
