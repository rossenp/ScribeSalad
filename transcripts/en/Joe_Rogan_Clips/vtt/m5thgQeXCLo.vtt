00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.530
<v 2>What, what happened, um, with, uh, with the dissonant,</v>

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.710
um, is, you know, the,

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.420
the film is kind of beyond told story behind the murder of Jamal

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:17.100
Khashoggi. You know, the,

6
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.890
the Washington post journalist walks into the Saudi consulate

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.420
in Istanbul in October, 2018 and, uh,

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.520
is murdered. Uh,

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.500
I mean just the most horrific gasoline murder. Um,

10
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.900
the, uh, he walks into the consulate. Um, they basically, you know,

11
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:44.760
strangle him, start in, bombing him as he's alive, uh,

12
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.840
and kill them and then disarming him while he was alive. Yes.

13
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
Because they wanted the blood to coagulate because they then dismembered him and

14
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.820
caught him into pieces to get them out of the consulate.

15
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.610
And, uh, you know, and this was ordered by Mohammad bin Salman, the, you know,

16
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:06.030
the, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, it's proven that he ordered it.

17
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.200
<v 0>Well. Yeah, I think we had to go and say, do,</v>

18
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.120
do we believe the CIA, uh, do we believe British intelligence,

19
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:23.040
French intelligence? Uh, do we believe Turkish intelligence, um,

20
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.260
Turkey? Um, there was a listening device in the consulate.

21
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.940
Um, we don't know how the consulate was bugged, but it was bugged.

22
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.710
And so the entire audio of [inaudible] murder

23
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.790
and even the planning of his murder, uh,

24
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.530
was captured by the Turks. And, um,

25
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.690
uh,

26
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.580
I obtained the transcript as part of making this film and there were

27
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:01.140
independent investigations conducted Agnes Calmar to the UN of course,

28
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.450
the Turks CIA,

29
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.840
and all of them concluded with a very,

30
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:10.860
very high level of confidence that MBS, uh,

31
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.570
ordered the murder. Um, and if you understand how Saudi Arabia works,

32
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:16.890
right? I mean,

33
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.060
this is considered an absolute monarchy.

34
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.880
This is an authoritarian regime, right?

35
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.230
And you have probably 90%, you know,

36
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:29.910
and I'm making up this statistic,

37
00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:34.740
but something of the entire wealth of a country controlled by one

38
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.663
family.

39
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.250
So the idea that you could send 15 people

40
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.290
on private jets owned by the kingdom of

41
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:50.280
Saudi Arabia, traveling on diplomatic passports,

42
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.200
people in the kill team, uh, one of the guys was, uh,

43
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.230
[inaudible] who was Muhammad bin Salman's, you know,

44
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.060
personal security had a security. Uh, other guy was, uh,

45
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.040
out Dabashi who is the state forensic examiner and coroner

46
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.580
who came with a bone saw, uh, another guy,

47
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.870
Alice Siri is one of the top ranking generals. Um,

48
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.420
and the list goes on and on.

49
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.410
And so the idea that you could have this carried out

50
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.330
without the approval of the crown prince,

51
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.270
um, would be staggering to believe. I mean, it it's,

52
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.500
it's,

53
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.060
it's next to impossible because who else would order this

54
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:44.950
crime? And especially when you're dealing with it with an absolute monarchy,

55
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.110
um, anybody who did this without that sort of permission, right? I mean,

56
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.950
that's, this is, uh, you know,

57
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:58.600
Saudi Arabia carried out 800 beheadings last year. So, uh,

58
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.770
talk about off with your head. I mean, everywhere I go,

59
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:07.390
they might not recognize me, but then if I say, Hey, what are you doing?

60
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:10.750
I go, oh yeah. Did you see Icarus? I mean,

61
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.680
everywhere I go in the world, they all saw it. Like, I,

62
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.640
I can't even find people that haven't seen it at this point. I mean, it's,

63
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.890
it feels like the whole planet watched it.

64
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.170
And that is the extraordinary power of Netflix that

65
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:31.090
when they put out a film that releases into like 197 countries across

66
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.970
like 50 languages, all at the same time,

67
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.310
the entire world has access to it.

68
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.540
And the entire world should have access to this film,

69
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.450
but they're not going to have access to this film because there are

70
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.430
business interests at stake. There are an investment interests at stake, and,

71
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.820
and that is really disappointing.

72
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.750
And so, um,

73
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.880
I'm shocked that that I believe with

74
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.380
great wealth and with great power comes great

75
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.790
responsibility.

76
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.920
And if these business

77
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.120
Titans that, um,

78
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.190
that have huge companies lose

79
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.710
their moral compass,

80
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.140
lose their direction to basically

81
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.940
say, okay,

82
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.750
this might not be the very best thing for our business or our

83
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:43.420
subscriber growth, but God.

84
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.340
People should see this. Wow,

85
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.640
we got to do something about it. Wow.

86
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.040
There are people losing their lives and sitting in jails and maybe are

87
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.860
distributing.

88
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.690
This film can change that maybe are letting our

89
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:05.780
hundreds of millions of subscribers. See,

90
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:10.220
this can actually bring about positive change for humanity

91
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.410
and they don't do that. That's really, it's,

92
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.730
it's it's soul crushing. I, I got a,

93
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.200
a message and I hope [inaudible] is not going to be mad at me.

94
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.370
Um, she,

95
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.170
his fiance sent me a message

96
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.420
two, two, uh, two days ago.

97
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.430
And, um, she said, hi, dear Brian,

98
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.070
I've read all the reviews of the film. And I'm very encouraged.

99
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:57.260
May seem to like the film and they have a really good idea about it.

100
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.480
The main three points they mentioned is that you're brave that Omar

101
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:07.130
struggles and my position as fighting for human rights.

102
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.880
I'm glad I'm proud of you every day.

103
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.690
You made history, you did an incredible job.

104
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.600
Believe me all as well.

105
00:07:20.601 --> 00:07:22.850
Now I'm getting better every day.

106
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.200
This trauma has created a new [inaudible]

107
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
. I think I understand that every day, I'm not the same person two years as I was two years before I got a lot. And I learned a lot and I made some good friends. The most important one is you and your team, 

108
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
Thor, that's Thor Halverson, the president of the

109
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 human rights foundation who financed the film and Jake's

110
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 want co he is my cinematographer. My life changed in my opinion, also changed. And my daily life also 

111
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
changed

112
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
. The one thing that did not change is my love and my heart. It's still full of love for humanity and 

113
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
Jamal

114
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 soul. I believe that if we change life, it will be with love and with love for our values. And that's extraordinary to me to see that his fiance two years on has such that incredible positive outlook on in war in the world. 

115
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
And

116
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 I'm so honored to receive that message. And at the same time, you know, I know that for the world to actually learn of her story and her fight for Jamal's life and for justice

117
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
, um,  is going to be a struggle, uh,  because of the, uh, um,

118
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 whatever want to call it business interests of

119
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.200
 these major platforms that come ahead of seeking any sort of, uh,

120
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.033
 accountability for human rights abuses.

121
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.050
<v 1>And the potential to make the.</v>

122
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.800
<v 0>World a better place and the potential to make the world a better pace,</v>

123
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.140
but might not align with their goals for subscriber

124
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.960
growth in that region of a world,

125
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:27.090
or it might not coincide with

126
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.070
possible future investments or investments or shareholder value.

127
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.080
And that's, that's unfortunate.

128
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.150
It's unfortunate if the richest man on planet earth are now the second, I guess,

129
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.760
uh, Jeff Bezos, uh,

130
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.410
is more concerned with his bottom line than he is concerned

131
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.330
about seeking justice and accountability for a man who worked

132
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.530
for him,

133
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.930
who was murdered while working for his newspaper and

134
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:01.764
that

135
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.710
he and his company could have stepped forward to see to it that the world truly

136
00:10:07.711 --> 00:10:08.610
had access to this.
