00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Look.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.600
<v 1>Predict let's go around the table. Eddie Bravo. What's up on.</v>

3
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.440
<v 2>Paper. Cabib takes this. Uh, I hope he wins only because,</v>

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.440
uh, it would make a, like a, a monstrous fight between him and Tony. Ooh,

5
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.590
but you can't count Dustin out. You know, he could throw a flying knee,

6
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.910
but you got KIB could catch him. You be, uh,

7
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.030
if I had a gun to the head from him, gun to the head,

8
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.350
I'd go cabib that's the safe,

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.390
but I'm not gonna be surprised if Dustin drops him. I'm gonna.

10
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.310
<v 1>Say pore third round Kao and then fights con McGregor. Whoa.</v>

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.630
<v 0>Hold on. PO fights McGregor.</v>

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.900
<v 1>You this wow. Call. What do you think I'm I'm going, but I.</v>

13
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.540
<v 0>Love Kaib. I'm go. I think Poer drops him in what round dude?</v>

14
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.900
Um, in the fourth round type move. And I think, uh,

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.900
and I think he's gonna fight con mcgreor. Wow. Yeah, no, still here,

16
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.300
but I'm.

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.170
<v 1>Just, that's how I feel. Okay. Well, you said exactly what I said, but how.</v>

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.970
<v 2>Do those reshoots go, Brian? I do do those reshoots shoot.</v>

19
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.050
I'm glad you askedquestion. You can't get what were the lines? No.

20
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.690
<v 1>No, no. those lines. Here we go. We're about to do this. Yeah. Please, please,</v>

21
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:13.970
please.

22
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.490
I don't wanna talk about making the way know note how I've cleverly avoided

23
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:20.170
making a prediction. That's I let's move on. You can't make predictions.

24
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.770
You have to. Here we go. Here we go. Here we.

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.200
<v 2>Oh. Look at that. Look at.</v>

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.320
<v 0>That. Now. Now.</v>

27
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.440
<v 1>Another thing interesting about Dustin is Dustin south paw with a nasty straight</v>

28
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.320
left hand. Yep. And great combos. Although he did fight Connor,

29
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.600
it was also south paw. Yep.

30
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.800
<v 0>Oh, that's a while ago. Dustin's got much longer. Arms.</v>

31
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.910
<v 1>Got better. Kicks. Dustin also has hip issues. He's a, uh,</v>

32
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.870
some pretty significant wear and tear in his hip, man. He's fine.

33
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.230
He's a black belt on the ground, but I don't think cabibeb gives.

34
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.230
<v 2>A flying fus. Dustsin's a black belt. Dustsin dust.</v>

35
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.030
<v 1>Uh- oh, dust caught that leg under Tim crater. I believe.</v>

36
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.430
<v 0>His crater, his training partners were guys like, you know, robbiey Lawler,</v>

37
00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:59.470
et cetera. Before law Robbie went left, uh.

38
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.190
<v 1>ATG. That's a long time ago. Brian, look, notice that right away.</v>

39
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.020
It doesn't matter is staying on the outside. Cabib is avoiding the kicks.

40
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.420
He's staying away from Dustin's striking length.

41
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.020
Cuz Dustin's striking length is a boxing length. Right?

42
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.780
So Dustin's forced to throw kicks, which he doesn't necessarily prefer.

43
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.580
So when he' is throwing those kicks,

44
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.260
cabibbe's caught a couple of 'em already or caught one of them at least. Right.

45
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.420
But he's avoided the kicks, but see the distance. Yep. Look at the distance.

46
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.570
See cabib is staying outside the striking range and looking for that opening for

47
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:32.530
the shot. See, see, Dustin's forced to throw kicks, but he's not a kicker.

48
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.610
It's not his. Especially with a bad hip. And so cabib look at that.

49
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.690
Oh cabbe. There's the shot there's shot. He's not gonna here's the,

50
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:45.320
Dustin's no punk with his taking down to fence man. Right.

51
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.640
But HES neverought anybody like cabib never fought anybody. That's that good?

52
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.720
Yeah. But here he goes. But the other thing is even if KA,

53
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.640
even if cabibbe doesn't take you down the draining, he drains,

54
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.760
he gets tired too, though. He does like there's a lot of energy for, and then,

55
00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:05.880
then becomes a strikes. Does he get tired though? Really? Yeah. Really?

56
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.880
I Quint uh, con McGregor fights. He takes rounds off. He comes striking me.

57
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.880
Yeah. But you know that's coming, you know, that's coming. Get up, stand up,

58
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.280
stand up, stand up, stand up the malling. stand up.

59
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.430
The malling he up. We're good. We're not quite, not quite. He's not up yet.

60
00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.150
Boom. No, Dustin's gonna get taken down every round. Yeah he is. It's its,

61
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.230
if Kenny it' a switch. Nope. On his

62
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.270
don't try switch it's around. Not good. It might be over round. Very bad.

63
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.950
It could be very, very, very, very could first round stop.

64
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.860
Very bad for Dustin. Very at, he might get smashed here.

65
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.860
Oh look how he pulls his face. Like that. Yous actually got fingers in his eyes,

66
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.740
man. I can did like, like a bear. What is that? A hundred dollars.

67
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.380
&lt;laugh&gt; that's about my hundred dollars. You know? What's crazy.

68
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.740
You know what's crazy is that, oh my God. It's over. It's a wrap. It's over.

69
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.980
He's gonna use that. Folkcal trap. He put no it's not over.

70
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.290
No couldn. Dude that was close to being over was very close.

71
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:06.290
That was close to being. Overrus someone. Here's a jujitsu coach. Big shots.

72
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.010
The head is this is this where dust wants to be sideways.

73
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:11.290
Like not where he wants to be, but sideways in this chair. No, no.

74
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.970
He's he's in a good spot right now. The cage right here. Look at' cage.

75
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.891
The face, man. Look at,

76
00:04:15.891 --> 00:04:19.010
he's actually using the cage to defend the rear naked choke. Cuz he's got the,

77
00:04:19.011 --> 00:04:19.844
he doesn't have the angle.

78
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.720
See I how he sideways mm-&lt;affirmative&gt; he's using that cage. Covering his mouth.

79
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.920
It's it's it's sobullshituch this couldn' have been guns. He wear for dust.

80
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.640
This might be it. This might be it. This might be it. Dustin trying.

81
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.080
He's trying to survive, man. He's trying to survive.

82
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.520
It's crazy as that more people haven't adopted this fight side.

83
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:41.390
Oh he's nasty neck crank here. He Dustin survive. It's dust't survive us.

84
00:04:41.391 --> 00:04:44.510
Stand up. Please. Stand up. Standing, standing, standing, turn, turn.

85
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.310
Whoa. Don't count him out. That was so close.

86
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.950
He just asked for the money back you up. I don't remember that.

87
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.470
You're off the train. I don't have any dust.

88
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.620
He's he's out. No turn. Don't don't do that. I don't know why he did that.

89
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.140
I Don'. Cause he take separate. The handss taken down.

90
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.580
Cause he's trying to separate the hands. He should never turn your back on bead.

91
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.660
I think he's just trying to separate the hands. Right? Okay.

92
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.820
He just tried to face the hands. He got a minute left. Let's go. Come on. Just,

93
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:18.700
just be cool. He might just try to wear this out or ride this out rather.

94
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:22.010
He's gonna, he's gonna survive to the second round for sure. Who for dusts?

95
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.450
Third round he a minute. Go man. Look. Anything can happen? No, no. He's good.

96
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.410
It's gonna take, there you go. Look at that trip. Look, be beautiful.

97
00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.450
Trip Rick up. He standing up, you just keep standing up.

98
00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:35.290
You know he's gonna get slammed right now. He is he both.

99
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:38.290
By the way he controls this does he? There's no one better, man. He's the best.

100
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.000
He's a mall or bro. He's the best. He's a smaller man. He can wrestles with.

101
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.280
Oh he tried that last time. He up. It's not gonna work.

102
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.760
His hands were his hands were close.

103
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.520
A switch is not gonna work on your hands a lot. It could be just too good.

104
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.560
It's not gonna work on. And now he's mounted man. Now he's mounted.

105
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.720
This is no Buo only 20 seconds. He's what what's no Buo no, no he's.

106
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.480
<v 3>Good. Connor chilled here in the Mount.</v>

107
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.160
<v 1>Remember? Yeah but listen, this is cause we really don't do work. Now.</v>

108
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:05.160
This is a different fight.

109
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.640
It's entirely possible that cabibbe could get him here. It'd be tough.

110
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.240
Look at this. Look at this. Boom boom, boom. Oh. This ain't good.

111
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.030
This ain't good. How much time? This ain't 10 seconds.

112
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.310
5, 4, 3, 2. That's Jesus survive.

113
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.350
He's survive. Tough down. Yeah, he survives. He's fine. Not a mark Onno.

114
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.590
This is gonna happen in Poia.

115
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.750
<v 3>Funny. Third, fourth round man. Yep. If he can make a third, fourth round thats.</v>

116
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.950
<v 1>That was crazy. That was crazy. I'm out. We gotta get some food after that.</v>

117
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.100
Yeah. Let's get food after this. We'll go get some could be so.

118
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.460
<v 3>Monster. God, but that's you gotta walk through the fire to get to that third,</v>

119
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:46.700
fourth round man. Yes.

120
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:47.840
<v 1>Yes.</v>

121
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.580
<v 3>You gotta hope he gets tired from whooping your.</v>

122
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.740
<v 1>He's done. He's done that third and fourth round.</v>

123
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.380
He was telling barbbo said come on man. No, his different animal.

124
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:58.210
Barbarabo yeah. Who? Boy, Tom mcg give up. But they.

125
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.930
<v 3>But they know Dustin knows this. He's listen. He has, how many fights?</v>

126
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.930
40 fights. He knows this. He' been in the game for so long man.

127
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.370
<v 1>Yeah, he's been down. He's been up. He knows how to lose.</v>

128
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.490
He's not gonna freak out. HES. Fine. He's lost before and bounce back.

129
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.050
He's not he not shin his pants right now. He's a full veteran.

130
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.530
He's a full veteran. He's fine. I mean, he's a,

131
00:07:16.531 --> 00:07:17.810
he's not a guy that's gonna get broken.

132
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:20.320
And at this stage of his life got beaten. Capib in front.

133
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.240
<v 3>Of his dad though. I Don', the odds.</v>

134
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.080
<v 1>Are not good in front of Russia, sir.</v>

135
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.440
In front of Russia and mean he's in,

136
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.760
abuha's got Asias. Abbu I' saying what I'm saying is that Russia's watching.

137
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:34.080
Here we go. Here we go. HES watching. Here we go. Well now you know,

138
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:38.040
Dustin's gonna want to avoid going to the ground at all costs lower stance now

139
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.110
and then avoiding the distance. He's still with those kicks, man.

140
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:47.510
I think he waits for cabib to come in. I would say avoid those kicks and,

141
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.750
and just wait for oh Jesus. Look at that. Oh he got, he got clipped dude.

142
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.750
<v 3>Here's the problem about cabib is the striking's not terrible.</v>

143
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.150
And you're so worried about the take down. Remember when he dropped Connor?

144
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:57.820
Yeah. Oh.

145
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.780
<v 1>Hold on. Well he's dropped. Other guy is too. It's like he's. Oh.</v>

146
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.580
<v 4>He gotow. Oh. This is what dust.</v>

147
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.980
No, you. You' off the train off the train

148
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.043
dude.

149
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.650
<v 1>Yeah, but he can', he can't get crazy. He can't he's wearing him out.</v>

150
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.930
He's wearing out. Right.

151
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.810
But he can't get crazy because he'll he'll run into a take down. Oh the crazy.

152
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:29.890
He might be in trouble. He, he just clipipped them again. Yeah.

153
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.650
Cabib might be in trouble here. That's the dark point. Dustin's tired.

154
00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:38.090
Dustin's tired. No. Yes he is. Yes. HES. Very tired. He's.

155
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.840
<v 3>Tired. He's just chased him for a minute. Dude.</v>

156
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.800
<v 1>Took a, a deep breath look or maybe he trick dude, there's a shot. Here's fake.</v>

157
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.960
Oh, look at this. Gaillot attempt. That's not idea. This is bad. It's also bad.

158
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:54.520
Been with a hundred and 20 degree heat index inside that arena. He got so tired.

159
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.360
Uh, like that something happened. dude.

160
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.640
<v 2>He had him right there.</v>

161
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.360
<v 1>What do you mean? Something happened? He, he just ex you know,</v>

162
00:09:01.361 --> 00:09:04.000
put his energy out there trying to finish him. Cuz he hurt him a little bit.

163
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:07.120
Well, he got real wild. He got real wild. Dustin has get wild.

164
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.240
<v 2>Yeah. He had to. That was, he has to way.</v>

165
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.960
<v 1>Around now. Now this is a big, if I, by three minutes,</v>

166
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.390
20 seconds will in the second round. Why does he have to get wild? When,

167
00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:17.030
when you clipped someone, he knocked him out. Right.

168
00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:19.990
But he clipped him and hurt him. He could just do that again.

169
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.870
He could just stay technical and keep it on the outside.

170
00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:25.630
Which where I think he has an advantage. I don't think his wildness.

171
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.350
<v 2>Was the result of this takedown. I think he.</v>

172
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.430
<v 1>Exhaustion. He got taken. But the wildness leads to you being exhausted.</v>

173
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:35.580
They're they're both. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. Be exhausted. They're both. Yes.

174
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:39.460
Cause both those big punches exhaust cabib they're tired, but,

175
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.220
but cabibbe is way more, more efficient at doing this. Yes.

176
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.540
He clips your legs. He crosses your legs.

177
00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:48.660
Like a girl scout and no one's figured it.

178
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:51.620
Girl Scouts crossed your legs like that. I don't know. Is that a move on camp?

179
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.500
Did you go to, is that like a merit badge?

180
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.290
I don't wanna talk about it when I was younger, I was dressed girls.

181
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.930
It's how I got myself through college. All right. All right, here we go.

182
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.170
It' it's gonna be two minutes and 30 seconds of this. Okay. It's a lot,

183
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.110
lot of time.

184
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.290
Dustin just has to kind of hopefully capize on those little moments, by the way.

185
00:10:08.291 --> 00:10:10.610
He's kind of resting here. He's kind of resting here. He.

186
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.890
<v 2>Survives here and then tries it again in the its not in the fourth.</v>

187
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:15.610
He just gotta survive. Sitting against.

188
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.960
<v 1>Case. Gonna get another shot.</v>

189
00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.040
It it's really dependent upon what kind of recovery he can have,

190
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.160
how he's dealing with the heat and how, what kind of, oh God he gave back.

191
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.120
He justs back up again, man. But if he's gonna stand.

192
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.800
<v 2>Up and then use and then look, he's bleeding on his left eye. He's relaxed.</v>

193
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.160
<v 1>He's relaxing. That's a bad kind. This isn't a place to relax though.</v>

194
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.600
Kibdo goes, he's gonna.

195
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.240
<v 2>Get back. He's gonna face him. Right?</v>

196
00:10:35.241 --> 00:10:37.230
He's gonna get that left under and he's fine.

197
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.950
All he is gotta do is just pull that left underhoo out and he' is good.

198
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.270
Pull that left. Oh. Oh he didn't get it. He.

199
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.630
<v 1>Just pressure on no Don go guilty.</v>

200
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.430
<v 2>You taken don't sit back. There you go. Underhoos.</v>

201
00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.790
<v 1>That pressure. That pressure.</v>

202
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.310
<v 2>Dude. Kaib got serious.</v>

203
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.780
<v 1>Pressure. The head pressures. The best we forget about that.</v>

204
00:10:57.781 --> 00:11:00.980
Well his head pressure and the way he dips his body down and gets all the,

205
00:11:00.981 --> 00:11:01.540
his weight into.

206
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.380
<v 2>It on his feet though. Dude, he's on his.</v>

207
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.340
<v 1>Feet. Well, his head belongs on braweer by the way for Kabe,</v>

208
00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:08.580
he's got the biggest head. He got up to his feet. Oh,

209
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.180
but gotta don't what is he gonna do? Maybe Gramby roll.

210
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.940
<v 2>All he is gotta do is keep getting up and just kill time. There's a minute.</v>

211
00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:17.420
Just kill. This is just killing time.

212
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:20.890
Him for Dustin for another shot to get hopefully shot. That's smart.

213
00:11:20.891 --> 00:11:22.650
Another shot. Smart. Another shot. That's.

214
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.130
<v 1>Your best bet. Smart, smart. Just frustra. Frustra.</v>

215
00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:29.170
Don't go for the guilt's frustrating. Take guilty. HES. Not there. Stand up.

216
00:11:29.171 --> 00:11:30.410
Well he doesn't have a neck dude.

217
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.210
<v 2>There's no way he's gonna GU it to him. No.</v>

218
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:35.090
<v 1>You wish he imagine if he did the only way he.</v>

219
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:39.640
<v 2>Could GU it to him is if Dustin is known for acious guillotating and that's of</v>

220
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:40.960
that I.

221
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.160
<v 1>I, well, he is gotta galaacious Dar his Dar is fantastic. Good.</v>

<v 2>Shot to separate.</v>

225
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.040
<v 1>Is not gonna breath with it, man. He doesn't give.</v>

228
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.920
Exciting over ran.

229
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.840
<v 2>As soon as our separation run.</v>

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.280
<v 1>Oh, look at this up again. Up again. Run. Look at this up again. Oh,</v>

232
00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:18.630
Stand up. 16, 16. I'm I'm telling you Dustin's not taking a lot of damage.

233
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.910
He might be tired, but he is not taking as much damage as he could. Ah, yeah.

234
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:23.690
Yeah.

235
00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.630
<v 2>Aren't you an actor.</v>

236
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:28.070
<v 1>Or something? He got hit with a big knee there. Man. Who did? Dustin did?</v>

237
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.820
Oh. Back on their feet. two rounds of fury.

238
00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:38.940
Look at this. God. He's tired for sure. Of course. Is he tired though? Course.

239
00:12:38.941 --> 00:12:39.640
That's the question.

240
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.940
HES kill third and fourth round is usually a tough time for him.

241
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.340
I'll say this though. It's kind of impressive.

242
00:12:45.341 --> 00:12:47.460
What Connor did coming back of that long layoff.

243
00:12:47.461 --> 00:12:50.140
Cuz we see what he's doing to Dustin. Doesn't everybody.

244
00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.380
He's I'm just saying for whatconnor. You know he did defend a few take downs.

245
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.810
Know what? I landed. Some jobs.

246
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.970
<v 2>I see Dustin like, like this is the game plan. Wear him out a.</v>

247
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.810
<v 1>Hundred percent round. A hundred percent. The survives survive survives.</v>

248
00:13:02.811 --> 00:13:05.810
Dustin's a hundred percent dangerous. He's in the mix right now.

249
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.930
And you knock you out at any anymore. I would love to be listening to uh,

250
00:13:08.931 --> 00:13:11.450
Mike Brown's coaching. I take too. Just keep, you know what?

251
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.450

He screws up. The thing is you go looking for that shot. up.

257
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:36.190
You gotta the conservative looking for those shots.

258
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:40.190
You gotta be real conservative, but can, if you wanna win, if you wanna win,

259
00:13:40.191 --> 00:13:43.710
you gotta get wild. Oh yeah. He's so he's gotta just look at every go.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.110
Here we go. Yeah. Every beginning.

261
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.950
<v 2>Of every round is the time to knock him out. And once you get shot on. Okay,</v>

He tried to take a little breather after he let go of that guillo team.

You tugged on his neck. You tugged on the bear's neck. Now he is gonna you up.

Look at his dad right there. Nothing moves on his face. Makes you think.

Look a elite Brazilian jujijitsu black belt gets him in a position like that.

Cabib's the fight all day. I, I see, I disagree with Brian. Artte you?

295
00:15:37.381 --> 00:15:41.220
Cuz he's too small. He's 145 pounder. Oh he's a huge 40 fighter.
