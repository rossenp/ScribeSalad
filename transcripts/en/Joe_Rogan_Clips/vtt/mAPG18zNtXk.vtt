00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.840
<v 3>And one of the things I'm trying to do with, uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.841 --> 00:00:09.000
this is your mind on plants is start that post drug war conversation about

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.200
drugs, which is one of the reasons I included caffeine, you know,

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.880
a totally legal drug that everybody uses. Um,

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.320
what does that have to teach us in, in a way,

7
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.830
one of the most powerful drug experiences I've had in my life life was the first

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.510
cup of coffee. After three months off, really?

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.350
It was psychedelic really was incredible. Yeah. Come on, try it,

10
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.870
try getting off caffeine three months, three months without caffeine.

11
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.070
How am I gonna do a podcast? &lt;laugh&gt; you may have to take a hiatus.

12
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.710
I'm gonna run out of things to talk about. I'll fall asleep. It was really hard.

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.660
I did it actually. It's a suggestion of rolling Griffin who, uh, you know,

14
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.100
the psychedelic researcher mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who before that was the world's

15
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:47.300
leading expert on caffeine.

16
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.540
<v 1>Um, and, uh,</v>

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.460
and I was interviewing him about caffeine for this chapter and he said, well,

18
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:55.860
you're never gonna understand your relationship to caffeine until you get off

19
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:59.420
it. So it was kind of a dare and it was really hard.

20
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.930
It was one of the hardest things I've done really. Oh,

21
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.690
I was a mess for how long? Three months.

22
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.690
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; you were mess until you, I was functional after a month.

23
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.690
Um, the first week I was not functional at all,

24
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.050
I felt like I had contracted a D D Hmm.

25
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.850
I could not stay on track everything.

26
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.280
The periphery just kept intru on my thinking. I couldn't write, I mean,

27
00:01:24.281 --> 00:01:27.440
writing is the most linear thing you can do. Right, right. And you,

28
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.400
and it's all about concentration obviously. And, um, and I couldn't concentrate.

29
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.840
And I, I felt like there was this veil between me and reality that, you know,

30
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.920
I was not quite seeing, getting feeling,

31
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.550
and it was weird. I didn't feel my self for the whole time. And,

32
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.910
and I thought, what does that mean?

33
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.750
It means yourself is caffeinated &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.

34
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.110
And, and that is baseline consciousness for me and for many people.

35
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.470
And that's not a bad thing, but I think we have a debt to these plants that we,

36
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.140
we owe them. Um &lt;affirmative&gt;. And so I spent a lot of time in that,

37
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.293
researching that chapter,

38
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.340
looking back in history for when caffeine enters the west.

39
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.660
And it doesn't happen until the 1650s in Europe.

40
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.940
So we actually have a before and after which we don't with a lot of drugs,

41
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.580
cuz they just go back, you know, millennia. Um,

42
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.810
and before caffeine and it was a very different world and a very different

43
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:27.644
consciousness.

44
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.250
People were drunk a lot of the time buzzed almost all of the time.

45
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.730
People drank morning, noon and night because it was safer than water.

46
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.130
Right. Water was really how you got diseases.

47
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.930
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; if you fermented things even low, you know, low alcohol,

48
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.240
it killed a lot of the mic CROs. Um, so people,

49
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.560
even kids you gave your kids hard cider for breakfast. Um wow. And, uh,

50
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.320
and this was true in America up until the 18 hundreds up until prohibition. Um,

51
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.720
but anyway, um, caffeine comes along in the 1650s and,

52
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.520
and tea and chocolate and coffee all arrive in the same decade in England,

53
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.440
which kind of like great decade. Right. And, um, uh,

54
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.120
and things starts to change in the form of coffee, coffee and tea and chocolate,

55
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:14.040
which also has caffeine in it. And uh.

56
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.070
<v 2>So what would the dead never experience coffee before the 16 hundreds? That's.</v>

57
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.950
<v 1>Right. They had in the Arab world, they'd had it,</v>

58
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.110
they'd had it from like 1200 or something like that.

59
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.350
Supposedly it was discovered in eight hundreds by a herder in like Ethiopia

60
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.030
who noticed that his goats were getting very frisky when they ate this

61
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:37.470
particular Berry and would stay up all night. And so he, yeah,

62
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.700
so he kind of like started experimenting or he brought it to these monks and

63
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:43.900
they made a drink and it's like, Ooh, it makes sense.

64
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.900
<v 2>That, uh, it was in the Arab world.</v>

65
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.220
Cuz if you think about all the science that was being done in the Arab world,

66
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.620
all the literature back then. So all.

67
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.540
<v 1>The writing one theory is that the Arab world had coffee first and had this</v>

68
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:01.290
incredible golden age. Yes. And they is an historian of, of, um,

69
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.050
psychoactives named, uh,

70
00:04:03.051 --> 00:04:06.890
Wolfgang Shivel Bush and he correlates name isn't that wonderful German.

71
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.770
Of course &lt;laugh&gt; Wolfgang sh Bush. It's a great book.

72
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:13.930
It's called taste of paradise, highly recommend it. Um, and he said,

73
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:18.370
this was the perfect drug for the culture that invented mathematics &lt;laugh&gt; and

74
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.080
had this incredible. Um, and it helped the culture in two ways.

75
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.760
One was as safe as alcohol made water boiling,

76
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.960
it made it much safer. And coffee and tea,

77
00:04:29.961 --> 00:04:34.360
of course both required boiling water, no one ate a drink, boiling water,

78
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.240
uh, or hot beverages before.

79
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.150
So this gave this incredible public health boost to these place. Mm.

80
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.230
And then you have the drug that basically fosters a kind of more linear,

81
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.230
rational, focused way of thinking.

82
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.430
And so there is a lot of evidence linking, um,

83
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.430
coffee and tea consumption with the enlightenment in France and with the age of

84
00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:01.940
reason in England and people in the 1600 started writing about it.

85
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.420
So I was like, wow, people, you know,

86
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:07.460
we have this new civil and sober drink that we, that,

87
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.500
and it was so popular cuz it was new that people drank less and they used more

88
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.533
caffeine.

89
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.180
And that I think makes possible things like the industrial

90
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.860
revolution because you know, when you're,

91
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.410
when you're doing physical labor outdoor, which was most of history, right?

92
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.490
You could be buzzed. You didn't have to know what time it was.

93
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:28.250
You worked from sun up to sun down,

94
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.290
there were beer breaks actually on farms in England. Uh,

95
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:35.330
they would give you beer cuz it gave you calories and made you happy. Um,

96
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.250
but when you start moving into like running machines and doing double

97
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.120
entry bookkeeping, you need a clearer head.

98
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.800
And when you start moving toward night shifts and overnight shifts,

99
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.920
you couldn't do that without caffeine. And that's when it begins.

100
00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:55.880
There's a whole new, like it freed us from the rhythms of the sun,

101
00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.600
which dictated everything in Western culture. You worked, you could only work,

102
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.240
Tillen went down. Um, so it had a profound effect on capitalism,

103
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.920
the rise of capitalism and the clearest illustration of that,

104
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.600
that I came across is the coffee break. Where did that come from?

105
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.160
The coffee break actually has a history. We,

106
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.590
the company that came up with it and it was a,

107
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.030
a neck time manufacturer in Denver called wigwam weavers

108
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.870
really. And wigwam weavers, uh, made these very intricate silk neck ties.

109
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.510
And during world war II,

110
00:06:30.511 --> 00:06:33.590
they lost all their best loom operators to the war effort.

111
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.510
So they hired these old guys to do it, you know,

112
00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:39.420
who weren't getting drafted and they couldn't do it very well.

113
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.380
Then they hired these women to do it and they could do it beautifully.

114
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:46.900
And there were very intricate patterns, very complicated looms. I mean,

115
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:49.580
you've seen how they, you know, the patterns on neckties and um,

116
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.380
the women could do it really well, but only for about four or five hours.

117
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.220
So they called a, a meeting and the owners said to the workers,

118
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.650
what could we do? We have to improve, uh, your efficiency and you know,

119
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:04.770
we need more output. And the women said, well, give us a coffee break. Um,

120
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.210
they didn't call it that initially. And um,

121
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.570
give us some time at like 10 in the morning and four in the afternoon and give

122
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:12.570
us some coffee and tea.

123
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.770
So we started doing it and overnight like their productivity and efficiency goes

124
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.000
out up, ah, quality control goes up and uh,

125
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.000
so he institutes the coffee break and um, think about it.

126
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.120
Your employer gives you a drug and then gives you time off

127
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.000
in which to ingest it during the work day. Yeah. Why would they do that?

128
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.680
Because it contributes might elite.

129
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.230
So the coffee break might seem like it's something your boss is giving you,

130
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.750
but it's a way to extract more value from you.

131
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:48.190
<v 2>And I'm sure employees that have little breaks and get to enjoy</v>

132
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.830
just a little bit of free time. They'll be more,

133
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.510
they'll be happier employees. They, oh yeah.

134
00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:56.350
They'll probably be more productive like the, the.

135
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.300
<v 1>Bezos and he should instant. I don't know if he has coffee breaks.</v>

136
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.620
He wants to be on Adderall.

137
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.500
<v 2>24, 7 running to the next package. Now tell me about your experience,</v>

138
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.980
what your experience was like with the three months off and then,

139
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.100
then having the caffeine. So I had.

140
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.020
<v 1>This three months that was really unpleasant. Um,</v>

141
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.170
the only things that were positive about it was I S like a teenager.

142
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.890
It really did improve my sleep. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I had some,

143
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.210
some great sleeps, like I remember from when I was a teenager, you know,

144
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:29.570
when you can sleep 14 hours mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, that was really good.

145
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.370
I also felt, and I'm not proud of this self righteous &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. So,

146
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.970
you know, and I would, I remember, I remember one morning, um,

147
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.960
having to get a 6:00 AM flight and I had to get up and get myself

148
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:47.240
moving on mint tea &lt;laugh&gt; okay.

149
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:52.200
And I get to the airport and it's just when they're opening the P the pizzas and

150
00:08:52.201 --> 00:08:55.320
the Starbucks and the line is like sneaking, you know,

151
00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.520
for those people getting on 6:00 AM flights,

152
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.840
and I'm looking at these people and they look like junkies, you see,

153
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:04.960
in Amsterdam &lt;laugh&gt;, they look so pathetic and you know,

154
00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:08.760
that they were hooked and they needed their, they needed their fix. And, um,

155
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.960
and they look kind of miserable and withdrawal was starting,

156
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.310
cuz that first cup of coffee is not about the pleasure.

157
00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:18.750
It gives us it's really about stopping withdrawal symptoms, which are beginning,

158
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:22.070
overnight, cause you haven't had it for 24 hours. Um,

159
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:27.550
and I felt self righteous. &lt;laugh&gt; I'm not proud of that cuz I,

160
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.710
and I knew that I was gonna rejoin them as soon as I could. Right.

161
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.460
So when I hit the three month mark, um, I, I do decided,

162
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.780
and I need for the ending of the piece, uh, to have a cup and see,

163
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:44.540
this was gonna tell me, you know, because drugs are very different.

164
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:47.540
The first time you take them right before your body is accustomed to them.

165
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.020
So I had this first cup and I gave a lot of thought to where I would have it.

166
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.580
I thought about the original pees is in my neighborhood, the very first pees,

167
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:58.010
but I don't love their coffee. It's kind, it can be kind of burnt tasting.

168
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.610
And uh, so I went to a place called the cheeseboard,

169
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.730
which is a cafe bakery in my neighborhood. And um,

170
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.650
they have a little pocket park out on the street and I got a cup, uh,

171
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.730
got a special, uh, which is, uh, it's sort of like a cappuccino,

172
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.890
but more CA more, uh, coffee and less milk, like a flat white in, uh, Austin,

173
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.800
Australia. And we sat my wife and I Juda sat there and um,

174
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.120
I drank this drink and it was so good. &lt;laugh&gt;,

175
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:25.920
I mean,

176
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.640
I just felt these waves of wellbeing and then it turned into euphoria

177
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.760
and um, uh, I was like, wow, this is such a strong drug.

178
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.670
I had no idea it was like cocaine or something. And, um,

179
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.350
and that lasted for maybe 20 minutes,

180
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:45.110
but then something turned that was kind of interesting across the street.

181
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.270
There was a, um, a garbage truck that was, uh,

182
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.590
grabbing hold of two garbage, you know,

183
00:10:50.591 --> 00:10:54.070
plastic garbage can and shaking them like this and making this horrible racket.

184
00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.790
And, uh, and it really got under my,

185
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:02.060
I was getting kind of irritable and I said to Judith, can we go home? You know?

186
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.100
And, and I felt like I gotta get something done. I felt kind of compulsive. Wow.

187
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.420
And so we walked home and I went to my office and uh,

188
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.340
I just had this desire to get done. And, uh,

189
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:15.260
so what I did was this is really weird.

190
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.050
I unsubscribe from like a list serves that I was getting on my email that were

191
00:11:20.051 --> 00:11:23.570
really annoying. I just killed them one after another and after another.

192
00:11:23.571 --> 00:11:28.570
And then after I finished that, I, uh, went through the sweater, uh,

193
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:32.850
in my closet, all the sweaters in my closet &lt;laugh&gt; and I threw out some,

194
00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.090
I gave some away and.

195
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.930
<v 2>I, this sounds like meth behavior &lt;laugh&gt; cause this is what I hear.</v>

196
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.560
I had a friend of mine, I don't know,

197
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.000
data girl was on meth and she always would clean really.

198
00:11:43.001 --> 00:11:45.680
She would come home and organize and clean things. He's like,

199
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:49.680
so if your girl starts cleaning incessantly, she might be on ahe.

200
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:50.514
You have a problem.

201
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:55.000
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. I was really compulsive, uh, and very productive. And,</v>

202
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.560
and I said to myself, did.

203
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.920
<v 2>You keep drinking it throughout the day?</v>

204
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.240
<v 1>Well, this is no, but I was tempted to,</v>

205
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.320
so I said to myself, how can I hold onto this power that this drug has?

206
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.200
Cuz if I start using it every day, I'm gonna lose it.

207
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:12.400
I'm just gonna be another caffeine, you know, addict. And, um, and I had,

208
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.590
I came up with this idea, only do it on Saturdays. Oh, once a week.

209
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.830
And I did that for a while. So that very day after cleaning out my closet,

210
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.470
I worked in the garden and, and there were some, um,

211
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:27.190
plants that needed a replacement. And uh, so I,

212
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.710
I started driving down to this garden center called um, flower land.

213
00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.020
And um, and I realized, why did I pick that flower?

214
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.980
Why did I pick that nursery and say, oh,

215
00:12:36.981 --> 00:12:41.060
they have this Airstream where they sell espresso drinks right out in front.

216
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:42.160
It was like,

217
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.740
it was the voice of the addict putting me in position to get another cup the

218
00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:48.860
same day. And um,

219
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.970
and so I resisted that and I did this Saturday thing for a while and it worked

220
00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:57.330
pretty well. I really look forward to Saturdays and I got a, I got a lot done,

221
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.050
um, on Saturday, on Saturday &lt;laugh&gt;,

222
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.410
But I wasn't addicted anymore. So I could get to the week. Wasn't fine.

223
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.610
It wasn't hard. But then gradually it was like, Hmm. You know, it's Thursday.

224
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:13.810
And I got a deadline and this would really help me get over the,

225
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.320
so I, so I started making exceptions. It was complete addict thinking.

226
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.120
<v 2>Right. Did you try any other forms of caffeine? Um.</v>

227
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.960
<v 1>I would, yeah, I would.</v>

228
00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.560
I would do green tea as I'm drinking now mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as a kind of green

229
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:30.000
tea is a very good, um, source of caffeine cuz it's really, even,

230
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.920
there's another ALO in it that stretches out the effect. Um,

231
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.270
so you don't get of jolt, but it kind of keeps you nicely titrated.

232
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.190
<v 2>What is the caffeine, uh, content of green tea, the average cup. It.</v>

233
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.990
<v 1>It, it's probably a third of what you get in a cup of coffee. Um,</v>

234
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.350
it varies amazingly. Like if the, if the tips were, uh, plucked, you know,

235
00:13:51.351 --> 00:13:52.630
when they're brand new, you know,

236
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.580
first flush green tea that has a lot more cat caffeine and,

237
00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.940
and is a lot more valuable. So there's a lot of variables that go into it.

238
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.740
The plant is producing caffeine of course, as a pesticide. Right.

239
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.940
And that was a whole question I looked at. It was like,

240
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.260
why do plants produce these things that have these effects on our minds?

241
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.030
How did that,

242
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.860
isn't that amazing that a plant could devise a chemical that can unlock

243
00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.570
a receptor in your brain. That's astonishing.
