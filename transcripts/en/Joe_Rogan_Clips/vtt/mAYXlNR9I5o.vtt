00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.793
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Healthcare,</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.200
and this is a healthcare issue obviously is so

3
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:10.230
complicated and there's so many levels to it. But I mean,

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.310
I think one of them that we really have to address is diet and obesity.

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.710
There's, there's a giant problem with diet and obesity in this country,

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.640
healthy food, eating, eating the proper food. And, you know,

7
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.620
I had a friend who said they were talking about people who do

8
00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:31.920
drugs and people who drink and, you know,

9
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.100
maybe they shouldn't get access to those same health care.

10
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.660
And maybe that's a good incentive to stop people from drinking and doing drugs.

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.700
And I said, yeah, what about people do fat? What about people who were fat?

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.080
Like you're going to use the same logic with them because you can't fat shame.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.390
So can you tell, Hey, Hey fatso,

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.900
you can't get the same health care that a healthy person does. Well,

15
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:58.430
if you've got a healthy person who likes to drink and they, they run and they,

16
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:01.500
they jog, but they do like to drink and they occasionally smoke a cigarette.

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.030
What are they healthier than someone who's morbidly obese? Yes they are.

18
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.260
So would we have a problem? Is people who don't self care.

19
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.180
We have a giant problem with that.

20
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.050
People who don't take the necessary steps personally,

21
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.770
now is this because of education? Is it because of ignorance?

22
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.480
Is it because of a lack of awareness of the consequences of a,

23
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.400
of a non-healthy diet or eating poor foods or consuming large amounts of

24
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:32.340
alcohol or tobacco products? I don't know what it is,

25
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:37.140
but that is a massive part of our healthcare system is people

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.850
who are not doing the proper things to their own body in terms of eating

27
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.110
nutritious foods, hopefully that they can afford in terms of exercise,

28
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.880
which is free for everybody. You know,

29
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:50.760
there's a lot of things you can do that are free to take care of your body.

30
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.420
<v 1>Yeah, I agree. Well, I think it's indicative of,</v>

31
00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.500
of a problem in our culture where we've started to sideline this notion of

32
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:05.000
personal responsibility. Um, I, the chapter seven in my book,

33
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.350
I forgot it. I got to talk about my book. Well,

34
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:13.490
now order from your local bookstore you'll run any more than any more help than

35
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:14.000
Amazon.

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.350
<v 0>Did you read the audio book version of it? Yeah. Good. Thank you.</v>

37
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.650
14 hours. Very important, Andrew,

38
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.590
that some other dork is reading for you. It'd be very upset.

39
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.390
<v 1>Yeah, no, I was, I was very much against that. And uh, so yeah, we got it done.</v>

40
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.010
Um, chapter seven is called a sense of duty and you know,

41
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.970
part of the, part of the deal when we, when we,

42
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.840
when our founders wrote out the declaration of independence and the constitution

43
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:45.710
and, and built the framework for this free society that we live in,

44
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.650
where government's role is to protect your rights.

45
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.850
That's fundamentally the government's role. You have God given rights. And, uh,

46
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.130
and, and these, these are life, Liberty, property, effectively speaking,

47
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.870
life, Liberty, and that's in the constitution and the declaration,

48
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.060
they Jefferson wrote the pursuit of happiness and they choose these words really

49
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:11.050
carefully. Now, part of the exchange there is,

50
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.150
is a necessity for citizens to live with a sense of duty and to live as a

51
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.410
citizen, this idea of citizenship, and to do what is right to do,

52
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.030
what is good. Um,

53
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.360
it's hard for me to imagine that people are just so uneducated that they don't

54
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:27.820
know that they're unhealthy. You know, I think, I think,

55
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.960
I think they know it right, but the problem is that, that they don't care.

56
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.440
That's a problem. And you're getting at that problem.

57
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.610
<v 0>That's true. I don't think it's that they don't care.</v>

58
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:43.110
I think they have no discipline. I don't think it's that they don't care. Well,

59
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.650
there there's,

60
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.580
there's a difference is they've never been taught to push themselves.

61
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.910
There's a lot of look, it's just so easy to get by,

62
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.120
but that's one of the reasons why I love the title of your book.

63
00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:55.950
Fortitude is what people need. And,

64
00:03:55.951 --> 00:04:00.540
and also they need to understand that there's a great value in doing

65
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:05.280
difficult things and this society, which chapter is that?

66
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.290
Chapter eight? Is it the name of the chapter is called, do something hard.

67
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.820
Good for you. Well, listen, man, that's true. Look, you're a Navy seal, man.

68
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:18.210
You, you know it, you get it, you live it. This is what we need.

69
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:22.620
We need more people who understand that. I know it's hard to get up.

70
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:25.680
I know it's hard to do things. I know it it's hard for me to,

71
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:28.500
but I still do them and you should do them too. I mean,

72
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:32.230
it should be something that we encourage everyone to do and that we,

73
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:35.580
we all talk about. And then we all praise each other for,

74
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:39.690
and we all get excited about accomplishing these things and taking care of your

75
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:43.980
physical body, taking care of your meat vehicle. If everybody just did that,

76
00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:47.850
we would have healthcare costs in this country would be radically decreased.

77
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.440
Well.

78
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.400
<v 1>That's a fact. Yeah, that's a fact. That's an absolute fact.</v>

79
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.181
<v 0>Well ahead,</v>

80
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:58.260
discipline and more people just went out and took care of themselves and then

81
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:01.350
had disciplined to not overeat and had disciplined too,

82
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.880
to try to choose the right foods and to make a meal plan,

83
00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:08.880
write things down. I mean, it can be done this.

84
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.800
We're not talking about breathing under water.

85
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.710
We're talking about things that can be done by the average person.

86
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.220
<v 1>Like, I don't think the,</v>

87
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.570
the notion of personal responsibility is talked about enough as it's almost

88
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.790
conservatives talk about it all the time.

89
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.340
That's one of the things I appreciate about conservatives.

90
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.680
<v 2>But.</v>

91
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.840
<v 1>It's, it's kind of used against us a lot, right?</v>

92
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.190
It's almost like we're accused of being immoral and unfeeling and uncaring.

93
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.770
When we say, you know, in this whole like, oh,

94
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:41.940
just tell everybody to hold themselves up by their bootstraps and whatever.

95
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:46.170
And like, not that we even use that term, but, but the point is,

96
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.700
is that it's actually important.

97
00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.150
And I don't think conservatives have done a good enough job over time explaining

98
00:05:51.151 --> 00:05:55.500
why it's so important and personal responsibility as a,

99
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.590
as a foundation of our culture. It's important because it leads to empowerment.

100
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.340
It gives us the agency to control our own destiny.

101
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.270
It's if you're constantly in victim mode, if you're constantly being told that,

102
00:06:09.271 --> 00:06:11.300
that you can't control your own destiny well,

103
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.840
that that's fundamentally disempowering and that's a terrible psychological

104
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.913
state to be in.

105
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.390
And the other thing I tell people is that is a fundamental American

106
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.260
attribute. There's, there's some interesting polling out there. Um, I don't,

107
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.180
I forget the numbers, right. But I always,

108
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.900
I always have them in a speech that I give. And when,

109
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.880
when you ask people, um, what's the exact question it's.

110
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.480
<v 2>It's like, do you.</v>

111
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.280
<v 1>You know, do, do you have,</v>

112
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.420
are the things that happen to you or are they within your control or outside

113
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:49.090
your control? It's something like that. Um, in Germany, the,

114
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:50.210
the answer was,

115
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.980
was overwhelmingly things are happening to them outside of their control,

116
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.730
right? Like, like, do you understand what I'm saying in America?

117
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.330
When the same question was asked, it was like, you know,

118
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.040
30 or 40% of people said yes, versus in Germany it was like 50 or 60%.

119
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.170
So it's a pretty market difference. And that,

120
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.010
and that's a uniquely American thing that we believe we are in control of our

121
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:16.910
own destiny. We tend to overwhelmingly say more than European countries,

122
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.800
that if we work hard and, and, and play by the rules and do what's right,

123
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.430
that we will get ahead, that we will find that opportunity. And I think that's,

124
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:28.400
I think the world recognizes that too. When, when you,

125
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:32.120
when you go around the world and you ask people, where would you rather be to,

126
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.030
you know, to, if you could immigrate right now,

127
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.430
what's your number one destination. Well,

128
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:42.110
it's the U S a like overwhelmingly the second place is Canada and Germany at

129
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:46.100
like 6% of respondents. The USA is like 21% of respondents.

130
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.360
So second place isn't even close. And so for all of the left wing,

131
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.280
like anger and, and always saying how bad it is and how nothing works here.

132
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:58.220
And everybody's just in, in, in crisis,

133
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.620
all the topics that we're in a crisis technically right now, of course,

134
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.790
but this, this rhetoric was, was, was prevalent before all this,

135
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.890
for all of that commentary. It's, it's just, it's just, isn't true.

136
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.580
And so, and, and the reason they use crisis language, okay.

137
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:16.820
The reason they tell you're going to die in 10 years, climate change,

138
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.020
the reason they're always telling you that corporations are taking advantage of

139
00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:24.950
you. And the 1% is just the, got you under their boot and all of this. It's,

140
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.440
it's very victimizing language,

141
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.750
and there's a reason behind it because they want very, they want very,

142
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.950
very extreme policies put into place. And you can't justify,

143
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.400
you can't justify revolutionizing the whole system,

144
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.510
unless you convince people that the system is so bad and so corrupt that it

145
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:46.240
needs to be revolutionized. And what's,

146
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:50.170
that's created is a real undermining of this notion of personal responsibility,

147
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.660
because you have to tell people they're victims.

148
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.970
If you're going to convince them that they need you to save them.

149
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.740
And when you undermine personal responsibility, you disempower people. Um,

150
00:08:59.741 --> 00:09:00.810
and fundamentally to me,

151
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.490
that's what socialism does because you're telling people there, you know, each,

152
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.720
each to their need each to their ability,

153
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.650
what you're telling people is that they don't have to work that hard,

154
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.700
that they deserve.

155
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.640
They have rights to all of these other services from other people,

156
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.190
it's their right. And we should distribute that accordingly.

157
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:21.750
Everybody's perfectly equal. What that does is it removes agency from people.

158
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:23.970
And it's truly a disempowering thing.

159
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:27.810
And we've seen this throughout their throughout history. Um, you know,

160
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:32.040
just talk to Venezuelans and Cubans, and they're so happy when they get here.

161
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.760
They're so happy. Cause they just want to work hard and move up.

162
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.750
And they're just so excited about this meritocracy that we've, that we've,

163
00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.480
that we've built into our, into our culture.

164
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.890
<v 0>Is there such a great example of that? My friend, Andrew Schultz,</v>

165
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.750
who's a hilarious comedian has a great bit about how communist Cubans

166
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.280
come to America and the moment they step foot on soil, they become Republicans.

167
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.590
It's really hilarious, but it's true. Yeah. And they do appreciate that,

168
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.850
that aspect of this country.

169
00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:06.110
I think one of the things that you said earlier is that we live in the best time

170
00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:08.270
ever in history. And I agree with that,

171
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:13.640
the consequences of it being such a great time are it's far easier

172
00:10:13.641 --> 00:10:17.450
to get by because it's far easier to get by. People,

173
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:21.410
look for things to be more difficult than they actually are.

174
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:26.270
They look for things to be more stacked against them than they actually are.

175
00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:28.760
They look for more of a woe is me standpoint.

176
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.300
When you find people that actually have a real difficult life,

177
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.210
they don't look for things to be hard.

178
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.850
They find hard things everywhere they look.

179
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.890
And oftentimes you find that those people that have a real struggle, that it's,

180
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.880
there's a great documentary called happy people by Werner Herzog.

181
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.840
And it's about people who live in Siberia and it is a brutal,

182
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.480
difficult existence in extreme cold,

183
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.050
but these people are overwhelmingly happy. I mean,

184
00:10:57.051 --> 00:11:01.630
it is a really crazy documentary because their physical and their,

185
00:11:01.631 --> 00:11:06.080
their struggle just for existence just to survive is so

186
00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:10.400
difficult that they've found this sort of perfect

187
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:14.480
vibration of existence, where they're in the wilderness,

188
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.450
they're out there trapping and hunting and fishing and, and farming and,

189
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:22.760
and gathering up enough food to survive in the extreme winters.

190
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:23.780
And it's,

191
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.640
it really shows you that human beings need difficult tasks.

192
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.760
We need things to be tough to do,

193
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.360
and we need to actually go out there and do them to have a feeling of

194
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:39.620
satisfaction and have a feeling of personal responsibility.

195
00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:44.210
And the fact that you've actually done the things that you needed to do in order

196
00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:46.430
to survive, it's built into us.

197
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.600
<v 1>Yeah, it really is. And this is why I've wrote a whole chapter on this,</v>

198
00:11:50.601 --> 00:11:54.880
do something hard is it is, it is a real deep into the benefits of suffering.

199
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.380
And I distinguish between just going through something hard,

200
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.720
like getting blown up in the face, like yeah, that's suffering,

201
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:04.450
but it's not self-imposed I wouldn't wish that upon anybody.

202
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.840
I'm not saying you need to get blown up in the face and lose an eye to have this

203
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:11.680
sort of spiritual awakening and how good it feels to go through something hard.

204
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.270
But you should,

205
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.680
you should have been easily move into a self-imposed suffering

206
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.130
if you were about to say something. No, it wasn't.

207
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:23.580
<v 0>No, but you, but you just, by virtue,</v>

208
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.410
like you're a seal and seals, people that are special operators,

209
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.690
people that have gone through [inaudible]

210
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:30.690
, whether it's military or first responders really difficult physical tasks to get to where you, you are just that alone creates character, creates a different kind of person and the type of people that gravitate towards those endeavors. Those 

211
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:31.523
they're special people.

212
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.120
<v 1>They are. But, but, uh, you know,</v>

213
00:12:51.121 --> 00:12:55.350
I didn't write this book for them and I wrote it for everybody. And, and what I,

214
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:57.240
what I point out is, is, is, is, is listen,

215
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.110
seals have our hard thing and it's buds, um, you know,

216
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.220
it's just that as an acronym,

217
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:05.070
it stands for basic underwater demolition slash seal training.

218
00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:09.180
It's six months of hell. And it is,

219
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.870
it pushes you beyond limits. You, you ever thought you had hell week,

220
00:13:12.871 --> 00:13:16.200
especially. Um, and when you're done with that, when you,

221
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.850
when you come away from hell week,

222
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.810
there really is this sort of spiritual awakening it's that you have higher

223
00:13:21.811 --> 00:13:24.980
confidence, you feel prepared for anything, even in the, in the,

224
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.740
some of the worst situations, uh, you can think to yourself, well,

225
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.000
it's not quite hell week, is it? You know? And, and so you, you,

226
00:13:32.001 --> 00:13:35.730
you you're able to have a much more perspective we're lacking in perspective,

227
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.730
quite a bit. Also chapter two is called perspective from darkness.

228
00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:43.200
And I point this backed out, but too many of us have gotten so comfortable.

229
00:13:43.201 --> 00:13:47.040
We we've removed suffering from our life to such an extraordinary degree,

230
00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:50.730
and that's not a bad thing. Okay. That's, that's, that's a, that's a, that's a,

231
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.620
that's an element of the modern times that we live in and I'm happy we live

232
00:13:55.621 --> 00:13:56.850
there. But the reality is,

233
00:13:56.851 --> 00:14:01.140
is that my ancestors were like struggling through Texas trying to find water on

234
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:02.850
a daily basis. And,

235
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.080
and in my life I'm complaining because when I'm at 30,000 feet flying through

236
00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:10.740
the air, the wifi isn't as fast as I'd like it to be like.

237
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:13.680
So we have very different complaints and it's good to every once in a while,

238
00:14:13.681 --> 00:14:16.110
just think, you know what? I have a pretty good.

239
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.680
And to remind yourself of that again, the do something hard.

240
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.450
Chapter is it's one, it's a deep dive into the psychological literature,

241
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:29.130
which I just enjoy doing. Um, there's a, there's a lot to back this up,

242
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.990
whether it's modern psychology, the history of stoicism or the Bible,

243
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.130
all of these, all of these texts, these,

244
00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:41.310
these ancient pieces of wisdom that have been around for a very long time,

245
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.120
they all talk about this. They'll talk about the value of suffering,

246
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.770
the value of enduring and hardship and how this builds character and,

247
00:14:49.771 --> 00:14:52.310
and how this actually quite makes you stronger.

248
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.060
And most of them built a metaphysical sense and a psychological sense and a

249
00:14:56.061 --> 00:15:00.470
physical sense actually actually go into the, um, to the science of it as well.

250
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.530
And like how the, the changes in your brain, what exercise does,

251
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:07.490
what hardship actually does both physically and metaphysically.

252
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.080
Like there's real, there's real benefits to this, but you have to do it.

253
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.100
And it doesn't have to be Joe Rogan's life. Okay.

254
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.260
I wonder if a lot of people look at your life and they're like,

255
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.440
that guy is too productive for me. And, you know,

256
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.470
it's just too intimidating and maybe that's so,

257
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:26.540
but don't compare yourself to other people compare,

258
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.080
compare yourself to who you were yesterday, you know, and I think that was,

259
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:33.200
it's not a Jordan Peterson that might be a Jordan Peterson character.

260
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.590
I think I was just quoted that. But, but the point is, is like,

261
00:15:36.591 --> 00:15:38.150
these things are true because they're true.

262
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.810
Like that's why Jordan Peterson says that because it's true. Like, I, you know,

263
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.540
I don't pretend like I'm the first one to come up with these ideas.

264
00:15:44.541 --> 00:15:48.060
I'm just trying to put them into language that people can understand and,

265
00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:52.220
and use my life experiences to, to bolster those, um, those lessons.

266
00:15:52.221 --> 00:15:56.210
But it just has to be harder than what you did yesterday and maybe it's

267
00:15:56.211 --> 00:15:58.220
physical, but not everybody can do physical things.

268
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:01.070
Maybe it's hard for you to finish a project at home. Just do that.

269
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.770
Maybe take a cold shower. And just so you can like, kind of,

270
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.680
you feel tougher the rest of the day, because you're like, you know what?

271
00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:10.970
I just sat in 10 minutes of icy cold water. I didn't do that the day before,

272
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:14.720
but I did it today. And now I feel a little bit more like a bad-ass like,

273
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:17.210
you know, and I feel like more like a bad-ass than I did yesterday.

274
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.590
It's small things.

275
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:22.890
It's this self-imposed suffering is so important for our lives. Like me, I,

276
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.350
for me, it's usually physical, right?

277
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:27.320
Like I want to do this challenge of a workout. And they're like,

278
00:16:27.321 --> 00:16:29.450
that kind of keeps me sharp. Um,

279
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.370
or maybe it's like running for Congress or something. Like, I dunno, like we,

280
00:16:32.371 --> 00:16:36.970
we all have something and I'm just saying, Hey, you have to find that and,

281
00:16:36.971 --> 00:16:39.620
and make it habitual. It can't just be once, either.

282
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.770
Cause seals can get soft too. Yes. We, we all know the, you know,

283
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:45.980
we know who those guys are and, um, it's because they stopped,

284
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.210
they stopped listening from the, to the lessons from buds into this,

285
00:16:50.211 --> 00:16:52.370
this value of self-imposed suffering.
