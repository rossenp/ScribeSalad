00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.720
<v 6>I used to actually could touch the rim almost dunk, but my knees was like, yo,</v>

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.400
I don't care what you put on 'em fam. We ain't doing it. Did.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 1>You see the Tom Sura dunk? You didn't see what happened? No. No. Oh,</v>

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.000
I gotta show you something.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.360
Tom Sagura went to dump dunk and as he's running towards the net,

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.390
he blows out his patella tendon as he is leaping up in the air,

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.910
his knee blows out and then he falls and lands on his arm,

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.990
snaps his arm in half.

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.110
So he blew out his knee and his arm all in one terrible

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.910
maneuver. And they did it all on video.

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.300
Him and Burt were having a dunk competition. And now Tom has a, uh,

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.860
he's got this thing on his, his hand because his nerves got damaged.

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.180
&lt;laugh&gt; and he's watch this.

15
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.053
<v 2>You okay?</v>

16
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.500
<v 0>No, no, he's.</v>

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.060
<v 1>Not. Okay. Watch this boom. Look at the arm breaks. Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.450
<v 3>Okay. Okay.</v>

19
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.243
<v 4>He's arm.</v>

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.673
<v 0>He's arm.</v>

21
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.490
<v 5>Okay. Can you call nine.</v>

22
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.450
<v 1>Call nine one go.</v>

23
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.483
<v 0>For, &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

24
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.663
<v 1>Not good.</v>

25
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.760
That's why it's good to be a little athletic cuz occasionally you and your

26
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:29.720
stupid friends want to have like a ridiculous competition for a video.

27
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.000
This.

28
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.400
<v 0>Is the, this that's the reason why wives yell at husband? No,</v>

29
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.480
don't go. &lt;laugh&gt; like, are you gonna play basketball again? Like,

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.633
like it's like.

31
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.030
<v 1>But that's not even regular basketball. They were just,</v>

32
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:44.390
they were just dunking over and.

33
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.030
<v 0>Over and over again. So, um, I'm quite sure, you know, bill Bellamy. Sure.</v>

34
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.190
So bill Bellamy's, um, road manager,

35
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.630
Terrance they're shooting, just shooting around in the gym,

36
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.030
just shooting regular shooting. And it's always this man you need man,

37
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.580
pull up on your own, your toes lifts up on your toes and shoot that ball.

38
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.660
So he lifts up on his toes and blows out whatever's back there is &lt;laugh&gt;

39
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.220
is gone. Achilles. He is.

40
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.060
<v 1>Achilles. Oh no, that's a bad one.</v>

41
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.260
<v 0>Like yo I'm like, see I'm like,</v>

42
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.780
don't listen to people when you're just shooting around.

43
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.540
Just listen to yourself. Just I'm just gonna do this.

44
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.410
I'm just gonna to lay the ball up. Not doing if so. I'm like, ah.

45
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.610
That's why when I go to the gym, I intentionally put on cowboy boots. &lt;laugh&gt;

46
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.570
intentionally. I'm like cowboy boots and shorts for me, man.

47
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.410
I'm not cowboy boots. I don't want nobody to try to convince me to do anything.

48
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.370
I'm like, no, I'm not doing it. Yeah.

49
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.680
I remember the last time I was convinced I'm not doing it.

50
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 1>What was what convinced you last time?</v>

51
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.040
<v 0>Oh, Hey man. First it always start with you played football.</v>

52
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.640
Didn't you like? &lt;laugh&gt; that?

53
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.600
I think it's been more injuries started with that right there.

54
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.280
So you play football &lt;laugh&gt; so I'm like, yeah, we, you know,

55
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.600
we all play football. So me, my friends, we out there in dress shoes.

56
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.200
Mind you? Oh no. In dress.

57
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.160
We supposed to be running one little quick little route this way. Nope.

58
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.390
Out we outside the gym. Cause this is the only place where it is called.

59
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.830
Like it's no. Cause like yo, we go right there to LA fitness.

60
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.830
&lt;laugh&gt; like, but why? Like why do you know what LA fitness is right now?

61
00:03:30.831 --> 00:03:34.910
Like why do you even know? &lt;laugh&gt; like, how does he, first of all,

62
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:36.790

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.740
not even a real football Nerf, you know, that's what he had in his car.

65
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.700
A little Nerf with the little, with the little, um,

66
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.380
I think they got some new ones where they twist or something.

67
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.380
Cause my NEF balls were smooth. This was, has little waves in it,

68
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:57.660
throwing the ball. And I cut, forgetting that I have on dress shoes.

69
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.810
Cause now you getting competitive person catch the ball, see that's touchdown.

70
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.370
First of all, you know, we close to, first of all, there's okay.

71
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:07.610
If that's the pole down there, you're nowhere close to it, sir.

72
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.770
You know what I'm saying? So now, now it's competitive.

73
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.250
Now &lt;laugh&gt; now up on the line. You know,

74
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.330
now you really being what you saw on TV. Now you being a safety and I cut,

75
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.040
I cut that dress shoe, that heel call a little gravel.

76
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.160
And it's hard to explain the side of your face being scratched up.

77
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.560
Like you, you cause the gravel scratch.

78
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.000
It's like when like fall off a motorcycle and you get the, the cement rash,

79
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.520
turf rash. So I'm just like side of my face is scratched up.

80
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.880
My hand is scratched up and I'm like, huh, okay.

81
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.750
Now I gotta go home and explain why my face is bleeding.

82
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.310
You supposed to be at the club, sir. How did,

83
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.230
