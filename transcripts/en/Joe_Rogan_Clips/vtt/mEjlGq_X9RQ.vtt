00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 2>Did you see DC's breakdown and in detail,</v>

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.270
the second fight versus the first fight with Conor? Very interesting.

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.950
<v 0>It is,</v>

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.110
but I see a lot of people talking funny stuff about like the leg kicked in and

6
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:18.060
knock him out. What happened like, so DC says in the detailed breakdown, uh,

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.110
I kicked on his calf and Connor steps back in his led kind of goes, and DC says,

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.300
oh, that's the light kicked it, you know, hurt his leg or whatever.

9
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:26.700
But when he went after that leg kick,

10
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.910
he kind of reached down to grab the foot and through an uppercut and I was

11
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:32.790
switched stance. So I threw a, from my backhand that clipped him. Good.

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.720
And that's when he took the step back and was hurt. Um, I think that's a detail.

13
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:37.563
People are missing.

14
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.150
<v 1>Right hand. Well,</v>

15
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.960
you've certainly you landed a lot of solid shots in that fight,

16
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.430
but there's no doubt that leg kick was that right leg up for sure.

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.510
But the detail, what I was going to get over is the,

18
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:52.200
the difference between the first fight and the sacrifice was you were landing

19
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.470
hard leg kicks in the first fight, but you're landing them on the thigh.

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.390
And then it switched over to the calf.

21
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.220
What a crazy difference that calf kick has made in MMA over the last few

22
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.930
years, it's really nuts.

23
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.830
<v 0>It is man. And it doesn't take many, and it doesn't take as much commitment.</v>

24
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.980
You know, like a thigh kick, you're turning your hips over Moya Thai style.

25
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.670
You're really set in your position, weapon, this calf kick, you can flick,

26
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.760
you know, you can flick it like a jab and just catch the top of the calf.

27
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.683
And it's.

28
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.170
<v 1>It's so wild that this one kick was almost ignored.</v>

29
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.990
I always give Benson Henderson credit because I think he was the first guy to

30
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.000
start use it in the UFC. But for whatever reason,

31
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.750
he didn't have the same impact with it. It just, I don't know,

32
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.670
I'd have to go over some fights.

33
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.780
<v 0>Huge legs. I'm sure it.</v>

34
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.080
<v 1>Gets hard as I'm sure it kicks off, but for whatever reason,</v>

35
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.640
he wasn't stopping guys with calf kicks. But then along the way,

36
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:45.180
somewhere in the last, what was it? Five, six years. Something like that.

37
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.350
<v 0>Not maybe not even that far.</v>

38
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.830
<v 1>But maybe not even, which is crazy, which is crazy. I can't think of a thing,</v>

39
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.730
a single technique that got, that revolutionized the sport that way. Right.

40
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.490
<v 0>And, and like I said, about the calf,</v>

41
00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.500
you can't take many because there's nowhere for the swelling to go.

42
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:01.430
So that's why it's so painful and debilitating your, your,

43
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.470
your nerves and your foot kind of stop working with you. It's it's bad stuff.

44
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.380
<v 1>There's no meat there either. I was explaining to someone I'm like, just,</v>

45
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.650
just karate, chop your arm right here, where the bonus,

46
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.590
it hurts just to do that. Now, imagine someone kicking that.

47
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.590
And that's what it's like when you get kicked in the calf, there's nothing,

48
00:02:16.591 --> 00:02:17.970
there there's no meat.

49
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.240
<v 0>And even when you turn your shin outward to check it, you still get it.</v>

50
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.710
You it's still bad, man.

51
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.630
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I noticed that in the Conor fight. Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.370
You could see somewhere in the first round when he started realizing like, oh,

53
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.690
this is a real problem.

54
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.720
And Connors now have the ability to switch stances or if he does,

55
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:34.554
he doesn't do it.

56
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.900
<v 0>Yeah, definitely didn't do in that fight. And it was only going to get worse.</v>

57
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:39.060
That was second round. You know, we had three more rounds,

58
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.150
50 more minutes of me chopping LA. If we do it again,

59
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:43.860
it'll be interesting to see what he does, uh,

60
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.640
different in preparation or by defending that.

61
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.220
<v 1>Well, you were such a, such a different guy in the second fight. You know, you,</v>

62
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.970
first of all, you weren't debilitating yourself getting down to 145 pounds.

63
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.080
Yeah. I mean, you were a big 1 45. Like how, how rough was that cut?

64
00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.560
It.

65
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 0>Was horrible. And it made me hate the process because my quality of life sucked,</v>

66
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.300
you know, training camps were torture, you know? Uh,

67
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840
I would walk around one 90 G get to one 90.

68
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.493
I'd get up to one 90.

69
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.990
<v 1>Yeah. Oh my God.</v>

70
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.730
You get up to one 90 and go down to 1 45, 45 pounds.

71
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.370
<v 0>Let me tell you this. When I up Swanson in London, England,</v>

72
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:27.400
I took it on short notice and I just want to fight before.

73
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.610
And it was right around Christmas. So I was eating. And when they called me, uh,

74
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.780
they asked me my weight and I told them I had one 70,

75
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.780
but I was like 180 7 or something. And it was like really short notice. So we,

76
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:40.990
my team fly out there. Um, am 30 pounds over when we land, you know,

77
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:42.790
fight week they check Jesus.

78
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.710
<v 1>Christ, all my.</v>

79
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.720
<v 0>Crazy. They check your weight fight week when you show up to make sure I was,</v>

80
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.380
uh, I was 1 76 and it was a 45. Oh.

81
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.880
<v 1>Oh my God. Yeah. But you made it, made it. How the did you make that?</v>

82
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.330
<v 0>I don't know. Almost died. I don't. I feel like weigh-ins were kind of blurry.</v>

83
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:05.530
I don't like my memory is gone from weigh-ins I've it's it's not good for you.

84
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.340
<v 1>Do you think it makes sense though, for you to be fighting Conor for the title?</v>

85
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.203
No.

86
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.583
<v 0>I don't think so.</v>

87
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.420
<v 1>Do you think it would, it should be all of era.</v>

88
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.810
<v 0>Connor has been away so long. His last two fights. I want 55. He's lost.</v>

89
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.910
So you can't put them in there for a title fight. Right?

90
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.520
How could you justify doing that? When they got,

91
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.990
when you have guys like Olivera.

92
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.370
<v 1>But if Khabib retires and they say, Hey, this is for all the marbles.</v>

93
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.280
You're not going to say no. What are you going to say?

94
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.570
You're going to say I'm a purist.

95
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.550
<v 0>What are you gonna.</v>

96
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.190
<v 1>Say? I don't know if Dana pulls you aside. He goes, I,</v>

97
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.900
it doesn't have to make sense, but.

98
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.280
<v 0>Make some money. We're fighting for the belt. Yeah. You have.</v>

99
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.300
<v 1>To fight for the belt. Yeah.</v>

100
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.170
<v 0>We'll see what happens, man. I think it's going to be something soon.</v>

101
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.220
Cause we've got to keep them moving.

102
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.540
They're not going to sit forever chasing Khabib and the division has to move on.

103
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.920
<v 1>It is interesting that in the time where that low calf kick is coming to</v>

104
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:02.110
prominence and you know,

105
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:06.040
this is also a time when Connor started moving away from the sport,

106
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.250
took time off, fought boxing, you know,

107
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:12.040
then came back and had the fight with Khabib and then came back and had the

108
00:05:12.041 --> 00:05:16.450
fight with cowboy. The calf kick was never in play in any of his fights.

109
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:20.410
But if you look at him stylistically, and this is one of the things I love DCS,

110
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.240
uh, detail that, uh, that he does on ESPN. It's amazing. But when he broke down,

111
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.900
Connor's heavy weight on the right leg.

112
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.850
He leans in like this all the time.

113
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:34.080
He puts a lot of weight on that right leg when he paused and that south boss

114
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.910
stance. And because you fight south Paul a lot as well,

115
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.930
it just opens up that kick. So big. It's such a big weapon.

116
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.680
<v 0>And sometimes he's like you said, that wide stance as well.</v>

117
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.650
It's just hard to check the kick from that wide stance. Yeah.

118
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.180
<v 1>You know, what's a crazy stance for everything other than calf kicks.</v>

119
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.890
It's a great stance. I mean,

120
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:58.370
he's so good at moving in and covering distance with that stance.

121
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.570
It's very karate, light.

122
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.860
<v 0>Great countering. Like you see karate, bounce back and forth to boom attack. Um,</v>

123
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.530
and he, and he has a hell of a, a left-hand where he, you know,

124
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:09.110
he's knocked out a bunch of guys with it, with that counter who that pool too.

125
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.280
And that's what we,

126
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.920
we worked on a lot that training camp when my boxing coach diet Davis is,

127
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.800
is that pool too. Baiting him into throw the pool to.

128
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.550
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

129
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.580
The one time where it was one of the times you call them several times,

130
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:22.820
but one time we caught him with that counter right hook and you pointed out and

131
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.920
I'll be like, ah, gotcha. Yeah.

132
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.140
<v 0>Yeah. That felt good.</v>

133
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.670
I just felt like I was kind of grabbing the wheel and starting to let him

134
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.560
understand though, this guy has changed. You know,

135
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.880
like this isn't the same fight.

136
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.870
<v 1>D D C also broke down at the end of the first round.</v>

137
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.130
You kind of gently punched him in the stomach. Just gently like, Hey man,

138
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.980
good round, good game. But there was a little,

139
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.520
there's a little gamesmanship going on there. I didn't, I.

140
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.800
<v 0>Didn't do it in the, in the moment. I didn't do it. Like, uh,</v>

141
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.460
like you're thinking.

142
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.470
<v 1>About it. Yeah. It just has just natural. Yeah.</v>

143
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.100
What did you say to him at the end of the first round? You said something.

144
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.340
<v 0>When we were hitting each other with, with, with the shoulders, I was, uh,</v>

145
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.940
having fun asking them that sink. I told them, how'd you like that?

146
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:09.500
Clavicle just messing around. You know, that's a funny how'd you like that?

147
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:10.334
Clavicle.

148
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.710
<v 1>Just messing around with that in life.</v>

149
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.980
It might be the first time a human being has said, how'd you like that?

150
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:19.490
Clavicle a delivered one. I think that's probably got me back better though.

151
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.950
You think all of the sentences that people have said throughout history,

152
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.810
how might that clavicle? Yeah,

153
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.720
there might be like two or three other humans that have ever lived that have

154
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:30.770
said those words together. How did you like that clavicle, right?

155
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.930
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. That's not a, that's not a,</v>

156
00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:34.850
that's not a word or phrase you use often.

157
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.400
<v 1>Very uncommon phrase. How'd you like tech, like the.</v>

158
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:41.930
<v 0>Clavicle man, then he started cracking me with him.</v>

159
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.170
Yeah. And well, he had more pop on his first.

160
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.050
<v 1>Sure. The cowboy fight that was bananas that we was able to do.</v>

161
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.040
That kind of damage.

162
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.990
<v 0>Yep. Broke his nose maybe. Yeah, for.</v>

163
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.200
<v 1>Sure. I mean, he was bleeding out the nose right away. That was nuts.</v>

164
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.090
A lot of people didn't even understand what was happening.

165
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.580
<v 0>I wonder why. Uh, cause when he started hitting me with them,</v>

166
00:07:58.581 --> 00:08:01.220
I just naturally felt like I just put my head on the other side.

167
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.810
<v 1>Yeah. Here it is.</v>

168
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.810
Well, it's a, it's obviously something that he's practiced. Yeah. The,

169
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:14.870
one of the things about this fight is you look like the bigger guy.

170
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.370
<v 0>I, I I'm pretty sure I weighed more than him.</v>

171
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.180
<v 1>Yeah. You looked like it. You looked more muscular. He's.</v>

172
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.470
<v 0>Uh, you know, he's muscular, but his waist is small. It's just built,</v>

173
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.170
just built different. And I just, I probably walk around and have it in him.

174
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.470
<v 1>Do you feel like now after that first part,</v>

175
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:35.410
that you got his number or after the second fight it's uh.

176
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.540
<v 0>It's fighting, man. I don't think you ever really.</v>

177
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.970
<v 1>He'll make adjustments. Yeah.</v>

178
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.890
<v 0>Make adjustments. There'll be a completely different fight.</v>

179
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:43.510
Like the first one in the second was different.

180
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.860
The third one's going to be different as well,

181
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.530
because I'm going to make adjustments as well. I got to switch it up and

182
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.640
keep things fresh and keep him guessing. Yeah.

183
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.520
<v 1>Now ideally, when would you like to rematch?</v>

184
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.280
<v 0>June, July, June, July. Cause I'm still, uh,</v>

185
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:03.690
my wife's birthday is coming up,

186
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.050
so we're going to go somewhere for a couple of days. Like I'm still not. I will,

187
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.090
if, if, if, if I get the call in his time to go to work,

188
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.430
I will lock myself in training camp. But uh, I'm still not right now.

189
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:17.070
Ready to just go back to Florida a month removed from,

190
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.070
from the last fight and then locked down for another 10 weeks or whatever it is.

191
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.290
So we'll see, uh, if they call, I will do it,

192
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:24.060
but I w I'd rather it be a little bit further.

193
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:26.850
Let me enjoy my life back home in Louisiana,

194
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:28.080
before I go right back out to Florida.

195
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.080
<v 1>So if they call you and say, may you will be doing it, but you would.</v>

196
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.080
<v 0>Rather I'll do it anytime. I'll do it.</v>

197
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.700
<v 1>He really shocked if they decided to do it in may.</v>

198
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.420
Just that close after that Kao. I just don't think that's wise.

199
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.030
<v 0>Yeah, it is soon. Yeah. And, and obviously, I mean, an honestly it's not,</v>

200
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:48.900
it's not a lot of time to adjust and, and work on what we need to,

201
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:51.540
what he needs to work on for the calf kick or what I want to switch up.

202
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.120
You know, we're just right back in camp, getting ready to fight.

203
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:58.410
We're not really evolving outside of training camp. For me.

204
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.820
I learned things in training camp.

205
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.890
Cause it's just constant every day under pressure.

206
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.720
But it's the time between camps. Like right now when I'm in the gym, having fun,

207
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:10.470
rolling and doing light kickboxing drills with my friends where I feel like the

208
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:13.110
big gains are made when I'm having fun,

209
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.010
because I'm kind of tunnel vision and training camp I'm showing up. All right,

210
00:10:17.011 --> 00:10:19.890
let's wrestle. All right. I'm not having fun and exploring different things.
