00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.830
<v 2>The perils of becoming famous when you're young are well-known</v>

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.080
right. It's no one is really,

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:14.070
there's a small handful of people that have made it through unscathed.

5
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:15.503
It's a,

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.580
it's a weird way to grow up because everybody else grows up

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.620
trying to prove their worth or trying to find their place

8
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:30.480
in life and trying to, you know, get people to understand who they are.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.760
You grow up where basically most people who run into,

10
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:39.200
you know, who you are before you knew who they are. And they're,

11
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:43.170
they're already like, kind of freaked out that you're there and they'll,

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.020
they'll do anything for ya and they want to see you and they want to see you

13
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:48.540
perform. They just want to see you sing and talk.

14
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:53.280
And it's a very strange way to grow up. Right. What did,

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.960
did you, at any point in time have this feeling like, Hey,

16
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.700
maybe this isn't the best way to grow up?

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.090
<v 1>So I grew up in Texas, Dallas, Texas.</v>

18
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.370
Um, I keep forgetting we're in Texas Dallas. Um, but I,

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.430
I grew up, you know,

20
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.880
I went to public school except for the one year that I homeschooled on Barney

21
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:22.260
and friends and I experienced, um,

22
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.510
bullying pretty bad while I was there.

23
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.310
And so I ended up leaving public school and I went into

24
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:34.290
a really depressive state for a period of time. I didn't,

25
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.900
you know, when you're 12 and you're bullied, that's your social life.

26
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.340
Like your social life is everything to you. And so, um,

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.440
I felt like I didn't have much to look forward to anymore,

28
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:49.620
except for my music and music kind of kept me alive.

29
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:54.510
So it's not that like I ever looked at the industry

30
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.790
as, um,

31
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.850
this kind of weird burden on my teenage years or

32
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.540
whatever. Like, yes, it is weird in hindsight,

33
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:11.490
but I looked at it as it actually kind of saved my life, um,

34
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.710
at times because it gave me something to live for.

35
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:17.250
And I knew that if I stayed in Texas that, um,

36
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.320
I wouldn't make it out alive.

37
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.480
<v 0>The bullying was about, yeah.</v>

38
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.680
<v 1>The bullying was that bad, but.</v>

39
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.550
<v 0>They knew that you had been on television already.</v>

40
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.800
So it was that part of the reason why they were bullying you.

41
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.990
<v 1>So when I asked them, like, why are you guys? So it all started with,</v>

42
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:36.470
like, I wrote a note, you know, you're in sixth, seventh grade,

43
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:39.140
you're passing notes back and forth. And I called someone,

44
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.760
this other girl like called her annoying and said she was being a. Right.

45
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.910
And then that escalated to,

46
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.150
by the end of the day, I,

47
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.880
it was that like scene in the movie where you walk in the lunch room and

48
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.340
everyone just looks at you. Cause the thing was,

49
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:59.260
is like the girls that I wrote that about where the popular girls.

50
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.910
And so it just like anyone who wanted to be popular,

51
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:07.720
took their side and everyone just was like, I dunno.

52
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.370
So I had a concert that weekend on a military base and I went to

53
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.200
like Vegas for the concert or something. And when I came back,

54
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:21.130
it just had increased. And so when I asked them, like,

55
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.490
why are you guys doing this? I wrote a note. We all write notes in school.

56
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.150
We're in seventh grade. That's what we do. And they were just like, well,

57
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.640
you're a and you're fat.

58
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.160
And so I internalized what they were saying.

59
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.230
And that's when my eating disorder developed. And I couldn't, I mean,

60
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.860
I wasn't a. Um, I believe.

61
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.853
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

62
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.400
it is so crazy how children have this instinct to pile

63
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.170
onto people like that though. It's bullying is it's more common than not.

64
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.060
<v 1>Well, and you have to understand is my generation was like the first with social</v>

65
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:02.170
media. So what I was really, um,

66
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.560
dealing with was the cyber bullying of everything. It wasn't.

67
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.850
I had wished that someone had tried to fight me because I'm a fighter.

68
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.530
And so I would've thrown down,

69
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.900
but they were coming at me with words that scarred me emotionally for

70
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:19.540
years to come and ended up, you know,

71
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.110
scarring me for the rest of my life. Um,

72
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.120
and I kept saying to people who didn't understand cyber bullying,

73
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.910
like I wish that someone had just hit me and gotten it over with,

74
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:34.750
because at least I wouldn't have to live with those words that they said to me

75
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.830
for years. And that's what was the hardest part, um,

76
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.100
was the emotional trauma of like, of all of it.

77
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.490
And which made it hard to meet fans my age,

78
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.030
because I had just been bullied three years before by people, my age,

79
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.570
when I was meeting fans, I was excited to meet them.

80
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.610
But at the same time I knew what they were capable of.

81
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.360
So I had this weird like battle in my head every time I'd meet someone,

82
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:01.450
my age of like, I'm so appreciative of you,

83
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.520
but I'm also terrified of what you're capable of.

84
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.541
<v 0>Wow.</v>

85
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:09.250
So you just had a wall up for any young kids that reminded you of the girls who

86
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:10.084
bullied you.

87
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.520
<v 1>Which was my fan base at that time.</v>

88
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.560
And so that was always in my mind and I actually never

89
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:21.340
even told anybody that really, because I didn't think it was important.

90
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:24.610
I also felt guilty for feeling that way towards my fans. Did.

91
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.490
<v 0>You discuss the bullying with anybody at the time? Oh.</v>

92
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.090
<v 1>Yeah. I D I discussed it with my mom. She took it. We went, I mean,</v>

93
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.140
she came to the school and tried to tell them what was happening.

94
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:37.840
And they were like, if it's cyber bullying, we can't do anything about it.

95
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:41.980
It didn't happen on school grounds. So no punishment really took place.

96
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.421
And I mean,

97
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:47.650
they had a suicide petition that they passed around the school and tried to get

98
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:51.970
people to sign it so that I would kill my, like, it, it gets gnarly and,

99
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.230
and girls can be mean middle school girls can be mean.

100
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.950
And so I talked about it a lot.

101
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.890
And then I decided that was really my first taste of activism.

102
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.040
Mark was being an advocate for anti-bullying.

103
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.210
And I remember I like decided to start talking about it.

104
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:13.130
And I felt like I felt some purpose and all of a sudden my career

105
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:16.160
wasn't about my talent anymore. Have you.

106
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.750
<v 0>Ever run into those girls?</v>

107
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.310
<v 1>So I haven't run into them,</v>

108
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:27.080
but I did make a phone call to like the main girl that bullied me

109
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.210
because when I got sober,

110
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.500
a part of the program they teach you to on your ninth step is you make amends.

111
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.300
And when you do your resentments, um, or you,

112
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:41.030
you make a list of resentments, you write down everyone,

113
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:44.030
you've had a resentment against your entire life.

114
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.190
At least this is the way I was brought through the steps and her name was on

115
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:53.150
it. And when they had me go through what was my part, and I was like, well,

116
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:56.660
I put the name down that she was a. So like,

117
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.270
I guess I did play a part in that.

118
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.560
And when I looked at everything, I was like, you know,

119
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.630
I can't look back at that situation and, and say that I was innocent.

120
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.310
So I went to own my part, but a part of the step was calling and making amends.

121
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.380
And so I called her and she was like, oh my gosh,

122
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.760
I can't even believe you remember who I am. And I was like, you ruined my life.

123
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.640
Are you kidding? Me?

124
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.000
And I was so I just like sat there. And I was like, cool.

125
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:35.870
I think this concludes the end of this phone call. I'm sorry.

126
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.430
And who wish you will?

127
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.810
<v 0>What was she, what did you get past that? Did you talk to her? Like.</v>

128
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.730
<v 1>She was so thrown off that I even remembered who she was after</v>

129
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.370
becoming famous and a celebrity that like,

130
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.290
she wasn't interested in talking about what had happened when I was

131
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:55.730
12 or whatever.

132
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.880
<v 0>What does she want to talk about? Like, what's it like to be you.</v>

133
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.100
<v 1>You like, oh my God, I miss you so much. I hope you're well,</v>

134
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:04.934
and I was just like,

135
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.570
God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.

136
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.700
<v 0>It's so strange people that are not famous for some reason.</v>

137
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:20.330
They think that people who are famous or not people, yeah.

138
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.750
You become a famous person. You're not a person it's like,

139
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:26.220
you have like a shield around you. You, you,

140
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.050
you like all your emotional scars or all of your past,

141
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.770
for some reason that doesn't, it doesn't affect you.

142
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.260
You're in a castle somewhere covered in gold, right? Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.630
They think that like, that's probably how she felt when she was talking to you.

144
00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:44.690
Like, how do you remember me? Like, you're in a castle covered in gold.

145
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.800
<v 1>And so I'm hearing this thinking like, I've,</v>

146
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.490
I just got out of treatment for an eating disorder.

147
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.130
Like you don't think, I remember you,

148
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.220
you were the first person to ever call me or not the first,

149
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:04.080
but you were the first mean girl to call me fat. Like,

150
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:07.050
of course I remember you. It was just wild, but you know,

151
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:09.930
you look back at times like that. And everybody, like,

152
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.950
those were my teachers at that time. Like we all have teachers and,

153
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.250
and people. And so even though I,

154
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.390
I used to resent that person for many years.

155
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:23.400
I look at that time in my life and I'm like, well,

156
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.790
I needed to learn those lessons then. And, um, it is what it is. Can't,

157
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.250
can't change the past.

158
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.700
<v 0>It's a painful lesson that hangs with you for that long.</v>

159
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.050
But did you feel a large weight lifted off you after having that conversation

160
00:09:37.051 --> 00:09:37.884
with her?

161
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.890
<v 1>Uh, no. No, no. It actually, it made me more upset because I was like,</v>

162
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.230
how does someone who literally

163
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.000
altered the course of my life? Not that I'm blaming her for my eating disorder,

164
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:58.780
I would have probably developed one anyways because my mother had one.

165
00:09:58.781 --> 00:09:59.770
And so I was,

166
00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.870
I was looking at negative food behaviors and that's all I knew.

167
00:10:04.871 --> 00:10:09.430
And so when someone called me fat, I knew exactly what to do now.

168
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.350
Like I said, I don't blame her for it by, um,

169
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.720
I couldn't believe that she didn't think I remembered who she was after what

170
00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:23.320
she said made me, uh,

171
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.650
decide to stop eating.

172
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.250
<v 0>Yeah, just what I said earlier.</v>

173
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:34.550
I just don't think that someone like her ever thinks that someone like you even

174
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:36.230
has normal feelings. Yeah, totally.

175
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.110
<v 1>And a lot of people still think that about celebrities, like know.</v>
