00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 0>I just was time. This is slightly changed, but it was so it was like,</v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:08.160
do you remember where you were? When the OJ verdict was written?

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.320
I was in high school. I climbed a tree.

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.200
<v 1>Why don't you climb a.</v>

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.480
<v 0>Tree so that people would be like, where were you when the OJ verdict</v>

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.103
in a tree?

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.680
<v 1>I remember I was with my girlfriend at the time and she threw her hands on her</v>

8
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:27.420
face and went, oh no. Oh no. She's kept saying, oh really?

9
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.610
She just went, oh, oh no. Oh.

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.780
<v 0>No. Where are you in LA?</v>

11
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.940
<v 1>Yeah, we were watching it in my apartment.</v>

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.980
We were watching the verdict and w and I was dumbfounded.

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.060
I thought he was going to jail.

14
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.510
Everybody thought he was going to jail and she just, she just kept going, oh,

15
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.970
no. Oh no. Oh.

16
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.880
<v 0>No. I just remember being in high school. I knew.</v>

17
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.500
<v 1>Ron Goldman sister too. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That was real weird.</v>

18
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.010
Yeah. Yeah. I knew his sister. And.

19
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.200
<v 0>So like her, her Ron Goldman's father, and I have no, like, I can't imagine,</v>

20
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.250
I can't even begin to fathom what that whole experience would be for anyone,

21
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.290
but he was like, he felt very, like, he felt like he,

22
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.460
like, he was, again, I say this with all due respect. Like,

23
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:17.310
I don't know what I would have no sense of what that experience is like,

24
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.100
but there are certain people that you're like, oh, you do like being on camera.

25
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:23.340
I know something horrible happened to you, but you did like being on camera.

26
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.200
I mean, I have no idea.

27
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.600
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know either. I mean, w who the knows how you,</v>

28
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.410
I don't know how I would react. Your son was murdered by some superstar. Like,

29
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.050
just think about how crazy that is. Not just murdered,

30
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.730
but murdered by a famous guy. Yeah.

31
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.570
<v 0>Yeah. Who then is like flaunted and got off. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.740
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, man.</v>

33
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.040
It was a part of this weird race thing where it was post Rodney king.

34
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.340
So there was a lot of people that felt like there was some sort of a,

35
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.100
a racist aspect to it that like,

36
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.060
there was a racist cops who got off with Rodney king.

37
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.630
So now it's their chance to get one for black folks.

38
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.660
And I was talking to people about it, you know.

39
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.280
<v 0>It's that Cray. Did you watch the, the D you do watch the OJ, the documentary.</v>

40
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:07.230
And then also there was the FX show.

41
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.090
<v 1>It's one episode of the FX show. And I was like, Cuba, Gooding Jr. nailed it.</v>

42
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.090
He really seemed like OJ in it. It was really good. Yeah.

43
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.580
<v 0>Yeah. But that's all I, the documentary is interesting.</v>

44
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.850
Cause it sets up like LA all like that,

45
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.410
the preceding years leading up post post riots, all that stuff. Like,

46
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.560
and you're like, oh, it does it sort of,

47
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.920
it does like lend itself to be like, oh, this was,

48
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.750
this was a perfect confluence of events that led to this thing of like,

49
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.200
you know, racial, you know, all,

50
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.530
everything that went into the OJ trial, it's nuts. It's crazy.

51
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.410
<v 1>It was a strange, strange time.</v>

52
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.130
It was a strange time because it just seemed like the world was made of

53
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:53.370
something that was way more flexible than I ever thought it was before.

54
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.150
Like I never thought OJ Simpson could be a murderer.

55
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.280
I thought murders were bad people.

56
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.460
And that the people that you thought of that were good people on TV,

57
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:08.020
you would never think of like OJ was always so friendly and

58
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.550
smiling and he would have that big laugh and he's handsome. And.

59
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.270
<v 0>The head injuries to CT. It's like, you're like, I wonder what.</v>

60
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.850
<v 1>Sure how to do with it. 100%, 1000 million percent. In fact,</v>

61
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.000
his doctor said that if the trial were to take place today,

62
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.030
his doctor at the time they would introduce CT. Yeah.

63
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.920
<v 0>Yeah. And you see all those tutes I'm in like the,</v>

64
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.800
the level of violence that there he is.

65
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.930
<v 1>That's right. Police academy.</v>

66
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.910
<v 0>He's funny and naked gun, but it's interesting.</v>

67
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:44.260
You go back and watch that documentary. And it's like, you know, his buddies,

68
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.510
his like his good buddies who stood by him,

69
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.360
his good buddies who stood by him talking about him in high school.

70
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.930
And he's kinda like he was thrown his friends under the bus in high school.

71
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.950
Like the all three of them would be like doing some like in the bathroom,

72
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:02.140
like doing some they're supposed to be in class.

73
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.240
And the principal would come in and the three of them were all together and OJ

74
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:09.640
would just like saddle up next to the principal and be like,

75
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.460
what are we going to do with these two guys? You know what I mean?

76
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:15.970
He was like throwing his buddies under the bus. You're like, oh,

77
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:19.810
he was CTE him up. I don't know what kind of man he would have been like,

78
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.780
whether he would have been so violent or whatever, but he was like piece of.

79
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.620
Plus he kind of felt like he was a piece of. His whole life. Well,

80
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:27.040
how about the.

81
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.840
<v 1>A book if I did it? How crazy? How crazy is that?</v>

82
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.330
That he wrote a book. If I do, I didn't do it.

83
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.350
<v 0>I did it. Did you see the, did you ever see, have you ever seen his prank show</v>

84
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.690

85
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.580
<v 1>Oh yes. That's post.</v>

<v 0>Oh yes. Yes. This was part of that juice. I think thing. Right?</v>

91
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:58.810
It's in that same thing. It's part of it's. It's like, and it's all these young,

92
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.560

<v 1>What does that picture of him with the glasses? That's from one.</v>

95
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.253

He can go to Disneyland. That's here that famous.

00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:18.910
And you did something awful like that.

<v 0>You got to go in disguise.</v>

100
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.240

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.470
<v 0>You think still people, are you still think people are going to bang him?</v>

<v 0>Yeah. I guess so.</v>

<v 1>There's, there's a guy that we had in here. Nick Yarus who, uh, went to jail.</v>

110
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:55.390
He was on death row for 20 years for a crime that 22 years for a crime that he

111
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:58.790
didn't commit. And he said since getting out, he's just in it.

112
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:03.310
He was asking on the podcast with these women to stop sending him emails. Um,

113
00:06:03.311 --> 00:06:06.860
I'm married. I have a good relationship. Like, please leave me alone.

114
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.200
Like stop testing me and like really? Yeah. They just throw that buzzy his way.

115
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.720
Interesting. Yeah. Well Richard Ramirez,

116
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:19.370
the night stalker that guy apparently got all these women were

117
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:23.870
sending him pictures and email or letters actually. Yeah.

118
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.450
And he wound up marrying some woman. Really?

119
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.240
<v 0>Manson's Mary Nancy got married.</v>

120
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.620
<v 1>Yeah. A lot of them get married. Yeah. Real common.</v>

121
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.450

122
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.570
<v 0>Crazy. Yeah. I mean, look I'd OJ.</v>

123
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.690
<v 1>I would too. I'd them with you. We'd high-five each other.</v>

124
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.200
Would you want the front of the bag?

125
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.460
<v 0>I don't. I think I don't want the front. I think.</v>

126
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.330
<v 1>From people more dangerous. If you had a CTE like flashback and pet your dog.</v>

127
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.190
<v 0>Oh, that's true. You can control.</v>

128
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.220
You can control the back a little bit better a little bit. I wonder if, yeah.

129
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.940
I wonder how his teeth did in, in prison. He's out now, right? He's out.

130
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.710
<v 1>Yeah. Which is really weird. That's wild. What is OJ doing these days?</v>

133
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.140
<v 1>Or I think he is Jamie. He's got a good podcast.</v>

134
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.160
<v 0>I've done his podcast.</v>

135
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.130
<v 1>I put on my, um, my Twitter.</v>

136
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.100
Should I interview OJ on my podcast or not?

137
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.610
<v 0>What was, what was the response? Moshe Kasher.</v>

138
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.650
<v 1>Just sent me a text versus like what the?</v>

139
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.510
<v 0>Yeah. I guess that would legitimize it. My guests quit an interview.</v>

140
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.150
<v 1>With that. Legitimize him. I've heard that before.</v>

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.343
So maybe he should just.

157
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.890
<v 0>Well stop drinking. Maybe you should just up a.</v>

158
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.930
<v 1>Sure. He enjoys a martini a day. But what does that, if you, what,</v>

159
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:42.050
what is the blood alcohol level? They send you back to prison.

160
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:46.610
How crazy is that? Like free, but if you have three beers, you're in a cage.

161
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.480
<v 0>Yeah. She's on parole, I guess. Right? He was on the alley geesh or the thing.</v>

162
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.570
<v 1>Cohen dead. He's at the very, very end of it.</v>

163
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.590
He was trying to talk him into saying he did it.

164
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.980
<v 0>Yeah. I think he was,</v>

165
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.360
I think OJ was more aware of what was going on than a bunch of the other people

166
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:04.194
on that show.

167
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.550
<v 1>Well, I mean,</v>

168
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:09.030
you've got to think he's probably a hyper paranoid that someone's with him.

169
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.730
<v 0>I think everybody's home since always</v>

170
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.653
[inaudible].

171
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.520
<v 1>Yeah. More young Posey for OJ. OJ wanted to meet me.</v>

172
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:25.380
My name is Nicole. He said, that's his, my favorite name. Oh my God.

173
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.220
That is insane. But you know what?

174
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.120
I bet he gets a lot of those vacant, odd young ladies to accept his.

175
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.050
<v 0>I've tried. I have trouble believing that maybe. I mean, why? Because you think,</v>

176
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.740
do you ever, do you ever ironically somebody.

177
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.900
<v 1>I think some gals would do that. Right? Ironically, a murderer.</v>

178
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.730
<v 0>I guess. I can't imagine. I maybe I can't imagine.</v>

179
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.810
I don't know what the social, like the currency of that is.

180
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.540
<v 1>Scott Peterson was sent to death row in California,</v>

181
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:00.180
San Quentin prison for murdering his wife and their unborn child.

182
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:04.890
Dozens of women phoned asking for his address with one teenager wasting no

183
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:07.350
time and offering to marry him. Wow. Yeah,

184
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:10.320
there's a that's I think this is what I think.

185
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:15.540
I think there is some sort of ancient DNA that

186
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:20.040
people have that attracts them to murders and conquerors because those are the

187
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:23.400
people that survived. And the, your there's an,

188
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.510
some sort of a strange inclination for some women,

189
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:29.700
obviously ones that are not thinking clearly,

190
00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:34.320
but for some women to want the sperm and the genetics of a

191
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:38.670
murderer, because that's the type of, if you add a, uh, a murderous,

192
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.160
brave conqueror for a child,

193
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.780
that child would survive like that DNA.

194
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:47.250
<v 0>I mean, I get some sense of survival.</v>

195
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.920
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, and the times of barbaric.</v>

196
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.040
<v 0>Sure, sure. You want it to be with someone? Yeah.</v>

197
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.720
<v 1>That's what I think it is like a killer.</v>

198
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.420
<v 0>You don't feel that much like the caveman comedian.</v>

199
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.480
<v 1>Well, I think that if a male feminist goes to jail,</v>

200
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:05.370
they get zero requests for marriage. They get none. But, uh.

201
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.450
<v 0>He.</v>

202
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.110
<v 1>Thinks, yeah. If some male feminist like gets arrested and goes to jail,</v>

203
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.670
it's a wrap. Yeah.

204
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.103
<v 0>But if you're a murder.</v>

205
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.870
<v 1>But a few murder, you probably get a lot because women,</v>

206
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.120
there's a reason why men become, I mean, there's,

207
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.930
there's men who believe in equality and want women's rights.

208
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.520
And then there's men who are really Weasley and what they're doing is they just,

209
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.640
they're being young and posturing.

210
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.450
And I think those guys have they go to jail crickets.

211
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.960
<v 0>Well, either way they're in, they're in jail. So they're not,</v>

212
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.850
they're probably not, I don't know how it works. I don't know.

213
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.460
<v 1>Some places you can get conjugal visits. Yeah.</v>

214
00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.700
But I think it's dependent upon the.
