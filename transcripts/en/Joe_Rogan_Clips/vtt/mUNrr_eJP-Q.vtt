WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. Right.</v>

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.050
<v 1>Well, you shot cancer, saw stem cells into your Dick.</v>

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.210
<v 2>So men's health magazine just had me write this article called new year new deck</v>

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.540
where they helped me get them. It's got a, is,

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.500
is the issue with Marky mark Wahlberg on, on, on the cover? How appropriate?

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.920
Yeah, like how to make a small Dick bigger. Right. And I put Marky mark on the,

7
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.530
on the cover and now he can, he can beat me with his,

8
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.100
with his four foot tall fisticuffs. Uh, anyways though.

9
00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:33.050
So they had me go around doing everything that I could do to enhance sexual

10
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:36.560
performance or increase the size of your deck or increase blood flow or increase

11
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:37.880
orgasm quality, or, you know,

12
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.480
they just want to find out what everything from like fricking gas station,

13
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:45.620
Dick pills, to which, by the way, those things do not have in them,

14
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.620
what they say they have in them. What do you think? So they S you know,

15
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:52.880
they say like Epimedium and Euro coma, long Jack and.

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.340
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.490
<v 2>Yeah. It's basically for concealed Benefil right. The actual ingredients,</v>

18
00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:02.630
Cialis or Viagra, and then, uh, uh, Phaedra and copious amounts of caffeine.

19
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.210
So I would take these things and just literally feel like my head was gonna

20
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:08.120
explode. I mean, it's, it's like drinking 10 cups of coffee.

21
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.811
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

22
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:13.070
We have a friend of ours who predicted accurately that Jon Jones was taking

23
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:15.020
those things when he hot. Cause he was like,

24
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.020
those things have everything in them. And he's like, John Jones does Coke.

25
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.910
He goes, I guarantee you he's taking Dick pills.

26
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.350
<v 2>To read. Like, cause it's all like the, you know, like it's like Rena Chinese,</v>

27
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.190
fortune cookie, right.

28
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:30.020
It's like maximum potency Vigo Gora and everything's spelled wrong. Uh,

29
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.120
but the, uh, so they had me doing that.

30
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.050
<v 1>They did analysis of the ingredients. Did you actually get it tested? No.</v>

31
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.350
<v 2>No. We, we went to all these labs. They wouldn't let us actually tests,</v>

32
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.300
but apparently the FDA has tested them. And if you go to the fda.gov website,

33
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:47.870
they have like these, these warnings out about the actual grade.

34
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.670
So we took the five that they had warnings about and tested them and they,

35
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:53.840
um, yeah, you don't feel well,

36
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.250
you feel like your head's gonna explode your hands,

37
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:57.620
get all cold and clammy and so on and say, I don't know why,

38
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:01.610
but they say to take them in the morning. Right. Which doesn't to me make sense,

39
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.790
but you take them in the morning. So you just feel completely screwed up.

40
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.330
Like the whole morning. It's like, you're just mainlining coffee.

41
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.490
So they did that. They did. Um,

42
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.460
have you heard of this like acoustic sound wave therapy for your Dick?

43
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.643
<v 3>I'm serious.</v>

44
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.510
<v 1>You're going to answer this. This is a clinic in Florida.</v>

45
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.220
<v 2>It's called GAINSWave and you go down, there you go down there. And uh,</v>

46
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.580
and I walk in and the first thing they do is they hand me this like syringe full

47
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.790
of numbing cream. And I'm supposed to just like put it everywhere. And so I,

48
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.970
I smeared it, you know, my balls, my, like I just went everywhere.

49
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.370
Cause I didn't really know what they were, what they were going to do.

50
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.300
And I wanted, I wanted all, all shields activated to go into this thing.

51
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.740
So I walked into the room and, and my all numb.

52
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.620
They had me lay down and so my legs are splayed. I'm on this exam room table.

53
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.000
And this gal comes in and she's got like this giant wan attached to a machine

54
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.590
and they do this for women too, by the way,

55
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.900
they put like a condom on the end of it. And,

56
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.550
and she just basically goes to town for like 20 minutes, like a jackhammer.

57
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.280
I was like, like everywhere.

58
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.570
<v 1>20 Minutes, supposedly. Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.990
<v 2>It's supposedly it breaks open old blood vessels and builds new blood vessels.</v>

60
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.270
And once the numbing cream wears off, you're supposed to,

61
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:16.200
to perform a lot better. And then they combine this,

62
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.290
you know how we were talking about like with your shoulder, if you inject it,

63
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:22.110
you should do like electro STAM or vibration or something to,

64
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.190
to get the injection deeper into the tissue. Same thing, same thing with this,

65
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:27.210
they do the PRP.

66
00:03:27.211 --> 00:03:30.450
So they do PRP into your deck and then they follow it up and you get,

67
00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:31.380
you get a nerve block.

68
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.840
<v 1>First I act, I thought.</v>

69
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.810
<v 2>I don't know why I thought they put the needle just like right in the pee hole,</v>

70
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.440
which to me made sense. But it doesn't really, I mean,

71
00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:41.460
you want it in the actual tip.

72
00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:45.810
So they actually go like up where the Dick attaches, like the tissue at the top,

73
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.500
they do two nerve blocks on either side. And then the PRP.

74
00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.140
And later on like a couple months later, they had me do stem cells.

75
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.170
I actually extracted like four months later from my back.

76
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:59.170
And we did a stem cell injection, but this acoustic sound wave therapy, uh,

77
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.050
with the PRP, like it wears off. And you literally just like get all the time,

78
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.210
like, like all night long.

79
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.440
<v 1>So the acoustic sound therapy supposed to be breaking up blood.</v>

80
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.630
<v 2>Vessel breaks, open old dark.</v>

81
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.170
<v 1>Vessels.</v>

82
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.030
Jamie founded gains wave procedure breaks up plaque formation in blood vessels

83
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:20.610
and stimulates the growth of new blood vessels in the penis.

84
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.770
<v 2>Intensity, extra corporeal shockwave therapy. That's going to sell a lot of,</v>

85
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.850
uh, of procedures. Okay.

86
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.570
<v 1>The drawing and the after, before your veins are up.</v>

87
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.800
<v 2>Yeah. Before it looks like a, like an old hunched over man,</v>

88
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.673
then all of a sudden.

89
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.400
<v 1>Vigor, it looks like a bodybuilding scene.</v>

90
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.260
<v 2>Yeah. I used to do bodybuilding.</v>

91
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.230
<v 1>So is that horrible sport, do you think it's real?</v>

92
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:44.760
Do you think that's really doing something?

93
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.380
<v 2>It worked for me. It worked for me in the, um, so yeah, the,</v>

94
00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:52.470
the gas station, Dick pills to do the acoustic sound wave therapy, but.

95
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.570
<v 1>The therapy injections.</v>

96
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.960
<v 2>They had me do. Like the, uh, no stem cells were the best stem cells,</v>

97
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.450
stem cells. But that mean that not everybody's going to be able to do that,

98
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.090
but that was the best bar. None like they,

99
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.330
so I went down to Florida and again, Florida,

100
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.850
I don't know what I think is because all the old people live in Philly.

101
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.630
<v 1>Florida, just crazy Dell, all the people.</v>

102
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.090
<v 2>Like hunched over the steering most are, but all the guys have great.</v>

103
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.223
They can't drive.

104
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.620
They have their blinker on for like two miles before they turn them,

105
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.800
but their are, are primed. So the, um,

106
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.910
the stem cell thing was that the U S stem cell clinic in Florida.

107
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.930
And I went in there and they extract all the fat for me.

108
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:35.580
They took the fat out of my back. And what they do is they, they have,

109
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.460
um, it's called an enzymatic process where they use something that

110
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:44.490
breaks down the collagen in the fat.

111
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.390
And then they have the stem cells that get separated from the fat.

112
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.500
And apparently it's very, very high in these angiogenic, like,

113
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.190
like vascular vessel building, uh, compounds.

114
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.080
And so then you get that, re-inject it it's high in the, um, mesenchymal, the,

115
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:03.020
the MSC, the MSC cells, which,

116
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:06.290
which are supposedly the very good ones to inject in.

117
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.910
So I injected those, um, or I had a, a doctorate Spokane.

118
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:14.930
So they shipped him to Spokane on ice and they show up at my house at like 7:00

119
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.820
AM. Right. Cause you gotta get them delivered same day.

120
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.060
And then I had my appointment at the doctor at 9:00 AM and I went to the doctor

121
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.730
and you know, very, it was like de Javu from Florida where like,

122
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.240
I go and do the, do the numbing. No, no, no. You're going to do this.

123
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.760
<v 1>Oh yeah. It was kind of friends with the doctor. Yeah. Yeah. There's a picture.</v>

124
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.350
<v 2>I think there's a picture of him in the Meg.</v>

125
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.570
Cause they put all sorts of crazy pictures in the magazine because they had me

126
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:36.240
doing like infrared Latin, my balls.

127
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.360
And I have like this big thing called the juve light that they had me standing

128
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:44.650
in front of every day. Like Jack, my light I'll tell you about the stem cells.

129
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.470
This is crazy. Um, so the, uh, the stem cells,

130
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:54.670
I went to this doctor in Spokane and he injected these,

131
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.680
these stem cells from my fat after they'd grown for like several in this

132
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:02.950
case, I think they were down there for like eight weeks. But I mean, they,

133
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.720
they can do same day injections, but for me,

134
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:07.390
I didn't have enough fat cause for me it was right in the middle of,

135
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.490
I raced professionally in obstacle course racing.

136
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:12.130
So I'm just like lean as hell as I go in there. So they could,

137
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.240
they could barely get enough fat.

138
00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:15.040
So they had to grow them for a longer period of time.

139
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.640
A lot of times they can inject same day. So I went into Spokane, uh,

140
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.280
at this clinic and Spokane, Lynn, new integrative clinic.

141
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.830
It's like this osteopathic medical clinic with all these, you know,

142
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.050
nice receptionist when you walk in the door and this, this, this doctor who, uh,

143
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.920
he's done stem cell injections before,

144
00:07:29.921 --> 00:07:31.810
but he never actually injected them into someone's Dick.

145
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.490
So I was kind of like the Guinea pig. So.

146
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.370
<v 1>Do you have to explain to him what areas you're supposed to? He.</v>

147
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.111
<v 2>Researched it.</v>

148
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:41.680
And I think he actually talked to the folks at the stem cell clinic beforehand

149
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.260
to make sure that they were on that, on the same page. Okay.

150
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:45.640
I'm gonna fly all the way back down to Florida.

151
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.100
That's super inconvenient and it's just a deck. Right.

152
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.510
<v 1>Don't make more someday. They're growing kidneys. You're essential.</v>

153
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.030
<v 2>Though. They'll grow someday. So, um,</v>

154
00:07:55.090 --> 00:08:00.070
so I got injected and that was um, uh,

155
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:00.611
first of all,

156
00:08:00.611 --> 00:08:03.880
it looked like it got run over by a semi-truck for like two days it was like all

157
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:07.480
black and blue or the injection service was yeah, yeah.

158
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.700
<v 1>Yeah. I'd be super nervous. Like what did we got infected?</v>

159
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.850
It could have gotten infected. Oh, what'd you got mercy.

160
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.320
<v 2>The cancer I've had Marsa and I would not wish Murcia on your Dick,</v>

161
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.760
on anyone mercy, a triathlon. I got it.

162
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.760
This was at the, at the wildflower triathlon, like coming back,

163
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.190
my flight got delayed and I was covered all these cars,

164
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:31.030
like an off-road triathlon. And I had all these scrapes and wounds. And I think,

165
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.030
I think my layover was in Vegas. I don't remember where,

166
00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:35.200
but I had to check into a hotel flight,

167
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:37.870
got delayed and I slept in this hotel room that I swear,

168
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.110
like there must've been something on the bed. Cause within a few days,

169
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.220
like it was all, you know,

170
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:44.560
it gets all nasty and caky and then it was eating a whole,

171
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.130
I wrote a whole blog post about this on my website. And you can see,

172
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.580
I need to see this pull up the hole in the back of my leg. It's nasty.

173
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:52.840
Marcy scares the out of him. Just,

174
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:55.950
just search for like Ben Greenfield staff and, and you'll see the pictures,

175
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.770
but it was eating a hole in the back of my leg and my,

176
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.480
my kids roll now once a week. And I buy on, I get the defense soap from on it.

177
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:06.060
And as soon as they come, as soon as they come back in the door, I,

178
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.500
I have them go into the shower.

179
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.590
<v 1>Upstairs and it's done. Yeah.</v>

180
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.860
They had a bunch of different wipes and stuff for people that train in a place

181
00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:17.240
that doesn't have a shower. Yeah. You gotta be careful that a.

182
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:18.650
<v 2>Theme use essential oil.</v>

183
00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.460
Like it's like going to like a whole bunch of companies make this version of

184
00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:23.690
essential oil thieves.

185
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:27.740
It's like clove and roads named after these thieves who apparently never yet

186
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:32.240
clove cinnamon eucalyptus, which is really good for staff and Roseman.

187
00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:33.051
It's actually named it.

188
00:09:33.051 --> 00:09:36.710
There's like this story of like these four thieves that apparently traveled

189
00:09:36.711 --> 00:09:40.250
around the world and they would Rob Holmes and, and,

190
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.590
and they never got sick.

191
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.960
<v 1>Like that's basically the story. I'm sure.</v>

192
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.300
<v 2>This was, this was some board table at a,</v>

193
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:49.490
at a multi-level marketing essential oils company.

194
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.020
Somebody came up with this story or it could be true. I don't know. But the, um,

195
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.380
yeah, the, the stem cells into the Dick. That, that was an interesting one,

196
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:02.030
but it did. Um, I think from what I can tell,

197
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.590
looking in the mirror, it got bigger. I'm pretty sure how much, so half inch,

198
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.530
oh, like maybe that much lighter, like enough to tell.

199
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:13.910
And my erections got bigger and my orgasms got a lot better for how long they

200
00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:14.840
they're still like that.

201
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.240
<v 1>Still. Yeah. So I think the stem cells.</v>

202
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.080
<v 2>Kind of like stick with you. Um, well, last week I got them.</v>

203
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:25.030
I told you I'm training for the RKC kettlebell cert. And I was doing the,

204
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.640
the a hundred reps in five minutes, snatch test with a,

205
00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:32.000
with a one and a half food. And I felt something just go.

206
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.770
I was at 84 reps and I felt something go in my back and I got stem cells

207
00:10:36.771 --> 00:10:41.200
injected all up and down my QL, my multifidus, my rector spinae into my solo.

208
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.080
But then they also sent them to my, to my house.

209
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.000
And I did that same fat cell,

210
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.810
the stuff that's rich in the mesenchymal stem cells into the bloodstream.

211
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.150
So I did a push Ivy into the bloodstream.

212
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:57.500
That's the one that you would have to go out of the country to do.

213
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.800
Normally you're not supposed to do that. Like that's tech,

214
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.040
it's technically not legal for someone to inject you with your own stem cells

215
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:05.000
into your bloodstream.

216
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.570
But if you get your stem cells extracted and they're stored and they send them

217
00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:12.320
to you, you can technically inject them. If you do it yourself, or you're like,

218
00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:13.850
have a friend who's a nurse or whatever.

219
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.630
And you it's literally just like a push Ivy is like 30 seconds. We,

220
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:20.480
we caught it on video for a men's health films.

221
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.310
So they'll publish a video at some point,

222
00:11:22.311 --> 00:11:24.830
but I was super nervous cause it's like a few thousand dollars worth of stem

223
00:11:24.831 --> 00:11:26.220
cells that, you know, I'm,

224
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:29.020
I'm trying to hit the vein and make sure that they go in the right way and

225
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.460
inject. It's a very, very small amount. Well.

226
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.460
<v 1>You had to be the most nervous getting them shot into your Dick though. No.</v>

227
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.740
<v 2>I was kind of nervous. Yeah, yeah.</v>

228
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:39.800
<v 1>Yeah. Oh me like super experimental it.</v>

229
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.560
I do a lot of that kind.

230
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.380
<v 2>Of my shtick. Right? Like I do a lot of immersive journalism,</v>

231
00:11:45.381 --> 00:11:49.310
a lot of self experimentation, a lot of, a lot of Guinea pig type stuff. Uh,

232
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:52.310
and I'm, I'm not dead yet. And I have my deck, so oh, you look.

233
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.240
<v 3>Great. I'm happy. Yeah. Thank you. Look very healthy. I'm 22.</v>

234
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.980
<v 1>Um, actually, oh yeah. That's is that yeah. Is that that's.</v>

235
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.020
<v 2>One of them. That is, yeah. That's an image for my website.</v>

236
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:04.780
That's not as deep as it got. I don't think that's the worst photo.

237
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.530
<v 0>The worst one I've ever seen Kevin ramble to stuff it with iodine.</v>

238
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.610
Like they have you.

239
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.660
<v 2>Had them before? No,</v>

240
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.470
they have like these long iodine strips when you get the Murcia and it's like,

241
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:17.500
it's, flesh-eating bacteria. That's me too.

242
00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:22.270
And they stuffed see that hole in the middle. They stuff like an iodine.

243
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.550
It's like a stick in there, like a strip that has,

244
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.580
but they literally stuff it in there and you can feel it. You got,

245
00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:29.620
you were telling me you got dry needling done. And you know,

246
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:33.010
like that weird pressure. It's not like pain,

247
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:37.360
but it's like a weird pressure from dry needling. This is like that except pain,

248
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.900
right? Like it's both the pain and the PR it was horrible. Horrible. Like.

249
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.760
<v 1>Yeah. I've had some falls back, doc,</v>

250
00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:44.980
my staff in their leg where they have like a,

251
00:12:44.981 --> 00:12:47.220
a small golf ball sized hole in their leg.

252
00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:49.980
And they literally had a packet full of that kind of gauze.

253
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.100
<v 2>I don't like how you say it. A small golf, golf balls, a big hole.</v>

254
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.150
<v 1>For the back of the leg.</v>

255
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.380
It's like smaller than a golf ball to go large marble any hole in.

256
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.180
<v 2>The back of the leg, in my opinion is too big.</v>

257
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:05.340
<v 1>Kevin Randleman. See if he could find Kevin random and staff, he had open holes.</v>

258
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.480
We could see his muscle structure under his armpit. It was horrific. Gosh,

259
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.350
he never really recovered. He was dying. He died.

260
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.950
He died young from that. Who knows what he died from, but look at the whole,

261
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.830
I think I still have it. Oh my gosh. Yeah.

262
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.490
That's his muscle tissue that's carrying around the body part is that's his

263
00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:28.110
underarm. Yeah. Look at that. Oh my goodness. Yeah. That's how bad it was.

264
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.920
That looks like he got shot. Does. Yeah, he was rotting away.

265
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.090
And I don't know if he didn't treat it quickly enough or I don't know if it was

266
00:13:36.091 --> 00:13:40.350
just really aggressive, but it's a real common thing in gyms.

267
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.660
<v 2>And then once you get it, it stays with you.</v>

268
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.850
<v 1>Like it stays in your bloodstream. Like I still.</v>

269
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:45.001
<v 2>Like,</v>

270
00:13:45.001 --> 00:13:49.080
I have an essential oil diffuser on my desk and I put thieves in every day and I

271
00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:52.500
just diffuse essential oils while I'm working into the air. Yeah.

272
00:13:52.501 --> 00:13:55.590
It's like a nebulizing essential oil diffuser. And I didn't just,

273
00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:58.890
just to play it safe. Right. I just want to be breathing that in during the day,

274
00:13:58.891 --> 00:14:00.840
just in case. that's. Um,

275
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.730
and that's the other thing is I stand in front of this light,

276
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.560
this infrared light, and this is that it's a decline.

277
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.990
It's called a juve. And um, so it they've,

278
00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:16.110
they've done these studies on testicular and sperm production and they found

279
00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:17.190
that there's a wavelength,

280
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.700
that's like 600 to 800 nanometers wavelength of light.

281
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.600
That if you expose the testicles to that for five to 20 minutes a day,

282
00:14:24.601 --> 00:14:27.120
it's based on this concept of photo biomodulation.

283
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:32.610
So I originally got into this whole photo biomodulation thing when this company,

284
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.970
cause I,

285
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.300
cause I blog and people just send me these weird things to my doorstep to try.

286
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.310
And they sent me this like nasal probe that you put up your nose and it's got

287
00:14:41.311 --> 00:14:44.400
like a helmet on it. You could, you could look it up. Jamie, if you want,

288
00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:45.800
it's called a violet.

289
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:51.000
And it produces this light that supposedly activates a part,

290
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.050
your motto. So you have like your electron transport chain in your mitochondria.

291
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.960
And there's a part of that called the cytochrome C oxidase.

292
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.850
And it apparently activates more activity in the cytochrome C oxidase.

293
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.740
You produce more ATP in this case, in neural tissue.

294
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.980
Cause you have it on your head and they were using this in dementia and in

295
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:09.380
Alzheimer's patients. But it turns out it's almost like a,

296
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.850
like a neutral pick for you, right? Yes. That's me at my desk. Whoa.

297
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.150
Back when I was back when I was a young Chinese woman or to my desk.

298
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:18.580
<v 1>Um, up your nose on your head.</v>

299
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.010
<v 2>I like how that guy is just like looking pensively off.</v>

300
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.010
<v 1>His cross, read a book and she's reading a book. She likes reading Twilight.</v>

301
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:24.850
So that's what I originally.

302
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:25.061
<v 2>Did.</v>

303
00:15:25.061 --> 00:15:28.540
They sent me just the nose one and I felt shorted because they had like the full

304
00:15:28.541 --> 00:15:28.691
head.

305
00:15:28.691 --> 00:15:33.670
So ask them for the full head one and weird and you can feel it like Holton

306
00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:37.570
and uh, and, uh, what's the, um, it was, I think it was MPR.

307
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.910
It was either radio lab or um, it's the other science one.

308
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.250
I think it might be Radiolab. They did a study on that or a,

309
00:15:45.251 --> 00:15:48.130
or a story on like this 10 to 40 Hertz frequency.

310
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.640
That's tDCS. Oh nine volts. Transdermal stimulation are those two,

311
00:15:54.641 --> 00:15:58.450
the trans direct cranial stimulation that halo device that you wear before

312
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.313
workout.

313
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.350
<v 1>No, yeah. One at a time, one at a time.</v>

314
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.170
<v 2>So this photo biomodulation, I'm putting this thing, you know,</v>

315
00:16:05.171 --> 00:16:09.700
the probe in my ear and you're not even supposed to use it too much because it

316
00:16:09.701 --> 00:16:13.600
produces so much ATP that if you amp up cellular activity in neural tissue too

317
00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:16.060
much, you produce too many reactive oxygen species.

318
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.210
Like that's a by-product of cellular metabolism. It's just like,

319
00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:22.210
if you eat too much, you produce a lot of by-product of making energy.

320
00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:24.940
And that's why it's one of the reasons why fasting is good for you.

321
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.090
Like it cleans up the system and you don't make as many free radicals.

322
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.130
The same reason, like ketosis is good for you, right?

323
00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:33.160
You're not burning as much glucose. You don't produce as many free radicals,

324
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.630
same concept with this.

325
00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:37.120
You don't want to use it all the time because you get too much activity.

326
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.600
You produce too many free radicals or too many reactive oxygen species,

327
00:16:40.601 --> 00:16:42.460
but every other day use it.

328
00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:45.580
<v 1>New year, new year, new Dick. How often did you use it?</v>

329
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.910
<v 2>Well, this is from my head and this was like a couple of years.</v>

330
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.820
This was a couple of years and it was like a cup of coffee for my brain.

331
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:52.960
Like every time I'd wake up,

332
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.020
I'd put this thing out while I'm working at my desk. So then, um,

333
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.900
this company that makes these lights that are very similar,

334
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:03.340
activate cytochrome C oxidase activates a release of nitric

335
00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:07.360
oxide. But if you do it on your testicles specifically,

336
00:17:07.361 --> 00:17:09.850
the cell that it works on is the late excels and the testes,

337
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:11.680
which are responsible for producing testosterone.

338
00:17:11.681 --> 00:17:14.260
So you're basically stimulating the Leydig cells in the testes,

339
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.970
the same way that you'd stimulate,

340
00:17:15.971 --> 00:17:18.010
like neural tissue using this one for your head.

341
00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.170
So I'd had success with the thing for my head.

342
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.570
So I tried this one for the balls and the Dick.

343
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.870
And what I did was I would just Jack my pants down for five to 20 minutes a day.

344
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.540
Yeah. I'm diffusing my essential oils that I got a thing on my head. And, um,

345
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.960
and it works like you actually get more blood flow. I mean, I,

346
00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.890
I didn't do a control study just pulling my pants down and standing there for 20

347
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.380
minutes without the light on. I should,

348
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.110
I should do that at some point because maybe it's just like the whole, you know,

349
00:17:44.111 --> 00:17:44.590
it's like,

350
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.910
supposedly go in combat style is supposed to be good for your deck to combat.

351
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.120
So there's you that's me balls out.

352
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.390
I'm standing on the stand on my wobble board. I got my ball light and um,

353
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.640
that's actually not my office.

354
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:03.120
I was at one of my friend's houses cause he had one and uh, anyways, uh,

355
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.850
and I'm obviously I'm not naked, but normally I would, I would,

356
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.220
I would be nude and uh, yeah,

357
00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.490
you just shine malls and you just basically nuke your balls. Yeah.

358
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.050
And it's like a, it's like a warm Teddy bear, increased vascularity,

359
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.630
better size, better orgasms. I mean like, like all this stuff seemed to have.

360
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:18.840
Uh.

361
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.470
<v 1>So all this stuff seems to make your day had some kind of had some kind of an</v>

362
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:22.830
effect.

363
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:27.330
<v 2>Yeah. So, um, the PRP injections, acoustic sound wave therapy, stem cells,</v>

364
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:29.760
the infrared light, a gas station, Dick pills.

365
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.110
And that's the one I would not repeat.

366
00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:39.050
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
