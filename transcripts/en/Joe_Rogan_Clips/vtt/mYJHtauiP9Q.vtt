00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.450
the ozone layer is an interesting subject that you cover because that doesn't

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.440
get discussed anymore,

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.000
but I've been Australia and you go outside and you burst into flames.

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.460
There's everywhere you go to Australia.

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.370
There's these billboards for skin cancer. It's really, it was released.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
It was the last time I was there, which was over 10 years ago,

8
00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.670
but it's really strange. Wow.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.440
There's these billboards everywhere that show tumors and

10
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.340
show, you know,

11
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.810
people that have skin cancer and talk to you about the damages and the dangers

12
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:36.240
of sun. Wow. Yeah. Well,

13
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.030
they have a giant hole like Australia.

14
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.230
<v 1>They're close enough to the ozone hole or partially under parts of it,</v>

15
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.760
I suppose.

16
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.790
<v 2>So. Yeah, exactly.</v>

17
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.793
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it's,</v>

18
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.450
it is amazing how that story does seem to have been

19
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:58.160
forgotten both the threat and the fact of, of the success.

20
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.880
I mean, we caused this huge problem. Uh,

21
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.660
we discovered this huge problem, which we needed. I mean,

22
00:01:05.661 --> 00:01:09.380
that was kind of serendipitous. Um, and yes,

23
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:12.770
the industry denied it and this kind of came in two chapters first.

24
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:17.240
It was the aerosol industry saying this is an attack on free enterprise.

25
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:21.260
Probably the KGB is behind it. I mean, what else did they say? There was one,

26
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.740
uh, aerosol company, president Yahoo suspected. It was the KGB, but,

27
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.940
but many industry leaders were talking about this being as a, you know,

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.900
an anticapitalist crusade. And, and partly because this was the early seventies.

29
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.630
So they had already faced all of these, you know,

30
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:37.610
demanding environmentalist saying,

31
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:40.700
take the lead out of the gasoline and do all kinds of other things.

32
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.080
And so they were starting to feel like attacked on all sides and, um,

33
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.110
and eventually, you know, so there was some denial there,

34
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:51.710
mostly political eventually that got handled. Well,

35
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.070
I shouldn't say eventually it got handled relatively quickly because actually

36
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
it's like only 1976 when they said, okay,

37
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.650
we're getting this stuff out of the hairspray, out of the deodorant.

38
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.240
We don't need this in spray cans.

39
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.050
What was it that was in the spray chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs,

40
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:10.880
which were invented ironically by the same guy who

41
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:14.870
invented, led a gasoline at GM. He invented both of.

42
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.090
<v 3>These chemicals and.</v>

43
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.120
<v 1>His name was Thomas Midgley. Um, yeah.</v>

44
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.340
And he left quite a mark on the world, but, but here's the thing. I mean, I,

45
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:27.320
I blame him for putting lead in gasoline. That was terrible,

46
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.090
but inventing CFCs was actually done because it was replacing a,

47
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.860
the poisonous gases that were then in refrigerators and they would sometimes

48
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:37.850
leak and kill people.

49
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.890
So people were just transitioning now from iceboxes to fridges and,

50
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.350
and so they needed a non-toxic gas to put in there.

51
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:48.470
So he came up with this and it was non-toxic. And so, you know,

52
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:52.520
at the time nobody really even knew much about the ozone layer and they

53
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:55.190
certainly didn't know CFCs were going to wreck it. So it was a much,

54
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.760
much less obvious risk. Um, and,

55
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:01.600
and then it wasn't until the seventies then scientists who,

56
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.450
who were just sort of curious, put this altogether and realized, oh,

57
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.860
we are wrecking the ozone layer. Uh, and by 76, I think it was 76.

58
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.390
Um, the Ford administration said, okay, we're getting it out of the cans.

59
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.520
He got a couple of years. And this industry,

60
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:19.990
the aerosol industry who had been screaming and yelling about anti-capitalists

61
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.740
said, okay, I mean, it wasn't, it was not that big a deal.

62
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:26.050
It was easy for them to do. And then,

63
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.930
then I guess we were in the Carter administration and they were going to start

64
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:33.070
looking at the harder problem of how do you replace CFCs in refrigerators and

65
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.250
air conditioners. And they were putting up a plan for that,

66
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.740
but then Reagan got elected and then,

67
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:43.600
and the concerns of the sixties and seventies about how do we protect the

68
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:47.680
environment were replaced by concerns about how do we

69
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.980
avoid environmental regulations? Because they were,

70
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.320
they felt it was hurting business.

71
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.180
And so they basically dropped the ball on this completely. And the,

72
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.550
and the corporations like DuPont, which was the top CFC maker.

73
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.940
They had been working on substitutes, but once the,

74
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.810
the pressure of regulation went away, they just dropped it.

75
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:09.760
They didn't keep looking for substitutes,

76
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.360
even though they had the same science telling them that there was a risk here,

77
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:15.640
but they decided, oh, we're not going to have to worry about it.

78
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.010
Then eventually the ozone hole is discovered and scientists are shocked because

79
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.960
the models had predicted, you know,

80
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.000
a gradual reduction in ozone and suddenly you've got this deep reduction in

81
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.780
ozone and it covers like, you know, this huge space over Antarctica.

82
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.190
One of the reasons NASA had not discovered this with their satellites was that

83
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:40.690
they were expecting so much less that they had apparently, uh,

84
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.270
programmed the computers to read huge readings like this as

85
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.130
instrument error. So it was actually the British who discovered this.

86
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.640
They,

87
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.660
they did it the old fashioned way going down to Antarctica and like measuring

88
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.200
things. So anyway, they announced it, the NASA looked back and said, whoops,

89
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:01.770
you're right, huge ozone hole. Then everything kind of accelerated.

90
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:04.770
And by 87 we had the Montreal protocol.

91
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:08.460
And even though Reagan had run on this anti-regulatory platform,

92
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.450
he signed the Montreal protocol Senate ratified it.

93
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:16.080
I don't think there were any dissenting votes. Um, so, you know,

94
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.090
that was a big success story. And by the way,

95
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:21.960
by the time things really were winding down, even DuPont said, okay, yeah,

96
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.990
that there's enough science here. We're going to stop making our product.

97
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:29.130
And so it's sort of the one example I can point to where science and evidence

98
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:30.660
overcame denial,

99
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.910
but it's an example where the product wasn't their core product.

100
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:38.670
It was a little sliver of revenue that wasn't that lucrative.

101
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.880
They could replace it with something that they could sell. Um,

102
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.120
and they were going to clearly get regulated anyway. So, so clearly the,

103
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.880
you know, the benefits of continued denial had sort of done.

104
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.350
And so you can't count on evidence. Yeah.

105
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.420
Leading to the end of corporate denial.

106
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:59.030
More typically you have a situation like tobacco and fossil

107
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:03.200
fuels where even if it does lead to denial, it doesn't,

108
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.000
they don't stop selling the product. Right. So, and again,

109
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.640
obviously oil companies can't just stop selling their product,

110
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.150
but they can be part of a process for us all to figure out how we're going to

111
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:15.560
replace it as quickly as possible.

112
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.810
<v 0>What, what efforts were done, if any, to regenerate ozone.</v>

113
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.820
<v 1>Uh, just to cut the emissions and I'm not aware of anything. I don't know that.</v>

114
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.760
Yeah. It's funny. I've not heard anybody talk about that,

115
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.690
but it we've always known that the CFCs take decades to get up to the

116
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:32.291
atmosphere.

117
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:37.240
So stopping emissions meant that the old stuff was still going up there

118
00:06:37.241 --> 00:06:38.830
and it was going to take decades to fix it.

119
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.950
We do seem to have signs of healing now of the ozone layer.

120
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:45.700
So it does seem like we have solved, well, solve this. We have,

121
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.520
we have stopped the harm and it's going to get better through natural

122
00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:50.440
circumstances. But, you know, I was,

123
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.210
I was talking about how people don't let us celebrate that as humanity at its

124
00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:56.044
best, you know,

125
00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.850
cause we really did something very hard in the sense of figuring out the

126
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:01.270
science,

127
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.200
getting the nations of the world together and getting rid of a product that had

128
00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:07.060
been really useful and valuable to us.

129
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.520
But what happened immediately after that was this political backlash,

130
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.120
even when you had the chemical industry saying, yep,

131
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.000
we're destroying the ozone layer, we're going to stop doing that.

132
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.730
You had these right-wing groups.

133
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.180
Fred singer actually was one of the witnesses who was also in, in, uh,

134
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.760
merchants of doubt who goes,

135
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.300
and he gets to testify before Congress. He's a scientist.

136
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:35.230
And he's saying that the mainstream science on which you have just based all of

137
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:37.180
these decisions,

138
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.830
you're being bamboozled and they have an anticapitalist agenda.

139
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.900
And you had,

140
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:49.180
then I think it was Tom delay saying he doesn't listen to the ozone trends

141
00:07:49.181 --> 00:07:50.650
panel. All of those, you know,

142
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.830
hundreds of scientists who've hammered out the data on these issues.

143
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.370
He listens to Fred singer. And that was sort of the beginning. Well,

144
00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:59.530
not the beginning because you could take it back to the eighties,

145
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:04.270
but that was the next step in the rise of the science deniers,

146
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:07.900
who sort of had this all purpose agenda that looked at lots of different

147
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:10.750
industries. And the funny thing was here, you know,

148
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:13.330
you had the industry saying.

149
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.540
<v 4>No, we, we, we're fine with this.</v>

150
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.810
<v 1>Accelerating the phase out where we're going to go ahead and do it. So,</v>

151
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:25.030
you know, the way I think about it is that industry for a long time, uh,

152
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.250
fueled doubt. And to some extent,

153
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:32.050
they also then funded groups with an ideological agenda who continue to

154
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:32.884
push that doubt.

155
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.140
And then some of those industries stopped denying the science maybe because they

156
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:40.750
were going to get sued or maybe because it was just time,

157
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.700
but the groups that they have funded now sort of outflank them on the issue.

158
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:49.420
And for example, Exxon used to fund ExxonMobil,

159
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:54.040
used to fund this little crazy little group called the Heartland Institute.

160
00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.740
Um, and they, they stopped doing that quite a long time ago,

161
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.190
but this Institute kept just getting more and more extreme on this issue.

162
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.570
And recently they had a dispute between ExxonMobil and the Heartland Institute

163
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:11.070
and Heartland's leader called Exxon mobile part of the anti-energy global

164
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.240
warming movement. That's hilarious. Yeah. So, you know, there,

165
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.610
things are weird, right? Oh, that's super weird.

166
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.630
<v 0>Super weird.</v>

167
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.010
Exxon part of an anti-energy global warming movement.

168
00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:26.090
Now it's possible.

169
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:29.000
<v 1>That this was all kind of staged to make Exxon look good,</v>

170
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:33.890
but I think they have just created a monster and that monster is going to keep

171
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.440
going around out there and it keeps getting a lot of money.

172
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.550
The problem is it doesn't,

173
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.690
we don't necessarily know who's funding these groups anymore. For long time,

174
00:09:41.691 --> 00:09:43.970
Exxon funded a lot of climate denier groups.

175
00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.430
They got a lot of public pushback and pressure.

176
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.210
They stopped funding the most extreme ones, not all of them.

177
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.080
Then the Koch brothers started funding. Their foundation started funding.

178
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:57.080
A lot of these groups, they got a lot of attention.

179
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.580
Then we saw a lot of the funding of these groups going underground into these

180
00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:03.950
dark money organizations like donors,

181
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:08.600
trust that promise anonymity so that if you want to fund a politically

182
00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:13.190
sensitive issue, nobody knows you've done it. Uh, so these,

183
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.611
you know,

184
00:10:13.611 --> 00:10:18.590
the more extreme groups get a lot of money from these dark money organizations

185
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:23.330
and therefore there's even deeper anonymity and no

186
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.680
accountability, some.

187
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.130
<v 0>4D chassis. If Exxon was doing that, if they're sitting there going look,</v>

188
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.180
I know what we can get someone to call us a bunch of hippies.

189
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.690
<v 1>I, I suspect that it wasn't that, um,</v>

190
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.270
I think they really have just created a monster here really.

191
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.730
<v 0>Would be brilliant if it was true. Well, I.</v>

192
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.060
<v 1>Think that some of this is true that you, I mean, here's the thing.</v>

193
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:48.020
If you're Exxon and you don't actually want to do anything, you,

194
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.260
you spin off the denial into other groups that will actually stop things.

195
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:52.670
I mean this little group Heartland, I mean,

196
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:57.020
th th this extreme edge of these advocacy groups,

197
00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:00.830
they are deeply involved in the Trump administration. I mean, they,

198
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.620
it's not like they're just out there howling in the wilderness,

199
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.480
they have had enormous influence. Uh, so if you can back off like,

200
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.490
like Exxon, especially ExxonMobil,

201
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:13.820
especially if you're being sued and you've got angry shareholders,

202
00:11:13.821 --> 00:11:16.700
and you've got the sec, you, a lot of reasons,

203
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:20.540
and you have angry European countries that are taking this more seriously in

204
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.493
your multi-national.

205
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.950
You have a lot of reason to kind of keep your mouth shut and maybe say the right

206
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:29.690
things, but you can indeed still benefit from the denial.

207
00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:33.170
You have spun off into the world that is in fact,

208
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.020
say rolling back the fuel efficiency standards.

209
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:37.880
I don't know what ExxonMobil has said about that,

210
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:41.600
but clearly the more inefficient our cars, the more oil gets burned.

211
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.910
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>
