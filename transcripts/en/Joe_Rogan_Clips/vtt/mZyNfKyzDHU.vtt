00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 1>But like don't live in the white house. Jamie, I'm going to send you some.</v>

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.740
<v 2>No politics go. Buddha hood. Cory Booker. Did Mary and Barry.</v>

4
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:15.030
Did he smoke crack? [inaudible].

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.230
<v 1>You know why? Uh, I met Mary and Barry when he was, uh,</v>

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.520
just reelected. He was just realistic after the crash,

7
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
after the crash 94. Yeah. Um, Jamie, I just cracked.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.513
<v 2>His back then.</v>

9
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.620
<v 1>It wasn't 94. Maybe it was after. I don't know it was, um,</v>

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.570
I was in the studio with disappeared for a second.

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.130
I think I texted it to you. That.

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.163
<v 2>Set me up.</v>

13
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.290
<v 1>Sent me up. You were smoking crack though, bro? No, no, this is what happened.</v>

14
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.790
We were sitting in a studio.

15
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.180
It was me and Jim Norton and Opie and Anthony and I forget who else was a guest,

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.280
but Marion Barry was walking right by the big glass doors at Sirius

17
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.870
XM. And uh, he was just walking right by. He was on some other show,

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.720
someone, go, go grab them, go grab them, get them in here.

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.620
So we opened up the door and Marion Barry was just walks right in and he sits

20
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:15.250
down. And, and then is he gone? Is he dead? Yeah, he died.

21
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.793
Okay.

22
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.700
<v 2>Recipes, marionberry you? One of the most famous crack smoking.</v>

23
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.850
<v 1>I'm sitting there. And I know, I know I got a couple seconds with this dude.</v>

24
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.960
And so all my predatory instincts kick in and I'm like,

25
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.970
we've got to get right to this. They're going to pull them out of here.

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.830
As soon as they know what this show's all about.

27
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.020
Cause we're a bunch of comedians. We're high. It's seven o'clock in the morning.

28
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.570
I was high as dude. I was eating pot, lollipops and. And I was like, I go, what?

29
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.530
What? Uh, we talked about him smoking crack. And one of the things I bring,

30
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.650
I brought it up rank really quick, but he said, he goes, hold on.

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.890
No one knows what's in that pipe. That's what he said. Oh,

32
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.950
no one does diplomat diplomatic.

33
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.530
<v 2>That. No one knows.</v>

34
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.780
<v 1>Wow. I would vote for that guy because that's a hell of a politician.</v>

35
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.180
It's a good move. I like what he's saying, but it's really,

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.230
I like how he's trying to do it. You know what I'm saying? Like, no that's.

37
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.063
<v 2>Tobacco.</v>

38
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.960
<v 1>You know? It's like, no one knows what's in a hot dog. Right.</v>

39
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.130
You know? I mean you see the button, you see the hot dog you tell,

40
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.490
can you given what, what percentage would you get?

41
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:31.020
Correct in terms of ingredients. Right though. Right now,

42
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.730
if they give you a test, I wouldn't even, oh my God. I'd be like pig,

43
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:37.560
tail pig button. What's in there.

44
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.280
[inaudible] All kinds of. Yeah. So that was it.

45
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.210
<v 0>And so that crack story started with that,</v>

46
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.890
but it's been no evidence that we don't know what was in it. I mean,

47
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:56.340
I was up there for some other reason, quite frankly. What'd you think was that

48
00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.010
took one drag on.

49
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.930
<v 1>Okay. Do you feel that they're trying to railroad you because they didn't like.</v>

50
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.370
<v 2>What, what year was, did he get caught smoking crack?</v>

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.410
<v 1>That's a good question. Here's the thing.</v>

52
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.600
I don't think anybody did it, but here's the thing. So what,

53
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.570
what if he was just drinking right though?

54
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.000
Because he was listening to all the things he just said there.

55
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.670
Now I've changed my perspective since this happened,

56
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.720
getting older and more experienced in life,

57
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.410
but also realizing like, Hey, the guy,

58
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.370
if he did a good job as mayor who gives a, if he gets high, right?

59
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.760
Whose commercial life, if he gets home and shooting heroin,

60
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.150
he's got a butt plug up his and Oculus rift on. Right.

61
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.630
And he's tripping balls on ketamine. Why do I give a?

62
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.830
If this is this guy saving education, right? Is he,

63
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.700
is he providing health care? Is he making it safer for people?

64
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.270
Is he bringing people together? Right? Is he letting people know, Hey,

65
00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.130
we have more in common that Bernie tried to kill me. FBI tried to kill me.

66
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.910
Well, he might,

67
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.000
they might have that's the fact that they have the hippy eyes killed a lot of

68
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.860
people. Who's the governor of DC.

69
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.980
<v 2>Now the camera. That's what I want to know. Who had the camera?</v>

70
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.030
<v 1>Like Willie D said you got a little hope. You hope, hope, bro.</v>

71
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.680
And sometimes some gals need a little money. They'll hide a camera. Oh,

72
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.780
you got a little hole. This is what you gotta do.

73
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.990
<v 2>Stupid. Hit the camera. We had smoking crack, all this good cracking here.</v>

74
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:28.420
You want to have a camera? And the thing is, I mean, like for the most part,

75
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.340
it's just like, he's partying. He's just like, Hey listen man.

76
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.050
<v 1>Why is it, man? Why is it bad? Does he up as job? Here's the thing.</v>

77
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.560
If he shows up Monday morning, he's cracked out and decides to nuke China.

78
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.090
You know what kind of bombs we got? You're like, okay, okay. Okay.

79
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.940
If he's a real, if he's like a.

80
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.100
<v 2>Degenerate crack hit, but he wasn't. He was a, he was little feet.</v>

81
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.740
<v 1>Just functioning. But what if he just sits in the chair?</v>

82
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.390
What if he sits in the chair?

83
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.010
What if he's got a La-Z-Boy and he puts his feet up and he just keeps pounding,

84
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.990
keeps pounding whiskey. You're going to be a professor. Just kids.

85
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.230
No way worse than that guy. What if he just he's doing what's legal,

86
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.190
but he's in a chair and he's just not going anywhere. Just pounded it.

87
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.140
How come that's okay. We'll talk about the.

88
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.150
<v 2>Crack credit credit. Freddy crack cracked out. Freddy.</v>

89
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.690
Tell me about the effects of crack. I mean, everybody,

90
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:21.730
everybody handled drugs differently, man. So you know.

91
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.200
<v 1>We'll put that up there. Dear.</v>

92
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:28.000
Jamie says Mary and Barry 76 has further down in the interview that he

93
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:32.890
believes the FBI was trying to get him to smoke a substance as high as 90% pure

94
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:33.724
cocaine,

95
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.370
crack and chemistry chemist at a Berry subsequent trial testified

96
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:44.200
that the drug used in the sting operation was in fact 93%

97
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.270
pure cocaine. Holy. So they might've been, they bite the cat, fished him.

98
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.530
Yeah. They might've been trying to get him to die. Well, I'm.

99
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.500
<v 2>Gonna tell you this, right? My.</v>

100
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.990
<v 1>God, look at this. They had an EMT on the spot,</v>

101
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.710
which is not only did try to kill him for real. Yeah. Not only unusual,

102
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:05.030
but rare in the history of the FBI. Barry noted.

103
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.380
As he offered evidence to support his claims, he FBI attempted to kill me.

104
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.030
Why would they have an EMT on the same on the scene? If they weren't trying.

105
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.240
Wow, you had to let them inhale. It says at the bottom,

106
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.520
the FBI officials says the purpose of the medical standby was to provide

107
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:24.200
potential medical attention to Marion.

108
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.050
Barry should his criminal activities require it.

109
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:30.620
There's criminal activities that they brought the Coke for.

110
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.960
<v 2>So they made this.</v>

111
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.890
<v 3>With Q and non Joe. Hold on. They don't talk about this.</v>

112
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.180
Don't talk about this pro they'll talk about the Tuskegee experience.

113
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.720
Marion Barry being set up by the FBI. They only talk about weird.

114
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.280
These are people trying to kids.

115
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.540
<v 2>Wow. I didn't. I never thought.</v>

116
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.970
<v 3>I thought they never talked about this. So it's like, oh,</v>

117
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.790
talk about Oprah and Jeffrey Epstein. Someone talked about the 4.4 billion.

118
00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.930
<v 1>The church was below tribal. They're tribal. And they don't,</v>

119
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.040
they don't hang out with you.

120
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.400
They don't hang out with people that are interested in that or that story.

121
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.380
You know, we w people hang out with,

122
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:09.620
if you're hanging around with a bunch of flat earthers that believe that a

123
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.500
there's a basement somewhere where all the kids get. Right?

124
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.480
That's all you think about all day long,

125
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.190
but that actually happened to Mary and Barry.

126
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.010
You don't have time to listen to Cornell west.

127
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.000
You don't have time to just read it, FBI. And you saying what I'm saying?

128
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:24.800
It's like, you get you're so wrapped up in your own.

129
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.340
You're so wrapped up in being tribal. You don't have time.

130
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.660
<v 2>I thought I thought Mary and Barry bought that crack off the corner that he</v>

131
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.660
spokes. Cause you're talking about some 90%. I was like that.

132
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.560
Ain't no regular crack.

133
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.510
<v 3>[Inaudible] ran crack. Yeah. That's a different.</v>

134
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.210
<v 2>Kind of crack. Ain't no crack 90% cocaine.</v>

135
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.980
<v 1>This is me listening to him, talking about it. It's changed my perspective.</v>

136
00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:51.950
I bet you don't also me listening to me.

137
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.070
Describe the video that I saw, where all these people are.

138
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:57.230
Like none of I'm smelling a little crack every now and then.

139
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.670
Like I remember seeing that. I remember,

140
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.730
I remember thinking at the time these people are crazy. They,

141
00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.080
they reelected him and look,

142
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:07.940
they don't care about cracking it right now as a grown man who understands

143
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:12.350
media. I realized, oh no, this is probably like a broad range of opinions.

144
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.480
It's probably like a lot of people that go, Hey,

145
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.350
what do you give a if he's smoking crack.

146
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.270
And he does a great job with the budget. I don't know if he did. Who gives a?

147
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:21.710
I don't know if he did. I don't. I don't.

148
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:26.450
I literally know nothing about the guys don't reelect them exactly right.

149
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.370
<v 3>They did. But I don't think he was, was he bad? As I'm.</v>

150
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.750
<v 1>Trying to figure out, maybe they missed him.</v>

151
00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:35.060
Maybe the new guy got in place and he was boring and maybe Marian did a good job

152
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.900
and smoked crack. Right. That's possible too. Like Bert Kreischer.

153
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:43.070
He's a funny comedian and he's a drunk. Okay. I was gonna say, I was like,

154
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.830
no. How much is, how much is there a difference? Well,
