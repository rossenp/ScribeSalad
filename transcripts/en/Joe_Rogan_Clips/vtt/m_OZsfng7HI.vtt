00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 1>Right. Okay. Now I've got to change the way I fight.</v>

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.280
<v 2>There's also the wind bonus. I mean, especially now,</v>

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.910
did they have the wind bonus? Yeah. That's tad to me is a real issue.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.200
I think a guy should be paid what they get paid. I think if you have a contract,

6
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:17.970
the contract for X amount of money,

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.130
if you have points on the pay-per-view that's on top of that,

8
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:24.720
but the idea that your win or loss could be in the hands of what we have deemed

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.560
completely incompetent. Judge. I see it every week, every week. I mean,

10
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.500
you do a lot of commentary yourself in these smaller shows.

11
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.300
I'd imagine sometimes it's even worse.

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.640
<v 1>I've I mean,</v>

13
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:40.500
we've gotten in trouble to the point where we had people come to us and go look

14
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.110
you the promoters at different organs,

15
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.110
from different organizations when there was really, really bad decisions,

16
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.150
you know, when I was working with Michael Chavela,

17
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:52.900
especially we were brutal on the athletic commissions and we'd hear about it and

18
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.200
we'd go, you guys need to back back off.

19
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.460
<v 2>I've heard it from athletic commissions too. I'd say, go yourself. Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.320
There's guys in there that are fighting for their life.

21
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.060
They literally trained for months and months.

22
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.360
And some point someone who literally doesn't even understand martial arts is

23
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.870
giving these guys a decision, a loss or a win.

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.600
And that's 50% of their money. And that's.

25
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.990
<v 1>I remember the first time I witnessed it as far as a coach,</v>

26
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.320
when my IFL team was fighting in Texas, we were fighting. I think boss's team.

27
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.070
And I looked at the judges and all of them, one of them had a, uh,

28
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.020
a bouffant hairdo and old lady and then two old guys with white

29
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.630
hair. And I went back to the locker room and I go, guys,

30
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.060
you can't let this go to the judges.

31
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.300
They're like one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.

32
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:37.890
They know nothing about what they're watching.

33
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.470
Like we are in deep if we can't do it.

34
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.460
<v 2>Well, it's,</v>

35
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:46.290
I think boxing is a very complicated art and I think it's a very difficult thing

36
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.610
to, to score,

37
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.380
but it's way more easy to score than martial arts. Absolutely.

38
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.560
There's so much going on when a fight goes to the ground. I mean,

39
00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:58.710
I have a friend who's a judge who literally said to me in the middle of a fight,

40
00:01:58.711 --> 00:02:02.010
one of the female judges or referees rather, uh, judges,

41
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.520
one of the female judges turned to him and go, what is he doing? Like,

42
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.430
what is he doing? The guy was going for Kamora. What is he doing?

43
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.953
What is he doing?

44
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.160
<v 1>Adelaide bird. Right? Yeah. We've, we've heard you,</v>

45
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.020
you talked about her during one of the USA.

46
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.650
<v 2>Uh, I mean, Cormier joking around nice lady.</v>

47
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.060
Very nice lady. Yeah. But like I said, my mom's a really nice lady too.

48
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.500
I wouldn't want to want to judge.

49
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.410
<v 1>Right. But I said the Adelaide bird before the pride in Las Vegas,</v>

50
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.850
Lala was fighting in that one. Right.

51
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.080
And I thought I'm just going to ask and I walked up to her and I go, excuse me,

52
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:36.660
I'm new to the sport. Could you tell me what a triangle choke is?

53
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:39.300
And she looked at me and went, oh, just walked away.

54
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.783
She's just like.

55
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.190
<v 2>Sure. Maybe it's just like, this is a trap pat Millett,</v>

56
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.750
just trying to trap guy with cauliflower.

57
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.583
<v 1>Ears.</v>

58
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.610
<v 2>New to this sport. That's hilarious. He probably had a, uh,</v>

59
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.110
like a transparent grin. Like you couldn't hold it back. You know, those grins.

60
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.020
<v 1>Just it's, it's sad that this goes, it's awful.</v>

61
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.690
They suspend fighters constantly, but what are they going to start?

62
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:08.320
Suspending referees and judges. I think I've only seen it one time.

63
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.430
<v 2>I agree. I mean, judges in, in, in, in for sure. Referees as well.</v>

64
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.740
But I think that the,

65
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:17.830
the real thing that's so disappointing to me is that there's a wealth of martial

66
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.320
arts experts out there. Like there's so many,

67
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.340
there's so many good coaches. That would be great judges.

68
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.990
There's so many great ex fighters.

69
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.530
There's so many people that are just really well-versed in martial arts.

70
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.743
That'd be able to tell.

71
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.760
And I also think three people is a ridiculously small number.

72
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.220
I think for you you're you're like five judges. Yeah.

73
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.550
Like five judges would lose a lot of the decisions.

74
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.570
Cause if it's two and one and like there's sometimes when you get a split

75
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:44.710
decision, you're like, what in the?

76
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.450
Like one person saw this completely wrong and the other two guys got it. Right.

77
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:50.770
Thank God. The other two guys were there. Well,

78
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.040
if there's five people and this happens more than once you say, okay,

79
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.440
we've got a weak link here. Let's get rid of this person.

80
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.710
<v 1>Yeah. One judge will have it unanimous one way.</v>

81
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:03.400
And the other judges will have it unanimous the other, oh, that's impossible.

82
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.400
<v 2>They should be, they should be held accountable. They,</v>

83
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.120
someone should have to sit down with them and say, got to explain, like,

84
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:11.230
what are you seeing? Like what's,

85
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.950
let's watch the brown sit down with me and tell me how you think this guy was

86
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.450
getting the beat out of him was winning.

87
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.450
<v 1>I just it's criminal dude. Some of the kids I've seen screwed off. It's just,</v>

88
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.533
it's it's heartbreak.

89
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.820
<v 2>And it literally is like stealing money from these kids. You know? I mean,</v>

90
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.330
you're, I just don't like the wind bonus, man. I just think it's a bad,

91
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:32.710
I don't think anybody fights harder.

92
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.240
<v 1>C and I don't even, I don't even necessarily subscribe to, you know,</v>

93
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:39.820
fight of the night and knock out of the night and stuff like that. Yeah.

94
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.750
I don't, I don't,

95
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.500
I think they just bring back the yellow cards for stalling type stuff. Right.

96
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.280
But how pride.

97
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.240
<v 2>Did it, right. I.</v>

98
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.230
<v 1>Think that's a great way to do.</v>

99
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.050
<v 2>Things when pride did it, what did they take? 10% of your purse?</v>

100
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.140
<v 1>I think so. And they, you know, and they, they would end up, I mean,</v>

101
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.770
you get dqued eventually right. They pull the red card and you're done, right.

102
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.170
<v 2>If he was more than one yellow card, you'd get DQ.</v>

103
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.640
So they would give you a yellow card.

104
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:04.450
If they thought that you were either doing something illegal or if stalling.

105
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.780
<v 1>Just stalling or whatever. I mean, in college wrestling,</v>

106
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:09.850
they knew that they had to change things, right.

107
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.300
They had to speed up the action and they started calling stalling a lot faster

108
00:05:13.301 --> 00:05:16.480
in college wrestling. And it changed college wrestling guys. Get after it. Now.

109
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.240
<v 2>No, my problem with it though, is that there's referees,</v>

110
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.930
it's separate fighters when they're working real hard against the cage. Like,

111
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.360
and I think again, it's guys who don't understand,

112
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.570
they don't understand how difficult it is when you have one guy is trying to

113
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:29.680
take the other guy down the other,

114
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.490
guy's trying to defend their landing shots in between trying to open up space.

115
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.380
And then the referee will say, keep working. I'm going to separate you guys.

116
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:37.323
You don't work. Like.

117
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.970
<v 1>What the are you watching? They're battling. They're.</v>

118
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.300
<v 2>Battling. They literally don't understand the position. Yeah. And that's,</v>

119
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:43.930
that's a giant.

120
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.530
<v 1>No problem. Think about how many referees have never truly trained. Right.</v>

121
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.340
<v 2>A lot, a lot. And if they did train, it was a long time ago.</v>

122
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:54.190
A lot of the guys going in there with big fat guts and they just.

123
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.950
<v 1>Times have you called fights and all the years you've been calling fights and</v>

124
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:02.600
been saying, he's out, he's out, he's out. Stop the fight, stop the fight,

125
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:03.410
stop the fight. I.

126
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.320
<v 2>Wonder if you'd so close to it that you don't see it as well.</v>

127
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.350
<v 1>That's that's not an excuse. It's not because you know,</v>

128
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.920
you've trained for so many years in martial arts. Right. You know,

129
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:14.960
when somebody is unconscious from a choke, you know,

130
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.990
when a joint's getting destroyed, you know, you've been around it enough,

131
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:20.570
you've trained high level enough where you see it, you know,

132
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.050
you can see their stomach where it's going in and out really hard, you know,

133
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.033
they're unconscious, right.

134
00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.640
Where referees look at somebody and their eyes are wide open while his eyes are

135
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.230
open. So he must be conscious Europe.

136
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.730
<v 2>More. You don't understand, right? Yeah. Yeah. What are your thoughts on, um,</v>

137
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.760
forcing tap outs? Like if a guy gets his arm broken,

138
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.750
like that's a controversial thing. Like, like stopping a fight.

139
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.620
<v 1>We think about Tim Sylvia and Frank Mir, you know, Tim got his forearm snapped.</v>

140
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.910
<v 2>Crazy one because in that one,</v>

141
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:49.460
I kind of agree with her because it wasn't an elbow.

142
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.450
It was the middle of the arm.

143
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.890
<v 1>Right. Both foreign bones went at the same time.</v>

144
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.760
So I didn't see that angle. Right.

145
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.760
Tim's back was to us in the corner and herb stops it and I w

146
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.090
and Tim gets up and he's like, what? The F you know, do a great acting job.

147
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.200
Right. Tim, you know, for whatever reason was able to pull that off. I mean,

148
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.820
that's not a pleasant feeling, obviously having your,

149
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.890
your arms snap in and Tim gets up and he's like yelling at

150
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:20.330
her. I go in, I start yelling at Herbert. Herb's like, pat, I swear to God,

151
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.820
his arm is broken. He's pleased.

152
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:25.280
And then I see the replay on the big screen and I got her.

153
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.650
<v 2>The crowd was booing. And then we played the replay back and I'm like, watch it,</v>

154
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.620
watch it right here, scratching here, but he'd go. Oh.

155
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.060
<v 1>Yeah. And then I told him,</v>

156
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:37.820
I go wave to the crowd when we walk out of the cage with your broken arm.

157
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.290
So Tim goes, Jesus. And then we got back.

158
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.160
We got backstage when the doctor looked at it and I go, how bad is it?

159
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:49.820
And he goes, oh, it hurts. This hurts. Yeah. Yeah. It was.

160
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.960
<v 2>Bad. So the doctor.</v>

161
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.600
<v 1>That did the doctor. Yeah. The doctor that did it, it was a good,</v>

162
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.440
good friend of mine, orthopedic guy who I trained for many years.

163
00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.880
He was a bull rider at one time and then became an orthopedic surgeon and then

164
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:05.030
trained with me and kickboxing. Right. Tough guy. Tough, tough,

165
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.370
tough dude from taxing imagine. And he goes,

166
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.690
I've never had to order plates for a tibia bone

167
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.220
to replace, to put somebodies forum bones back together. He goes,

168
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.740
they're as big as the normal humans tibia. Oh yeah.

169
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.850
<v 2>Tim's it just, yeah.</v>

170
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.400
<v 1>It was, his bones were massive. He goes, they don't even make,</v>

171
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.530
I had to use tibia plates. Wow.

172
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.590
<v 2>Yeah. It did heal a hundred percent. Yeah.</v>

173
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.060
<v 2>Cause there's a long time though. Right? Like he really struggled with that.</v>

175
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.511
Right. That was,

176
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:36.170
I remember him saying thank you to her Dean for saving his career. Yeah.

177
00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.620
Because, uh, you know, if he let him go on and that.

178
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.570
<v 1>Thing got down here.</v>

179
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.890
<v 2>Especially if it goes, once it breaks through the skin, right.</v>

180
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.590
That comes a giant issue for infection. All kinds of here. It is right here.

181
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.900
Jamie pulled it up. Frank Mir,

182
00:08:50.901 --> 00:08:55.040
that has broken more arms that they're not showing it right here. Oh,

183
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.680
it says right on the cup. Here's a great play. Yeah. That's a,

184
00:08:58.681 --> 00:09:03.060
that's another thing about metal cups. That's a weird little Lupo here. It is.

185
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.050
That's a weird angle to look at that crash. Daddy,

186
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.010
that's a weird angle. That was ugly. That was ugly. Those metal cups, man.

187
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:14.730
That's a weird, uh, still loophole. Like you could still wear those,

188
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.140
those tie cups will still be able to, but you're kicking metal.

189
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.030
And it's also a crazy fulcrum.

190
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:24.240
If you've got a guy in an arm bar that's you got a metal rod there.

191
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.160
I like it though. I like it. I'm sure you do.
