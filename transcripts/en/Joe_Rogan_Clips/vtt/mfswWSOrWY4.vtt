00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.823
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.660
A real parallel is when you were talking about th these large-scale meat

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:11.160
processing plants are a perfect sort of Petri dish

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.180
for viruses to grow. So our factory farms,

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.530
and so are these farms where you're stuffing pigs next week,

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.340
you're doing all this unnatural stuff, right?

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.630
It's unnatural for people to be stuffed into a warehouse right next to each

8
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.400
other shoulder, to shoulder working all day.

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.510
It's unnatural for them to be stuffed in these homes, shoulder, to shoulder,

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.050
with bad food and,

11
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:35.160
and all the things that you would need to keep your body healthy and strong.

12
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.280
The same can be said about these factory farms, situ situations.

13
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.020
One thing that I find so attractive about the way you run your farm is that

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.370
there's no weirdness in watching these animals during the day. They,

15
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:49.980
they seem like animals just doing normal stuff.

16
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.240
If you see a chicken wandering around, just packing up the grass, looks normal,

17
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.350
see a chicken in a cage, getting fed out of a little cup or something.

18
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.840
It looks all kinds of up, right? It doesn't feel right now, right? No.

19
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.440
<v 1>That's what we, you know, we, um, we have the phrase, uh,</v>

20
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.620
respecting the thickness of the pig and the chicken, this of the chicken. And.

21
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.740
<v 0>We know that these diseases are all coming from these place. I mean,</v>

22
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:15.740
there's a ton of agricultural diseases, you know,

23
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:19.130
that are based from these factory farm situations where these animals live in

24
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:23.510
these really horrific conditions. And then the bacteria jump in.

25
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.070
<v 1>Look, I mean, there, there, there eat. Look, if you ate in your toilet, every,</v>

26
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.950
you know, would you like to keep your toilet every day, right? Uh that's.

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.490
That's how they eat your they're breathing in their fecal particulate matter,

28
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:38.660
which is, um, you know, uh, putting lesions in their, uh,

29
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.250
tender respiratory membranes, uh, making, making, uh, lesions there.

30
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.200
Uh, and,

31
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:48.800
and so w when you have those kinds of conditions and they're not getting

32
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:53.540
exercise, they're not getting fresh air. And so, uh, I mean, the,

33
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.790
the, uh, they're not getting salad,

34
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:59.720
they're not getting any vitamin D from the sunshine. Uh,

35
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.730
and so what happens is you get an extremely concentrated

36
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.930
host.

37
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.240
<v 2>Host facility.</v>

38
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.790
<v 1>For pathogenicity. Mm. Th th that's what happens.</v>

39
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:14.780
You get a very concentrated host facility, because there's always a host,

40
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.830
they're close to each other. The pathogen doesn't have to say, wow, boy,

41
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.950
I wonder if I can make it that, you know, that half mile over to another no,

42
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.930
they're, you know, they're always right there. And so you're right. It's like,

43
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.470
it's like an incubator. And so, you know, if we wanted to sit down and look,

44
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:34.760
if we wanted to sit down and say, let's say we had a James Bond, uh,

45
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.280
conspirators, you know, uh, and said, we're going to form a committee and, uh,

46
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.640
and make a pathogen friendly farm, you know,

47
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.590
the old James Bond nemesis. Right. And so we formed a committee to say,

48
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:53.360
how can we make a pathogen friendly farm? Well, we would have only one species.

49
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.780
We'd crowd it up. We'd take out the oxygen, the, the fresh air,

50
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:00.730
the sunshine we'd give it. We we'd give it a, a minimalistic diet.

51
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.260
What I've just described is modern, efficient,

52
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.250
industrial factory farming. You couldn't design a better system,

53
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.330
uh, for, for, uh, conductivity of pathogenicity.

54
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.540
<v 0>Now here's the big question.</v>

55
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.650
Is it possible to feed all of Los Angeles

56
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.080
using your methods? Can you,

57
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.130
can you feed big urban areas using these regenerative.

58
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.400
<v 1>Methods? Sure, absolutely. So, uh, so,</v>

59
00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:34.320
so two things to realize is the, the bottleneck in the food system right now,

60
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:38.490
the reason the supermarket is low on meat is not because there aren't animals in

61
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:43.050
the field. It's because of the pro the processing is the, it's not the trucking,

62
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.030
it's not the production. It's not even the, it's not even the store shelf. It's,

63
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.040
it's the processing. So it's the processing, that's the bottleneck. And so,

64
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.620
uh, so, so my vision is that, so, so,

65
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:01.050
so we can get to two questions, first of all, let's deal with the production,

66
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.360
uh, with the production. Absolutely. If we, if we spread out the production,

67
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.600
if we, if we did, for example, you know, uh,

68
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.610
if we took all the confinement chicken houses and put those chickens on pasture,

69
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.400
no problem. Okay.

70
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.470
It doesn't take any more land to grow the feed

71
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.440
for a chicken on pasture than it does in a confinement.

72
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.390
<v 0>House. You get a lot more lost though,</v>

73
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:29.670
due to Raptors and things along those lines.

74
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.480
<v 1>No, no, no. We, we put it, we put them in, uh, in little, uh,</v>

75
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.160
protected shelters. Uh, then we move them every day across the pasture. Well,

76
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:40.620
yeah, you, you can get losses from, from rappers,

77
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:44.850
but we use guard geese or there a guard, dogs, guard, llamas,

78
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.360
there's all sorts of guard animals. There's, there's really cool. Uh,

79
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:52.680
and there's, and there's a lot of research being done to jam the radar of,

80
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.850
you know, Eagles and stuff really. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

81
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.980
<v 0>They jammed the rate. I didn't even know they had radar.</v>

82
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.350
<v 1>Well, that's figurative.</v>

83
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.160
<v 0>Right? What are they using when they, when,</v>

84
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.000
when an Eagle it's just not just their vision's insanely good.

85
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.110
<v 1>Right? Yeah. In particular, it, it really is. It really is. And so, for example,</v>

86
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.530
I know one guy that's, uh, he's, it's not,

87
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:15.480
it's not ready to sell yet,

88
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.920
but he claims to have had great success, um,

89
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.820
putting reflective, uh,

90
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.690
Coke can bottoms on like a traffic cone,

91
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.970
hanging it out with his chickens and that splays the sun,

92
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.310
rays all out and messes up the eyesight of the, of the Eagles and the Hawks.

93
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.630
They, they can't zero in really, in in fact,

94
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.230
this was exactly, um, one of the defensive measures,

95
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:50.640
the U S Navy used and still uses for incoming missiles

96
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.050
that they, they, they have a Canon that blows out pieces of, um,

97
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.670
aluminum foil basically, and like a graffiti,

98
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.590
aluminum foil graffiti out of the air. And it jams the, whatever the, you know,

99
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.180
the honing devices of a, of a missile, the Hawks are the same way.

100
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.400
What I'm getting at is that there, there are, we don't lose very much.

101
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:15.440
We protect them greatly.

102
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.610
There are a lot of things that you can do to, you know,

103
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.220
to mitigate that kind of pressure. But,

104
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:26.780
but the fact is the industry loses tons of birds too,

105
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.730
in a flood, in a heat wave, in a whatever, you know? And, um,

106
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.430
and so the idea that these birds in this big confinement

107
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:40.700
house are actually protected from malady.

108
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.280
This is simply not, is simply not good.

109
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.180
<v 0>And they're going to be much more of them are going to get sick and sure.</v>

110
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.920
They might have losses in that way.

111
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.930
<v 1>Sure, sure. So, so can we produce, can we produce the food this way? Absolutely.</v>

112
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.700
Now one of the things that it would require is many more people on

113
00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:04.720
farms. So, you know, I've thought a lot about, um,

114
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.260
obviously as unemployment has skyrocketed through this

115
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.820
right now, sitting here, it's hard for us to imagine what it'll take to bring,

116
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.600
you know, to fill football stadiums again,

117
00:07:19.601 --> 00:07:24.130
to F to film Caribbean cruises, to fill theaters,

118
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:28.660
um, you know, uh, music venues, you know, um,

119
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.560
whatever boxing matches. I mean,

120
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.620
right now it's hard to conceive what it'll take.

121
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.450
People are so terrified.

122
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.270
It's hard to appreciate how much of this is going to come back,

123
00:07:43.271 --> 00:07:46.480
the hospitality industry and all that. So, so, so what's going to happen. So,

124
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:49.090
so where are the jobs, what are people going to do? And,

125
00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.770
and I would suggest that one of the things that that people can do is that we

126
00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:58.480
can have a lot of these smaller plants and we have a

127
00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:00.850
way more people actually growing food,

128
00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:03.700
participating in food production personally,

129
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.120
is food going to be more expensive, maybe so,

130
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.860
but you get to be healthy and we have a healthy planet

131
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.560
and what's that worth. And.

132
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.350
<v 0>How much more do you think it would cost for? I mean,</v>

133
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:19.900
if you just give a rough percentage,

134
00:08:19.901 --> 00:08:23.290
if you're thinking about food production right now with the current situation,

135
00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:25.690
there's a lot of automation, right? A lot of these factory farms,

136
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:27.250
they don't require too many people to be working.

137
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.720
You would require much more people get, you'd have to manage these animals.

138
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:34.210
You'd have to do it sort of along the lines of the way that you do,

139
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.770
how many more people you think would be involved in a large scale film. Uh,

140
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.280
lots and lots of people.

141
00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.100
<v 1>I, I don't have, I don't have a number there, but I can tell you that, um,</v>

142
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.620
that prices would, uh, you know,

143
00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:51.730
food prices might go up to what they were 30 years ago. And.

144
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.593
<v 0>It also,</v>

145
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.300
would it be fair to say that food prices might go to where they should be like a

146
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.790
cheeseburger really shouldn't be nine, 9 cents?

147
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.630
<v 1>No, absolutely. Uh, the, the, as,</v>

148
00:09:02.631 --> 00:09:06.470
as you're very familiar with the argument of the externalized costs, they don't,

149
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.560
they don't get captured. What's, what's the cost, you know, right now,

150
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:14.270
50% of the cases of diarrhea in the U S are caused by a foodborne

151
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.330
bacteria. Well, what's a, what's a case of diarrhea. Worse. Yeah. I mean,

152
00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:17.960
if we start.

153
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.930
<v 0>If you start, if.</v>

154
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.200
<v 1>You start putting dollars on these externalized costs, you know, the,</v>

155
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.160
the dead zone in the, in the Gulf of Mexico, the fact that we have, you know,

156
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.750
score hundreds of square miles, that don't grow shrimp anymore, you know,

157
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:36.290
because it's, it's toxic from the runoff, from the Mississippi, uh, from,

158
00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:40.430
from chemical farming. So there's, there's a lot of these externalized costs.

159
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.380
And not only that, but if this actually became normal, uh,

160
00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.610
the, the, whatever, the new way, the new orthodoxy, uh,

161
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.380
there would be definitely a economies of scale that we don't have right now. Um,

162
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.070
I mean, I'll just give you one example that probably nobody would think of.

163
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.070
So we play, we pay workman's compensation at our farm.

164
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.710
So how do you determine the exposure level, the risk factor of a poultry worker?

165
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:11.600
I mean, think about if, if you have a Tyson chicken farm and you hire a, uh, uh,

166
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.150
an employee to be in the chicken house,

167
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:20.060
think about his workman's comp risk. I mean,

168
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:24.530
there's fecal particulate all day long that he's breathing. Uh,

169
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:28.160
you've got augers chains, feed bins,

170
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:33.380
electrical connections, dust. I mean, it's, it's a very,

171
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.070
um, it's a high risk situation for us.

172
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:42.860
A poultry worker goes out in the field and move some,

173
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.670
move some chickens in a field. There's no fecal particulate, there's no dust.

174
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.140
There's no, uh, you know, uh, there's no augers, there's no,

175
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.570
um, whatever spinning fans, uh, vent shafts, you know,

176
00:10:56.571 --> 00:11:00.470
there's none of this. And so, so part of the cost,

177
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.370
the reason that our chicken is more expensive than what's in the store is not

178
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:06.920
only externalized costs, but it is,

179
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.990
it is unrecognized unrecognized

180
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:17.300
savings that we offer that can't be

181
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:21.760
captured in a square peg in a round hole. Mm.

182
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.230
<v 0>I see what you're saying. Yeah. The,</v>

183
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.360
the overall big picture of health for you health for the food,

184
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.700
how much is that worth? Yeah. Right.

185
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.190
That's interesting that we're not really taking into consideration these

186
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.160
secondary costs that come about from doing it the wrong way.

187
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:40.900
<v 1>Yeah. W w we're not, we're not, uh, I mean, there's, there's a lot of those,</v>

188
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.920
uh, you can much,

189
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.600
much of our increased costs has nothing to do with actual production

190
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.730
costs. It's,

191
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.840
it's the regulatory overheads,

192
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:58.840
uh, and this,

193
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.470
and this of course is why we don't have more community small-scale avatars

194
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.880
around the country, uh, is not because there's not a demand for them.

195
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.860
It's because the, the, the paperwork, the Hasset plants,

196
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:14.500
hazardous analysis, critical control point plans,

197
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:19.450
and the paperwork to be able to launch a business like

198
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:22.750
this require the,

199
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.150
are so high. The, the, the both time and money are so high,

200
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:33.580
that it's very difficult to launch a small business, you know,

201
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.240
cause you can't spread the overhead of capitalization.

202
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.550
<v 0>Over. Is there a solution? Is it.</v>

203
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:44.980
<v 1>Well, uh, there, there are a couple solutions, certainly one, one that's,</v>

204
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:45.400
um,

205
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.420
that's being championed right now by Congressman Thomas Massey called the prime

206
00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:53.650
act. He's had it in for five years and, uh, amazingly,

207
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:55.600
it's kind of just floundered for five years.

208
00:12:56.230 --> 00:13:00.430
All of a sudden in the last two months he's got 18 new co-sponsors because of

209
00:13:00.431 --> 00:13:02.740
this and what the prime act would do. It would allow,

210
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.120
it would allow uninspected custom processed meat

211
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:13.930
in-state to be sold by the piece that's not legal

212
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:17.740
right now, right now, the only way that you can sell a T-bone,

213
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.240
if you want to buy a T-bone steak for you,

214
00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:23.830
the only way for you to get it is for me to go to a federal inspected slaughter

215
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:25.870
house, get the animal processed,

216
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.200
packaged under inspection and put in for you.

217
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:35.440
Custom houses are where if you want to buy a half a beef, a quarter beef,

218
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:36.333
all right.

219
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.780
And it goes in with your name on that quarter and they're custom processing it

220
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:44.680
for me. Yeah. Then, you know, then I can buy it. And what,

221
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.330
what Congressman Massey is saying with the prime act is why should we

222
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:53.620
discriminate? And only allow people to tap into the lower cost and lower,

223
00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.120
lower, uh, uh,

224
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:59.530
overheads of the custom processing facility to only those

225
00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:02.740
people who can afford to buy a quarter of beef at a time. That's,

226
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.050
that's very poverty discriminatory.

227
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.820
Let's open that up so that people can buy it, buy the piece.

228
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.760
We're not going to ship it interstate. We're not going to sell it at Walmart.

229
00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:16.000
Okay. There's but if you and I,

230
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.740
as neighbors want to do business together as a,

231
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:24.250
and I'm using a powerful phrasing here as consenting adults.

232
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.050
If we want to exercise freedom of joy of choice and

233
00:14:29.051 --> 00:14:33.430
participate in a consensual relationship of

234
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:37.750
commerce, why should that be a bureaucrats,

235
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:43.150
uh, uh, business between, you know, between two consenting neighbors?

236
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.220
Right?

237
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.160
<v 0>So what you're saying is, is long, but is the,</v>

238
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.100
the regulatory process in place to make sure that people are using the proper

239
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:55.610
sanitation methods, making sure that the animals are healthy,

240
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:57.560
making sure that all these things are in place.

241
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:02.210
So that unscrupulous characters don't take advantage of the system and then

242
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:05.030
screw over the consumer. And the consumer gets sick.

243
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.210
Like this is like best case scenario for the regulation, right.

244
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.270
That it's there to protect us. Well.

245
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:13.930
<v 1>That's, that's the, um, that's the assumption. Yes. Um,</v>

246
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.470
and I would simply ask, uh,

247
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.310
that at some point, when you have a very close, transparent relationship,

248
00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:26.710
one-on-one you don't, you don't have, you know,

249
00:15:26.711 --> 00:15:30.280
truckers and warehouses and big slaughterhouses and, and, and, you know,

250
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.870
supermarkets, blah, blah, blah. In between us. There is,

251
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.220
there is a lot of protection in that

252
00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:44.050
relational transaction that beats all the paperwork you can amass

253
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.230
on the industrial scale. We,

254
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:52.180
we recognize scale in a lot of things in life. For example, in Virginia,

255
00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:56.350
where I'm from, if you want to open a, if you want to do daycare,

256
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.440
let's say you want to do a work at home deal. You know,

257
00:15:59.441 --> 00:16:01.570
you want to do a side gig and, and keep children.

258
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:05.830
You can keep up to three in your home without subjecting yourself to the

259
00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:09.490
licensing and compliance of daycare regulations,

260
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.520
because they know if all you're going to do is keep three in your homes,

261
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.920
those parents you're going to have a close relationship with them.

262
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.520
It's this is not a, this is not a daycare center. All right. All right.

263
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.160
The same thing is true with elder care. Uh,

264
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:26.080
my wife's grandmother spent her last year in a lady's home who is allowed to

265
00:16:26.081 --> 00:16:29.260
keep three people as elder care. She was an RN.

266
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:35.110
She wanted to not have to go to the hospital every day and started a side

267
00:16:35.111 --> 00:16:37.450
gig in her home. She cooked for them. She took care of them.

268
00:16:37.451 --> 00:16:40.000
Three of them in her home. Does this vary state by state?

269
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.170
It does vary state by state. I'm just giving you an example of where,

270
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.690
of where RISD, where,

271
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:52.630
where it's reasonable to appreciate that a different relationship at

272
00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:53.890
scale. Yes.

273
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:59.650
Can create its own safety in that particular

274
00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:03.490
thing. Can you keep a hundred in your home without a license? No,

275
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.630
but three, if you're only going to keep three,

276
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.190
you're probably going to see them.

277
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.790
You're probably going to have a direct relationship with each of their,

278
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.560
of their caregivers. They're, you know,

279
00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:19.540
they're people that are signing off for them. It's a different relationship.

280
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:24.610
And so all I would say is that, uh, from the safety issue,

281
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.890
that there needs to be someplace a point at

282
00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:34.390
which we can opt to do business with each

283
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.570
other, without a bureaucrat involved.

284
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.740
<v 0>Let me ask you this. If you wanted to slaughter a cow, and then you wanted to,</v>

285
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.260
uh, give some of the meat away to your neighbor,

286
00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.860
would you have to bring it to some sort of a facility.

287
00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.780
<v 1>Perfectly legal, perfectly legal? So this is not, yeah. If it were,</v>

288
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.760
if this were all about safety, right? You wouldn't be able to do that. So,

289
00:17:56.761 --> 00:18:00.610
so the important thing to realize is that the,

290
00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:04.020
the prohibition here is not on the in fact,

291
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:08.700
our neighbor can even buy it legally. Oh really? I can't, I just can't sell it.

292
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.410
So the prohibition is only on.

293
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.510
<v 0>One. If you can't sell it, how are they going to buy it.</v>

294
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.830
<v 1>Black market. So, so, so if, if, if I, if,</v>

295
00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:21.160
if I, if I did this under the radar, okay. So I,

296
00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:24.810
I butcher a chicken in my backyard and the neighbor comes over and buys it from

297
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:27.600
me. Okay. It's legal for him. It's legal for him to buy it.

298
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.060
It's not legal for me to sell it, but every,

299
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:33.660
but everything else in society that we've discerned determined as a hazardous,

300
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.790
a controlled substance hazardous substance,

301
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.530
the prohibition is both on seller and buyer. Right. Uh,

302
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.560
and I don't want to go down that rabbit hole either. I'm a,

303
00:18:43.561 --> 00:18:48.120
I'm a pretty libertarian, you know, drug, uh, let it all go. But, um, but,

304
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:50.750
but without regard to that, the, the,

305
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.510
the prohibitions are equal on even possession.

306
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.560
If you want to, if you want to have a ton of cocaine in your house,

307
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.590
you even, if you just want it over there in a corner, on a pallet. Yeah.

308
00:19:04.591 --> 00:19:06.990
I've got a ton of cocaine here. What, what's wrong with that?

309
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:12.090
You can't have that. Right. But when it comes to food products,

310
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.220
the prohibitions are only on one side and they don't

311
00:19:17.221 --> 00:19:20.910
include if you give it away. So if it was really dangerous,

312
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:22.890
you shouldn't be able to buy it.

313
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.100
You shouldn't be able to possess it and you shouldn't be able to give it away.

314
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:27.420
I.

315
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.340
<v 0>Said, I see what you're saying. Kind of, but the differences, first of all,</v>

316
00:19:30.341 --> 00:19:34.240
cocaine is illegal. Beef's not illegal. And second of all, it's like,

317
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.230
you're trying to, the idea is you're trying to protect the consumer, right?

318
00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:42.490
And I think that they have exceptions for these small situations where you're

319
00:19:42.491 --> 00:19:43.420
the farmer and this,

320
00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:47.740
maybe this guy's growing tomatoes and you trade him some Philemon Yon for some

321
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.820
tomatoes and you have a good deal there. That makes sense that they, you know,

322
00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.660
I think it's more reasonable that they step back and let that happen.

323
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:59.410
But it is odd that they can buy unregulated beef,

324
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:02.410
but you can't sell unregulated beef. So it's like, well,

325
00:20:02.411 --> 00:20:05.890
how'd you get that beef? I bought it. Is it regulated? No. All right.

326
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.140
Don't even go. Who's, who's the criminal selling you than the beef. Yeah.

327
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.240
It's very strange. But.

328
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.970
<v 1>The FA the farmers, the one that's liable,</v>

329
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.860
the buyer that the customer is not, but the same thing is true. I mean,

330
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:25.540
the important let's, let's appreciate too, for example, a wildlife.

331
00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.240
I mean, right now you can go out and, uh,

332
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:33.280
during hunting season and you can shoot a deer and you don't have to worry about

333
00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:36.490
temperature. You don't have to, you don't have to worry about any inspections,

334
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.960
nothing, or a wild pig, right. Squirrel,

335
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:45.370
you can bring that home and there's, there's no inspection, no,

336
00:20:45.371 --> 00:20:49.630
nothing over that. And you can dress that yourself. I mean, you know,

337
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:52.840
butcher it, package it, whatever, feed it to your children.

338
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.620
You can have a block party, invite all your, your block and have, uh, and,

339
00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.500
and feed everybody with that food. That's perfectly legal,

340
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.870
but to do a chicken or a pig or a cow

341
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:10.150
at all on your own and, and sell that,

342
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.830
what is, what is it about,

343
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.360
about selling something that suddenly turns it from benign to hazard?

344
00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.490
<v 0>Well, I think it's just protection for the consumer. And I think it's also like,</v>

345
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.840
it'd be fine if it was a small neighborhood where you knew the farmer and you

346
00:21:24.841 --> 00:21:26.370
had a great, great relationship with them,

347
00:21:26.371 --> 00:21:28.680
but they're talking about doing things at scale. When new,

348
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:32.990
when you're talking about selling food to, you know, a large city, it's,

349
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.600
you can't really just hope the guy did a good job.

350
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.370
That's the argument for regulation.

351
00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:41.340
The argument is that regulation is when things scale up, well,

352
00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:43.500
you need someone to step in and protect the consumers,

353
00:21:43.501 --> 00:21:46.510
because if there is one bad actor, who's not taking care of it.

354
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.350
He has the potential of sickening, thousands of people.

355
00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.710
<v 1>Right. Which is, which is the argument. Exactly.</v>

356
00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:57.180
The argument for decentralizing and de

357
00:21:57.181 --> 00:22:00.780
amalgamating, as opposed to centralizing and amalgamating.

358
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.530
<v 0>Okay. Well, is it a land issue though? Like if you wanted it,</v>

359
00:22:04.531 --> 00:22:08.940
like the factory farms that I've seen in videos where they have these pigs,

360
00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:12.390
they're stuffed next to each other in his large warehouse and the same with the

361
00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:13.170
chickens, right?

362
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.800
How much space would you need to have the same amount of chickens and the same

363
00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:19.740
amount of pigs, if you let them free range. All right.

364
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:21.150
<v 1>Here's, here's my point.</v>

365
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.700
What you don't see in those videos is you don't see the

366
00:22:26.701 --> 00:22:31.590
hundreds of acres growing corn and soybeans to feed them in that

367
00:22:31.591 --> 00:22:35.670
house. The industry wants you to think that this is some sort of, uh, uh,

368
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.030
you know, uh, an island, you know, we're, we're looking,

369
00:22:39.031 --> 00:22:40.440
we're cranking this out of this house.

370
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.560
They're not showing you the tractor trailers, bringing in the grain,

371
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:47.610
bringing in the F and hauling out the manure and the square miles of,

372
00:22:47.611 --> 00:22:49.830
of fields to spread the manure. Okay.

373
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:54.210
They're not showing you how dependent that is on this massive land base.

374
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.990
And so, so on, in the pastured model,

375
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.670
the de-centralized pastured model, instead of having 15,000,

376
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:06.360
I mean, our farm, we're going to raise like 45,000 chickens this summer.

377
00:23:06.361 --> 00:23:09.270
We're not, we're not backyard by any means, but guess what?

378
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:14.070
Those are in 275

379
00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:18.690
bird shelters that are moved every day across pastures.

380
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:24.150
It doesn't take one more acre to produce the feed or

381
00:23:24.151 --> 00:23:28.170
handle the manure, whether the chicken is outside or inside.

382
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.670
The difference is when you come and see our operation, you see all the land.

383
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:37.920
When you see the factory farm, you don't see any of the land, but isn't.

384
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.430
<v 0>It possible that these factory farms are set up where the farms,</v>

385
00:23:41.431 --> 00:23:44.370
where the animals are raised are completely separate.

386
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.770
It's a separate from the farms where the soybeans and the coroner raised, well,

387
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.590
ours is done on the same property. No.

388
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.100
<v 1>It's ours is too. We, we, we buy, we buy our grain from neighbors. Absolutely.</v>

389
00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.270
<v 0>But if they had to grow these animals and grow that food,</v>

390
00:23:58.271 --> 00:24:01.600
would they have enough land to do everything together in the same farm.

391
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.140
<v 1>But there's no need to do it on the same farm.</v>

392
00:24:05.141 --> 00:24:08.860
I'm a big believer in mutual mutual interdependence, uh,

393
00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:12.280
not complete independence. We don't have any intention to grow our own grain.

394
00:24:12.281 --> 00:24:15.040
We, we don't have the soils for it. We don't have the equipment for it.

395
00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:19.240
We don't have the skill set for it. So we buy from neighbors who do GMO-free,

396
00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:23.230
non-genetically modified GMO-free grain, uh, and,

397
00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.940
and we give them more than they would on a commodity on a commodity

398
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.920
scale. Um,

399
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.480
and so they love us because we're giving them more per bushel and they have a

400
00:24:34.481 --> 00:24:38.800
nice secure buyer and they're local, they're close. Uh, you know,

401
00:24:38.801 --> 00:24:43.540
we're not getting it from, you know, uh, foreign countries and it's all close.

402
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:45.970
So what happens is in,

403
00:24:45.971 --> 00:24:48.850
in the kind of situation I'm describing,

404
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.660
instead of having a fundamentally segregated food system,

405
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.790
you have a fundamentally integrated.

406
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.100
<v 0>I see what you're saying is what happens,</v>

407
00:24:57.101 --> 00:24:58.600
strong relationship with people growing. Yeah.

408
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.230
<v 1>So for example, I mean, you started the discussion with can Los Angeles,</v>

409
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.070
you know, there's enough land to feed Los Angeles, you know, that, uh, and we,

410
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.010
and we could discuss whether there's where the Los Angeles should be as big as

411
00:25:09.011 --> 00:25:12.400
it is. I mean, that's a valid discussion. It's a very valid discussion, but,

412
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:17.380
but, but Le we, we can go there, but first, let me just say that if California,

413
00:25:17.381 --> 00:25:20.830
for example, did not export,

414
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.780
I don't know what the percentage is, but it's huge, you know, Allman's, uh,

415
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:30.640
all over the world. If California is centered on feeding California,

416
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.520
there's absolutely enough here to feed California. Okay. I mean, Iowa,

417
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.890
Iowa imports,

418
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:43.780
90% Iowa is probably the most fertile place in the world

419
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.020
and they only eat only,

420
00:25:47.021 --> 00:25:51.550
only 10% of the food consumed in Iowa is grown in Iowa

421
00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.140
and processed in Iowa. That's pretty crazy. It is crazy Hawaii,

422
00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:57.760
only 5%,

423
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:02.680
95% comes from off Hawaii. I mean, they've got ranches.

424
00:26:02.681 --> 00:26:03.401
They've got, I mean,

425
00:26:03.401 --> 00:26:07.990
why would you have to import stuff if you can grow pineapples, pineapples,

426
00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:12.910
and, uh, you know, macadamia nuts in your backyard, come on, you know? Um,

427
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:18.250
so there's a, there's a huge, there's a huge disconnect. I mean, um,

428
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:20.560
the, the, the, the, the pro the,

429
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.770
and this is one of the reasons that we're having this. I think this,

430
00:26:23.771 --> 00:26:28.030
this blow back from nature is that instead of having a fundamentally

431
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:33.100
integrated system, I mean, think of how, uh, in Switzerland, you know,

432
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.400
they take the cows up to the mountain, pastures, they milk,

433
00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:41.110
and the milk flows down, uh, uh, the, and they make cheese up there.

434
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.750
The way from the cheese goes into the, into the pigs,

435
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:47.700
the pigs eat the way.

436
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.830
And so instead of transporting milk to a centralized

437
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:56.580
cheesemaker and pigs to a centralized processor,

438
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.670
they're actually making the cheese on site.

439
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:04.380
So all they've got to actually transport is cheese and,

440
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:09.450
um, and, and pork. So they slaughter, they slaughter, you know,

441
00:27:09.451 --> 00:27:13.950
contiguous near, nearby, not on the same farm necessarily, but, but nearby.

442
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.780
So you don't have all this transportation.

443
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:19.440
What you have is a fundamentally de-centralized. We could even say,

444
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:24.420
democratized, can we say food, distance, food,

445
00:27:24.421 --> 00:27:27.790
food, food, distancing, um, that,

446
00:27:27.791 --> 00:27:30.360
that creates resiliency in the system.

447
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:35.310
So instead of being tied to these a hundred or 150 mega processing

448
00:27:35.311 --> 00:27:40.110
facilities, we're, de-centralized throughout the land fan base.

449
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:44.260
<v 0>W how much more money do you think it would cost for food? We,</v>

450
00:27:44.261 --> 00:27:45.630
we kind of touched on this earlier,

451
00:27:45.631 --> 00:27:50.370
but if you're dealing with this more natural based system,

452
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:53.010
and it's more complex, it's going to require more people,

453
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.220
and it's going to require a complete restructuring of the system that's

454
00:27:56.221 --> 00:27:57.054
currently in place.

455
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:02.160
<v 1>Um, I think I don't have a figure, uh, for.</v>

456
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.090
<v 0>Science. Well, I.</v>

457
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.210
<v 1>Think, I think in general it would be probably double what you'd pay at Costco.</v>

458
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.450
<v 0>Yeah. That's an issue for a lot of folks though. Right.</v>

459
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:15.270
<v 1>But now think about this, think about this. Um,</v>

460
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.500
you, uh, oh man, where do you start with this? Um,

461
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.180
first of all, you're gonna, you're going to offer a lot of jobs there.

462
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:29.760
A lot of people that are going to be looking for jobs right now. So,

463
00:28:29.761 --> 00:28:34.020
so this offers a lot of job opportunities. Number two,

464
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.160
it's much more healing on the land. Number three,

465
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:42.990
you don't have all the pathogenicity, you know, uh, you don't have to use, uh,

466
00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:47.070
drugs, antibiotics. I mean, our, our, our meat doesn't do drugs. Okay.

467
00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:50.310
Our dinner doesn't do drugs. Uh, people don't realize that, you know,

468
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:52.890
two thirds of the drugs used in the country, aren't in people,

469
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:56.490
they're in animals. Okay. So you don't have those issues.

470
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.480
There are a lot of issues that you, that you don't have. And those,

471
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:02.430
those add up in the big picture.

472
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:06.660
So I always tell people our food is the cheapest aggregate

473
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:11.550
food. There is. We just put all the costs in all our,

474
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:16.020
all our costs are in. Okay. And so we're not,

475
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:18.840
we're not asking taxpayers society, the planet.

476
00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.320
We're not asking them to pick up the tab for, you know, for cheating, for,

477
00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:23.700
for cutting, for cutting corners.

478
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:25.750
<v 0>And.</v>

479
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.660
<v 1>What's, what's interesting is that that, uh, 40 years ago, right now,</v>

480
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:34.830
today 9% of the average, um,

481
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.970
person's income, 9% is spent on food. That's our average in our country,

482
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.990
40 years ago, it was 18, 40 years ago.

483
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.240
9% of our personal income was spent on healthcare today.

484
00:29:49.241 --> 00:29:53.950
That's 18%. Uh, isn't that interesting? How those have inverted? Yeah.

485
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.010
Those have inverted in rough, in roughly 40 years.

486
00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.240
Ever since the USDA called the USDA, uh,

487
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.320
created the food pyramid and put Twinkies and cocoa puffs on the bottom as a

488
00:30:05.321 --> 00:30:09.730
foundational. And you can track the diabetes.

489
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.770
Uh, you can track obesity,

490
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:14.860
you can track all of these things right through from that time.

491
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:22.920
