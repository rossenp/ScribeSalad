00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 1>Experience the man. Have you heard of hyperbaracks? Yes, this.</v>

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.480
<v 0>Is, I know. Um, yuiah Faber used it quite a bit after his fight with Jo Aldo.</v>

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.400
Yeah. When Aldo his leg up and his, his.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.040
<v 1>Legswollen up real bad. I'm telling you,</v>

6
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.280
this is one of the biggest game changers.

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.640
I love the float mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, go float tanks.

8
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.150
I've done it at least 50 times, uh, at float O KC in Oklahoma,

9
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.710
my wife and I that's our date night. Once a week, we go and we do that.

10
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:30.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, and I, I float fight week, at least twice a week.

11
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.110
I really believe in floating. Um,

12
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.390
hyperbaracks is unlike anything I've ever done and felt immediate long lasting

13
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:38.910
benefits from like, how so,

14
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.500
what does it make you feel like I get better sleep than I' ever, ever gotten.

15
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.580
That was instant almost. I mean, I noticed it the first night,

16
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:48.500
the second night I've done over 20 treatments now of hyperbarics you get in the

17
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.100
tank, um, you put on an oxygen mask and,

18
00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:54.940
and they fill the tank up with oxygen and you lay there for an hour and a half

19
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:57.140
to two hours. Some people only takes an hour, but I'm bigger.

20
00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.900
And they take me to a lower depth mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then my ears kind of

21
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.050
mess up on me a little bit on flights. Um,

22
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.890
they kinda gets clogged up or whatever because of the hyperbaric chamber. No,

23
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.050
it's just, they've always done that on planes. Okay.

24
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.650
And so it's like you're in a plane when you're in the hyperbarics and what it

25
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:15.690
does is it pressurizes the oxygen down into your cells.

26
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.410
So it's literally going into your mitochondria.

27
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.970
That's what the new studies are showing the oxygen gets in there in a,

28
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.320
it promotes healing and in your brain,

29
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.320
it literally brings blood flow into every part of the brain that needs it.

30
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.960
So it's one of the best things after a concussion. Ah,

31
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.120
so I was with Rayen and what's, I I'm one of those guys that sometimes thinks,

32
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.440
um, everything happens for a reason, you know, or there's,

33
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:42.400
there's not a lot ofences I just started hyperbaracks two or three days before

34
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.630
where I met Rayden, then I'm doing it.

35
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.390
And they're saying it's one of the best things for concussions.

36
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.430
Rayden gets a concussion from one of those fights. Um,

37
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.270
or maybe it was one of the ones that wasn't on the fight,

38
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:56.270
but they diagnosed him. I with the doctors and his mom and his dad,

39
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.270
whenever the doctor says, I think he really has a concussion,

40
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.750
did some testing on him, wrote a prescription and said, Hey,

41
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.540
I think he needs to do hyperbarics.

42
00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.140
That's one of the best things for concussions now. And I was like,

43
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.620
I just started. And so literally that day, the doctor,

44
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.860
hands him a prescription for hyperbaracks and then I take him in there and get

45
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:14.694
hyperbaracks.

46
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.220
And this is probably the story I wanted to share with you about hyperbarics the

47
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:23.140
most there's this kid named Caleb Freeman and he just made NBC nightly news. Um,

48
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.290
a I think Fox news and ABC, um,

49
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.490
he's making the news everywhere because of his comeback story.

50
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.850
The kid probably should have never been able to eat again on his own,

51
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.690
especially never be able to walk.

52
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.850
His parents were told that he would be left in a vegetative state.

53
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.730
And if you have that Caleb Freeman video,

54
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.610
because of he got in a vicious car accident, 16 years old,

55
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.760
he just started driving.

56
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.520
He was the number one cross country runner at his school,

57
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.080
but also in his district. And then he got in this brutal car accident.

58
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.320
Here's the video of him trying to learn to put up the finger. Number one, again,

59
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.440
there's a, he's trying to do a one that's his dad kind of coaching him,

60
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.040
but he was the number one cross country runner.

61
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.560
Now he is trying to get him to do a thumbs up.

62
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.480
And this is all for a high brain dive. Yep.

63
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.640
Traumatic brain injury driving down the road, hit, hit a, uh,

64
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.080
what's it hydroplained, &lt;affirmative&gt; got in a brutal wreck. Um,

65
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.830
and they thought he would be left in a vegetative state for the wreck rest of

66
00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.230
his life. So you can see right here,

67
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.870
his muscles are so arophied mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because he had been in like a,

68
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.470
I think he was in a coma or he was, um, in intensive care for so long. Um,

69
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.110
and so his dad's trying to get him to do a thumbs up. You know,

70
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:34.830
he is trying his hardest to do that. If you can go to the second video, um,

71
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.230
and they're telling him,

72
00:03:36.231 --> 00:03:39.860
you should really try hyperbaracks they' everything you can.

73
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.060
And so the whole community has rallied around him in Oklahoma. Um,

74
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.580
he's from new castle where one of our board members are from,

75
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.860
and they're trying to help him learn to walk again, assist it.

76
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.340
I don't know what they have in the, did he break his arm? Yeah.

77
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.580
He broke his arm. He, he fall down, break his arm.

78
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.660
Cause in the other picture seemed like he didn't have the, um,

79
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.410
actually don't know post accident. Yeah. This is post accident.

80
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:04.570
So maybe this was before that other video. Um,

81
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.850
so which video are you trying to show then? Um,

82
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.690
but trying to show you both of these,

83
00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:12.690
because this is how far gone he was mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then after 40

84
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.250
hyperbaric treatments, they say, get 'em in there,

85
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:18.050
it'll flood his brain with oxygen, right? When it has the oxygen,

86
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.490
it'll reproduce, uh,

87
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.040
the bloods flow and they'll bring actual healing into his brain.

88
00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.360
And so that third video, um, is right here. He's literally,

89
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.160
he was the number one cross country runner at his school.

90
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.640
So now he's trying to learn how to do cross country. Again,

91
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.720
he was ever supposed to walk again on his own.

92
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.760
He came in there to the hyperbaracks assisted.

93
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.750
Like you saw where people are assisting him on both sides.

94
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.670
He does 40 treatments of hyperbaracks and then all of a sudden he walks up and

95
00:04:47.671 --> 00:04:52.630
down the football field, 14 times unassisted, nothing changed, um,

96
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.830
just 40 hyperbaric treatments and doctors. Like you gotta keep doing this. Yeah,

97
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.070
yeah. That next video is actually him.

98
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.820
That's a JPEG that's us at hyperbarics with Rayden.

99
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.300
That's the young man that got the concussion on the right.

100
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.620
And this video right here. I don't know if there's volume, but, uh,

101
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.340
this is actually a pretty special video.

102
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.100
This is after 80 treatments,

103
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.300
he's literally finishing his cross country run again.

104
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.890
And he was never supposed to walk and that's after like three or five miles.

105
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.530
Wow. And so, and how's his ability to communicate? Is that coming back as well?

106
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:28.450
Yeah, he was actually texting me, uh, this morning.

107
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.330
He texted me that picture of us and Ray. Wow. Um, and his,

108
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.610
his dad actually forgot. He goes, he goes, where,

109
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:38.050
where do we take that picture again? And, uh, or I don't have it saved.

110
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.400
And Caleb goes, it's in your phone, dad, just look. And so he he's,

111
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.640
he's able to recollect a lot of different stuff. That's amazing.

112
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.760
So this is all something that you're, uh, experiencing as well for your, yeah.

113
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:52.000
Your treatment for the parasites. Yep. And I I've,

114
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.600
I've literally never gotten better sleep.

115
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.880
I feel more positive when I come out of it. Um,

116
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.920
and then I feel like I can focus better because one of the things that they saw

117
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.080
in my brain scans where I have PTSD and then I have real, uh,

118
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.720
severe a D D um, and they can see that on the Fu how my brain functions,

119
00:06:09.721 --> 00:06:12.360
they guess there's like eight different types of a D brains.

120
00:06:12.361 --> 00:06:14.720
Don't put me in one of the things. I don't even want to know.

121
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.593
I think you need to do it.

122
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.750
I don't even want know what's you then Dr. Aman's awesome, man. And so then I,

123
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.430
I have that. And then, so going into the oxygen,

124
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.150
they can see from scan one to scan two mm-hmm,

125
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.390
&lt;affirmative&gt; how my brain is actually functioning better. And, uh,

126
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.990
the spots with a D have kind of cooled off a little bit. Um,

127
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:37.660
the spots with PTSD have literally kind of gone down a little bit. Um,

128
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.340
and so that was Caleb's story.

129
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:44.100
There's also this girl named Eden Carlson in Eden Carlson.

130
00:06:44.101 --> 00:06:48.860
There's like a minute clip, um, on the New York post and they did it on YouTube.

131
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.940
This girl drowned for two hours.

132
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.940
She was facing float down in a pool or face down in a pool.

133
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.570
Her mom pulled her out at maybe 15 minute. She drowned for two hours.

134
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.210
She didn't breathe. She didn't have a heartbeat. Um, and then at the hospital,

135
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.330
they miraculously got her back. Her story's all over. If you just Google Eden,

136
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.650
she was dead for two hours, two hours, Eden Carlson,

137
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.890
E D E N Carlson. Um,

138
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:19.200
she's the first one to, uh, have brain damage reversal,

139
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.280
scientifically proven. They've done all the MRIs and cat scans. Wow.

140
00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:26.760
From the hyperbarics from hyperbarics one of the first things they need to do

141
00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:30.760
for victims. Man. I think this is worth trying to pull up one of those videos.

142
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.160
Um, it's New York post Eden play those. Oh, okay. You can't post. I plays that,

143
00:07:35.161 --> 00:07:36.360
but literally, um,

144
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.950
there's a Eden Carlson video on YouTube and it's wild to

145
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:46.470
see how she's recovered and how they told her she would never be able to eat

146
00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:48.950
again. Never be able to go to school, never be able to do that.

147
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.510
Now she's basically a normal a girl, again, know, look at her there. Yeah.

148
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:53.430
So cute. Right there.

149
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.990
<v 0>A little smile. That's amazing.</v>

150
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.780
<v 1>Her mom is like a huge advocate for it. Now that's a incredible, and.</v>

151
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.020
<v 0>Uh, now, but with you, what do they have to do?</v>

152
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.540
Like they have to find out whether on the parasites are still in your system,

153
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.220
&lt;affirmative&gt; identify the parasites, cuz it could be an.

154
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.300
<v 1>Unknown parasite. Right?</v>

155
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.500
Well they know it's STO and if I've had STO in me for as long as they think they

156
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:19.380
don't think it started in April, they think maybe that was another, not an on,

157
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.890
but took it to another level when I went there and got sick. Um,

158
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.770
and it was brutal. I mean, I was hugging basically the, the, the, uh,

159
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:33.730
not the toilet, but the, um, uh, the latrine mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

160
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:37.410
while I was in Uganda, in April, uh, in may now, I mean, I was just so sick.

161
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.290
This hyperbaric.

162
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.200
<v 0>Is helping you, but you you're still not, not able to train right now.</v>

163
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:43.880
Like you're not, you're not like you don't have a fight schedule at time.

164
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:44.880
<v 1>I don't have a fight scheduled,</v>

165
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:47.800
but I would like to fight first quarter of next year if I can. Is.

166
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.560
<v 0>That literally possible? I mean, if.</v>

167
00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.760
<v 1>You're not six months from now, I have another follow up appointment here.</v>

168
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:57.920
Uh-huh in March and we're gonna have a lot more data to show like

169
00:08:57.921 --> 00:09:02.680
from my blood work to my bacteria in my stomach, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

170
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.240
to, uh, those brain scans are gonna be the big thing that show, um,

171
00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:11.480
how my brain has started to heal how my body started to feel. Right. Um,

172
00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.720
and show my health just increasing.

173
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.030
And so that's the goal I'm on this mission to get, get healthy. Um,

174
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.430
so I can fight again, but also just so that I can function better. Yeah. Um,

175
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.830
and have like, not these big swings.

176
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.550
So the hyperbaric chamber is helping you yeah. Big time,

177
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.830
but yet you're still feeling some serious yeah. Significance. I,

178
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:34.950
I just started the hyperbarics a month ago. Okay. So I'm 20 treatments in, I,

179
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.660
I need to get, um, 40 done as soon as possible. Um,

180
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.540
and then they think I'll probably do another round of 40. Um, and then yeah, I,

181
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:47.100
I, I mean seeing how, how Caleb's doing mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I mean,

182
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.020
Caleb told, Caleb showed me this, this is wild.

183
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.260
I come in and I'm, uh,

184
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:58.290
about to get in the chamber with him and he shows me his hand shaking and

185
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.290
he's showing me, I don't know what that's called, but it's whenever, um, uh,

186
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.650
is that when Parkinson's and different stuff,

187
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:07.970
like you have those kind of shakes mm-hmm you in your hand can sure. Uh,

188
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.050
or Alzheimer's or whatever that is. Um,

189
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:14.930
so Caleb's got that and he gets in the chamber. 90 minutes later, we get out,

190
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.280
he shows me his hand and it's completely steel and he can put contacts back in

191
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:20.120
his eyes. Whoa.

192
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.560
But before there's no way at all that he can get contacts in his eyes

193
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.040
afterwards, his body's calmed down enough.

194
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.000
His brain has enough oxygen and blood flow in it that he can put his contacts

195
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:34.560
back in on his own. That's insane. Yeah. So Rayden, um,

196
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.870
his parents say that he was always up and down in the middle of the night and

197
00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:40.670
that they would have to try to put him back to sleep. Um, and now he just,

198
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:43.950
once he's asleep, he's asleep until they wake him up. Um,

199
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.030
they think it's helping with his autism, his diabetes, um,

200
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.390
his AC one levels or whatever those are called. Those have started to come down.

201
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.310
And what the doctors have told us is like, there's nothing better.

202
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.620
The doctors take a oath that say to do no harm. Mm-hmm,

203
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.260
&lt;affirmative&gt; like that's first and foremost is to do no harm. And they're like,

204
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.740
if someone has a concussion or if someone has autism, or if someone has, um,

205
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.420
this bacteria or a parasite that might be in the brain,

206
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.460
why not flood the body on a cellular level? Oh,

207
00:11:15.461 --> 00:11:17.890
you're gonna love this part that can increase your,

208
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.250
your stem cells by eight times in your body. Wow.

209
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:25.250
So it's one of the best treatments for whenever you have the stem cells injected

210
00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.070
in you mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

211
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:29.850
So I had themcs the meinkial stem cellshmm for my hip,

212
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.650
put my shoulder mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they said one of the best things I could

213
00:11:32.651 --> 00:11:33.251
have done for it.

214
00:11:33.251 --> 00:11:37.210
Would've been to get in a hyperbaric chamber because that would, um,

215
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.080
promote the,

216
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.360
the stem cell growth and life of the stem cells because they're cells and you're

217
00:11:42.361 --> 00:11:45.880
pushing oxygen into the cells. Yeah. And increasing blood flow into it.

218
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.840
And you're extending their life. Wow. And helping them reproduce.

219
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.200
So it's one of the best things out there, Joe. I,

220
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.400
I wouldn't be talking about it like this without, uh, Rafael is getting into it.

221
00:11:56.401 --> 00:11:59.160
Joe namoth Joe namoth has his own, um,

222
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.600
clinic now for hyperbaracks.

223
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.320
<v 0>Yeah. He's doing that through reverses brain trauma for football. Right.</v>

224
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:05.360
<v 1>I read about that. Right.</v>

225
00:12:05.361 --> 00:12:08.920
And it's the first time there's ever been documented cases of brain trauma

226
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.200
reversal, where if you can heal your brain,

227
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.190
you basically heal your life where you have a healthy brain,

228
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:15.870
you have a healthy life.

229
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.111
<v 0>Dude.</v>

230
00:12:16.111 --> 00:12:19.950
We need a hyperbaric chamber in here' they have one'm saying you buy portable.

231
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.150
<v 1>Units. Yeah, absolutely. I use something called a secst,</v>

232
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:25.110
which I think you would really like, it's the hard chamber it's glass.

233
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.550
You have one in your house. No,

234
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.070
but the secrets one or there's Joe ammo doing it.

235
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.190
I think Michael Phelps does it, you know, getting in the water much.

236
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.203
<v 0>Why get that?</v>

237
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.820
<v 1>Wow. Literally it's wild at how, how much stuff it actually. So what.</v>

238
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.140
<v 0>What's the prognosis like with you, with the doctors that,</v>

239
00:12:43.141 --> 00:12:45.860
that have looked for parasites or doing all this blood scan,

240
00:12:45.861 --> 00:12:48.540
do they think that they're gonna be able to straighten you out? They think so.

241
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:49.261
<v 1>Yeah. They think,</v>

242
00:12:49.261 --> 00:12:54.250
they think with doing a holistic approach where medication can come in. Um,

243
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.690
at a later date, I had this doctor that's. Oh, you have PTSD.

244
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.690
Here's these pills. Mm oh, you have depression. Here's these pills. Yeah. Uh,

245
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.570
okay. Now, now you're starting to have anxiety for the first time in your life.

246
00:13:05.571 --> 00:13:09.890
You've never had it before. Here's some more pills. Um, of course. Oh,

247
00:13:09.891 --> 00:13:11.290
you think you have a D D here's some more pills.

248
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.730
They put me on three or four different pills at the same time.

249
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.320
I started feeling like a zombie. Yeah. Uh, like a zombie. I felt weird.

250
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.840
I felt like I started having like electricity running through my veins or

251
00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:25.920
something like, like, uh, my muscle started twitching. My eyelid was, uh,

252
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.760
constantly spasming. So you did.

253
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.360
<v 0>The doctors that have looked at this, all the different,</v>

254
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:33.600
various ailments that you have, like, and they don't want you to do pills.

255
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.670
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so what do they want you to do?

256
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:37.790
And what do they think is gonna be able to happen?

257
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.350
They think you'll be able to fight again.

258
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.350
<v 1>Are there, um, so Dr. Aman, he's a guy that says, man,</v>

259
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.830
our brains are the, literally you can live,

260
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.350
they can do lung transplants. Right. And heart transplants,

261
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.310
kidney transplants, like you can't do a brain transplant. Right.

262
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.380
And so he's saying that anyone that's in a brain damaging occupation.

263
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.020
And he said, whether that's fighting football or even being a firefighter,

264
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.540
because that is a brain damaging occupation,

265
00:14:05.541 --> 00:14:08.500
you're breathing in burning couches,

266
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:12.860
which are putting off all these harmful chemicals. Um, and so he said,

267
00:14:12.861 --> 00:14:17.850
you want to protect it and promote your brain health as much as you

268
00:14:17.851 --> 00:14:21.090
possibly can. Right. Um, so he's a brilliant guy and, um,

269
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.450
he's gonna be on weekly calls with me, guiding me, uh,

270
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.170
keeping me accountable on how am I protecting my sleep? How am I,

271
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.090
what am I getting to eat? Uh, you know, also supplementation,

272
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.600
uh, what's that one that you are on here are what Davidson Claire talking about.

273
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:42.800
NN. Uh it's like that rolls rverol yes.

274
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.600
<v 0>That one. Yeah. It's not a drugs. It's uh, interaccident drugs. Yeah. Okay.</v>

275
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.160
<v 1>Well that, plus some of the other things that you guys were talking about,</v>

276
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.000
like they're all in his, um, supplements where he tells you,

277
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.160
go get these supplements from here and here and make sure that you're optimizing

278
00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:56.800
your brain health.
