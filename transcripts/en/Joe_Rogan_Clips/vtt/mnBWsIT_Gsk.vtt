00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 1>Experience. When people talk about, um,</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.540
Russia collusion and they talk about, we, we kind of lost our way. Right. And,

4
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.280
you know, everybody's kind of guilty of it,

5
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:12.930
whether it's Mueller and his investigative team,

6
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.820
or whether it's Congress or whether it's just the general public,

7
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.280
we all kind of lost a way over the past couple of years,

8
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.570
imagining somehow that the big story here was, uh,

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.560
Trump's collusion. Right? Well, that was a political Dodge, right?

10
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:27.570
That was a shell game that was being played on us.

11
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.280
It was the big story is what did Russia specifically do?

12
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.670
Right? What exactly did they do? How did they do it?

13
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:40.110
How successful were they show us some case studies of specific examples.

14
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.800
That's what an investigative team should have been doing for two years and then

15
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:48.510
deliver that information and keep throwing it out at the public and keep

16
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:52.720
talking to the public about it. A guarantee of the, the, the, the GRU and, uh,

17
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:56.760
and, and others, uh, the FSU at the, in, in the Intel services, in the,

18
00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:00.570
in Russia, they're happy that we didn't do that, right? Because again,

19
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.780
they've been in advancing, they've been improving their, their capabilities.

20
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.040
They're going to do it again.

21
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.990
So I guess that's why I keep beating on this is that I don't think we,

22
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.990
we really focused our attention where we needed to,

23
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:13.260
because we all get lost in this political. And.

24
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.610
<v 0>Well, I feel,</v>

25
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.750
I feel like this is the most easily manipulated we've ever been as a,

26
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.400
as a culture. Like,

27
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.290
I think it's so easy to spin these narratives and to get people upset

28
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.490
about anything. Right. And I th I feel like a lot of these are test cases.

29
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.390
Like they're trying to see, like, what happens when we spin up this story? How,

30
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.720
how outraged did they get at that story? Like.

31
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.660
<v 1>Well, look it, and look at this, look at the issue of racism, you know,</v>

32
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.720
look at it, look at, I mean,

33
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.750
th th that thing gets thrown out there now to the point where it's, it's,

34
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.770
you know? Yeah. I hate to say it, but it's, it's almost losing its,

35
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.070
its meaning in a sense, right.

36
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.210
They just keep hammering away and any anybody they disagree with and I'm talking

37
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:55.260
about, uh, the, the, the hard left of progressive you're a racist, right?

38
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.770
It's not possible that you could possibly disagree on policy, right? Like the,

39
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.120
the, whatever that's a squad, you know, AOC and her competitors.

40
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.790
I don't give a about, you know, where they're from.

41
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.790
I care about the fact that their policies, from my perspective,

42
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.450
other people I'm sure love them, you know, a screwed up and screwed up about.

43
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.200
<v 0>Their policies.</v>

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.640
<v 1>Well, um, I'm not a democratic socialist, right?</v>

45
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.770
So, um, I,

46
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.200
I have a problem with everything from you look at the green new deal, right?

47
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.940
And this idea that we're going to roll this out and the economic impact we know,

48
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.570
or I specifically talking about the economic impact.

49
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:34.800
I think what they're doing is they're just,

50
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:39.570
they're playing to their base and they're doing it successfully and

51
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.850
people hear about it and nobody wants to be righteous.

52
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.430
Everybody wants to think sure. If I care about the environment,

53
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.680
let's get rid of emissions, that'll be a great idea.

54
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.050
And whether it's that or open borders, um, and the idea that somehow we're,

55
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.700
you know, do I think we're running concentration camps down south? No,

56
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.040
I don't think that that that's up, that we would,

57
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.800
that's the terminology that we would have, right.

58
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.890
For detainments for detainment centers and you know, what you want to you,

59
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.920
you want to make it better. Well, great. Let's,

60
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.340
let's actually do what your job is. Let's make some changes to the, to the,

61
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:16.480
to the, uh, immigration rules and to, to asylum laws. Let's, uh,

62
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.940
put some more money down there, um,

63
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.580
and make conditions a little bit better.

64
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:25.180
There's things that we could in terms of concrete steps, but we don't,

65
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.530
we don't seem to want to do that.

66
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:31.450
We seem to want to just throw around at each other. And, and I, I,

67
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.750
but the open border Singh is, is, is, uh, is, is worrisome.

68
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.770
<v 0>There's a guy named John Norris who was just on, um, uh, my friend,</v>

69
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.960
Steve Rinella, his podcast, it's called the mediator podcast. And he's a, uh,

70
00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:44.860
a warden he's a game warden.

71
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.070
And one of the things that they had to deal with somewhere along the line was

72
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:51.460
they had to become enforcers for illegal drug, uh,

73
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.240
drug, marijuana growing, um,

74
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.800
these establishments in public lands in national parks.

75
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.450
So these guys that were supposed to be just catching people with too many trout

76
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.500
on the stringer are now being forced to stop illegal grow ops.

77
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.390
And it's all cartel members.

78
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.580
And what he's saying is that 80 to 90% of all of the marijuana

79
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.010
that gets sold illegally in this country,

80
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:21.250
in the Midwest and all these different places where it's illegal is coming out

81
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:22.240
of these grow ups.

82
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.560
And a lot of it is tainted with dangerous pesticides because these guys are

83
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.394
trying to,

84
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.700
they're actually using poisons to keep animals from eating the marijuana.

85
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.910
So these kids that are, or whoever the is buying it,

86
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:37.990
they're buying this pot from these illegal places. No, one's testing this stuff.

87
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.260
You don't know what the you're getting. And you very well could be smoking pot.

88
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.243
That's poisoning you.

89
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.120
<v 1>Yeah. There's uh, uh, a guy that I know really good guy.</v>

90
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.490
So he's a huge landowner here in California, uh,

91
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.210
to the point where you can spend all day on an ATV and still not, you know,

92
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.910
get to the end of one of his, uh, plots of land.

93
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.410
I don't know if you call it a plot of land. And anyway, he's had those, uh,

94
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.950
incidents, right. He's had where they, it's such a massive, uh,

95
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.440
piece of property that, uh,

96
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.460
a small element from a cartel will set up a grow spot there.

97
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.300
And you know, they'll camouflage. It it's very well done. Uh,

98
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.670
they bring in the piping for the water,

99
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.830
cause it w pot uses a huge amount of water.

100
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.690
<v 0>That's I was talking about one of them, they brought in,</v>

101
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.580
they had a pipe that went for three miles. Yeah.

102
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.350
These kids carried it on their back. Yeah.

103
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.780
<v 1>See, that's what these guys do. And then, and then eventually, you know,</v>

104
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.810
you gotta go in there and bust it up, but it's,

105
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.760
it's people that stumble across it that, you know,

106
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.230
they're just out there doing their regular ranching job and, and it it's it's,

107
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.020
it is fascinating. I like, I don't know. Um.

108
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.780
<v 0>I feel like we should take those guys and reprogram them.</v>

109
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.410
You get a guy who's willing to carry a hundred pounds of piping on his back and

110
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:48.340
walk eight miles into the Backwoods. That's a industrious individual.

111
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.520
You got to, you got to Laura, I'm away from the cartel with a better deal.

112
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.990
Cause that guy worked for a, uh, competing corporation. He'd be like, look,

113
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:57.650
I like the way you do right.

114
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.880
<v 1>Give him a job on the ranch. And I.</v>

115
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.240
<v 0>Found this guy and he was working for Verizon. They'd be like, Hey,</v>

116
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.860
come on over here, man.

117
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.140
You're putting in the time this guy's carrying three miles of hose on his back,

118
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.130
that's work. That's it.

119
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.700
<v 1>That's what we call it. Yeah. So use that. You use your power for good,</v>

120
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:15.980
not evil. That's what I tell my boys. It's hard.

121
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.210
<v 0>Though, because evil's font. I think.</v>

122
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.610
<v 1>It's a way within the short term, it could be more lucrative. Yeah. Right.</v>

123
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.490
<v 0>There is that. And they have a record and probably murderer as well.</v>

124
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.661
<v 1>All right.</v>

125
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:29.540
So maybe we're not talking about someone you're going to hire as a landscaper.

126
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.960
They're your home. But, uh, but you do, your point is open borders.

127
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.610
<v 0>Open borders, not a good idea. There's a lot of bad people that are getting in.</v>

128
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.520
<v 1>And it's not, it's not a stretch. This is not,</v>

129
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:42.710
if anybody who imagines this to be a stretcher,

130
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:46.490
or it's going to take offense at this, every nation maintains borders,

131
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.750
every nation maintain some element of, of immigration controls and,

132
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.510
and borders, uh, protection. Um,

133
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.020
the idea that we shouldn't have that we should somehow feel exceptionally bad

134
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.590
about it is, is I don't quite understand that mentality.

135
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.090
<v 0>Well, we should feel bad when we see someone who's just a poor mother.</v>

136
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.120
Who's trying to come over to America to get a better job because she's stuck in

137
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.100
Guatemala and it sucks over there.

138
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:13.160
And there's no opportunity whatsoever for her to Excel. Right?

139
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.810
That's a different animal than someone who is a member of some

140
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.370
terrible cartel gang that comes over.

141
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.450
The question is how do we differentiate and how do we make it? So that,

142
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.750
that woman who's a mom can come over here. Right? How do we make it?

143
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.850
So it's legal. That's the real question. Right.

144
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.280
<v 1>And that's when I was, but that's not what they're addressing. Right. Right.</v>

145
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.801
Yeah. Well,

146
00:07:31.801 --> 00:07:36.110
how many decades now have we heard about immigration controls and immigration

147
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:39.830
process and regulations and policy and then nothing ever gets done?

148
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.530
And so it may be, and again,

149
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.950
I think one of the things that's interesting about Trump, um,

150
00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:50.390
is as, as, as strange as, as it is the environment,

151
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:55.160
I mean maybe the fact that he is disruptive and sometimes it doesn't seem to

152
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:56.750
give a. Maybe that's a good thing.

153
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.500
Cause it gets us talking and gets us talking in areas that we haven't before and

154
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:01.700
in ways that we haven't before.

155
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:05.510
So maybe that results in something maybe like the Chinese, uh,

156
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.250
the public's just going to wait for him to go.

157
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.100
And then it will get back to business as usual that may.

158
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.340
<v 0>And even business as usual. The concern is like, if,</v>

159
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.050
how do you differentiate between someone who's coming in illegally because they

160
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:21.350
want a better life versus someone who's coming in illegally because they're

161
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:26.330
literally going to commit murder and sell fentanyl and deal, you know,

162
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.230
incredible harm to whatever community they wind up in.

163
00:08:30.231 --> 00:08:32.940
And they're a member of Ms. 13, and they're going to hear,

164
00:08:32.941 --> 00:08:35.000
there's both things that are going on at the same time.

165
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:36.020
And you're a heartless person.

166
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:39.110
If you don't want that lady with a child from Guatemala to come over here and do

167
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.390
better. And she's probably going to work as hard,

168
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:44.690
if not harder than any good old-fashioned red blooded American,

169
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:46.490
that's over here trying to make their way through this world.

170
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:49.820
And why should we be able to have this opportunity when they can't one of the

171
00:08:49.821 --> 00:08:51.350
beautiful things about America, right? Is that like,

172
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:53.930
if you're a poor person and you live in Baltimore,

173
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:58.860
you can get your and get out and you can move to maybe Silicon valley or you

174
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:00.720
can move somewhere where there's more prosperity,

175
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:02.580
there's more opportunity and you can get something.

176
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.470
<v 1>Or they're poor people in Baltimore. Uh, I heard there are.</v>

177
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.840
<v 0>I heard there's I gotta pay attention. Some sort of a, there's a word.</v>

178
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.820
What is the word? He used infestation.

179
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.680
<v 1>Infestation of rat infestation.</v>

180
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.890
<v 0>You can't use infestation when you're talking about certain neighborhoods.</v>

181
00:09:16.891 --> 00:09:20.520
People get mad, even though he said infested with crime and rats, he's still.

182
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.430
<v 1>It doesn't matter. The, the, the, the key here is,</v>

183
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:26.010
and it's a democratic talking point, right? I mean, this is a,

184
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.940
this is a strategy and that's fine. Both parties use different strategies. And,

185
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.900
uh, you know, but the, the Dems have obviously decided in this period of time,

186
00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:37.700
because it's so intense, there was clearly discussions within wherever the,

187
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:41.850
the DNC or elsewhere that this is our policy. We are going to push this.

188
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:45.090
And we're just, you just keep hammering that word, racist, racist, racist,

189
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.370
no matter what, and it's going to stick. And it, and it does because you just,

190
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.820
you, you get hit by that hammer and you kind of, you're staring into the light.

191
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:56.760
You don't know how to respond. Right. So, and you think, oh my God,

192
00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:58.860
I'm not a racist, but then, you know, you know, you're like, Senator,

193
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.070
you're still beating your wife. And so it's, it's one of those things you can't,

194
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.960
you can't answer. Um,

195
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.440
but I think it's because it's like calling everybody a Nazi. It's, you know,

196
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:11.940
it loses its, its its importance and its, and its meaning and, and you know,

197
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.600
um, anyway, it's, it's a, it's a strange, strange time,

198
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:18.300
but I think you can do both. You can, you can take care of that,

199
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.130
that woman with the kid or kids and, and you can also, um, you know,

200
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.010
look at the issue of border security, right?

201
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:30.630
And it enhance your ability to understand who's coming across the border

202
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.910
and cost money and it, and it requires effort. But you can do, you can do both.

203
00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:36.480
I don't think.

204
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.770
<v 0>I think you can do both, but I think the real big picture, the real big picture,</v>

205
00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:42.990
like if you had to look at the solution objective,

206
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.730
really the real problem is Mexico has like real economic

207
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:51.780
situations that we don't have here in America are they're far worse off in a lot

208
00:10:51.781 --> 00:10:56.250
of the areas. And as his Guatemala, as his neighbor, El Salvador,

209
00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.780
neighboring countries are economically devastated until they are not

210
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.320
until they come up and until they experience prosperity,

211
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.990
you're always going to have people that are committing crime because they're

212
00:11:06.991 --> 00:11:08.220
wanting to try to get by.

213
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.980
And you're always going to have people that are going to want to try to get to

214
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:13.440
America because it's a place where there's more opportunity.

215
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.570
That's the real issue. The real issue is that.

216
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.360
<v 1>Much better over here. Right. And that's, and that makes sense.</v>

217
00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:21.780
And you get the same thing with immigration and, and movement of, of, uh,

218
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:25.710
of people over in Europe coming up from, from wherever, which is the Mexico,

219
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.720
which is the Brexit argument in part, I mean,

220
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:28.980
it's not just based around immigration,

221
00:11:28.981 --> 00:11:33.330
but it's more control of your own nation's, uh, security and destiny, et cetera.

222
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.290
But I think that that's, you could argue that national security, um,

223
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.180
from a us perspective, uh, would warrant, um,

224
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.980
improving your ability to impact nations like watermark El Salvador,

225
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.390
uh, wherever, uh,

226
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.620
and working with Mexico to not just improve sort of the security,

227
00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.990
the liaison that goes on and improving that. But you're right. I mean,

228
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:59.920
working conditions, uh, criminal, you know, uh, or crime and, and instability,

229
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.220
um, that's in our national security. I know people get, you know,

230
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:05.860
they get very upset. I said, why should we give countries money? Well,

231
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:06.760
in part you're right. I mean,

232
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:09.310
sometimes you give them money and it just goes down some and it doesn't,

233
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:10.780
you know, and I don't mean to, I'm not talking about the country,

234
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:13.180
I'm just talking, literally it goes into a hole and it never comes back.

235
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.720
It's in corruption and they absorb it and at the highest levels of government.

236
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.260
Yeah. And so there's no, there's no controls over how that money is spent.

237
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:20.620
There's no,

238
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.110
there's no metrics to say whether it's spent wisely at the end of the day.

239
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.980
So you can, you, but I, I would argue that. Yeah, I agree. I mean,

240
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:31.720
it's in our national security interest when we're talking about, um, uh,

241
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.740
border security,

242
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.420
immigration to view that as sort of the top line issue,

243
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.440
why are they, why are they on the move? Well, like you said,

244
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.460
they're on the move because they want a better life because where they're adding

245
00:12:45.461 --> 00:12:49.090
good. Yes. How do you work with them? And that's, you know, that's,

246
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.520
I think people sometimes look at that and think, well,

247
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.590
that's pushing a rock up a hill. It's never going to happen.

248
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.890
And so maybe they just stop. Right. But, um,

249
00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:01.600
we've ignored Latin America, central America, south America for decades. Right.

250
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:05.830
Which is how we ended up in part with Chavez and Maduro have to follow. And,

251
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:09.280
and some of the horseshit that went on down there, uh, because we,

252
00:13:09.281 --> 00:13:11.440
we ignored it. We didn't give it the resources.

253
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:15.520
We didn't give it the attention and we didn't treat it seriously as a national

254
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:18.430
security concern. We were all focused on wherever,

255
00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:22.930
improving relations in Southeast Asia or elsewhere. So yeah,

256
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:26.230
we need to refocus and I think ultimately, do we see it immediately? No,

257
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:27.730
but I think so. Anyway, it's.
