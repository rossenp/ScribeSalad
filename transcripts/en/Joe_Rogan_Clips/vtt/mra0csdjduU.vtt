00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. We talked about this before.</v>

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.240
We need to find a cul-de-sac and don't buy houses there.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.370
<v 1>You mean the cult? Yes.</v>

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.160
<v 0>I know what you think a ranch would do the trick.</v>

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.170
It's hot Tufts to get people to live on a ranch.

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.080
<v 1>Oh, I see the way you're talking about, I know what you're talking about. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.450
It's not that hard. Like I, you know,

8
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:25.290
I think the way you do it is in phases, right?

9
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.850
So like the first thing would be just get the land. Right.

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.220
And then hire an architect. Yeah. Hire an architect. And then like, you know,

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.503
all looks great.

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.910
<v 0>That thing that he did in upstate New York. Beautiful. Have you been there?</v>

13
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.290
<v 1>I've been there and I haven't, unfortunately, I haven't been there since its,</v>

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.000
its completion. I know if it's completed,

15
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:48.900
but I've been there in the early phases and yeah, that for sure is a temple.

16
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.360
Like it's no joke. It's not like, they're just saying it's a temple.

17
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.194
That's a real.

18
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.330
<v 0>Printed, those weird faces.</v>

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.040
Those multi feature faces and use them in the corners of the building.

20
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.413
What is it? What does he call it?

21
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.480
<v 1>I can't remember. I'm sorry. Causal call.</v>

22
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.760
Cause I thought you meant what he called those faces. He has the names,

23
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.983
name for the faces too.

24
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.660
<v 0>Is that the chapel of sacred mirrors? Is that what it sounds for?</v>

25
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.400
But isn't that Kozum is,

26
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.310
was used to be what he called the place in New York city. Right.

27
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.450
He had the place in Manhattan.

28
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.730
<v 1>I think they still will. They still do have a beautiful place in New York, uh,</v>

29
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.100
actual or like a, uh, an artist loft there, I believe. But like they,

30
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:28.050
they ended up realizing it was time to like spread their wings.

31
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.210
<v 0>Build at temple. Yeah. And then really go somewhere in nature. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.920
They're there in like a small New York town, right? Yeah. That's right.

33
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.890
State town. Yeah.

34
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.610
<v 1>It's a beautiful place. And they're.</v>

35
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.510
<v 0>Legit religion and Theone. That's.</v>

36
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.390
<v 1>Right. And they're an actual religion, which they are, they are actually.</v>

37
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.000
<v 0>A religion. Yeah. It is a religion. And by the way,</v>

38
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.850
our religion is one of anything from you. Like th they're not,

39
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.590
I'm not trying to get 10% of your money.

40
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.930
They're giving you a bunch of rules to follow. They want you to learn worship,

41
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:00.750
love and creativity. It's a really interesting place is that, oh,

42
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.530
that's just an image of what it's going to look like.

43
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.840
And I'll think it's really quite there yet. But holy, man.

44
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:10.890
Imagine coming up to that, like walking up to their front door and you're like,

45
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.120
oh my God, what the hell am I looking at?

46
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.850
<v 1>Dude, when I was on tour, they let me park my tour bus there.</v>

47
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.560
Cause we needed a place to sleep for the night.

48
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.010
So I had to sleep in front of that thing in my tour bus and I,

49
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.510
and it hadn't even gotten to that phase,

50
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:28.650
but I had crazy dreams just sleeping there. Yeah.

51
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:31.040
It was wild man.

52
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.320
<v 0>One of those, if you build it, they will come. Things like,</v>

53
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.990
do you imagine how hard you would trip inside that place?

54
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.700
Do you know what I'm saying? Like, I don't think it's, I don't think it's a,

55
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.910
like you could do DMT in a apartment and still have some crazy

56
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.103
mind blowing trip,

57
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.160
but you can't tell me that coming to this place and going through this

58
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.320
[inaudible] portal. Yeah.

59
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.710
That this isn't going to have some crazy effect on the way trip.

60
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.540
<v 1>Yeah. Oh my God. But that, you know, that was the idea of a temple. I mean,</v>

61
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.390
the idea is I'm not, I'm not just saying to trip or whatever,

62
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.090
but the concept is like, you know,

63
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.920
let's acknowledge the fact that maybe our ideas aren't necessarily

64
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.100
coming from inside our brains. Let's just as a fantasy.

65
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.810
Imagine that there is a divine intelligence that as one of the many beautiful

66
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.660
things, it pushes into this particular realm is art.

67
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.380
And that if we can figure out a way to purify the connection with that thing,

68
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.710
then we become receivers for that. And by doing that,

69
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.070
we allow that thing to begin to exist in this world.

70
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:40.390
And a temple was a place that allowed that connection to be refined

71
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.480
purified. Uh intentionalized.

72
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.520
And in that there's this solidification called inspiration or art or

73
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.890
whatever the name is, you want to give it, but it's really,

74
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:55.660
it's like output from a place that maybe is a, you know, a flute,

75
00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.240
a few floors up from the one we're at,

76
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.420
it's having a pretty wonderful party right now.

77
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.590
And like part of what we do is like allow it to drip into this round,

78
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:09.910
which is potentially a denser realm. We're in the realm of matter. It's dense,

79
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:13.630
you know, and like ideas. If you look at your ideas, they're they're light.

80
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.560
They're like they're, they're they're they're they don't have at least my ideas.

81
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.650
Like they're, they're they're not like heavy they're, uh,

82
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.960
inspiration feels like barely anything.

83
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:26.950
In fact it's so barely anything think how easy it is to miss a good idea how

84
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.370
easy it is to think something cool that maybe you want to write down for a joke.

85
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.001
And you're just,

86
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:34.330
I'll write that down later and then it's gone and it's light it's light.

87
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:38.890
And so in, in part of what they're, I think are all about, or, I mean, I, again,

88
00:04:38.891 --> 00:04:40.030
that's me putting it on them.

89
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.640
They have a wonderful description on their website about what they're all about.

90
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.480
But to me, part of what creation is, is taking those things,

91
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.010
allowing them to come through you and then allowing this realm to do what it

92
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.000
does, which is to crystallize them in a denser form that other people can enjoy.

93
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.120
And you know, that, um,

94
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.230
that enjoyment is, uh, you know, that's enough.

95
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.730
It doesn't have to be some lofty.

96
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.310
It's just like people get a little like this tiny little smell

97
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.790
of heaven, like a better place, a lighter place,

98
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.460
a place that isn't encumbered by so much.

99
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.270
It's this particular realm that can like completely take someone out of a

100
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:23.650
depression, man, that can completely give somebody that, you know, juice.

101
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:28.360
They need to like get back out there and like open up themselves to the

102
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.360
world and not be shut down. Just one little like tiny,

103
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:35.590
tiny minuscule reminder of like, don't worry, there's this,

104
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:40.450
isn't the only place there's simultaneously amazing things happen

105
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.840
happening with your part of you just don't realize it yet.

106
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.580
And don't worry, you know, McKinney, he said in one of his essays,

107
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.010
that's what he would say on mushrooms is you would get this message.

108
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.480
Don't worry, we're coming. Don't worry. We're coming. And you know what I mean?

109
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:58.400
But I think that's what art does is it gives you this sense of like,

110
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.170
don't worry right now, we're just building the runway. Don't worry. It's coming.

111
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.130
I know this place seems up. It's a little dense right now.

112
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.560
We're going to lighten it up. And then that.

113
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.420
<v 0>Is your own imagination. Now,</v>

114
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.640
like how much of your own imagination stimulates your trips? You know,

115
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.533
I mean,

116
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.830
we want to assume that we're really interacting with something right on the

117
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:25.400
other side, but why, why do we assume that that's something,

118
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.800
obviously it's not static. The,

119
00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:31.220
one of the things about tryptamine experiences is that things twist and

120
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.770
change and morph and shift and never,

121
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:35.930
they never stay any one thing for any length of time.

122
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:39.200
They're always becoming other things and moving in and out of things like

123
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.960
maybe that's just what happens over there.

124
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.770
Maybe this things are constantly shifting and changing.

125
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.260
You know, maybe what we're doing is we're trying to apply.

126
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.250
When we think of how we are here in this, this life,

127
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.230
we're trying to apply those laws to whatever we, we experience when we,

128
00:07:03.231 --> 00:07:04.460
when we, when we do that.

129
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.250
But it seems so alien when you have those experiences, it seems so alien.

130
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.960
You're not going to be able to bring any of that back.

131
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.160
You can give someone like little glimpses and what Alex has done the best is

132
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.030
captured like, oh, I know what he's doing. Like those faces those,

133
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.050
like almost a gypsy looking golden faces are moving apart from each other.

134
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:27.800
Like you go, oh yeah, I've seen something. Yeah. Something sorta, yeah.

135
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.720
There's a trip to mean part to that,

136
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.720
but that whatever that would it be in that dimension,

137
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.410
it would change and become something else and didn't instantaneously and then

138
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:37.640
become something else. And then,

139
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.380
and a lot of it has to do with how you're thinking, which is weird. It's like,

140
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.430
are,

141
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.200
is the way your thinking actually affecting those things or is the

142
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:52.610
way you're thinking effecting your perception of whatever this

143
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:54.590
energy is and how it manifests itself.

144
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.860
<v 1>Well, I mean, this is that right. Even in, in what you're saying,</v>

145
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:02.660
there's this assumption that, that you're thinking is separate from the thing.

146
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.030
Right. Right, right. And, and,

147
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:08.360
and so w so we have a thought and we're thinking to ourselves, oh,

148
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.260
I just got a good idea.

149
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.670
We don't know that if we had a different way of quantifying time and space,

150
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.350
we might've just seen some,

151
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:18.770
a theorial MIS drift through us that produced a thing.

152
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:20.750
We caught a thought that we thought must be us.

153
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:24.870
So you look at a thing in that realm and it's shifting and converting. And,

154
00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:28.460
and you notice that that conversion seems to be happening in relation to like

155
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:30.500
how you're feeling. And you know,

156
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.180
now you're in a chicken or the egg conversation, which is like, who's, you know,

157
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.300
who's reflecting who here, like who,

158
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.270
which of us is like real,

159
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.360
and which of us isn't are we just kind of there? I am.

160
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:48.650
I just seeing who I actually am, but because I live in a world of,

161
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.610
um,

162
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.930
individuality and I live in a world where there's a separate quality to things.

163
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:57.180
I see, I have to see you as separate, because if I don't, I can't see you.

164
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.680
I know all I can do, you know, I I'm seeing myself in you, which is,

165
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:05.730
I think what, what is happening in this realm anyway, it's like,

166
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.930
when we're anything you're looking at right now is, uh,

167
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.070
some phenomena being painted instantaneously by your

168
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.670
imagination with all, that's what the imagination is doing.

169
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:22.590
It's painting colors onto the universe of infinite phenomena that

170
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.570
your, your brain is like doing out of habits. So that's, that's that, you know,

171
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:29.400
anything that anyone you're around,

172
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.930
you make an instantaneous assessment of that person, or, uh,

173
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.390
you, you begin to like, realize like, wait, I got a bad vibe about that person.

174
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:43.230
I bet something's off with them. And then you go into like, you're a TV psychic,

175
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.610
like, oh yeah, really? Oh, really? Is that your,

176
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.790
was that the instincts you learn? Where'd you learn that world Warcraft. Yeah.

177
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.130
You don't, you don't know, but I've done that by the way.

178
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:54.720
I'm talking about myself where I'm like, yeah.

179
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.990
I just can tell if a person is on a string. It's like, no.

180
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.260
<v 0>You can definitely tell if a person's really weird though.</v>

181
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.220
That's for sure. You can tell if a person's off,

182
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.280
like they're not really connecting with you or they're intending to connect with

183
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.490
you. And you're like, well, I got a weird vibe from this. Yeah.

184
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.340
If you looked at what he said on paper and what you said on paper would be

185
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:15.690
totally normal. That's true.

186
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.200
There's sometimes there's a certain things of a violation of space.

187
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.880
There's a weirdness to the way they look at you, a cadence, they're like, oh,

188
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:24.900
you're off.

189
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.510
<v 1>I hate that feeling, man. That's a deeper thing.</v>

190
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:29.100
When the alarm bells go off like that,

191
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.940
your hair starts standing up and you're like, gotta go. I hate that.

192
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:36.750
That's scary. But you know, I'm just saying, sometimes you're not right.

193
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.720
And this is like, why you need empiricism in science,

194
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:41.580
because sometimes you're not right. Like,

195
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:46.230
just because you think that's how is from some instinct inside of you

196
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:51.270
doesn't mean that's how things is your bias. And so that, that's the projection.

197
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.690
That's like the, that's the part of you that you're like,

198
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.810
you're still dealing with some trauma when you're a kid.

199
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.620
And you're seeing that trauma in all the things around you.

200
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:06.180
And so you're like in an argument with someone who hurt you 20 years ago,

201
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.680
when you're talking to somebody who vaguely reminds you of that person,

202
00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.800
you're still having the argument.

203
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.140
And if you're not aware that you're still having that argument,

204
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.430
then you can start saying. Like, why do you always end up with the same person?

205
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.120
It's like, oh, I always draw this kind of person to me. And it's like, well,

206
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:27.420
maybe you're drawing the exact same kind of person to you.

207
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.070
Or maybe you're running the same movie on a different screen. And being like,

208
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.000
I've seen this before. I keep seeing this movie, you know, it's like,

209
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.330
that's the same movie. It's like, you're seeing the same thing.

210
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.250
You're projecting. It's just, it looks at like,

211
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.630
now it's not Tom, it's Alex,

212
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:48.630
or now it's not Lisa. You're looking at Samantha,

213
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.010
but you're still seeing this thing. And that that's the projection. So anyway,

214
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.640
that's the imagination.

215
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.320
And the question is how powerful is that projection?

216
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.460
Because sometimes you start projecting onto someone how you think they are.

217
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.010
And if that person's weak or insecure,

218
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.180
they'll start acting the way you think they are now.

219
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:13.570
You've your projection is sprung to life in front of you because the person,

220
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.350
you essentially animated a person with your expectation of them.

221
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.370
And then because that person is acting the way you thought they would act,

222
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.870
because they don't know the. They are,

223
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.810
you're making monsters with your imagination.

224
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.690
<v 0>We just do it. Right. That's how you start a sex cult.</v>

225
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.280
How the same way you got to take these people and like put it in their head that

226
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:37.780
this is what they do. Oh, right. Put it in their head, right?

227
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.530
<v 1>Yeah. That's right. You say you see it. I see it in you.</v>
