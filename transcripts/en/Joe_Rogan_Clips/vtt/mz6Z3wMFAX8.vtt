WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>Ground. Yeah. I'm absolutely fascinated by mushrooms. I had, uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:06.480
Paul Stamets on the podcast. I saw, I saw that.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.520
<v 1>One. How great is that guy? That's super cool. Was mushroom hat. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.360
&lt;laugh&gt; that was amazing. I got one. If you want one.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.760
<v 0>That's awesome. I got, he gave me two mushrooms. That's amazing.</v>

6
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.640
What am I gonna do with two well case one breaks? Yeah,

7
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.200
&lt;laugh&gt; I have an extra mushroom hat, but that's.

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.030
<v 1>A really cool documentary actually. Um, it's called know your mushrooms.</v>

9
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.990
I think it's by Ron better know by, by Ron man. And he, he, he,

10
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.510
he travels along with these mushroom hunters, uh, up, I think a lot,

11
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.150
a lot of it's in Oregon and up the coast of California down in New Mexico,

12
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.110
but they're, they're professional forgers that then go and sell these mushrooms.

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.190
Uh, but they track these forgers and it's such a cool movie. That's.

14
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.620
<v 0>Interesting. What I was gonna say is you better know mushrooms,</v>

15
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.900
cuz they'll kill you if you don't.

16
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.060
<v 1>That that's the thing, man. It's like, you know,</v>

17
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.340
my first experiencing forging for mushrooms,

18
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.260
I was like an apprent chef at this restaurant.

19
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:54.140
And the chef comes in and was like, Hey, check these out. And I was like, whoa,

20
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.820
like what the hell are these? And he is like, oh, they're morels.

21
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.700
Like I found them mountain biking. And there's this stigma, you know,

22
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.050
like as a kid, like your parents are like, Don, don't eat those,

23
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:04.410
don't touch those. They're poisonous. They'll kill you. And it's like, okay,

24
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.370
well then you just, you just have this idea. Well,

25
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.610
mushrooms come from the grocery store. Well it's like, no, they grow,

26
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.930
they come in the wild and you know, that's, that's like my thing with meat is I,

27
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570
I teach my kids like meat doesn't come from the grocery store. It's not,

28
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.290
it's not on a styrofoam package. That's not where it comes from. It's an animal.

29
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.410
Yeah. Um, and, and yeah, and it's just like, you know,

30
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.280
mushrooms own the wild and they're just, they're crazy. They, they,

31
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.120
this like micro, micro, uh.

32
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.720
<v 0>Microrisal yeah. It's it's Michael riser relationship with the, uh,</v>

33
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:33.640
animals or with the, uh, the trees rather. Um,

34
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.640
do you know the story of the Amita mascara?

35
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.640
<v 1>Uh, I know what they are. Uh, I don't know the story. The Amita.</v>

36
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.910
<v 0>Mascara is the most fascinating one to me. Cause that's the one that looks like,</v>

37
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.350
looks like Santa Claus or the Mario with white washroom. Yeah.

38
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.750
That is the subject of a book by a guy named John Marco Allegro,

39
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.030
who was one of the head scholars, uh,

40
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.430
for deciphering the dead sea scrolls.

41
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.230
He deciphered the dead sea scrolls for 14 years. He was an ordained minister,

42
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:04.740
but he was also in his study of fi became agnostic. And he sort,

43
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.460
when he started realizing that there was all these different religions that had

44
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.700
similar stories and he was, you know, found all these, uh,

45
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460
different connections. And he was trying,

46
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.300
trying to like figure out what the origins of all these stories were well after

47
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:18.860
studying the dead sea scrolls for,

48
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.220
I think it was 14 years before he wrote this book.

49
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.730
He decided that all of Christianity was a massive

50
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.290
misunderstanding. And what it was originally about was these stories,

51
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:35.010
these collection of stories that were about fertility rituals and

52
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:39.890
psychedelic mushroom use &lt;laugh&gt; and he traced the word Jesus back to an

53
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:44.520
ancient Sumerian word that was a mushroom covered in God

54
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.120
semen. And that when God would come on the earth, that's what rain was.

55
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.960
Rain was God coming on the earth and that these mushrooms would rise up out of

56
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:57.360
the ground. They would eat them and trip their balls off. Right. &lt;laugh&gt;.

57
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.240
<v 1>That's a crazy story.</v>

58
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.360
<v 0>So me, you gotta think, yeah. People that were foraging for food,</v>

59
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.320
especially back when there was no agriculture, right? I mean, it was,

60
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.560
it was touch and go. You, you could easily starve to death. You,

61
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.800
I mean a bad winter, you know, a drought, people would starve to death.

62
00:03:12.801 --> 00:03:17.560
It was very, very common. So they would take foraging,

63
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.110
extremely sea areas and they knew what they could eat and they knew what they

64
00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:22.030
couldn't eat. Well.

65
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.590
They knew that there was a relationship between Carnes trees and coniferous

66
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:30.550
trees would grow these weird looking shiny red and

67
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.430
white mushrooms under 'em. That's what coniferous trees is. Pine trees.

68
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:39.340
That's what we use for Christmas trees. Yep. Those red and white packages. They,

69
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.780
they are like the shiny packages underneath the Christmas tree.

70
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.380
They are the color of Santa Claus. Yeah. They're common in Siberia.

71
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.780
They're eaten constantly by caribou. Caribou are reindeer.

72
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.260
Reindeer are addicted to these,

73
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.460
to the point where when people are having psychedelic mushroom rituals and they

74
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.580
go outside to take a leak,

75
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.890
the CA will knock them over to get to the Amita Maia in the

76
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.610
sand &lt;laugh&gt; cause they smell the Amita Maia in the.

77
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.490
And one of the ways these guys trip their balls off is they eat the mushroom and

78
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:15.890
then they drink their own urine. They have that's crazy second process of this.

79
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.930
Here's where it gets even crazier in the times in Siberia where it,

80
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.960
him extremely snowy when the,

81
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.600
the shaman would visit the way they would get into the house is through the

82
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.360
chimney because the door would be snowed in.

83
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.440
So they would climb in through the chimney. I mean,

84
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:35.320
there's so many parallels to Santa Claus and to Christianity that this

85
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.200
one mushroom that they think was a massive part of shamanistic rituals.

86
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.270
There it is right there. This is this root off the red nose reindeer. Yeah.

87
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.510
Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; oh, that is root so crazy. I'm sure that's such a cool story.

88
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.030
Oh dude, it's crazy.

89
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.990
So he wrote this book called the sacred mushroom in the cross that was bought

90
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.350
out by the Catholic church. This I have to verify. Um,

91
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.750
but I do know that they stopped production of it.

92
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.270
I don't know if it was bought out by the Catholic church. That's always been,

93
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:01.104
what's been told to me,

94
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.740
but I do know that they stopped production of it forever. Um,

95
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.940
he came out with another book called the dead sea scrolls and the Christian

96
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.300
myth, which is still available then more recently,

97
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:14.860
like really recently within the last decade, uh,

98
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.940
a guy named Jan Irvin republished, um,

99
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.060
the John Marco Allegro books with permission from his family.

100
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.050
I think I'm might have actually been one of those things where when a book is

101
00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:27.970
over 25 years old, it becomes like public domain or something like that too.

102
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.090
But this, this book and this,

103
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.770
this story behind it is incredibly fascinating.

104
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.170
And what he's basically saying is that,

105
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.290
and it makes sense if you were living thousands of years ago and you stumbled

106
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:43.920
upon these psychedelic mushrooms and you took them, you would experience God.

107
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.000
You literally would think that that psychedelic state was you communicating with

108
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.320
God. They would wanna hide those from the Romans.

109
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.400
So they hid them in parables and stories.

110
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.840
And he explains what the original meaning of all these parables and stories are

111
00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:59.960
because of course you're going from ancient Hebrew,

112
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.840
which is an extremely complicated language that also involves numbers.

113
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.040
The letters are also numbers,

114
00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.240
and then that's translated to Latin and to Greek and then eventually to English.

115
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.720
So a lot is lost in that translation.

116
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.520
So it really takes a linguist and a,

117
00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.440
and a biblical scholar to kind of understand whether an,

118
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.390
not what this guy is saying is correct. I'm obviously not one of those.

119
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.670
So I'm just talking &lt;laugh&gt; but it's a, there's so many parallels.

120
00:06:24.671 --> 00:06:28.870
It's almost like how could it be just coincidental that Santa Claus is red and

121
00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:29.140
white,

122
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.670
that Santa Claus likes reindeers that the Christmas tree is something that we

123
00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:35.830
use in the presents are under the Christmas tree that Santa Claus lives in the

124
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.260
north pole with is Siberia,

125
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.700
which is where caribou live and which is where these mushrooms are very common.

126
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.180
I mean, there's so many parallels. It's really kind of crazy. That's cool. Yeah.

127
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:47.460
It's a great book. Anybody. I,

128
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.420
I really highly recommend it because it's one of those books where you just

129
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:52.300
gotta, you read a few chapters. You gotta go.

130
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.700
I think I may have to go back over that again. You go over it again.

131
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.460
Cause it's so it's, it's so freaky. Very cool.

132
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.170
But I've stumbled upon those in the wild, those Amita.

133
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.890
<v 1>So I've never found those and there's like, those there's like,</v>

134
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.370
you have to cook them first. You can't eat them raw. You have to boil them.

135
00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:07.250
Yeah. We made tea outta them. They will make you sick.

136
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.370
Apparently if you don't do it. Right. Um, but yeah, no, I, I forged more for,

137
00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.970
uh, more's are my favorite. Uh, Chan's obviously awesome.

138
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:17.290
Like awesome culinary mushroom. Uh.

139
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.880
<v 0>What's that you yellow one that grows on trees. It's like a thick.</v>

140
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.440
<v 1>Uh, chicken of the woods. Yes. That one that one's and it tastes like chicken.</v>

141
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.880
It is unbelievable. I, that, one's amazing. It's really funky. Uh, we found,

142
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.280
I was walking with the kids in a park downtown Toronto,

143
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.400
and I look over and there's this massive it's on my Instagram. Uh,

144
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.000
massive yellow kind of looks like goo growing on this tree.

145
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:41.630
And it was a premature the woods and it just looked like this blob. And then if,

146
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:44.390
if I were to leave it, it would start to kind of, uh,

147
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.790
shelf out into like shelf kind of mushrooms. Um, and so I,

148
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.390
I left it for like a week and went back and harvested it. And it's like,

149
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:53.030
it's like tender, juicy chicken flavor. It is bizarre.

150
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.110
<v 0>Oh, that's kind of cool. So you, you were just like hoping nobody else saw it.</v>

151
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.870
Yeah. And.

152
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.060
<v 1>It was like, and it was in like a really public, uh, it park. And I was like,</v>

153
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.420
oh man, like I better get this before someone else finds it. &lt;laugh&gt; well, how.

154
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.940
<v 0>Many people would know in a public park in Toronto? Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.300
<v 1>Uh, there's a few there's, there's definitely few I've.</v>

156
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:11.580
I've kind of walked up to ladies, like picking herbs and stuff. And I was like,

157
00:08:11.581 --> 00:08:12.660
Hey, like what are you doing?

158
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.620
And they just kinda looked at me and kind of went away.

159
00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:17.260
They didn't wanna share their knowledge with me here. It is. There it is. Oh,

160
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:19.500
so that's the it's bizarre man. Look at you like.

161
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.730
<v 0>Zoo zookeeper, zoo.</v>

162
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.610
<v 1>Andrew. I was like those. I was so pumped. I was so excited.</v>

163
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.210
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; the face you made? There's another, you look like Chris there.</v>

164
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.810
That's right. Doesn't he look a little like Delia. That's hilarious. Oh,

165
00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:32.210
that's so.

166
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.770
<v 1>Cool, man. Yeah. Oh, so, and there's like a little tiny one, uh, you know,</v>

167
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.050
below it, but yeah. Why don't they.

168
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.883
<v 0>Grow on trees?</v>

169
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.290
<v 1>I don't know. I think, well that one,</v>

170
00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:41.440
you can see the bark is like de deter rating. So again, it's, it's, uh,

171
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.800
it's feeding off the decaying, uh, treat.

172
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.880
<v 0>Wow. That's oh.</v>

173
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.320
<v 1>Look how badass looks. So if that,</v>

174
00:08:46.321 --> 00:08:49.160
if you actually go and I found ones like that too, if you go and, and,

175
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.840
and harvest those, they're really Woody by that time. And they're,

176
00:08:51.841 --> 00:08:55.680
they're kind of little too tough to, to eat. Oh, really? Um, so yeah, you want,

177
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.400
you want to get 'em when they're kind of younger like that.

178
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.800
<v 0>So is there a color change?</v>

179
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.400
<v 1>Um, I, I get, I guess when they, when they're older, they get a bit more orange.</v>

180
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.720
Yeah. Uh, from that kind of yellow premature,

181
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.680
do you see that one where there's like yellow? Yeah. Those are like perfect.

182
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.080
Yeah.

183
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.120
<v 0>Right there. Perfect. Yeah. Oh, wow. That looks like almost like cauliflower.</v>

184
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.110
<v 1>Totally. Yeah. It's really, really neat. Wow. It's fascinating. You know, the,</v>

185
00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.670
the, the mushroom world is, is, uh, super.

186
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.150
<v 0>Cool. Do you know, they breathe air?</v>

187
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.990
I did not know that they breathe air and they breathe out carbon dioxide. Yeah.

188
00:09:23.991 --> 00:09:26.910
They're closer to animals than they are to vegetables. That's really cool. Yeah.

189
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:30.270
They're weird. Fungus is a weird thing, man. Yeah. Well, and.

190
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.230
<v 1>A lot of it's like, um, misunderstood. Well, I, I guess.</v>
