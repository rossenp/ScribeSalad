00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.400
<v 1>Experience. And I was kind of expat. I grew up in a machine shop.</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.780
My dad was a machinist. So I was doing that from like five years old.

4
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:14.670
I was sweeping the floor. And I was like, I was like, man,

5
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:18.600
this is not what I'm meant to be like, I'm supposed to be something great. But,

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.270
uh, but everybody around me is, I know this is what you do.

7
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.600
You live in this little town and you do you follow the rules,

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.700
you're going to be a machine or a farmer or a, you know, whatever. And,

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.820
uh, you know, that me off, you know,

10
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:37.620
and I never really found my niche. And so I was homeschooled actually for,

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.440
I think, two years in a junior high.

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.060
So I think that was sort of actually the start because I went back to school and

13
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:49.410
when I went back to school, I was now the outsider. I didn't have any friends.

14
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.930
Um, and then going up, uh,

15
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.430
all of a sudden I'm in high school and I have no friends. I have no, uh,

16
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.010
I can't get laid for. Um,

17
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.190
I think that's what causes Angie and a lot of people in the world, right?

18
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.080
<v 0>Oh yeah. And depression. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.440
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And at the exact same time,</v>

20
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.400
I'm starting to experiment with drugs and alcohol.

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.170
So you put the two together, you know, um, I was supposed to be, um,

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.820
the prodigal son, you know what I mean? Like I was very intelligent. I was,

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.590
um, you know,

24
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.250
I was doing things by the time I was 15 years old in the machine shop that,

25
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.810
that guys, you know, they'd been working for my father for 10,

26
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.110
15 years. Couldn't do you know what I mean? So I was sort of,

27
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:34.771
this product was signed.

28
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:38.400
I was good at athletics and everything had no problem with all that stuff.

29
00:01:38.401 --> 00:01:42.000
So I think, uh, it was just sort of a backlash, you know,

30
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.790
and then I let that anger get the best of me.

31
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.680
<v 0>So now when you were doing drugs and alcohol,</v>

32
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:53.490
what were the drugs like? What was the drug that caused you to overdose heroin.

33
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.303
<v 1>Injection? Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.690
<v 0>That's deep when you're injecting it. That's when you're all in baby. Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.240
<v 1>Yeah. And you know, I didn't actually do it a whole lot.</v>

36
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.081
It's kind of the funny thing.

37
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.440
A lot of people thought that I was addicted to heroin and I wasn't that,

38
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.530
I think that was probably the fifth time that I did it, maybe six,

39
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.950
something like that. I didn't count. But, um, you know,

40
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:18.810
that was sorta my fun. That was my step into the dark side. Um,

41
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.860
you know, and, and a blessing and a curse man, you know,

42
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:26.400
it immediately hoes like, oh, okay. That's what can happen. Right.

43
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.380
It's the step back. Uh, and you know, I was very naive, very,

44
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.850
uh, man, I was a fool really like, cause what I did,

45
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.040
I remember leaving the, uh, uh, the hospital and I was like, okay,

46
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.590
well I'm never doing heroin again, but let's go do some Coke.

47
00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.970
Right. So I was just a dummy man. Um,

48
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.280
I think I was 21, 22, uh, one of those, uh, I mean it was like 15 years ago.

49
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.800
There was a lot of stuff. I, I, I was actually kind of thinking about like,

50
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.120
so again, you know, on this podcast I was like, uh, that, you know,

51
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.170
this is probably going to come up on it as a pretty, uh, intense story. Um,

52
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.900
I was like, I can't remember all the details of that.

53
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.240
It was like a long time ago, but anyway, yeah. So I was like 21, 22.

54
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:21.100
And, um, it wasn't too much long later, you know,

55
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.520
I live with this girl and, you know, she was a drug addict too.

56
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.450
And she had a couple of kids and it was like, it was like, all right,

57
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:32.410
well now I got a place to live. Like let's get up,

58
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.580
you know? And then I never did, um,

59
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.950
heroin again after that, obviously. Um, I think I did Oxy,

60
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:46.470
so Percocet stuff I got, which is basically the same thing. Right. Which,

61
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.430
I mean, I didn't realize it at the time,

62
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.170
but really my drug of choice was meth back in that day.

63
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.540
That was what I really liked.

64
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.060
And that was actually what I was addicted to at one point.

65
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.460
And I ended up going to jail and that was what got me,

66
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.720
uh, out of addiction. I didn't realize I was addicted until I was in jail.

67
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.340
So what made you realize that when you were in jail? Uh, just,

68
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:16.300
I just couldn't stop thinking about it and just one it and just, I mean,

69
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:20.800
I didn't get to have like, like, um, like cold sweats or anything.

70
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:25.570
I don't think that happens with uppers, but, um, I mean, I was just, you know,

71
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.390
like, like I couldn't stop thinking about it, man. I was like, dude,

72
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.200
like just a lot of that anger was coming out or I was just like, God,

73
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:34.510
like what the? I want to fight everybody. I was like,

74
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:37.180
somebody gave me something, you know? And wow. Yeah.

75
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:42.040
It was just really terrible experience, but probably my lasted three, four days.

76
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.300
Not even, maybe not even that. And then you came out of it. Yeah. I mean,

77
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:50.020
I was just like, eh, able to accept my fate and, and deal with it.

78
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.130
What does it feel like to be on meth? Uh, you have to take Adderall.

79
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.190
I had never taken an Adderall. No, I'm

80
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.780
pretty similar to Adderall. Right? It's like Adderall. I mean,

81
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.780
that's the closest I would say. Um,

82
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.670
I mean you're high. Um, but you don't have, I mean,

83
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.690
it said that euphoria more than anything, just to, excuse me,

84
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.280
just an extreme sense of euphoria. Just everything is beautiful,

85
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:23.050
but then men, soon as you start to lose out a little bit,

86
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.040
you just itch for it so bad man.

87
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.740
So bad that you just want it again. You, you,

88
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:33.730
you don't want to sleep how your teeth to be grinding in your psych.

89
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.320
Like you you're just tensing up all your muscles. I, God,

90
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.000
I got to get more of that. You know?

91
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.740
Now when you're working out at all back then, no, no, well I'd say,

92
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.600
well not working out like it should be. So again, I was angry a lot of times,

93
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.820
like, I'd be at a party that this was a common thing.

94
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.460
I'd be at like a party or just doing drugs, whatever.

95
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.120
And I just started getting, look at everybody. I don't like, none of you.

96
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.380
And I would just walk outside and I would go for a run, I'd run five, six miles,

97
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:07.430
come back and be like, all right, give me another line or whatever. Wow. Yeah.

98
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.390
Um, run and then come back to the park. Yeah. And then sometimes I would,

99
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.330
I would fight people, you know, that was common. Very,

100
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:16.430
very common if you call that working out.

101
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.670
And we did like this particular time in my life,

102
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.050
I was living in a little town called Jamestown, Ohio, and I had this buddy,

103
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.200
um, he was friend, his cousin,

104
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.130
his cousin was a fighter and this was kind of my first, uh,

105
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.030
uh, foray into mixed martial arts, our first, uh,

106
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.660
experience watching it and everything. And, uh,

107
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.320
they would train in the grass in the backyard. You know, we,

108
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.240
I remember watching Ken Shamrock DVDs are VHS's

109
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.990
back then. Um, leg locks, we'd go on the living room floor.

110
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.430
Like just be faced drunk.

111
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:58.400
And I'm lucky I didn't tear my ACL or thing where like, oh,

112
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.480
this is what he's doing is how you doing. Yeah, he'll hooks. And I mean,

113
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.820
I don't remember all the techniques, but I remember it was like, you know,

114
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.250
Pankration stuff. Right. And we just be laying there in it.

115
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.080
And it was always a thought of like, my dude is awesome, man.

116
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:16.520
Like I could beat tank habit, like, you know,

117
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:18.320
and we would joke about it, man. We would say,

118
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.370
I remember specifically sit in there and be like, dude, like, you know,

119
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:26.480
we're gonna get you a fight in, uh, you know, the local Joe Schmo show.

120
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:27.860
And then, uh, you know,

121
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:30.440
we're going to get you up and you're going to go to a pride and then you're

122
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:34.430
going to go to the UFC. And I was like, oh cool. The hell. Yeah, let's do it.

123
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.330
And that was, you know, it was like a joke kind of,

124
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:41.810
but that was what was in my head. That's so that's what we were going to do.

125
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.550
<v 0>Action to martial arts. Yeah. So what was your first real formal training?</v>

126
00:07:46.551 --> 00:07:47.930
Like what, what Jim did you first?

127
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.130
<v 1>So I fought before I trained chip the. Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:54.643
Yeah. So,

129
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.300
so actually there's this guy that was a, um,

130
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.640
he was supposed to go fight west Sims and uh, his name was fat.

131
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:05.600
Joe was what we called him.

132
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.980
He was supposed to go fight Watson fat Simms west Sims that day.

133
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.430
And I said, yeah, let's go, man. I want to go with you.

134
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:16.580
I want to see this up close. Right. So we go there and I'm, I'm,

135
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.490
I'm doing a bunch of Coke on the way. And you know, to me,

136
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.710
it's just going to be a party. Like, I'm just gonna watch my dude fight.

137
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.370
I get there. And uh, you know, there's a,

138
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.690
he signs up on the table and I was like, dude, what is that? How you, you know,

139
00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:31.550
that's all you gotta do. He's like, yeah, he's a,

140
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.540
he just paid 30 bucks and he'd come by. And I said, man, maybe I should do that.

141
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:39.650
And then the guy and I'm looking inside and I see the, uh, you know,

142
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:43.130
people sit around smoking cigars, like you see on a movie, people smoke cigars,

143
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:46.970
you see bets being made and stuff. And, and uh, the guy who was men,

144
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:50.450
you want to fight the champion. Like nobody wants to fight him. And I was like.

145
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.090
Yeah, man, I'll fight him. You kidding me?

146
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.040
So I literally went across the street.

147
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.090
There's a sporting goods store across the street or down the street or something

148
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.960
and went and bought a mouthpiece, come back. Uh,

149
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.510
there's a restaurant across the street, boil the mouthpiece at the restaurant,

150
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.330
use their microwave, come back. And then, uh,

151
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.590
and then we're at the fighter's meeting.

152
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.980
So the fighter's meeting back then was a lot different. So there wasn't way in,

153
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.610
it was like you and you, you guys look about the same size, uh,

154
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:18.120
you guys doing kickboxing. Okay. You guys fight. Right. So that's how,

155
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.640
the way it worked out and I'm sitting there and they're like, okay,

156
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:25.200
you're the champion. You're fighting him. And I was like, oh. All right, this.

157
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.340
Right. And, uh, you know, so, um, [inaudible] this guy,

158
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:31.560
he taught me how to do a jab. He's like, man, he's like,

159
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:34.620
all you gotta do to beat this guy. Just jab him. He's like, you see this just,

160
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:39.120
don't just jab. I was like, oh, okay, I'm gonna do that. And uh,

161
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.540
went out there and I beat the guy. So he actually quit. Yeah. He actually quit.

162
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:45.930
You know? So he was a tough man champion is what he was. And uh,

163
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.280
I actually threw a jab, punched him in the face and he went to shoot on me.

164
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.480
I did, you know, uh, playground guillotine choke, and he just quit.

165
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.310
I don't think I actually had the joke in. I don't,

166
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.110
I highly doubt he tapped out saying that his calf

167
00:10:01.111 --> 00:10:06.090
cramped up. I have no idea. Like,

168
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.050
wow. It really happened. I mean, I certainly didn't know a guillotine choke it,

169
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:14.610
even though the name of it. So, uh, anyway, later that night he was like, dude,

170
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.630
like you're fighting Gover along. You will fight again. Yeah. Whatever man.

171
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.770
And I said, well, this guy, you know, he's going pro in his next boxing match,

172
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.910
your kickboxer fight him. I said, all right, I'll him up. Right.

173
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.620
Because dude beat the out of him. So that was actually the first,

174
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.590
the nice thing about that was it actually made me realize how tough I am.

175
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:38.700
That was the saving grace. I mean, he just, you know, just pieced me up,

176
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.240
just one punch after another, you know, I'm just eating punch after punch.

177
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:47.040
And then, uh, yeah, that was it. I said, man, I gotta do this. And then,

178
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:51.960
so my second fight, uh, I, you know, I didn't think I still yet needed to train.

179
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.850
Uh, my second fight, I met a guy at a gym. So, you know,

180
00:10:56.851 --> 00:11:01.200
I did go to this gym as a Japanese jujitsu gym and he goes, and he goes,

181
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:05.910
Hey man, you want to fight in like two weeks in Moyer tie. Hell yeah. Right. Um,

182
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.740
so for two weeks, you know, I'd hit the bag probably for five minutes at a time,

183
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:15.690
whatever something. Um, I go to the fight and uh, man,

184
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.330
this is the worst part. So I get in there. The first thing the guy does,

185
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:24.300
comes and shoots on me. It takes me down. We're in big gloves. Uh,

186
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.640
shin pads on us takes me down. I'll get up,

187
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:31.350
look at what the he's taking me down. We can't do this more time. Right.

188
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.510
Uh, music fight, you know, comes, it takes me down again. I said, what the man?

189
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.150
So I was like, okay, so we're wrestling. Right?

190
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:41.880
So I come out and get in sort of a wrestling standards, drop my hands,

191
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.420
kicks me in my head. So, uh,

192
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.760
we'll come find out later saying shall no,

193
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.660
Scott Sheely's show w I used to work with him a lot.

194
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.730
Sand shall for people that know was.

195
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.870
<v 0>A kickboxing would take downs.</v>

196
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.340
I cornered Clarice Smith back in the day when Maurice was doing that once

197
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:06.460
in Burbank, I think it was, it was weird. It was confusing. It's like,

198
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:09.730
okay. I mean, it's interesting. I guess. I mean,

199
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:11.530
it's probably a good skill set to learn,

200
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.760
learn how to do take-downs and throws with, with kickboxing,

201
00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:18.160
but then you just let the guy up, which is just weird.

202
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.370
<v 1>You didn't get it. Huh? He was weird. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,</v>

203
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.370
it still goes on de San dos. I think he's amazing sport. Yeah.

204
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.480
<v 0>I love it. It's amazing.</v>

205
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:29.820
And it's only a lot of times there's a lot like throws in [inaudible] cause you

206
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.990
know, there's a lot of trips and throws and [inaudible].

207
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.170
<v 1>He said you get points for that throws up to five. Yeah.</v>

208
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.690
<v 0>Another variation. Yeah. Yeah. So.</v>

209
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.910
<v 1>If like their feet go above their head, it's five points.</v>

210
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.550
<v 0>So when did you get serious? So you did this. It was right after.</v>

211
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:50.340
<v 1>That. Cause, cause I mean, he'd beat the out of me. Um, I like,</v>

212
00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:52.900
I remember walking out of there and people were looking at me like,

213
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.450
how'd you survive Hasbro? I mean,

214
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.900
and like people were actually asking me how like, dude, how'd you survive that?

215
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.970
Like, I don't know. I do. And I had to go to work that night.

216
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.110
I was like working third shift.

217
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.650
I got to go to work right after everybody was looking at me at work. I did,

218
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:13.390
you got like two black eyes they have anyway. Um, that was when I,

219
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.980
uh, said to myself, you know, I want to try this. And you know, I think, uh,

220
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.730
you know, this is, uh, something I really enjoy and I want to go for it. Um,

221
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:24.280
so I met this guy, um, uh,

222
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.790
his name was Eli heirs and he was fighting in king of the cage once I've ever

223
00:13:27.791 --> 00:13:31.210
met. And then he got Brayden Workman and uh, they were training for,

224
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.920
it was a big show there in Columbus. Um, I can't remember name of show,

225
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.460
but I think Lawler fought on it. Like a bunch of military guys, Tim Sylvia,

226
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.700
you know the name if I said, I can't remember, but anyway, um, yeah. And then,

227
00:13:45.701 --> 00:13:49.300
you know, then I really got the kicked out on me when I got in the gym,

228
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:54.280
you know, then I realized like, you know, what a real beating was and uh, yeah,

229
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.680
it just went from there, man. Cause I,

230
00:13:55.681 --> 00:13:58.960
I just said I never looked back and I thought, man, you know,

231
00:13:58.961 --> 00:14:01.600
I want to change my life. You know, I'm, I'm, you know, I,

232
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:04.540
wasn't never actually a uh,

233
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.560
the type of person that fit in with the drug user scene, right?

234
00:14:11.561 --> 00:14:13.810
Like that wasn't me. It was just a, again,

235
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.760
an expression of anger and these things that, um, you know,

236
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.090
in my childhood just kind of came out the wrong way. Right.

237
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.730
So it wasn't really a, like I fit in there. Um, so at this point,

238
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:30.300
like I'm, I'm really not fitting in anywhere. And this was, uh,

239
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.680
a quote that I remember where I said,

240
00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:35.350
I stopped trying to find yourself and start to define yourself.

241
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.430
And I felt like the whole time I was trying to find myself and I said, you know,

242
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:43.390
I'm a, I'm a define who the I am. I'm going to say, this is what I am.

243
00:14:43.391 --> 00:14:47.800
This is what I do. I'm a fighter. it. Let's go. It's do or die. Um,

244
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.650
I've, I've been to jail and dad, I've been, you, uh,

245
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.510
I've slept in on, in the snow. You know what I mean? Like I've been homeless,

246
00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.550
I've done every low thing you can do.

247
00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.700
Like what's the worst that can happen to get knocked out. There's nothing. So,

248
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.830
uh, you know, I decided to, you know,

249
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:06.800
this is my path and I'm going to carve the path.

250
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.120
I'm not going to search for a path.

251
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:12.080
I'm going to make the path and I'm not going to look back and I'm going to the

252
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:13.730
top of that mountain. And, uh,

253
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.110
and that's something I still talk about today when I talk to people is about,

254
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.720
uh, I didn't have any idea how I was going to do it,

255
00:15:20.721 --> 00:15:23.180
but I knew why I was going to do it. And I knew that I was going to do it.

256
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:24.440
And I think, um,

257
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.650
in my own personal struggles and I think in a lot of people's struggles,

258
00:15:27.651 --> 00:15:30.920
they kind of get caught up in the, how, you know, how am I going to do this?

259
00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:33.830
How am I gonna win this fight, whatever. And I think when you understand your,

260
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:38.360
why I think the, how becomes a lot more, um, clear,

261
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:42.380
clear, yeah, more clear and easier. I mean, it doesn't matter anymore.

262
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:45.710
You could do, it's better to do it a hundred percent wrong than 50%. Right.
