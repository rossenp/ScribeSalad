00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.740
My prognosis is that it will break itself, break itself.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.830
It will just, it, the backlash to it,

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.860
which can be reasonable and liberal people are going to wake up and they're

5
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:16.230
going to have peak woke and they're not going to have more woke.

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.690
And it will chew itself up from the inside.

7
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:23.610
With these fights between is here's an example of a fight here's exemplified 16,

8
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.390
19 project from the New York times. Nicole Hannah Jones writes this, you know,

9
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:30.840
kind of fake history of the United States saying that we're all about slavery.

10
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.810
Slavery is everything to do with the United States in every regard from the

11
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:38.370
beginning and still, and then, uh, what are they doing now? Right?

12
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:39.091
So there's this huge,

13
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:43.290
intense fight between the black population and the indigenous population for

14
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.320
most racially oppressed. And they both have a pretty good claim on it, right?

15
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.130
So that genocide thing was pretty, pretty big.

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.210
And then slavery was pretty big and it's complicated.

17
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.670
So they're going to, they're fighting for status.

18
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.500
So you had the indigenous side of that assert that black people in north

19
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:05.670
America are settlers of color, which is a problem. And then you've had Nicole,

20
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.090
Hannah Jones tried to point out that lots of native Americans held black slaves,

21
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.640
which so there were slave owners, which is a problem.

22
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:15.420
So they're fighting over that in fighting for status for the ultimate victim

23
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:18.240
status. And then they've got like that trans things coming.

24
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.500
I saw a video of some black woman the other day yelling about what is this black

25
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.990
power fist on the trans flag about? That's not, you know,

26
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.490
that's not what this is supposed to be all black.

27
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.720
People's not supposed to be at white people,

28
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:29.120
trans white people putting their stuff. I thought.

29
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.650
<v 1>It was really clever that trans people jumped in and had that black</v>

30
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:37.950
trans lives matter rally. Right? Cause it was like, you,

31
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:40.760
you might be the only people that can get away with this right now.

32
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.410
This is the thing. No one else can hop in on that, but black trans lives matter.

33
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.350
And there was like hundreds of thousands of people because everybody felt like

34
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.260
you had to just keep, keep protesting.

35
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.410
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. So I think it's going to chew itself up inside,</v>

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.530
but everything that took over is going with it. Like the, the,

37
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.620
I don't know how long it's gonna take the university to not be kind of like a,

38
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.240
I don't know about that anymore. Well.

39
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.250
<v 1>Yeah. When do they say anything like that?</v>

40
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.240
Particularly if they get so much massive pushback from the people that they're,

41
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.200
you know, they're teaching.

42
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.190
<v 0>Right?</v>

43
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.850
I mean the number of people right now that are saying they want deferrals,

44
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.280
partly because of the COVID in online classes,

45
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.570
they don't want to go back to college.

46
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.060
And then this stuff's blown out in every college presidents.

47
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:21.800
Like we're going to be a full anti racist thing.

48
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.680
The other thing nobody's factoring in yet is the other backlash,

49
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.560
which is going to be law. Okay. Uh,

50
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.400
Niagara falls of lawsuits has coming because a bunch of people are,

51
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.970
so here's here. Like, imagine you run a business, you, you do run a business.

52
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.480
So all of a sudden, you know, this event happens,

53
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.100
everybody's supposed to have their statement.

54
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:41.960
There's tons of social pressure to make your statement.

55
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:45.650
If you don't make a statement, it's compelled, you know, say, oh, your business,

56
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:47.420
didn't say something about black lives matter.

57
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:48.830
So you have to say something one way or the other.

58
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.540
So everybody's making a statement,

59
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:53.210
everybody's trying to do the thing and they don't know what to do.

60
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.140
So I hear from a lot of people that email me about, um, the, at their job,

61
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.530
what their, they talked to their boss and the boss is like, well,

62
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.280
we have to do something. And there's this, you know, there's this program,

63
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.180
this anti-racism program. So we have to do something. And that's the thing.

64
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.710
And we'll just take it up in.

65
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.290
A lot of people are successfully pushing back on that and saying, look,

66
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.640
there are other ways we can actually do other diversity programs and this one.

67
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.030
And when they realize that, you know, a lot of bosses are saying, huh, yeah,

68
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.710
maybe we should think a little harder about this.

69
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.840
So everybody's acting really fast. And there is a,

70
00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.780
there's a clear moral panic going on.

71
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.310
So people are making bad decisions and they're opening themselves up to a lot of

72
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:31.270
future litigation.

73
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.660
Like if you're actually having an official statement or policy of your company

74
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.060
that says something like, uh,

75
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.560
that you believe that all white people are complicit and racism or racists,

76
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.980
and you've now called all your white employees, racist. That's not good.

77
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.940
That's probably discriminatory. But do you think.

78
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.100
<v 1>You can actually Sue someone for that?</v>

79
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.200
<v 0>My point isn't whether or not you can,</v>

80
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.630
my point is that a lot of people are going to try.

81
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.880
<v 1>But I think that the courts are even siding towards being more woke because it's</v>

82
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:02.100
society's cultural shifts.

83
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.970
<v 0>Some yes and some, no. And that's, there's a point to that.</v>

84
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:08.730
But on the other hand, for example, if you look at the title,

85
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.640
nine cases were those mostly boys would, it wasn't always,

86
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:13.860
boys got wholly railroaded in kangaroo courts.

87
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.870
They got accused of sexual misconduct.

88
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.440
The university ends up expelling them or whatever, you know,

89
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.300
the girl with a mattress or whatever that happened.

90
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.320
And then they're suing in civil court and they're almost all winning.

91
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.630
<v 1>Is that, did that kid, the mattress boy, did he Sue? I don't know.</v>

92
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.040
<v 0>No. If he did specifically or not,</v>

93
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.350
but I do know that there've been a number of civil suits.

94
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.270
<v 1>That lady was bringing her mattress on the stage when she accepted her,</v>

95
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.523
her diploma.

96
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.220
<v 0>I mean, it's performance art. Yeah. It's just performance art.</v>

97
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.780
It's it's really like, we can't run the world on performance art though.

98
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.450
<v 1>Yeah. Wow. What's really strange too,</v>

99
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:55.140
is that if you accuse someone of something and it turns out that not be true,

100
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:57.680
you don't really get in trouble for that. That.

101
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.980
<v 0>That's the thing. That's a real problem because there's no.</v>

102
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.600
<v 1>Actual repercussions for being deceptive and ruining someone's life.</v>

103
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.200
I have a friend who was accused of sexual assault by a woman,

104
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:15.060
and it was proven that he didn't do it and nothing ever happened to her that's

105
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.730
she made some stuff up about him. And.

106
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.340
<v 0>So we got laws against revenge porn, right?</v>

107
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.860
Like you can't like film your girlfriend or whatever,

108
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:24.480
and then you break up and then you put it on her,

109
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.720
put her on the internet to put her on blast or embarrass her or whatever it's

110
00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:29.520
against the law. Now we made laws about that.

111
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.150
I mean this doxing stuff or these videos where they're filming people and

112
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:35.280
accusing him of being racist and it blows up their lives.

113
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.190
Like there may have to be legislation built around that.

114
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.700
So the question becomes will, the political will be there.

115
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.370
And that depends on the people. And it depends on the politicians.

116
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.100
I know your lovely state here in California,

117
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.700
just the state legislature just voted to take the anti-discrimination language

118
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:54.600
out of the state constitution, which I think is a bold move. Um,

119
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.370
I think the people get to decide on that in the, and maybe November,

120
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:00.170
but what is the anti-discrimination.

121
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.900
<v 1>Language in the constitution that they're removing?</v>

122
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.330
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.740
You're going to pull that one up as like article 31 or something like that.

124
00:06:08.741 --> 00:06:13.720
It is unbelievable that they voted to put this up to be pulled out of the

125
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:16.180
constitution. What, what was there? It's like,

126
00:06:16.181 --> 00:06:20.110
you can't discriminate or favor by race, uh,

127
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.730
gender sex, sexual orientation, so on and so forth. Why would they remove that?

128
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.080
Because equity requires discrimination. If you listen to this guy,

129
00:06:29.081 --> 00:06:30.910
that's blasting all over EBM candy.

130
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.650
That how to be anti-racist even has a sentence in the book where he says that

131
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:39.370
you have to evaluate everything according to whether it has racist or anti

132
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.061
outcomes.

133
00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:44.260
So if you have discrimination policy that says you cannot discriminate,

134
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.450
and then that makes it so you don't have equity,

135
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.800
then that's actually a racist policy. So they're actually advocate. I mean,

136
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:55.210
equity requires discrimination, correct, but it'll be positive discriminate.

137
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.250
Well, it might actually be white males.

138
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.110
It'll be discrimination for at first discrimination for minority.

139
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.600
So the equivalent of affirmative action and reparations,

140
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.070
and then they'll add in possibly discrimination against if they aren't achieving

141
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:09.880
what they're trying to.

142
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.340
<v 1>Is this clear that this is their motivations is.</v>

143
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.320
<v 0>I mean, they're, they don't lie about it.</v>

144
00:07:14.321 --> 00:07:17.980
They just say it all the time is that if it's, if you don't have equal outcomes,

145
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.190
then the system must be, I mean, you can see how this is like putting like,

146
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.680
you know, wallpaper over a hole in your wall.

147
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.710
If the system has unequal outcomes, it must be discrimination.

148
00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:31.120
So you're just to going to change the policies to make up for it. And that,

149
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.010
I mean, they say it explicitly and you see this,

150
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:35.650
that there've been actually there's a lawsuit, at least one lawsuit,

151
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:38.470
one in New York city where they were openly discriminating against Asian

152
00:07:38.471 --> 00:07:40.240
students. Like they were,

153
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.540
they were discriminating against Asians to make it cause they're, you know,

154
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:47.260
they're academically kicking all the. And so they were making.

155
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.970
<v 1>It more difficult for, they would have to have had a higher GPA to get in. Yeah.</v>

156
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.050
W where's going,

157
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.810
what's going on with that Harvard there's a lawsuit with Harvard with that.

158
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.080
Right. I don't know where it, where it's at though. Yeah. That is a,

159
00:07:59.081 --> 00:08:00.810
that's troubling. This.

160
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.660
<v 0>This is troubling stuff. And I mean, I say, California does this.</v>

161
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:09.010
I don't know what happens because it's in violation of the federal laws.

162
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:14.170
So, I mean, it's directly against the title seven who's pushing for that.

163
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.030
Uh who's. I mean,

164
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.540
all of these kinds of like hustlers that are getting all famous are pushing for

165
00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:21.070
it, but then I, again,

166
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:25.900
as your state legislature actually voted amongst themselves to put it up to a

167
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:30.250
vote, um, all the more reason to, to move to Texas or something.

168
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.050
<v 1>That's so spooky. It's like, where do they think the goes? It's like,</v>

169
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:38.380
there's no map of the territory. There's no,

170
00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:41.050
like if we do this, then you know,

171
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.580
we're going to have this kind of success in the future because, you know, we'll,

172
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.270
we will discriminate to the point where we reach some sort of

173
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.170
homeostasis. I mean, equality. Okay.
