<v 1>That things are new is when things are newly invented or when they're new</v>

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.040
events, like it has to be like a significant event or a new invention.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.200
Then, then things open up new pathways. Other than that, like,

and a rope around his mouth was tied to his genitals.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.810
No big deal and a sex toy in his boot law enforcement officials said

a sources said quest was initially busted for loitering. &lt;laugh&gt;.

80
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.410
<v 0>It really wasn't about that.</v>

81
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.250
<v 1>Aside from the oddly configured rope,</v>

82
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.960
the search also turned up a sex toy inside of his boot.

83
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.520
That means his &lt;laugh&gt; and a small bag of methamphetamine in his

84
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.680

The official said as he was being escorted out, he volunteered in quotes.

103
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.930
I have meth in my pocket.

104
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.250
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; according to an official briefed on the case,

105
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.360
the police searched him and recovered a small amount of methamphetamine in a

106
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.360
Ziploc bag and a rope around his Dick and his neck.

107
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.480
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; and a sex joint. His.</v>

108
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.480
<v 1>More importantly, there's a lot of dudes.</v>

109
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.080
<v 0>Who do meth. They do. They keep it.</v>

110
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.680
<v 1>Together and they stay on the farm.</v>

111
00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.560
<v 0>What kind of boots he had on his there's a snake in my boot. No, in his boot.</v>

112
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.160
<v 1>That means in his. Is this an English paper?</v>

113
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.200
<v 0>No it's no, it is New York. It was central.</v>

114
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.080
<v 1>Park. I think they mean his. I.</v>

115
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.080
<v 0>Don't think, think they mean his boot. I think.</v>

116
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.800
<v 1>They mean in his, in his, as.</v>

117
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.910
<v 0>That that's a whole new dimens. That's.</v>

118
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.230
<v 1>Your trunk, bro. They wouldn't call, you know what? English?</v>

119
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.550
<v 0>No in England, but it's like this isn't this, this New York.</v>

120
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.990
<v 1>Times. Yes. They're using proper British English. Don't that's America.</v>

121
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.470
It's New York times called boots of boot in America.

122
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.750
<v 0>Let's go with the better angle on it. This day was in his. Yeah. I mean,</v>

124
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.950
<v 1>That's the better New York post. Not New York times. It was in his.</v>

125
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.790
That's why they said his boots, his boots,

126
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.860
his boot is it's proper British for like, if you watch like, uh, that is.

And James May they refer to it's trunk as the boot. It's the boot. Yes.

130
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.060
It's in his. Right? The guy had a sex toy. His. Hey,

131
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.273

<v 0>Yes, sir.</v>

136
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.890
<v 1>Even if he didn't get caught with that in his,</v>

137
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.410
he's still doing meth and talking to cops. Like what?

138
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.330

<v 0>In that jail. Yeah, I think so. A hundred percent. I think so a hundred.</v>

153
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:13.940
<v 1>A.</v>

154
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.340
<v 0>Hundred dismissed.</v>

155
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.610
You had meth and a rope already

156
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.490
connecting your neck and.

157
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:27.410
<v 1>And probably a sex toy in your. Yeah. The UK, the UK.</v>

158
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.050
<v 0>Version issue at the very least in, I was gonna say in his shoe,</v>

159
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:34.130
which is weird enough. It might, it might even be.

160
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.570
<v 1>Weirder, but let's not jump to conclusions. Yeah.</v>

161
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:41.440
This also just be a confusing interpretation of the American version of boot and

162
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.640
them saying maybe they think.

163
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.793
<v 0>Shoe means that.</v>

164
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.680
<v 1>It was with another man. Ooh, mention that.</v>

165
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:47.713
<v 0>The other one. Oh.</v>

166
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.880
<v 1>His boot. Nobody's got a rubber Dick in their boot. That's outrageous.</v>

167
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.840
That would make your boot all uncomfortable.

168
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.640
Why wouldn't you just put it in your pocket? It's in his, bro.

169
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.200
Let's just run with that. Cause he had meth in his pocket.

170
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.320
That's why no more Google search.

171
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.080
Shut off all the computers spread misinformation. &lt;laugh&gt; look.

172
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.920
I'm sure it was just an issue. Whatever, whatever you don't ever volunteer,

173
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.040
that you have drugs, let them find the drugs. Yeah.

174
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.990
Let him the drugs unless you wanna the cop. I have a quick,

175
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.310
good one on that level, on that.
