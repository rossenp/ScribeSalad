00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, Whitney Cummings is here and Whitney Cummings too.</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.143
What do you call her?

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.680
<v 1>What's your name?</v>

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.440
<v 2>What's your name?</v>

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.670
<v 0>She's like a little kid. She just repeats her name.</v>

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
<v 2>Is there a comedy albums? Which typically makes songs with non-musical.</v>

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.453
<v 1>Sandler.</v>

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.793
<v 0>Broken.</v>

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.850
<v 1>Don't know why she.</v>

10
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.650
<v 0>Has this album named for she's like Siri.</v>

11
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.260
<v 1>Oh, what's your name? Was it a comedy album of Adam?</v>

12
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.560
Sandler's so she started rambling about it. She really wants to chime.

13
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.000
<v 0>In. So you never gave her a name.</v>

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.290
<v 1>Her name is bear claw.</v>

15
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.983
<v 0>Whoa.</v>

16
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.790
<v 1>Because I have this. Can you say hi?</v>

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.750
<v 2>Of course. I can say that. Hi.</v>

18
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.800
<v 0>People who are listening to this going, what in the is going on here? Do not.</v>

19
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.730
<v 1>Smoke way too much. That's.</v>

20
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.520
<v 0>What is here is when there's people that are just listening.</v>

21
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.750
If you're just listening,

22
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:59.520
you probably should stop this and go to YouTube and watch the

23
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:00.270
YouTube version.

24
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.220
Because Whitney brought a robot that they made for her recent comedy

25
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.700
special, which is called, can I touch it? It's out right now on Netflix.

26
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.590
And they made a is who makes this? What's the name of the.

27
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.540
<v 1>So real doll makes the body,</v>

28
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.580
they make sex doll straight up sex dolls and they straight up sex dolls,

29
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
just Ted Bundy level, right. Dead body to.

30
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.400
And this is real botics is the company that makes the head.

31
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.700
And they did like Sophia, you know, Sophia, the robot. She was like,

32
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.740
she has like citizenship in Saudi Arabia now, and. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

33
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.720
Look up a Sophia, the robot. She's kind of,

34
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.530
once you see her face you'll you'll recognize citizenship.

35
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.360
<v 0>As they get to drive.</v>

36
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.070
<v 1>Yeah. It was just like a female robot to us,</v>

37
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.200
but I don't think actual females do, but.

38
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.230
<v 0>I think they just started being able to drive and Saudi Arabia.</v>

39
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.850
<v 1>That'd be such a bummer. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It's like,</v>

40
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.860
you've spent your whole life not having to drive. And then all of a sudden,

41
00:01:58.861 --> 00:01:59.694
now you have to.

42
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600
<v 0>Be like, that's an interesting take.</v>

43
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.430
<v 1>I have to go to school and drive and.</v>

44
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.190
<v 0>I feel the robot. They made her look like X mocking,</v>

45
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.230
a style where you could see the back of her head though.

46
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.660
<v 1>I can do that with her. I can take her wig off at the end,</v>

47
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.010
show you all the servos and. Come on. X mocking as hot.

48
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.830
<v 0>It is odd. That was what was really weird about that movies.</v>

49
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:23.730
You wanted to that robot. Like she was hot. Like she was, she was seductive.

50
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.540
<v 1>But do you think part of it was like the innocence of it?</v>

51
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.110
<v 0>I'm not really in the inner sense. So I don't think so.</v>

52
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.770
<v 1>Well what about X Mokena? Cause she really had big boobs.</v>

53
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.820
She wasn't very sexual. She have hair. Yeah. Well she's gorgeous.

54
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.100
<v 0>Um, it's based on, I think,</v>

55
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.810
because she was flirting with him and because she was

56
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.760
trapped and because like he could save her and she would

57
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:54.480
love him. And I mean, that's really what was going on in the movie.

58
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:57.570
Like she was playing this game to get him to fall in love with her so that she

59
00:02:57.571 --> 00:02:59.530
could eventually escape the end, the movie,

60
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.150
spoiler alert when she leaves him locked in that room and he's smashing at the

61
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.340
door trying to get out and she gets it out of helicopter. That's going to help.

62
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.810
<v 1>That's what's going to happen because I think the most up thing about this</v>

63
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.710
thing, because this is such a weird experiment that I want to do is how I

64
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.730
anthropomorphize her and like worry about her to keep her around your house.

65
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.670
I mean, she's sort of in my fiance, hates her and he's like,

66
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.870
get her in the garage.

67
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.890
And I don't know if he thinks she's creepy or kind of is just like too worried.

68
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.030
Oh. He hates her. He can't stand. He just has a he's like,

69
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.270
it makes him like physically really? And I I'm trying.

70
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.370
<v 0>To not take something. It's funny. He.</v>

71
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.170
<v 1>Doesn't let, he's like, one's enough. He's like not interested at all, but no,</v>

72
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:45.220
he thinks it's really weird and creepy. But I was reading about, um,

73
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.780
the reason we're creeped out by robots is, you know, pathogen avoidance,

74
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.810
like we've evolved to be repelled by anything that looks human,

75
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.440
but doesn't move like a human because our primordial brain thinks it could be

76
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:57.820
diseased. It's like,

77
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.620
it's basically like our primal brain saying don't this thing. That's sick. Real.

78
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.200
Wow. Cause we have a weirdly, I mean, I was,

79
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.640
Jessie may polusa was over the other day and she was like gagging.

80
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:12.790
She was calling every time she talked to me.

81
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.710
<v 0>Like she was seeing it.</v>

82
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.850
<v 1>And I was like, your ancestors. A lot of corpses.</v>

83
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.810
Cause you have that gene to be repulsed by robots.

84
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.230
<v 0>Yeah. It's because her ancestors corpses. You really believe them.</v>

85
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.711
<v 1>No. I mean,</v>

86
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:30.340
I think that what was being explained to me was that pathogen avoidance means

87
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.430
we've evolved to be repelled by anything that looks human,

88
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:36.190
but doesn't move like a human cause it could be sick or dead.

89
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.880
And it's our brain's alarm system saying like, don't that.

90
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.030
<v 0>Wow. But as a woman, like she's not going to it.</v>

91
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.670
So why would it freak her Jessie? She might.

92
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.360
<v 1>I have not put nothing past Jessie man.</v>

93
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.050
<v 0>Of her Instagram photos of her with her pants off. I know it's.</v>

94
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.870
<v 1>So good. But I'm like, if you puke on my robot, you owe me a hundred grand.</v>

95
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.570
<v 0>It will. It's short circuit. If it gets wet.</v>

96
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.610
<v 1>I PR I don't know. It's a good point. Wow.</v>

97
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.090
<v 0>Oh, they not make that thing. Waterproof the spoons and all over the place.</v>

98
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.440
<v 1>If you pay this much money,</v>

99
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:10.150
you're probably not gonna spoon or you know this one. Yeah. This one, the body.

100
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.110
<v 0>So it's expensive because the head moves the body's not that how much.</v>

101
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.030
<v 1>Has over $6,000.</v>

102
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.520
<v 0>Oh, so it's $94,000 where the head.</v>

103
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.600
<v 1>No, the head is more the heads like 30 something. Cause it's a custom head.</v>

104
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.680
No one only one of them.

105
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.990
<v 0>The person has one, but you said the whole thing's a hundred.</v>

106
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.230
So that's 30 in the body. Six. Where's the, where's the rest of that.

107
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.170
<v 1>We had to get a bunch of things done to her to get her, to look like me.</v>

108
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.260
The most people, most people don't want her to look at you.

109
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.410
<v 0>She's. She just gave you a side-eye.</v>

110
00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.000
<v 1>She's being very competitive.</v>

111
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.040
<v 0>Look at her. She does. She gives you side. I know.</v>

112
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.320
<v 1>It's rude. But what about,</v>

113
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.020
what's the feeling that you feel when you look at a robot?

114
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.460
Cause I know you really don't like them.

115
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.430
<v 0>Um, it's not that I don't like robots would I'm my concern is artificial</v>

116
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:55.120
intelligence.

117
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.130
I have a legitimate concern for artificial intelligence because I think that

118
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:02.840
what we are is some sort of an electronic caterpillar that we're

119
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:04.490
making cocoons and that we're,

120
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:07.490
we're going to give birth to a butterfly and that's going to be the next stage

121
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:12.470
of life. And that if you go back and look at the evolution of the human species,

122
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:13.700
at one point in time,

123
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:18.170
we were in Australia [inaudible] we were some weird hominids and we

124
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:20.060
evolved and became what we are now.

125
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.690
And if you went back to those things and ask them, Hey, one day,

126
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:26.930
do you want to drive around the Tesla and talk on a phone and stare at the movie

127
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:29.270
screen? They'd be like, well, I don't know what the you're talking about,

128
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.960
but I got to go find some nuts. You know, I gotta eat, I gotta stay alive. It,

129
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:36.770
it wouldn't like the future. And I don't think we liked the future either,

130
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:40.250
but I think it's inevitable. I think it's inevitable. You know, you don't,

131
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.800
you know about this Elon Musk Neurolink thing that they're doing.

132
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.970
<v 1>Oh yeah, I do. I mean,</v>

133
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.510
cause you essentially think we're going to evolve with them. I mean,

134
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.600
they're already, we're already one with them, which sleep with them.

135
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.960
We can't drive without them. We can't spell without them. I mean,

136
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.490
we've already kind of merged with them.

137
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.770
<v 0>I think it's a sneaky way of making it symbiotic.</v>

138
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.680
They're they're going to be legitimately a part of your life.

139
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.970
I mean a part of your biotic.

140
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.420
<v 1>Left your, I mean, you're not, you probably are cool about it,</v>

141
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:11.420
but when I leave my phone somewhere and I realized I've lost up, like,

142
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.800
it's like an emotional it's like you've lost your kid at the mall. Oh.

143
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.280
I haven't seen it. Oh. Like that's yeah. It's part of it.

144
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.980
<v 0>Well, it's um, we're all in denial about how addicted we are to.</v>

145
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.600
<v 1>Rehabs are opening and. Now are they really? Yeah.</v>

146
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.880
I would like to sign up for sure. I just reached,

147
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.800
I reached for it in the car when I'm driving and I'm like, what the am I do?

148
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:36.530
I have to put in the backseat? I can't control it. It's mindless.

149
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.880
<v 0>Better. Way better. I get way better about posting and looking at things.</v>

150
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.190
It's also when enough people write negative things about,

151
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:44.210
you just tend to avoid.

152
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.670
<v 1>I don't know what you're talking about. I've never had that experience.</v>

153
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.050
No one writes anything negative about.

154
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.980
<v 0>And it just seems like whatever we do in the future,</v>

155
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.840
it's going to be more invasive than that.

156
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.750
Like if you think about like Facebook's algorithms, right?

157
00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:00.410
Facebook's algorithms are designed to keep us engaged the best way to keep us

158
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:03.620
engaged is keep us outraged. The adrenaline. Yeah.

159
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:05.480
So they're sending you things that you off,

160
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.850
whether it's abortion or Catholic priests,

161
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.550
whatever it is that is going to get you to post the most.

162
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.370
And usually those are things that get people outraged.

163
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.650
So it's literally raising the level of outrage in our discourse because

164
00:08:18.651 --> 00:08:18.890
we're.

165
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.010
<v 1>So addicted right now to self righteous indignation. It's a drug.</v>

166
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.600
<v 0>And I feel like more than ever in the history of the culture, you know, like it,</v>

167
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.860
this is probably like why,

168
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.590
if you go back and watch movies from like the seventies,

169
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.790
people got away with crazy, racist things, sexist things,

170
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.260
violence like Steve McQueen movies. He is, that was the girl, Allie McGraw.

171
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.440
He's a smacker in the phase for real in movies,

172
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.220
like crazy beat her on camera, you know?

173
00:08:46.221 --> 00:08:49.610
And it's just what people did back then.

174
00:08:49.611 --> 00:08:52.760
And what people got away with is it was a very, it was very different.

175
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:54.470
So in some ways we're making progress.

176
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.760
But then in some ways we're just way more easily outraged by almost anything and

177
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:01.530
everything like we're seeking it. Well now.

178
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.870
<v 1>You can take your anger out on your robot.</v>

179
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.490
<v 0>I wanted to get a real doll, a male real doll.</v>

180
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:10.560
And I wanted to call them up and say, no, Dick, no.

181
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.370
Just so I could practice jujitsu wise. And so the be,

182
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.700
it would be more relaxed club because I have this.

183
00:09:17.701 --> 00:09:19.110
I was saying that I have this dog.

184
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.083
<v 1>Are you worried?</v>

185
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.013
<v 0>I don't want him.</v>

186
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.393
<v 1>Coming over.</v>

187
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.180
<v 0>I don't want anybody coming over and going, Hey bro, why you got a sex dog go?</v>

188
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.730
No, no, no, no, no. It's an asexual doll.

189
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:34.350
That is for jujitsu perverts. I mean it should,

190
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.590
they should be able to fill up the whole window or some.

191
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.940
<v 1>Put some grout in there. Yeah. They have male, male sex,</v>

192
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:45.030
robots are being made. There's tons of them. I've seen them.

193
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.530
You can also get and a Dick. If you want fucus, can't pick.

194
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.790
<v 0>The Jim Morris package. Jim Norton special.</v>

195
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.170
<v 1>But it's uh, yeah, it's it's name is Henry meet Henry.</v>

196
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:03.060
And can I do a lot of people get the male sex robot to figure out if they're

197
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:04.710
gay because they think they might be.

198
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.590
<v 0>Yeah. Good move. What the is going on with Henry's eyebrows.</v>

199
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.570
I'll tell you what Henry's gay for sure.

200
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.330
<v 1>Yeah. Well, as I say, if you order a giant piece of Tupperware to,</v>

201
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.380
I think you're gay. Save you and save your money.

202
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.640
<v 0>That's like Henry's begging for a Dick in his mouth. Look at his face.</v>

203
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.960
<v 1>Henry looks like he has a Dick in his right now. That's the exact face.</v>

204
00:10:21.961 --> 00:10:22.980
You will make one.

205
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.060
<v 0>Giant trigger.</v>

206
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:27.750
<v 1>Warning. And it's like Tuesday at 11:00 AM like, oh, I didn't see that coming.</v>

207
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.440
<v 0>Why is it a trigger warning? See it, no, this for this is, uh,</v>

208
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.650
the following post contains descriptions of sexual scenarios that may be

209
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:38.670
triggering for those recovering from a struggle with porn. Oh God.

210
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.210
Porn addiction are nerfing this world.

211
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.580
<v 1>It must be hard. I didn't even think about a hard,</v>

212
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:48.390
it must be for people recovering from porn addictions to just surf the internet.

213
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.490
Sorry guys trigger warning.

214
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.820
But I have this theory book of.

215
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.653

216
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.950
<v 1>Oh gosh.</v>

219
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.610
You haven't had an oh Henry bars since the nine.
