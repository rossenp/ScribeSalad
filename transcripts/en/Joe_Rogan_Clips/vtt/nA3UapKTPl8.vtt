00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 2>Well, I call it tomorrow. Oops, mana vet. Yeah, no, I mean,</v>

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.400
for sure in the Gilbert burns fight, that was veteran.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.280
He just weathered that storm in that first round.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.920
And then by the end of the first round was winning. Yeah. You know,

6
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.020
and then him up in the second and.

7
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.760
<v 1>His striking is getting better. Oh my God.</v>

8
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.200
<v 0>It's getting better. That fight this weekend is very interesting. You know,</v>

9
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:25.650
I watched the first fight again the other day and I'm gonna tell you something,

10
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:28.620
man. Mazda doll was all over him in that first round. And.

11
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.630
<v 1>That was last minute, correct?</v>

12
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.640
<v 0>Six days. Notice he stuffed.</v>

13
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.250
<v 1>What? 11 of his take downs, which is unheard of with newsmen.</v>

14
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.120
<v 0>Yeah. But more importantly was not in condition. No.</v>

15
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.960
Was not prepared for a fight like that. They offered it to him. He took it.

16
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.550
He went there six days notice. And um, I mean that first round,

17
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.290
he looked very good if he only won that one round one that's what's important in

18
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.120
the fight because it was Mon made adjustments.

19
00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.890
Another thing that's important to note is that oops,

20
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.150
apparently had shattered his nose two weeks before that fight. Wow. Yeah.

21
00:01:00.151 --> 00:01:04.410
So his nose was because after the fight, you know, they, they, you know,

22
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.710
had them checked out and his, he had a broken nose and he was like,

23
00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:11.730
my nose is already broken. Like his nose is up two weeks before the fight.

24
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.180
<v 1>Yeah. I think about it. He's been, man. Is that he, he,</v>

25
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.760
some people say he's boring, you know, boring fighter. I think he's great.

26
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.210
I think he's a.

27
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.950
<v 0>Great, wasn't worrying that Gilbert burns.</v>

28
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.500
<v 1>No, he wasn't. I think he's great, man. He's he presses the fight.</v>

29
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
He's got cardio for days in a guy that looks has that kind of physique or no,

30
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.080
it shouldn't have that kind of cardio. And he's got, he's just,

31
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.270
I think he's great. I think he's got charisma, man. His,

32
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.560
his striking is getting better. He freaking knocked out Colby, Covington, TKO,

33
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.530
and broke his jaw. And that he beat burns with the jab.

34
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.390
<v 0>Anybody who says he's boring as an.</v>

35
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.070
<v 1>Idiot, you get poked in the eye, just poke yourself in the eye. I mean.</v>

36
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.760
<v 0>You gotta be an idiot to think that guy's boring. That's crazy. Look,</v>

37
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.100
he did what he had to do. The wind, the Mazda, the doll fight.

38
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.500
But if you take any consideration,

39
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.050
the fact that he had a broken nose going into the fight and you take into

40
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:05.220
consideration, the fact that Mazda doll is, you know, you fought him, he's game,

41
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.700
good.

42
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.420
<v 1>He's game.</v>

43
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.360
<v 0>And he's clever and he's experienced. And he's a real vet.</v>

44
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.910
<v 1>As a real vet. That's that? That's, uh, somebody that who you cannot break,</v>

45
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:18.880
this guy's will in a fight. No, I've seen it. I've broken. Guy's wills. And,

46
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.380
and they're in a fight when a guy like that who comes out just as hard in the

47
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:26.580
last round as he does in the first and still has got power and still is just,

48
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.060
just a Savage. Just, weren't just wanting to rip your head off. It's scary,

49
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:34.320
dude. Or you hit him. He just laughed. He smiles at you. Yeah. And you normally,

50
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:38.610
when guys do that, they're hurt. Right. But this guy, you know, that's just,

51
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.630
he's just a G man. He's slick. And I like him because he's, he is who he is.

52
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.810
He is not faking nobody. He's not trying to be somebody who's not. I.

53
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.310
<v 0>Love when he dresses like Tony Montana.</v>

54
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.570
<v 1>He's got the whole suit get up.</v>

55
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.040
<v 0>When I talked to him here at Willow,</v>

56
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.820
my favorite moments of the podcast with him here, it was. So I asked him,

57
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.580
I said, well, I go, the question is, uh, can Ben ask her and get a hold of you?

58
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.560
He goes, he can get ahold of these nuts.

59
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.370
<v 1>I see that guy, why I saw, I love, I love that guy. And it was funny.</v>

60
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.820
I was in Singapore, me and him both were there for as gas fighters.

61
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:15.580
And that's when, that's where we made that fight happen. Uh,

62
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.590
we had planned it out there.

63
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.050
He was wanting to work his way up and I had just lost the tire.

64
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.790
And so the second time, so I was, let's make it happen, man. And,

65
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.410
uh, he's, I think what's changed from him.

66
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.350
I wouldn't say so much his style, but his mindset.

67
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.340
<v 0>Yeah. He talked about that. The resurrection. Yep. Well,</v>

68
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.970
you know what had happened? He went on a reality show. Do you know the story?

69
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.990
<v 1>I think so. Yeah. And did it,</v>

70
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.580
was it the preparation or was it.

71
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.190
<v 0>Um, we talked about that on this podcast too.</v>

72
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.700
He went on this reality show and it was a nightmare. And he was,

73
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.100
it was like in the jungle and this reality show,

74
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:57.880
like he had to like go into villages to try to get food. It was. It's crazy.

75
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.380
It was a south American reality show.

76
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.580
And apparently he was there for a long time and he had no contact with the

77
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:06.280
outside world. It was a disaster, hated the show,

78
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.070
but it gave him a lot of chance to think about his life,

79
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.690
about where he was and then what his future is going to be and realize that

80
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:15.910
maybe some things have been holding them back.

81
00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.450
The one thing that had been holding them back was he was trying not to lose

82
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.470
versus trying to win. And that he was a little bit worried about his condition.

83
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.010
Cause maybe he didn't train enough. Maybe didn't prepare correctly.

84
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.110
And then he just decided, look, I'm going to go for it. Yeah. So here he is.

85
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.620
I mean, Mazda, Donald's got to be your age, right? It's probably 38.

86
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.670
It was in the rain. Yeah.

87
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.460
<v 1>She gets a little bit, yeah, it might be a little bit younger, 36,</v>

88
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:40.090
something like that.

89
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.940
But one of the most popular guys in the UFC said he was going to do it.

90
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.040
It's their fight for the title.

91
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.100
<v 0>Let's just think about what he did after that. Think about his fight.</v>

92
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.450
Like the fight with Nate Diaz. Oh. How the knockout,

93
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.780
a Terran till the Darren till knockout was crazy.

94
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.530
<v 1>And he, him getting knocked down early in that fight, we got knocked down,</v>

95
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:01.410
comes back. Oh my goodness.

96
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.150
<v 0>And, and owed him in the most vicious fashion and the way he did it to where he</v>

97
00:05:07.151 --> 00:05:10.150
set it up, that switch, we stepped in and throws the left hook.

98
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.250
<v 1>Well, he grabbed his front hand. I don't know if you saw that,</v>

99
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.850
grabbed his front hand, pulls it down and hits him with a left. Yup.

100
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.950
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, so, so smooth. So well he's so clever.</v>

101
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.210
He's clever. Like the knockout of Ben Askren. I give people think, oh,

102
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:28.870
he just ran at him and threw a flying knee. No, no, no, no.

103
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:34.120
He went to the side. Yeah. And then he came out change. Man went at him also.

104
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:36.040
So aspirin has to follow him,

105
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.810
which even more activates aspirin's natural desire to grab you.

106
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.810
<v 1>Right. I mean, he showed him planning for it. He didn't wait to.</v>

107
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.540
<v 0>Leave the sun. We're asking aspirin shoots. Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.540
I mean went to the side and then boom.

109
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.340
<v 1>The whole lead up to that was awesome. Oh my God, Kim, just.</v>

110
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.043
<v 0>Incredible.</v>

111
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.120
<v 1>Yeah. You know, just look at like a freaking G and then.</v>

112
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.650
<v 0>He steps off and that roles of him in midair</v>

113
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.950
landing that need a Ben's face. Jack,

114
00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:09.830
do you see an angry look on his face?

115
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.940
That's one of the classic all time MMA photos. See if he can find that.

116
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.300
<v 1>And then him saying it was that necessary to hit him and say that's super</v>

117
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:18.770
necessary. Super necessary. Yeah.

118
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.241
<v 0>Necessary. Well,</v>

119
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:23.960
not only that he like as Ben is out cold after he punched her in the face,

120
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.910
but he's talking to him and slapping the table. Like I told you. Yeah.

121
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.250
<v 1>And what's good about him is that he can cook.</v>

122
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.460
He can throw something like obviously there it is. Wow.

123
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.480
<v 0>That's that one in the middle is the one I'm talking about. The one up. Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.290
Look at that.

125
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.700
That is a classic photo up on the

126
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.190
metal. The middle of the impact. Look at his face. He's so angry.

127
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.800
Bella's down. I was at TV.

128
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.760
<v 1>I was there. So in case anyway, after that fight,</v>

129
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:58.190
I went up and congratulate and was like, man, he's like, thank you.

130
00:06:58.191 --> 00:07:00.290
But I was like, we need to make this fight. Have we need to do it again?

131
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.010
<v 0>I was crazy as. He became a superstar that night.</v>

132
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.460
<v 1>That's right. I've been at two, two knockouts, crazy knockouts back to back.</v>

133
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.360
Yup.

134
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.120
<v 0>And then now he has another chance that it will smile with a full camp.</v>

135
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.940
I think super interested.

136
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.470
<v 1>It's like, all right.</v>

137
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.140
How do you choose against somebody who's been so dominant in the welterweight

138
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:19.520
division? Again, it was men,

139
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.870
but then you get this guy out there who can just out of nowhere, just do out of,

140
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.390
you know, a thought in his head, he hit you with a spin,

141
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:30.710
something or a flying knee or he's so creative and.

142
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.790
<v 0>I'm interested. Teligent I would never count Guzman out.</v>

143
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.550
I think Guzman is one of the small mentally.

144
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:41.690
He's one of the strongest guys that have ever seen compete. His mind. You just,

145
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.440
you never see a weakness from him. You know, he's just, he's so strong.

146
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:48.400
And when he dominated Tyron like that to win the belt, this,

147
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.100
his first shot at the title, no nerves at all, just full dominance,

148
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:55.730
just went at him, just controlled him, smashed him, just beat him up.

149
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.570
Almost tried to take them out at one point in time and empty the gas tank and

150
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:01.280
realize like, Jesus, Tyron's still here.

151
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.460
We talked about it on the podcast to him, like how tired you were. He was like,

152
00:08:04.461 --> 00:08:08.070
bro, I was so tired. I didn't show it. He didn't show,

153
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.610
