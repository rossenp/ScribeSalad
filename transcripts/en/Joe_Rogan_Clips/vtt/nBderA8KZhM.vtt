00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.800
<v 0>Well, Prostin better.</v>

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 1>Naturally produce a furine.</v>

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.320
<v 0>Hmm. Dr. Jud fitty has, has test this, these he's test, these differents, uh,</v>

4
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:12.800
supplements and looked at, uh, sulfur vein, metabolites, and,

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.200
and urine to look at like bioavailability. And so.

6
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.040
<v 1>What is the one that you like? You pros?</v>

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.720
<v 0>Prostin I like apple Prothane I, I I've taken both.</v>

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.470
It's hard to get Prothane in the us. Why is it hard?

9
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.670
Because it's made in it's in France. It's in France. Can you.

10
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.590
<v 1>Get it on Amazon? No.</v>

11
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:29.613
<v 0>What?</v>

12
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.910
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; that's all Amazon's got me hooked.</v>

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.230
<v 0>No, they got hooked clients, but you can get it. It's.</v>

14
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.790
<v 1>Just, you gotta find it somewhere. Uh, they have a website maybe. Yeah. Okay.</v>

15
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.260
<v 0>So Han, okay. That's what I've been taking recently. How much do you take?</v>

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.140
Um, I'm taking three pills a day.

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.020
I think each pill has 10 milligrams with food. Yes,

18
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.540
definitely with food. Yes. Yes.

19
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.420
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;. Why is that for absorption or? Um, yeah.</v>

20
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.530
<v 0>It seems like it can be a little like it, you know,</v>

21
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.570
it seemed, it just sometimes if you're on an empty stomach feels gross.

22
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:11.730
Doesn't feel good. Yeah. Mm-hmm yeah. Um, I've had a lot of people email me,

23
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.690
you know, since the first time you and I talked about Soro vein,

24
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.410
some of 'em have taken AOL,

25
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.410
some have gotten ahold of Proin some doing broccoli sprouts. I mean,

26
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:22.640
I've had people talking about like tumor shrinking and stuff of like, whoa,

27
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.200
one guy. Yeah. I mean, it's like all anecdotal, but, um, I've,

28
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.440
I've had multiple, multiple people talking about the prostate, uh,

29
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.400
stimulating antigen going down. Sorry, prostate. Um,

30
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.720
is it stimulating PSA? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; my brain's sort of dwindling out,

31
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.440
but, um, going down, I know.

32
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.430
<v 1>It's a.</v>

33
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.590
<v 0>Real thing. It really is. It's a real thing. I mean, I kind of,</v>

34
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.550
I feel like I've done really good just from like exercise and mm-hmm,

35
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.270
&lt;affirmative&gt; getting all the fish oil and stuff, but, uh, it's definitely,

36
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.590
there's constantly, it's just all.

37
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.270
<v 1>You're getting a marathon a day. Totally. &lt;laugh&gt; I've seen it.</v>

38
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.900
It's it's uh, the, I mean, people that don't,

39
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:05.780
we were talking about this before the podcast, uh,

40
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.500
with Dan mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; people that don't think that it's difficult to be,

41
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.420
uh, just a mom or a stay-at-home mom. You're crazy.

42
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.660
<v 0>I was so judgemental and I really feel bad. I really do,</v>

43
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.380
because it's the hardest thing like,

44
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.780
like that I've I've ever done is bill has a great job.

45
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.370
<v 1>If you wanna do a good, oh really? He goes, oh, it's the hardest thing he goes.</v>

46
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.370
Any job you can do with your pajamas on is not the hardest thing. &lt;laugh&gt;.

47
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.850
<v 0>I really like bill. He's hilarious. He's hilarious. Yeah. He's hilarious.</v>

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.090
He's a great guy, but I mean,

49
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.050
if you wanna do a good job and you're thinking about like the enriched

50
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:41.050
environment and how important I gotta do re I gotta read to them. I gotta,

51
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.611
you know,

52
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:44.680
all this just mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then all the nutrition knocking the

53
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:48.560
plastic and the, I mean, it's just a lot of work. Like I don't no screen,

54
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.560
you don't wanna have, like,

55
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.880
you don't wanna sit them in front of the television and have 'em watching

56
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.360
cartoons. Right. You know, so which definitely would be easy. Right. Um,

57
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.760
so, and maybe the more kids you have, you're kind of like,

58
00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:03.480
something's gonna give, but, but, uh, it's definitely a very,

59
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.360
very hard, it's a hard job, but very rewarding. So rewarding. Like,

60
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.840
I just can't even believe I ever had a life before my son, you know, with like,

61
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:16.640
I'm just, my life is like, I get so much joy from him now. And I'm just like,

62
00:03:16.641 --> 00:03:18.870
how did I get all this joy before? It's like, well.

63
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.070
<v 1>It's crazy. Cause I remember before you had 'em you were like concerned, like,</v>

64
00:03:23.071 --> 00:03:24.750
boy, I wonder where my time's gonna go.

65
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.550
If I'm still gonna be able to do research. It's like, we'll, see's.

66
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 0>Hard. Yeah. Yeah. It's hard. And I,</v>

67
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:34.950
thankfully I have my mother who helps out a lot and that gives me some time,

68
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.190
but I'm like essentially doing both, you know, do.

69
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.220
<v 1>You feel the switch is going off in your brain,</v>

70
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.100
your brain switches over cuz you're you essentially, there's some,

71
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.060
a biological mechanism that's happening.

72
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:49.860
That must be fascinating to study on yourself as you're watching it happen.

73
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.180
Cuz you're, you know, the oxytocin gets jacked through the roof.

74
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.700
You have this little thing that you love literally more than anything you've

75
00:03:57.701 --> 00:03:59.460
ever experienced in your entire existing.

76
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.890
You can't believe how much you love them. It's hard to imagine. Like, I,

77
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.570
it's hard for me as a father to imagine what it would be like to be a mother,

78
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.370
because I think there's a big difference. Cause I think there's,

79
00:04:12.371 --> 00:04:14.770
and this is one of the reasons why me and my wife had a deal.

80
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.570
I didn't name any of the kids. I just had veto power. It's like,

81
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:21.360
you can't call the kid like can turn up or some stupid.

82
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.200
&lt;laugh&gt; you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, it's just nothing nutty,

83
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.680
but you it's in your body. I mean, you're cooking it manufactured it.

84
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:32.600
I know inside of you, the,

85
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.800
the difference between the job a man does and a woman does in,

86
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.790
in terms of like the actual making of the babe be could not be

87
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.270
further apart from each other.

88
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.030
The guy just does something that feels great and it's done.

89
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.950
And then the woman goes through this insane hormonal process,

90
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.790
her body morphs, she gains 50, 60 plus pounds.

91
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.950
Her body stretches out. She's got a baby inside of her. It's kicking her.

92
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.700
She's uncomfortable. She can't move she's swelling.

93
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.260
Then she has to go through excruciating pain.

94
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.740
There was a video on dig from yesterday.

95
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.940
See if you can find it where they have a labor, um,

96
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.500
recreating like pain device, no way that,

97
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.700
that they put men under.

98
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.930
And they ha they have these macho men that they have this,

99
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.010
this machine that they, they do something. They have these, uh, sense.

100
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.730
These put it up. We'll figure it out. How, how the they did it.

101
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.490
But it somehow or another reenacts,

102
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.330
the pain of labor and lets a man experience what it's like to get your vagina

103
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:39.150
blown apart.

104
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.440
<v 0>That's crazy. Know it is. You just totally explain.</v>

105
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.640
I mean the whole pregnancy and then like the delivery. I mean, it's just like.

106
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.520
<v 1>And then it's like a part of you is walking around. Right.</v>

107
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.080
And whereas for the man it's like, yeah, that's my kid. Wow.

108
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.040
And you get all this oxytocin rush, but I,

109
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.560
I don't even think it's a fraction of what the.

110
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.800
<v 0>Women's and breasts and breastfeeding, you know,</v>

111
00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:04.120
that whole like nursing that's like huge oxytocin is huge. Huge. Yeah.

112
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.920
And um, and then of course there's like the no sleep for like months mm-hmm

113
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.960
&lt;affirmative&gt; for me, like I, um, my son, like he's, he's seen a bottle, like,

114
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.910
I don't know, six or seven times, like I just always been on the nipple. Yeah.

115
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.150
Yeah. And do you pump, um, so because I was always there,

116
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.510
I I've only had a pump a few times. The thing about.

117
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.190
<v 1>Pumping that seems to be really good though,</v>

118
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.310
is that the kids can get more of it.

119
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.270
It's like it's depending on how never had an.

120
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.110
<v 0>Issue, an issue.</v>

121
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.190
I was actually an over producer and I had an issue of too much where yeah.

122
00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:38.980
It's like, he's like slow down mom. &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. So I was.

123
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.460
<v 1>Looking for that and I stumbled across this.</v>

124
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.660
Have you Pade syndrome heard of that?

125
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.140
A sympathetic pregnancy is a proposed condition,

126
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.820
which a partner experiences some symptoms and be that's just a man.

127
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.380
These include minor weight, gain, altered hormone levels,

128
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.090
morning nausea and disturbed sleep patterns. Like I said, that's just a. I, the.

129
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.490
<v 0>Disturbed sleep patterns come after the baby's born. Let me tell you &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

130
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.890
<v 1>That's silly, but I, I know you're talking about yeah. Some guys say that again.</v>

131
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.570
Again. We too, when I was pregnant that's cuz you're lazy.

132
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.130
&lt;laugh&gt; that's cuz you're lazy and you ate more food.

133
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.610
You SL that has nothing to do with a baby being in your body. Shut your mouth.

134
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.960
That's that's embarrassing so much. I'm pregnant too. No, you're not.

135
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.880
I hate when men say we're pregnant. Yeah. We're pregnant. No, we're not.

136
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.560
No we're not pregnant. Mike. &lt;laugh&gt; you're not pregnant. Mike.

137
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:33.040
She's pregnant. You got her pregnant. You. What does this say here?

138
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.720
Labor pain simulator here. Here it is. Look at these guys. I got her.

139
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.833
Get me some volume.

140
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.630
<v 2>Well that's different. Look at me.</v>

141
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.303
Talk to me right now.

142
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.790
You're almost getting to like the active stage of labor where it's really.

143
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.470
<v 1>Getting good. This is just the beginning. It ramps up.</v>

144
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.300
<v 2>Starting to come down. Now you guys are doing awesome.</v>

145
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.180
These guys to be, are you down?

146
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.140
<v 0>I mean.</v>

147
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.460
<v 1>It really does feel, you know, what's next.</v>

148
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.980
What's next is these gals put a strap on, on they peg these dudes.

149
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.140
They just that's next. They just have sensors on their stomach. It looks like,

150
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.370
right? Yeah. It's like, uh, you know,

151
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.010
one of them like those electromuscular stimulation devices and they just

152
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.450
Jack 'em through the roof. Dirt. They could have put one in their drawing,

153
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:30.890
right? Yeah.

154
00:08:30.891 --> 00:08:34.050
Well they put 'em in their abdomen just getting torn apart,

155
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.170
but it's not even as sensitive as your vagina. So it's ridiculous.

156
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.600
<v 0>Plus you're probably not making like these and oxytocin.</v>

157
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.200
<v 1>Yeah. It's nothing. And he's getting up on his hands and knees like, come on,</v>

158
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.640
stop. Yeah.

159
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.480
They're just basically torturing these men to make them feel bad for not being a

160
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:53.314
woman. &lt;laugh&gt;.

161
00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.360
<v 0>Yeah, it's definitely, um, painful process.</v>

162
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:02.240
That whole delivery thing is definitely painful.

163
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.920
<v 1>But it is pretty crazy. It's it's definitely crazy.</v>

164
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.720
It's really crazy that people make people in their bodies. &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

165
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.520
like I was talking to my daughter this morning,

166
00:09:10.521 --> 00:09:13.120
she was getting ready for school. And uh, we're sitting at the kid,

167
00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.270
the breakfast table and I'm just looking at her. And while she's talking,

168
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.070
all I'm thinking of is you didn't used to exist.

169
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.310
And now here you are talking to me about school,

170
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.910
talking to me about this and that and all the different things you're doing.

171
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.270
And it is so odd that you are a combination of

172
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.670
my DNA and my wife's DNA. And here you are to sitting here eating breakfast,

173
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:35.940
just talking.
