WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.250
<v 0>Yeah. And I think we're, and also, I think one of the things that's going on,</v>

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.480
and this is one of the things that's empowered,

3
00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:08.590
the women's movement into powered.

4
00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:12.400
A lot of other movements is access to information. Correct. It's radical,

5
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:14.220
it's happening so fast and it's,

6
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.290
it's inundating us and we have to catch up to it. It's like it's happening.

7
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.650
So quickly that w we're just trying to, okay. What, what, what is,

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.120
okay now what's not okay. Now, what can we do? What can we not do?

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.670
<v 1>And access to each other?</v>

10
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.320
Like never before have 10 women all assaulted by the same man been able to

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.590
meet each other. Well, how else would we run into the grocery store? Hey,

12
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:34.840
were you assaulted by that guy? By any chance? Like,

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.220
we're able to find each other on the Jamie.

14
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.440
<v 0>Talking about Steve Carell and the office.</v>

15
00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:40.270
Was it you that was talking about that? Yeah.

16
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.860
W w you watch the old episodes of the office, which is not that long ago,

17
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.950
he was such a creep. And I was like, you can't really do that.

18
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.120
<v 1>That's amazing. But he was kind of like bumbling, you know, like silly.</v>

19
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.160
<v 2>So what was the difference like that was,</v>

20
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.250
I think the percep of sewed where a girl shows up to sell purses,

21
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.620
and he's just like, makes a big to do it.

22
00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:04.840
Just like you can have the conference room and guess what?

23
00:01:04.841 --> 00:01:08.890
I just got this espresso maker. Don't make me give it to you. Cause I won't, oh,

24
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.110
do you need a ride home? I'll give you a ride home.

25
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.000
<v 1>But get the ride.</v>

26
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.700
<v 2>Home thing was a very particular creepy thing based off today is.</v>

27
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.480
<v 1>Right. And I think that, like, I mean, what I know about the English version,</v>

28
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:21.160
I don't know what the intention was for the American version.

29
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:24.220
The idea was to make him kind of polarizing and it's,

30
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.590
it makes you uncomfortable. And he, you know.

31
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.360
<v 0>It's crazy that it wasn't that long ago.</v>

32
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.660
<v 1>Yeah. It wasn't like, oh, but it's like, you know, it's like, you know,</v>

33
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.260
it's interesting because so much of this is, is almost it's.

34
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.060
Cause it's so intangible. It's hard to explain.

35
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:40.120
And I think this is why a lot of guys are getting annoyed because when you get

36
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:41.170
granular about it, it,

37
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.010
it makes us seem like we're just being crazy because so it's like you hugged me

38
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:48.460
at the comedy store and it feels different than when I'm,

39
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.140
let's call him Joe blow. He hugs me.

40
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.760
There's just something creepy about Joe blow.

41
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.200
And there's something not creepy about you.

42
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:55.780
And I can't explain it and I can't tell you why.

43
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.120
And I sound crazy and manic and.

44
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.790
<v 0>No, that doesn't sound because that's the same way with gay guys.</v>

45
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.010
There's certain gay guys that hug me where it's creepy.

46
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.460
There's certain gay guys that hug me. I don't want to out anybody,

47
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.580
but there's certain guys that hug me. I'm like, what's up and give them a hug.

48
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:11.800
And it's all just warm and friendly and it's cool.

49
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:12.760
It doesn't matter if they're gay or not,

50
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.300
but then there's other guys that they hang on to me a little or they'll squeeze

51
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:20.410
my back a little and it just needs a little, little extra going on. I'm like,

52
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:21.244
okay.

53
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.290
<v 1>And I try. And I think that that's what, like,</v>

54
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.050
females are kind of trying to sort of say what,

55
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:28.780
the more granular stuff and with the Z story and stuff, it's like,

56
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.730
I know it sounds like I'm being crazy,

57
00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:33.220
but I promise there's something creepy about it.

58
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:36.760
And I know that I don't have proof and I don't have photo evidence, but I'm I,

59
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.330
but in the more I talk about it, the crazier I sound, but I think that, that,

60
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.720
it's just making me, the Steve curl thing is making me,

61
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.150
it's like a hug that lasts a little too long. I had a guy once in an office.

62
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.430
<v 0>Right. But don't you think the Z store is like, look,</v>

63
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:52.330
you don't have to try to tank a guy life from a bad date.

64
00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:55.870
It seems like you both ate, ate each other out and went down on each other.

65
00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:59.420
And it's like, it sounds like it sucked, but then you're anonymous. Then you're,

66
00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:03.070
you're 22 or 23. Like this is like poor judgment. And here's the thing.

67
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.340
There's a lot of cruelty involved. It,

68
00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:08.230
like somebody described it as revenge porn and that's.

69
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.210
<v 1>For a, yeah, but.</v>

70
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.670
<v 0>It's just like, look, this is not,</v>

71
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.750
these are not comparable crimes to like what we've been discussing.

72
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.560
<v 1>I don't know if I can't speak to saying who's guilty and all that sort of,</v>

73
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.010
I don't, I don't think there's enough information,

74
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:28.180
but I don't think that, that this person is coming forward, equating it to rape.

75
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.430
I think women know that there's different echelons,

76
00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:33.460
there's rape and sexual assault. I mean, look,

77
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.100
I don't know enough about it and none of us were there,

78
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.420
but like I do know in my twenties, I'm not saying as he's guilty again,

79
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:40.991
I don't know.

80
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.500
But in my twenties I had a lot of sex that I felt I was coerced into that was

81
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.650
transactional sex that I didn't want to have. You know,

82
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.410
and this is something we talk about in the female brain movie is that men are

83
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:54.850
less able to read cues, emotional cues on, on faces than women are.

84
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.730
Um, I'm not so apparent.

85
00:03:57.731 --> 00:04:02.140
So we have evolved to cry four times more easily because men have a harder time

86
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.870
reading, um, emotional cues on faces.

87
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.780
<v 0>That's why women cry.</v>

88
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.510
<v 1>Until we crazier because men are designed to sort of like see movement and to</v>

89
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:13.390
hunt and to write, you're not designed to sort of read like, oh,

90
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:15.550
is she frustrated or angry? You know, like,

91
00:04:15.551 --> 00:04:18.700
have you ever been on a double date with your wife? And like, um,

92
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.850
you think that her and the other, I can't imagine you on a double date.

93
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.930
That was so weird thinking about it.

94
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.080
I've done those things really in the very early.

95
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.840
<v 0>Stage, I've done them recently. But if you really.</v>

96
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.970
<v 1>Yeah, and you go on a double date and like,</v>

97
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.670
you have to talk to the guy and he's asking you a million questions about

98
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:35.620
hunting. And you're like, just listen to my podcast.

99
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:36.970
Why do I have to do this for free?

100
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.470
And then your wife is talking to the other girl and you think it's going well.

101
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:43.690
And the girl gets to the car and you're like, oh, that went well.

102
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:45.880
And you're like, she was such a. I couldn't stand her. And you're like,

103
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:48.850
it seemed like you guys got along great. You know, like,

104
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:50.080
has that ever happened to you? My.

105
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.090
<v 0>Wife's not like, okay. She's.</v>

106
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.103
<v 1>Just.</v>

107
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.060
<v 0>Um, she just talks and she's not like if she, if she thought something was bad,</v>

108
00:04:58.061 --> 00:05:01.600
she would let everybody know right away. Well, she would just, it would be all.

109
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.740
<v 1>Or just, just sort of like sometimes there's like, um, basically,</v>

110
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:07.480
and we talk about in the movie is like, it's just,

111
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.870
men are not as good at reading emotions on faces. So it's like,

112
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.330
if you were to say like, Whitney, how are you? And I was like, I'm fine.

113
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.270
You might just be like, okay, she's fine. Let's move on.

114
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.870
A lot of guys can't understand that there's a discrepancy between what I'm

115
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.240
saying and how I'm saying it. And it's like about just reading,

116
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:25.780
like how muscles move on, on human faces. So it's like, you can look up, um,

117
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.070
sort of the difference. And you know, so I'm not defending men in that area.

118
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:30.904
I think that,

119
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.970
that an interesting conversation that might come up at some point as people who

120
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.720
have autism are really going to be in all of this people who can't pick up on

121
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:40.210
social cues, because so much of this is non-verbal.

122
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.970
I fear that we're going to get to a place where we're going to have to like sign

123
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:47.050
contracts and before we have sex and stuff. Because, you know, I,

124
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.310
I know that in my twenties and I'm freezing up just talking about it, um,

125
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.740
is that when men made physical advances to me,

126
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.550
I would be giving off these nonverbal cues. Um, and I wasn't saying no,

127
00:05:58.551 --> 00:05:59.720
but my body was saying no,

128
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.180
and I'm not saying it's necessarily a guy is supposed to like,

129
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.490
be able to read my body language, but that's what was happening.

130
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:07.580
Cause I froze up because of my trauma response and I was scared.

131
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:10.970
And also we are conditioned to be submissive to men. Um,

132
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.660
I am conditioned to feel shame if I don't a guy in a certain amount of time,

133
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.033
I spent a of.

134
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.870
<v 0>I thought it was the opposite.</v>

135
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.540
I thought you would feel shame if you a guy too quickly.

136
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.760
<v 1>I've got a guy on the first date. You feel shame.</v>

137
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.340
But if you there's this sort of like unspoken rule that you like,

138
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:29.240
kind of have to a guy on the third day. Yeah. Oh, I totally am.

139
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:31.730
I do not think that Jamie has never heard of this.

140
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.870
I feel like guilt and shame and I'm difficult and I have a prude and I'm like,

141
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.800
whatever. Yeah, this might just be me, but like every, I mean,

142
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:42.560
every girl that I know that I'm, maybe it's just my generation or something.

143
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.030
<v 0>Every guy out there is like, oh,</v>

144
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:46.250
I got to do is just get three dates in and we're in.

145
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.950
<v 1>I don't think about negotiate. So just the,</v>

146
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.100
just the tip is like something we joke about. Right.

147
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.160
But it is based in the idea of negotiating for sex.

148
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.430
So if someone is starting to say just the tip, that means I've already said no,

149
00:06:58.431 --> 00:07:00.950
and you'll, it will come on. How about just a blow job? And then I'm like, no,

150
00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:03.080
just come on. Just the tip. It's like, we joke about it.

151
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.990
But that means that a negotiation is going on and then I've already said, no,

152
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.400
and then you just get worn down and that's like transactional sex,

153
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:14.030
which I think women are kind of just, I won't generalize about all women. Um,

154
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.560
but I think some women are like, sort of like,

155
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.590
I don't want to have that kind of transactional sex anymore. And like,

156
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.080
like I feel like I'm being used as a blow up doll.

157
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.450
And I think from what I understand,

158
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.900
that girl felt as she felt like she was like rushed through dinner and like went

159
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:29.600
back and was just sort of expected to be.

160
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.820
And I think a lot of what's happening is that men were promised something from

161
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.640
porn and women were promised something from romantic comedies.

162
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:39.980
Men were promised that women like want it all the time.

163
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.980
And women have been promised that men like want to talk to us.

164
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.410
And I think these expectations are clashing.

165
00:07:45.411 --> 00:07:47.120
So I think it's a little bit of nature and a little bit.

166
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:50.750
<v 0>So a lot of it being media,</v>

167
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.980
misrepresentations of actual relationships and that's the models that people are

168
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:55.814
acting on.

169
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.300
I think it's different for every person because every person has a different

171
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.180
experience with sex. Everyone has a different ability to read faces.

172
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.360
Everyone has a different nature and nurture everyone had different parents.

173
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.400
<v 0>And then there's a problem with like,</v>

174
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.090
sometimes you really shouldn't be with that person and you're there and you're

175
00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:12.950
there. And what do you do when you do?

176
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.550
<v 1>I mean, I've literally had sex before just to like get out of there.</v>

177
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.200
You're just like, oh God, I don't want to argue with this person right now.

178
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:24.980
But I feel like this person feels entitled to my body and I feel shame and I'm

179
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:26.210
embarrassed. And like,

180
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:28.490
it's just all this stuff that's really kind of hard to explain.

181
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.970
And I think it probably is annoying to the guy and I just like,

182
00:08:31.971 --> 00:08:34.700
I don't want to be difficult and I've been so Gaslight to believe that I'm

183
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:36.620
difficult. It just gets like really messy.

184
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:37.940
And then by the time you figure it out,

185
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:40.850
you've already had sex and you're just like, oh, can I, my parking pass back.

186
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.230
<v 0>It isn't as,</v>

187
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:45.500
as part of just being a human and trying to navigate your way through the

188
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.890
treacherous waters of just social interactions.

189
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.060
<v 1>I didn't figure it out until I was 32 years old.</v>

190
00:08:53.061 --> 00:08:56.370
I wasn't able to like articulate or figure whether I actually want to be having

191
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.500
sex or not. So like my advice to all my guy friends is,

192
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.980
do not have sex with girls that are under 30. Cause like I could not,

193
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.210
I didn't have the ability to even know or say what I wanted until I was thinking.

194
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.260
<v 0>For men. A lot of men feel like if you have sex with a girl who's under 30,</v>

195
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:12.810
then it's fun and you can have fun.

196
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.940
But if you have sex with a girl who's over 30,

197
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:17.010
their biological clock is ticking.

198
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.990
<v 1>And they're pressing.</v>

199
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.630
<v 0>Pressuring you into this, you know, relationship very quickly.</v>

200
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.300
What's your intentions? Where's this going? I wouldn't know what we,

201
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.730
how we stand, what are we.

202
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.700
<v 1>Block? Or find another one there's Tinder. You can find plenty of.</v>

203
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.060
<v 0>What have you like, are you just wanting to calm down? You swollen?</v>

204
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.380
Let's work this out.

205
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.250
<v 1>Look, we're going to have to like start talking to each other, I guess.</v>

206
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:44.160
And like setting expectations. I know that sounds like a nightmare. It doesn't,

207
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:44.310
it.
