00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know what else</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.740
that I did with Chappelle that opened my eyes. I've never done one.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.290
Those things are done. Ivy, Ivy.

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.280
<v 1>Whereby, and brother. I swept it.</v>

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.450
<v 0>Up a bag and a half and I was ready to run through a wall in your house. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:16.930
They'll come anywhere. They came to our.

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
<v 1>Yeah, I get them at the crib all the time. My girl's pregnant again.</v>

8
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.800
We have another one coming in November and uh, for the nausea, we, we get IVs.

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.270
I swear. Oh dude.

10
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.080
<v 0>Night and day. It's amazing for like pumping you up.</v>

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.800
<v 2>I'm in Vegas. I had to get it. What'd you got, we had a,</v>

12
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.350
you had a show there and like I showed up wasted,

13
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.110
I think type of like the new year's Eve UFC.

14
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:42.000
I wanted to wake up and I had to get.

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.890
<v 1>It, had to get done. You felt so.</v>

16
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.710
<v 2>Much better in minutes, 20 minutes, I was good to go. It was crazy. It's.</v>

17
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.960
<v 1>Crazy. You know, what's crazy to me is the UFC doesn't allow.</v>

18
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.280
<v 0>Well, it feels so good. You can mask the use of performance,</v>

19
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:54.270
enhancing drugs and.

20
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.660
<v 1>Haters, bro. God.</v>

21
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.580
<v 0>Speaking and performance enhancing drugs.</v>

22
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.200
Let's talk about the sideboard situation.

23
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.090
<v 1>I knew you were going to go there as soon as I said.</v>

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.930
<v 0>How about that? See Dan and go hard in the paint.</v>

25
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.290
<v 1>You know, I like when he goes hard in the paint, he's the only guy, listen,</v>

26
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.970
say what you want about Dana. And I do like it. Like we always say,

27
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.520
can you imagine if another commission did this, another owner did this.

28
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.480
But I do like when he does spit the, cause what he's saying is the truth.

29
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.060
Like sometimes he's on one. You're like, what the you talking about?

30
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.940
You're screwing these guys over then sometimes like with the cyber thing,

31
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.490
when you send that to me, like, I agree with them a hundred percent. Yeah.

32
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.570
I love when he does that.

33
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.550
<v 0>They up and they really up when they tried cyborgs team, whoever did it,</v>

34
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.290
whether it's her boyfriend or whoever it was that edited that video that

35
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:44.520
lied and put words in his mouth is so stupid.

36
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.370
You don't think that they're going to do something about that.

37
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.360
You're out of your mind when they edited that video to say that whenever I'm

38
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:54.600
talking in public, I'm not telling the truth, which is not what he said at all.

39
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.850
And then to have it edit and cut right there. Oh.

40
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.290
<v 1>Okay. This right now. D Dana's too smart. Let's say he would.</v>

41
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.670
Let's say he thinks that you think he would say that in a public form to

42
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:09.060
cyborg when they're face to face like that and you don't think you realize

43
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:13.140
there's cameras around. No. He's way too smart for that. So that I'm like, well,

44
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:16.680
he's not that dumb be that video is you can tell it's so full of.

45
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.190
Same thing happened with me and Nate Diaz had our confrontation.

46
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.920
I didn't say any of that stuff. Someone made that all up.

47
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.970
<v 0>Well, what also they did was they're bringing back.</v>

48
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.250
That happened five years ago. Like,

49
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.220
and cyborg was saying she wanted an apology from me.

50
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.800
And I don't think it was that she wanted apology for me.

51
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.430
I think it was her boyfriend or someone on the team. I apologize to her,

52
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.970
me and her, no one around face to face.

53
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.220
And I took a photo with her afterwards.

54
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.730
There's a photo of me and her on my Instagram. What'd you say? You were just.

55
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.750
<v 1>Like, Hey, me and my guys were.</v>

56
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.670
<v 0>Fighting in the UFC. She hadn't fought in the UFC before. And I said, Hey,</v>

57
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.300
I'm sorry about the Joe. I promise no more jokes. And I said,

58
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:01.420
I am actually a fan of yours. And uh, I want you to succeed in the UFC.

59
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.570
And I wish you the best of luck. I go, no hard feelings shows no, those,

60
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.390
you know, those jokes kind of hurt my feelings. And I said, I'm sorry. I go,

61
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.960
I promise no more jokes. I gave her a hug and we took a picture together.

62
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.650
And that was a, when was that? 2017.

63
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.070
<v 1>So here's the only time where I'm like, God man is shirk.</v>

64
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:21.700
Her kid's skin bullied at school because of the comments she had a.

65
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.840
<v 0>Kid. Oh yeah, yeah.</v>

66
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.560
<v 1>How many kids? She has one daughter, I think in like fourth grade.</v>

67
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.370
And she goes because of the narrative that the UFC painted right or wrong.

68
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.040
I get it from the UFC side. Doesn't mean it's right.

69
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.590
Narrative that she's this heel.

70
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.080
She's this monster PDs.

71
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.060
<v 0>Right? Yeah. But that's because she tested.</v>

72
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.810
<v 1>Positive. Once we don't talk about Jon Jones, he thinks of possible.</v>

73
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.160
<v 0>More than once. First of all,</v>

74
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:49.870
there's Don Jones got tested positive for this tiny amount of something that

75
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.640
probably came from a tainted supplement.

76
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.560
She tested positive for a serious steroid and something that you you're

77
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.780
like a woman taking a steroid is different than a man taking a stone with you.

78
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.970
<v 1>Female, male, which is tough to do here.</v>

79
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:07.120
But there's been people who have tested positive before where that's not their

80
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:08.740
narrative Brock Lesnar.

81
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.210
<v 0>Yeah. But it is Brock Lazarus narrative. It's also Alistair Overeem's narrative.</v>

82
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.040
Is it? [inaudible].

83
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.420
<v 1>Doesn't tell you that though. They're not market.</v>

84
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.170
<v 0>The fans do kind of marketing the fact that stock, sorry.</v>

85
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.880
Board was taking steroids no.

86
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.930
<v 1>Into this kind of heal role though. Where if you know her, she's awesome.</v>

87
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.650
<v 0>Do you think? But no, the marketer's destroyer, which she is in her career is.</v>

88
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.300
<v 1>Scary, destroyed, but also.</v>

89
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.530
<v 0>In a good way. Look, if you look at her fights, you look at the fight with look.</v>

90
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.570
The, the, the, when it gets dark is when you go back to the non-testing days,

91
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.240
like the Gina Carano fight, which had veins coming out of her face, she looked.

92
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.450
<v 1>And Gina Chronos this way. My argument for, I don't mean to interrupt you,</v>

93
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:53.950
but Gina Carano ate the hottest Chica to ever fight MMA,

94
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.680
be fought. Seiberg when she was juiced to the gills,

95
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.870
did pretty well go back and watch.

96
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.090
<v 0>Shout out to Gina chrono. Eventually got beaten down and there's a video.</v>

97
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:08.860
There's a picture rather of cyborg holding Gina's face and punching her.

98
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.640
And you see the black fingernails and she's got this mean,

99
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:16.180
look on her face and she's punching Gina in the face. It's like, whoa, one,

100
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.240
have you ever seen that picture? I've never seen it, dude.

101
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.100
It's it's one of those pictures. It was the demise. No, no, no.

102
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.500
It's a standing photo of a cyborg punching.

103
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.320
<v 1>Is it that one right.</v>

104
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.060
<v 0>There? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Go left.</v>

105
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:34.840
Go left one above that one about friendship there. Bam. That's the photo.

106
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.250
So look at the black thing.

107
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.040
<v 1>She grabbed her face, like the end punter. It's.</v>

108
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.220
<v 0>The end of the fight. I mean, she's already beaten her down, but I mean,</v>

109
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:46.570
she's holding her face with those black fingernails and just crushing Gina's

110
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.650
head. She beat the out of her, but dead Gina was a beast man.

111
00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.210
And she hung in there as long as she could.

112
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:55.570
But the consensus was that cyborg was juiced.

113
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.000
<v 1>Up in that fund. That one, right? You mark it as beauty and the beast. Right.</v>

114
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:03.140
That's just the way it is. Gina's is a gorgeous individual cyborg,

115
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.510
not so much when it comes to the, the feminine, like the looks department.

116
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.920
So I get that market view and the beast I was taught, I had a Kyla Harrison on,

117
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:16.970
you know who that is? The PFL she's a two time, uh, gold medalists, uh,

118
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.320
ju judoka Kayla Harrison. Yeah. Monster. And, uh,

119
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.220
she wants she's in the PFL and she's in the tournament there and she's, uh,

120
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.390
she wants to fight cyborg.

121
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.460
<v 0>Yeah. Well there's a lot of people that are wanting to fight.</v>

122
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.680
<v 1>She definitely wants right. Undefeated gold medalists.</v>

123
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.720
And I was talking to her about, why does,

124
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.890
why does she think that kind of cyborg has gone down this road in her career?

125
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.510
And then I pitched her on, you know, if I found the UFC and here, man,

126
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.170
this might be completely wrong. I don't know, but this is how I would do it.

127
00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:46.610
And this is what they're doing is what I think.

128
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.100
But if I'm the UFC as nice as a person,

129
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:53.180
cyborg is there's no other girl walking this plant that looks like cyborg,

130
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.990
really? Because maybe PDs to your point, there's a.

131
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:58.190
<v 0>Men. When you say maybe.</v>

132
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.710
<v 1>Like most likely, that's what I'm saying. And I'm trying to be cool.</v>

133
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.400
I'm trying to be nice. There's a lot of girls that look like Paige Vanzant.

134
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.880
There's a lot of girl, Paige Vanzant or Ronda Rousey or Misha Tate.

135
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.680
So they're going to push those girls more because that's what people can relate

136
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:16.490
to more than a girl like cyborg. And I don't think I'm saying anything,

137
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:19.950
no one has assumed already. And this and I, I,

138
00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:23.870
I like cyborg the nice person and I don't think Cyborg's a bad person.

139
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:27.860
I think her management and the way they've handled things have completely her.

140
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.730
And I think her going to battle with UFC was the worst thing. And it's not her.

141
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.571
<v 0>I don't think it's her either.</v>

142
00:07:32.571 --> 00:07:36.590
And I think she is a nice person and every time I've ever interacted with her,

143
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.330
I look even that last fight.

144
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.200
And that was the thing with the Spencer fight like that people were saying that,

145
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.560
oh, you guys, it was biased commentary. No, it wasn't.

146
00:07:45.561 --> 00:07:47.480
That girl survived that girl.

147
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.640
<v 1>Um, you're the greatest cocktail of all time. Pro fight</v>

148
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:59.060
10, eight round cyborg. Beat the out of her dude. That fight wasn't closed. No,

149
00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:01.700
no, no, it wasn't close. But the narrative was how tough she was.

150
00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.490
I'm like cyborgs beaten up bragged on this girl. And she.

151
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.200
<v 0>Cut Cyborg's face wide, open.</v>

152
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.460
<v 1>One with one elbow, gives a. She got beat up the rest of the fight.</v>

153
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:11.120
There's the underground.

154
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.480
<v 0>The idea was that she was going to run through that girl. And she didn't,</v>

155
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:15.980
that girl was tough as. Wasn't.

156
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.760
<v 1>It wasn't a.</v>

157
00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.750
<v 0>Competitive site. Well, she doesn't have striking. That was on the level of,</v>

158
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.510
she doesn't have power to keep cyborg offer.

159
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.170
<v 1>She just does cyborg and lit her up like your Christmas tree though. There's 10,</v>

160
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:30.680
eight rounds. And I was like, oh, that fights even close. No, I feel you guys.

161
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.410
Cause it's the Jon Jones things. When you go into a fight,

162
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.200
it's like when John doesn't destroy someone,

163
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:39.740
you're talking about the other guy and with cyborg two, you expect just a Merck.

164
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.100
This.

165
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:43.040
<v 0>I go Santos was way closer. I mean, that was a way closer fight.</v>

166
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.600
Tiago Santos was a 1.5 rounds. Well, it was a split decision for.

167
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.433
<v 1>Sure. Yeah.</v>

168
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.650
<v 0>Some one judge thought that Tiago won the fight.</v>

169
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:54.830
I don't agree with that challenge, but that's how close that fight was.

170
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.500
There was no one that thought that Spencer won that fight after it was over,

171
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:03.090
but it was amazing that she was able to endure the beating the sideboard put on

172
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.600
her. It was tough girl nine saying, no,

173
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:11.910
it was one of those fights where it really like no one's clamoring for that

174
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:15.450
fight in the first place who was asking for that fight, not me other than her.
