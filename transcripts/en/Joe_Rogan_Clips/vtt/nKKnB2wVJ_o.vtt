00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.240
you were talking about universal basic income earlier,

3
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:13.220
and you were saying it in regards to dealing with impoverished communities, but,

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.200
uh, one of the big issues that people think we're going to need universal

5
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:20.090
basic income for is automation.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.080
Something that Andrew Yang has built his whole platform on Elon Musk has talked

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.490
extensively about it.

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.960
We are in a situation where there was an article today about Amazon, um,

9
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.320
using automo auto, uh, these, um,

10
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.570
I forget exactly how they described it,

11
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:39.800
but essentially robots that are packaging things and automation is going to

12
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:43.610
start taking over many non-skilled jobs.

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.990
And this is true with the travel industry, with trucking,

14
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.160
with moving things,

15
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:54.140
shipping that we're going to see less and less of these unskilled

16
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:56.270
jobs. And we're going to see millions of people out of work.

17
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.290
And that universal basic income may be the only way to bridge that gap between

18
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:05.000
them finding some sort of viable

19
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.130
new source of income. Yeah.

20
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.190
<v 1>I think that's certainly part of it. I think that's a, I mean,</v>

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260
it's a strong argument. Uh,

22
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.580
we got to figure out how we pay for it and how it actually, uh, you know,

23
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:21.320
achieves that intended objective. Uh, but also look at, um,

24
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.830
making that, those kinds of investments in,

25
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.670
in how do you train a whole new workforce and in what new areas?

26
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.120
So many you're taking people who are working in, in, you know, really tough,

27
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.860
tough labor jobs. You know,

28
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.550
you hear all these stories about people who were working at Amazon very long

29
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:40.900
hours, very stringent timelines. Uh, and,

30
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:45.380
and so if they're now being replaced by automation or robots or whatever it is,

31
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.840
um, you know, let's look at our economy and see how we can, um, you know,

32
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:55.760
help train folks for, for jobs that pay more money, uh, and,

33
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.790
and hopefully help offer a better quality of life.

34
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.950
And I think that's overall when we look at this, um, I think that's,

35
00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.520
that's the way that we should be addressing this is not just a job as a job,

36
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:08.690
as a job, as a job,

37
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.000
but really looking at the quality of life of people in this country that a

38
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:18.080
job does not equal happiness or, or fulfillment.

39
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.590
Um, but really looking at, um, you know, uh,

40
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.670
parents who have a child and who want to be able to spend some time at home

41
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:28.370
raising that child, or, you know, someone who wants to start,

42
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:32.540
start a small business and work out of their home to be able to hang out with

43
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.370
their kids more or whatever the case may be.

44
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:39.050
I think as we look at this and how we make this transition in a positive way

45
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.850
in this country, uh,

46
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:45.080
we've got to look at it from this comprehensive approach.

47
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
<v 0>Yeah. The idea of these people that are working in these fulfillment</v>

48
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.680
centers being happy, it seems pretty ridiculous. They're not happy.

49
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.220
They have those jobs as people are in back-breaking incredibly stressful

50
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:00.880
positions where you read the reports. I mean,

51
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.360
I don't know how accurate their reports of what the job is like,

52
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.740
but they literally run from one place to another they're timed and they have

53
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.574
their own breaks or.

54
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.360
<v 1>No, yeah.</v>

55
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.630
<v 0>Time limits. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.410
That's part of the problem with the idea

57
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:21.880
that companies are supposed to constantly make more and more money as you get

58
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.930
Russo ruthlessly, competitive people looking at the bottom line,

59
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.680
every single aspect of that business.

60
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.620
And one of the things that suffers is human,

61
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.280
human sacrifice satisfaction, and their,

62
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.520
their sacrifice has to be greater because they,

63
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.420
they have to find a way to justify their position in the company. Yeah.

64
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.240
And so they get paid very little. They work very hard. Yeah.

65
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.940
<v 1>Meanwhile, with, with a company like Amazon paying,</v>

66
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.390
not only paying no taxes, I think this is for the third year in a row.

67
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.490
And also getting,

68
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.660
I think this last year was over $125 million tax credit.

69
00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.110
<v 0>That sounds hilarious. Jeff Bezos has how much,</v>

70
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.980
it's got $150 billion and he's going to give 75 to his wife. And right.

71
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.780
The whole thing is ridiculous. Right? It's what people who,

72
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.250
uh, lean socialist point to when they talk about unchecked capitalism,

73
00:04:13.251 --> 00:04:18.200
without any sort of regulation that can stop something like that from happening

74
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:22.400
and stop workers from being exploited in that way. It's just, and people say,

75
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:25.340
Hey, you don't, you don't have to have that job if you don't, you know,

76
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:28.370
you don't want that job, don't take it. But no one should have to have that job.

77
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.340
How about that? Yeah. How about if, if,

78
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.360
if there's a job that makes you have timed bathroom breaks and run from one

79
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:38.360
place to another, you should get paid a load of money for that job.

80
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.070
That job should be something that it it's sucks all day long. But yeah, dude,

81
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.900
I make $5,000 a week and people are like, what? Yeah, man, eight hours a day,

82
00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:51.890
5,000, you got to run. But when at the end of the week, just save up your money,

83
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:55.340
man. You're making a lot of money that way people would go, oh, okay. Yeah.

84
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.360
And Amazon would still make a load of money. Yeah. If they did it that way.

85
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.290
But yeah.

86
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.620
<v 1>The people barely make it. I mean, they're barely making minimum wage.</v>

87
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.370
It's crazy.

88
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.750
<v 0>Yeah. I mean.</v>

89
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.270
<v 1>So that's where I think, you know, is, is, and look, this automation, um,</v>

90
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.880
really changing our economy is something that,

91
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.600
that I think we're behind the curve ball on because it's already happening.

92
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.030
But let's try to see the opportunity in that where if robots are going

93
00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:28.010
to start taking over those back-breaking jobs, then, then let's try to find,

94
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.960
uh, you know, new and innovative ways for people to work and to earn a living.

95
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.880
That's actually bringing value to them.

96
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.690
<v 0>That sounds awesome on paper, but how would one ever do that?</v>

97
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.720
<v 1>That's what we've got to work out. And, and it's not, I'm not saying that, Hey,</v>

98
00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:44.330
there's a government solution to this and snap your fingers.

99
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:45.920
And it's all done now. I mean, this is,

100
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.350
the government has a role at private sector. Private business has a role. Um,

101
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.220
and we've got to,

102
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.400
we've got to work together because this is all of our futures ultimately.

103
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.170
<v 0>Imagined any potential, any possibility, any potential solution?</v>

104
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.490
<v 1>Well, I think there's, there's pieces of it, right? I mean, it's,</v>

105
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.240
it's making sure that we close these, these loopholes,

106
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.370
that tax loopholes that allow companies like Amazon to get away with paying no

107
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:18.320
taxes and to get this much money back as a tax credit, do they do that? Oh gosh.

108
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.930
I mean, our tax code is so complicated, you know,

109
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:25.190
it has to do with the write offs and how many years and depreciation and all of

110
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:27.830
these different things that they plan for. Uh,

111
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.420
and they exploit in order to pay no taxes and to get money back in return.

112
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.560
It's just so Weasley. It is. And, and it's this crony capitalism.

113
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.250
That's really at the heart of this problem. How, how do we,

114
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.020
how do they get that kind of sweet deal?

115
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.240
When you look at the tax code that's written,

116
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.610
we look at the tax bills that are passed,

117
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.430
who are the people who are helping influence and write those bills.

118
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.450
They're the big paid lobbyists that Amazon has in Washington who are saying,

119
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:55.580
Hey, this is something that we want to see in there.

120
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.420
And working with lawmakers who they're cozy with to get that legislation in

121
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.110
there.

122
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.140
<v 0>Well, this is one of the things that, uh,</v>

123
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.690
has come out about Trump over the last week or two,

124
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.220
is that he lost a billion dollars over the course of, uh, X amount of years.

125
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.880
And that this is not really accurate,

126
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.140
but that this is how he set, like.

127
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.353
<v 1>To declare.</v>

128
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.070
<v 0>He basically did basically said it's sport is what he said is his description.</v>

129
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:29.300
Was that it sport? Wow. So essentially he was playing within the rules. No,

130
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:31.220
one's accusing him of doing anything illegal,

131
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.320
but the way he framed his taxes, the way he,

132
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.273
eh,

133
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.760
it turned out to be more than a billion dollars worth of losses over a period of

134
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.820
something like a decade. Yeah. And, uh, you know, people were like,

135
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:45.980
what the hell is that? And he's like, look,

136
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.850
that's what I was trying to tell you. He was basically trying to say, look,

137
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.150
this is something that I was telling you people about when I was running for

138
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:54.830
president, that the system is rigged.

139
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:58.550
I know because it was a part of the rig system and I pay these people off. Yeah.

140
00:07:59.450 --> 00:07:59.660
<v 1>Um.</v>

141
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.980
<v 0>It is rigged, but how could you get in without getting assassinated?</v>

142
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.290
How do you get in and say, Hey,

143
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:09.110
all you billionaires that are making all this money,

144
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.080
you're going to make less money now because of Tulsi,

145
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.670
president Tulsi is coming in. There's a new sheriff in town. Yeah.

146
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.460
<v 1>Sheriff with an army of people in this country,</v>

147
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:24.200
mobilizing saying this government was put in place to serve

148
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.153
us,

149
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.080
to serve the people and as much money and high paid lobbyists as these guys

150
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:33.530
have, ultimately it is the people of this country who cast the votes.

151
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:36.230
And it's ultimately the people in this country who have the power.

152
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.880
If we choose to use it, if we choose to make sure that our voices are heard.

153
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:43.850
And that, that is the way that we make this change. So would you have.

154
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.960
<v 0>To simplify the tax code? Would you have to heavily.</v>

155
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.550
<v 1>Heavily simplify the tax code? And you know, I'm working with my team,</v>

156
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:52.310
we're doing our research to figure out exactly what that would look like.

157
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.370
But I think we do have to simplify the tax code because it is so many of these

158
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.450
loopholes and massive corporate deductions that have brought us to the place

159
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.390
where we are today, where, you know,

160
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.710
most folks are not getting any kind of meaningful deduction.

161
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:11.190
Most folks certainly are not getting the kinds of tax breaks that these

162
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.340
corporations are getting. Uh, because it's,

163
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:17.250
these corporations are influencing how our tax laws are written and it's written

164
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:21.870
to benefit them, the, the ultra rich and the 1%, and you know,

165
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:26.070
people who are working very hard every single day are, are struggling.

166
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.660
They're still struggling just to get by.

167
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.890
<v 0>What kind of dirty tricks do you think they will pull out against you?</v>

168
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.000
If you try to fix the tax code and try to make corporations

169
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.580
accountable and make sure that they have to pay,

170
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.230
if they're coming after you now,

171
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.660
and you're just making waves and get ready for 2020, I mean,

172
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.030
it could be, it can be pretty gross. Yeah.

173
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.840
<v 1>Yeah. But I just, I don't underestimate the power of people.</v>

174
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.910
That's what I tell them, you know?

175
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.030
And they've been playing these dirty tricks for a long time. Uh,

176
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.810
there is more and more people I think in this country who were paying attention

177
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.670
and who were calling them out on it. Um, don't underestimate the power of the.

178
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:10.920
<v 0>You know what I think too, I think it'd be better for them. Like Jeff Bezos,</v>

179
00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:13.440
you know, you people over not paying taxes, bro.

180
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:18.210
That's so much money and I'm sure he pays taxes.

181
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.540
I don't know what he pays, but you know, the,

182
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:24.750
the idea that Amazon's figured out how to weasel that out. Like that's.

183
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.260
<v 1>I mean, you hear stuff like, you know, Warren buffet talks about this,</v>

184
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:32.940
about he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, right. Is a famous line.

185
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.700
How is that? Because he has look,

186
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:39.720
he's figured out all of these holes within the tax system that he can benefit

187
00:10:39.721 --> 00:10:43.590
from to pay lower taxes. When most people don't have that ability.

188
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.920
<v 0>And as a business person, who's also fairly ethical.</v>

189
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:49.530
You have to be perplexed like, like what do I do here?

190
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.290
Do I just do the right thing and give,

191
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.380
give more money to charity and balance it out?

192
00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.030
Or do I just take these cuts where they are and let everybody know,

193
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:02.550
Hey, look, how much money I paced,

194
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.370
how broken the system is this whack. Yeah.

195
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.870
<v 1>I mean like ultimately what you're saying, you know, as business owners,</v>

196
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.680
whether they're small business owners of these large corporations, I mean, look,

197
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:17.400
it is these large multinational corporations that, um,

198
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:22.170
are exploiting the system and exploiting the people and represent the worst of

199
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:25.200
these crony capitalists policies. Uh,

200
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.160
and so when I talk about changing this culture of leadership at the top,

201
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.700
it's bringing these values of service above self.

202
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:35.190
This has to happen within our government, but we,

203
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:38.190
as a society need to encourage, um,

204
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.900
ourselves bringing these values of service above self, to our businesses,

205
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:45.000
to every sector of our community.

206
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.450
Because just because you run a business and you make a profit doesn't mean that

207
00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:52.110
you can't, uh, be a servant leader and to think about, Hey,

208
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:55.690
how can I make a positive impact? Yes. For my employees and for their families,

209
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:59.440
but on, on society, on our community, on our investment.

210
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.320
<v 0>Right? And I think for the people that are running these corporations,</v>

211
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.670
there would be,

212
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.830
there would be real value in

213
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.350
appreciating the fact that we're all in this together.

214
00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.990
You're not going to live that long. You just don't have that much time.

215
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:17.860
Nobody does no one a hundred years. If you're lucky and you probably,

216
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:20.230
if you're running a corporation, you probably on death's door,

217
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.790
you've got kids and you've got kids.

218
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.000
<v 1>It's generations who will live with the repercussions of the decisions that are</v>

219
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.510
being.

220
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:30.620
<v 0>And the argument is that if you force them to pay more taxes,</v>

221
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:33.680
then there's going to be less jobs because they're going to have to make cuts.

222
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.070
Yeah. But that's, that seems like a ridiculous argument to me.

223
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.763
<v 1>That's been made all along.</v>

224
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:43.160
<v 0>It's just, you're used to it. That's all it is. You're used to these loopholes.</v>

225
00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:44.750
You're used to it. So you want to keep them there.

226
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.030
And if they take away those loopholes,

227
00:12:47.031 --> 00:12:49.100
you're going to punish other people because you don't want to be punished

228
00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:53.000
yourself financially. That's what's really going on. Yeah. And you know,

229
00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:55.100
and this is coming from me, who's a financial dummy.

230
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.870
I don't spend any time analyzing the

231
00:12:59.871 --> 00:13:03.290
financial situation this world. Yeah. But I could see that. Yeah.

232
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.630
<v 1>No, it's, it's glaringly clear.</v>

233
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.960
And the impact that it's having on people is also glaringly clear.

234
00:13:08.961 --> 00:13:09.920
People are seeing this.
