1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 2>If you look at that last card that we did,</v>

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.770
I think I had three of the biggest fights of any UFC card.

4
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.940
I did the Cubs Watson fight.

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.340
<v 0>It was.</v>

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.440
<v 1>Holy. I get about a 20 minute break.</v>

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.920
And then I do Kevin Holland versus Ray woo.

8
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.510
And then I finished my night with Tony Ferguson and Oliver.

9
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.900
<v 0>That was crazy too. So it's like three crazy, crazy fight. So yeah, God,</v>

10
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:29.530
that's a great card that Kevin Holland Kao was bananas.

11
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.870
<v 1>I think I've done. And you know,</v>

12
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.050
we don't have anything to do with the assignments to athletic commission gives

13
00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:39.220
us our fights. I've done Kevin HoloLens, like last four fights. And you know,

14
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.870
I tell folks, I got the greatest seat in the world,

15
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:42.340
sitting there in the octagon with these, you know,

16
00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.930
men and women who go in there and do that stuff.

17
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:48.580
But I fortunately have with great mentors and guidance and

18
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:51.970
opportunities from the UFC and somebody organizations have gotten some of the

19
00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:53.260
biggest and best fights in the world.

20
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.470
<v 0>Very high on Kevin Holland. He's something special. He's good.</v>

21
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.750
He's got crazy power and weird,

22
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.950
like to knock out jock right off your back with a punch, like.

23
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.440
<v 1>And we sit there and you know,</v>

24
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.600
you look at both fighters and see what's happening. And I go,

25
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.600
we went down to the ground and you have to know your fighters to know where

26
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:11.800
their expertise is going to happen.

27
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.690
<v 0>Well, he's a Travis looter trained jujitsu practitioner, Travis looter,</v>

28
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.360
one of the best American jujitsu practitioners, really ever. He Travis looter,

29
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.830
you know, it's, uh, it's, it comes from a different era. But back in his day,

30
00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:29.620
like the guys that I know that trained with him were like, holy.

31
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.740
<v 1>Because he could, and it's great to see them, you know, they're in the corner,</v>

32
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:35.350
you get some time to chat with these guys and hear all the stories,

33
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:35.890
but he's out.

34
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.730
<v 0>Of Dallas, right? Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.580
<v 1>When I fight happened with, yeah, when I fight happened,</v>

36
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.790
he's on his back and he throws that first punch and I go, okay,

37
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.430
this is going to be a transition. I look at Jack Ray. And you know,

38
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:46.420
if you go back and watch the fight,

39
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.810
he's actually rocked when that first happened, we'll step a little bit closer.

40
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.920
And by the time he throws the next three punches and I'm stepping in to try and

41
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:56.440
stop it, you know, Shakara is out out and they'll,

42
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.950
they'll concentrate on the fighter that wins. But you know, one,

43
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.130
you don't want a fighter to come back conscious and take you down to start to do

44
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:06.430
something that does happen. And if there's a language barrier, you know,

45
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:09.370
so I'm sitting there telling Jack Ray the fights over the fights over, you know,

46
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.880
I say, stop, stop, stop. So there's no misunderstanding about what's going on.

47
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.390
And I'm holding the jock Ray and holding the fence. Cause he started to,

48
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.040
you know, come back coherent again.

49
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.010
And I want him to understand that he's been knocked out and you know, he's like,

50
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:23.850
no, no, I'm good. I'm good. I'm going, nah, man, you got knocked out.

51
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.860
You'd been out for, you know, a minute or two. Isn't that crazy?

52
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.210
Everybody's mentally starts to come back.

53
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.630
<v 0>I think they're fine. Like people think that fighters,</v>

54
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.790
like they're trying to cheat or something like that.

55
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.980
Like you don't understand what it's like and you get knocked out,

56
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.310
especially fighters. When they come back, they think they're in the fight.

57
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.881
Exactly.

58
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.850
Like they'll try to take a referee down there holding on the pants legs. Yep.

59
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.490
They don't even think that it's a pants leg. And then eventually they go,

60
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:47.650
why is this? These are black pants.

61
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.590
<v 1>What happened? Yeah. What happened? They always say what happened or they,</v>

62
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:53.200
they get the bright light of the, you know,

63
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:55.360
the doctor is shining the flashlight in her eyes hazard. What happened?

64
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.270
One thing we tried to transition doing, you know,

65
00:02:58.271 --> 00:03:00.580
I've had some fighters really hurt really bad.

66
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.100
We normally keep everybody out at octagon.

67
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.500
But one thing we're doing is we're allowing a coach to come in with the doctor,

68
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.280
with the inspectors, with myself and give them a familiar voice. You know,

69
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:12.971
you get knocked out,

70
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.540
you come back and here's mark telling you now the fights over,

71
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.030
you may not recognize, but if a coach is there in the corner saying, Hey,

72
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:22.150
such and such, you got knocked out, calm down as fondness as coach huts as such,

73
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.850
I'm here. We're finding that's common, a fighter down just a little bit,

74
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:27.190
obviously medical protocols and safety. We got to do all that.

75
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.040
But I like doing that. I like asking one of the coaches to come in,

76
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.340
stand off to my side and kind of give them a familiar voice.

77
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.350
<v 0>When Olivera had Tony Ferguson in that arm bar and he had his arm completely</v>

78
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:42.840
hyperextended and it looked like his arm was breaking. Like,

79
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.950
what was your thought there?

80
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.900
Cause some guys have stopped fights when a guy has a fully locked out bar

81
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.760
and it's very controversial.

82
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.040
Like some people think you should just let it keep going.

83
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.810
Other people think like that.

84
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:59.130
One of the best examples was herb Dean with Tim Sylvia vs. Frank Mir.

85
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.670
<v 1>I went through my mind place and see what a lot of people didn't understand at</v>

86
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:04.980
first is herb is looking directly at his arm is.

87
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.870
<v 0>Season two, heard it.</v>

88
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.660
<v 1>He heard the crack. Yeah. Now he caught a lot of flack for that.</v>

89
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.980
<v 0>Did he only do for a couple seconds? Once I got in the octagon and explained it,</v>

90
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.910
I explained it to the audience because people were booing like crazy.

91
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.240
Cause the fight was tops. Tim's hill. He's like, what the? What the? Meanwhile,

92
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.103
his arm was.

93
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.700
<v 1>Going.</v>

94
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.560
<v 0>Too. Well, his arm was gone. Yeah. I mean it was, and then I explained it on TV.</v>

95
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:30.870
And then when I got into the octagon and I said,

96
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:34.080
I want you to look at something, watch this, watch this. And then you hear it.

97
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.640
But he go, woo.

98
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.750
When you see his forearm bend in half and then everybody's like, oh,

99
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.613
so that level.

100
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.160
<v 1>With the choke, I'll tell guys in rural meeting in the back,</v>

101
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.660
I'm not going to stop. Unless you go out,

102
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.400
you could have someone in a fully compromised position, you know,

103
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.210
who has a Dick? He has a fight. Yes. You know, he was fully compromised,

104
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:56.760
but how good could it be? How, how long can he hold it?

105
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:58.110
Can he turn his chin to the side and get out?

106
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.190
<v 0>I go out, you've got to let them go out. So we tell Kevin Lee has a nasty, rude,</v>

107
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:04.380
naked choke. And he had KSL fully.

108
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.500
<v 1>David in that position. You've got to let them go. So I tell guys in my,</v>

109
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.430
and we learn as we progress watching fights, you know, we talk daily,

110
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.930
weekly about stuff that we got to do.

111
00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:15.660
So I'll tell him in the back in Rosemead for a choke at this level,

112
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:17.760
I'm not going to stop it. Unless spider goes out.

113
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.650
If it's any kind of other submission,

114
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.200
I got to see a dislocation separation or it has to break.

115
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.580
Or if you scream and as a difference between a scream and a, you know,

116
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:28.170
a garage to get out of something, if you scream,

117
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:30.390
it's a verbal submission and we're going to stop. That's a weird one.

118
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.420
<v 0>Now Tony verbal submission thing is weird.</v>

119
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.220
<v 1>Man. That.</v>

120
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.100
<v 0>Was, you could saw his leg off with a rusty act.</v>

121
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.880
<v 1>That was beyond human. When,</v>

122
00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:44.370
when Charles transitioned from across the chest to under the underarm,

123
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.660
Tony grunted and he bared through it. Yeah.

124
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.290
<v 0>Yeah. Hyperextension. I don't know what happens to is.</v>

125
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.830
<v 1>I don't see my foot there. Look how close I am. So I'm doing two things. One,</v>

126
00:05:55.831 --> 00:05:58.820
I'm looking for a dislocation separation of break,

127
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.900
but I'm also listening to see if it's going to be crap, a verbal,

128
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.680
they know the cracking arm or verbal submission. He did not. He, he man,

129
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.550
he battled through that and there's we gotta be conscious of the time.

130
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.040
So the 10, second clapper had already gone off.

131
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:17.480
So I'm counting down in my head and the goal is to right when that horn goes

132
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.150
off, you'll see when we stop a submission from that,

133
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:21.710
we go right to the pressure point,

134
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.120
push back the opposite way and take off the pivot point.

135
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.760
And it's under armed to stop it because some guys are going to try to hold it

136
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:32.030
for an extra second out. The bill goes off, right. Is that stops?

137
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.750
I'm pushing on it and stopping it also verbally telling the guy to stop.

138
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.850
Cause you don't want any extra damage after the bail.

139
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.970
<v 0>[Inaudible] yes. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.620
<v 1>So we saw now think he did he fight Jake shields or somebody like that?</v>

141
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.860
<v 0>What's that loud noise. All of a sudden that thing.</v>

142
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.960
Oh great.

143
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.660
<v 1>Um, I think when he fought Jake shields, you know,</v>

144
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:54.760
there was some extracurricular.

145
00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.140
<v 0>With, um, uh, Kamora and that was in, uh, the PFL right? Yeah.</v>

146
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:04.370
He held on to a Kamora tap Jake, but then held it long.

147
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.340
And then afterwards there was a brawl inside the octagon. But.

148
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.060
<v 1>Yeah, and I think I'd refereed the fight right before that. And you know,</v>

149
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.780
it's our responsibility as a referee to know your fighter, you gotta, you know,

150
00:07:14.781 --> 00:07:19.280
we do what I do is I look at the entire card and I'll go back and try to look at

151
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:19.650
their fight.

152
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.280
So whatever I get assigned and I don't know what I get assigned until I get

153
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:25.070
there to know if anyone has any tendencies, you know,

154
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.040
where they grade on the standup or they grade on the ground that they have a

155
00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:29.060
tendency to file.

156
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.150
Cause we got some guys that like to fight with their fingers extended a lot.

157
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.480
And I put that into my rules meeting of, you know, washed fingers,

158
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:38.030
just what it's going to be fingers straight to the sky or make a fist.

159
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.310
Or if someone has a propensity to fall a lot,

160
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.290
that may be something that I'm going to watch out for.

161
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.670
<v 0>Okay. Now when you see something like that, if you saw the arm break,</v>

162
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.060
you would have.

163
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.040
<v 1>Stopped it. I would have stopped. Did you have to look.</v>

164
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.340
<v 0>How bad it looks? Yeah. It's so crazy.</v>

165
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:54.620
How hyperextended that thing is. Yeah.

166
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.180
<v 1>And you got some folks that are super double it and they will tell you ahead of</v>

167
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:02.480
time. Hey, I'm a flexibility. I'm double jointed. Do you.

168
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.970
<v 0>Remember a wholesaler? Gracie versus Sakuraba.</v>

169
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.890
<v 1>It was that with the.</v>

170
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.750
<v 0>He got him into Kamora as well.</v>

171
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.290
And he got his arm like way wrapped up behind his back,

172
00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:16.790
but Heuler has crazy joint flexibility. Like it's really nuts. Like,

173
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:18.360
and he was like, I'm fine. I'm fine.

174
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.520
And they stopped the fight and he was furious because his arm was like soccer,

175
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.770
robos, a catch wrestling guy, you know? So he,

176
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.960
he's got a lot of those like old school,

177
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:29.660
double wrist lock techniques that are really brutal and then joints.

178
00:08:29.661 --> 00:08:33.980
And he's got his arm like deep up high on his back and he's twisting it.

179
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.970
But Whaler was like, I'm fine. I'm not tapping. And he won't tap,

180
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:38.960
which is crazy.

181
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.490
<v 1>And it depends on the level. So like,</v>

182
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:42.200
can we do tough enough to amateur feistier.

183
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.220
<v 0>Oh yeah, yeah. If he keeps going, you can see that's only the beginning of it.</v>

184
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.270
Um, it, it got a lot worse if you say Heuler versus

185
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.840
no, that is that's the beginning of it.

186
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.320
<v 1>Yeah. Like at the amateur level, somebody could be in a choking.</v>

187
00:08:58.321 --> 00:08:59.100
If his compromised.

188
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.740
<v 0>We may stop the fight or if they get stuck in arm bar or something,</v>

189
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.040
don't demonstrate. Right. Right. In the amateurs. Yeah.

190
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.680
So this is Hoy's boys.

191
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.930
That's Hoy's this is a different guy. Boiler is much smaller.

192
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.270
That's the problem with soccer, Raba soccer.

193
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.190
Rob was a big guy and [inaudible] is fairly small boilers. Like, I mean,

194
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.480
he might be like one 60,
