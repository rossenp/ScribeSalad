Some wild. Oh,

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.090
They went to put his gloves up and said, no.

5
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.920
<v 0>Brian's not familiar with. I think your boy is going, gonna roll through.</v>

6
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.850
<v 1>Them. Huh? No, no, no, no. You want to bet on this. You.</v>

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.930
<v 2>How much you wanna bet. I didn't want to do Felder because.</v>

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.050
<v 1>Because Felder is a very scrappy.</v>

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.120
<v 0>Theater major has to be real.</v>

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.640
<v 1>And he's a theater major. He kind of go with a theater manager.</v>

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.770
He's traumatic and he's. There we go. Now, Brian, Brian, gimme, gimme your,

12
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.680
uh, assessment. Who's gonna win this fight. You elder. Uh,

13
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.480
I'm going to just go with Felder because he always, always is in the fight.

14
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.314
And he's always this.

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.650
<v 0>You don't know who is. Let's just be honest with you, Brendan. Sean,</v>

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.700
what do you got? Uh, I'll take via decision classic fights.

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.580
<v 1>Planning, decision hookers. Already show it. Thrown that low calf kick.</v>

18
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:03.380
He likes that as much as anybody. He's a giant fan of that low calf kick.

19
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.800
Yeah, we go. Interesting. Interesting set up.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.540
Oh no, no. You know what it is? His low,

21
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:19.520
his calf has already up. He's hit like four or five low calf kicks. has.

22
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.240
<v 3>Four already. Yeah. Oh, he threw a bunch of them really.</v>

23
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.790
<v 0>Right off. If they're, if they're fighting like this, ain't going to decision.</v>

24
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.080
<v 4>These boys are yeah. Cocked up. Ochre.</v>

25
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.300
<v 1>Is the master that little content. Do you mean?</v>

26
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.490
<v 0>You know what? I exactly. I know what.</v>

27
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.840
<v 2>It means right? Night out. Boys' night out college in New Zealand. Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.770
College straight around tonight. Oh, there.

29
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.730
<v 1>He is. Another one. Yeah. Those low calf kicks are so gross.</v>

30
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.910
They suck up and kick you there. You want to feel it.

31
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.730
You could see him setting it up. He keeps hitting it too.

32
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:55.010
He hit it again and Felder's not even checking.

33
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.740
<v 0>It out. I'm just trying to get the timing down and he's just not there yet. The.</v>

34
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.290
<v 1>Problem is, even though you look normal, your leg is,</v>

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.643
[inaudible].

36
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.120
<v 2>Not Felder. You hop on with that.</v>

37
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.020
<v 1>Left hook. I don't sleep on Felder. Feld as a tank. Yeah. No.</v>

38
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:12.980
The thing about tout Felder, he's really big for that division. He was sick.

39
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.900
I was walking around 190 pounds. Yep. And guess what? It drops down to 55.

40
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:19.490
He just let.

41
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.940
<v 0>I think that's what I felt that last cause he's running ranked one, uh,</v>

42
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.580
ahead of. Oh six and seven.

43
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.670
<v 1>Well, it's probably like a psychological thing. Oh, you checked that one.</v>

44
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.360
Then give him a little jacket, little ties to them. Touching the face.

45
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.890
Not a big deal. He's been there before. When you look at Hooker's body,

46
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:38.000
it's so weird. He's got like big shoulders and big biceps.

47
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.880
It's almost like they're they're Tommy Hearns kind of stuff.

48
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.330
It's like they're from a guy whose body is big

49
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.600
hookers. The hands are down. That's what I'm telling you. It is.

50
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.150
But with Felder keeps targeting that left hook.

51
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.550
<v 0>That left hook was just a hair off. Then.</v>

52
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.580
<v 1>Felder beat Barboza got stopped by Barboza. I hate MMA math,</v>

53
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.100
but there's something to that. And that was felled. Oppressing them. Yeah.

54
00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:06.360
You got, you got shop all over hookers.

55
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.680
<v 2>And fight. When you got shot, like Phil, you got a 260 pound man on your Dick.</v>

56
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.730
I like don't you the twist? I like Felder. hate how you get on the hook.

57
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.890
<v 1>You been on the train one, dude. I love Kiwis.</v>

58
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.900
You do. Why don't you marry them?

59
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.270
<v 5>I love burning Brendon. I love burning him.</v>

60
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.330
<v 1>I don't think he burned them. I don't know, dude. I'm pretty good at burns.</v>

61
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.880
Oh wait. Curious. So aggressive with that low calf kid. It's crazy.

62
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.540
That will chop a tree down guys. What I call it? I call it the tree

63
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.110
[inaudible].

64
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.910
<v 2>Hooks. There is trouble.</v>

65
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.390
<v 1>Man. Landed too really hard. It's this round. Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.220
Could be in a little bit trouble, man. Well,

67
00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:51.270
the fact that Hooker's been stopped by Barboza and got beaten down in that fight

68
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.960
and eventually he just crumbled as amazing to you.

69
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:56.550
Felder knows that.

70
00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.480
And Felder knows that he went toe to toe at Barboza and he's got that in the

71
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:05.100
back of his head. [inaudible] you. Well, Felder's one.

72
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.460
<v 2>Five in a row. Yeah, Elvis. Right? Five in a row.</v>

73
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.950
<v 1>He's Felder's smart.</v>

74
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.600
And he's been training with duke roofers is arguably top two or three best

75
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:19.290
striking coaches on planet earth. Two groups.

76
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:23.910
This is a machine. Yep. Oh switching. Oh.

77
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.840
<v 0>Kick. Oh, them up. Oh man.</v>

78
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.930
Nobody's Felder just seems a lot more.

79
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.960
<v 1>She's strong as, bro.</v>

80
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:37.590
He's a big fella when he's walking around in between fights.

81
00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:40.380
Like how the do you ever make 1 55?

82
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.750
<v 5>Very interesting. 180. I think 180 Dan. Dan.</v>

83
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.760
<v 1>Ogres just got it. Crazy biceps,</v>

84
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.790
like biceps and shoulders that don't belong on his body.

85
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.100
And he's probably strong that he's probably shim strong.

86
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.740
Well Chimp's strong and ridiculous power.

87
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.900
<v 4>Yeah. Yeah. Separate boys.</v>

88
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.310
<v 0>Got that calf kick out and look though, dude. Yeah, it's there. It's there.</v>

89
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.520
And it's um, I'm a, I'm a.

90
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.190
<v 4>If you're a fan should be worried. Well.</v>

91
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.630
<v 1>If you're a, you got to watch out for the hook.</v>

92
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.700
I'm telling you the fact that Felder knows that Barboza

93
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.160
stopped, felt that Barboza stopped,

94
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.800
but that Felder beat Barboza in the rematch. And he went toe to toe with them.

95
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:25.200
The first fight as well. But by the way, by the way.

96
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.243
<v 0>Felder likes a</v>

97
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.703
[inaudible]. He likes to give in. He likes to get into it and he's.

98
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.660
<v 1>Getting after him now, man, he's really pressing this fight. Oh.</v>

99
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 2>Oh, okay. Oh. What around? I give that round the Felder. Her. So.</v>

100
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.200
Yeah. I give that round the Felder.

101
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.030
<v 1>I mean Gresser big moments of, for Dan with a low kicks,</v>

102
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.400
especially the low calf cake, but that's not enough.

103
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.410
Do they get pressed the fight?

104
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.160
Felder control the center of the octagon more often. Do you get the score score.

105
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.640
<v 2>As much? Not enough. Not enough.</v>

106
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.560
<v 0>Problem is definitely lost. Even though it's in New Zealand,</v>

107
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.520
weed fellers going forward, fellow stolen more hands. They count really kicks.

108
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.380
<v 1>I can't. I can't the. I can't drive by,</v>

109
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.980
but I tried that I had to have rented pop me up. Give it a shot. No I can't.

110
00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:18.550
I gotta put my kid to bed. Oh,

111
00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.140
she got a swollen eye. Felder's right. Eyes swollen.

112
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.790
What happened? I don't know the Jack. He did drop the out of him. I know.

113
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:31.330
But that's quick to have it swell up. Boom. Ooh. That low kick. That's what?

114
00:06:31.331 --> 00:06:34.960
It was terrible then. Boop. There's the jab.

115
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.730
<v 4>Low kick. Jabie God whoop.</v>

116
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.080
Hooker's so long.

117
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.200
<v 1>He's so long. Boom. There's that left hook</v>

118
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.020
almost messed it down.

119
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.690
<v 2>Oh, well.</v>

120
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.080
<v 1>Real bad. That wa that right eye looks like it's closed. God felt her,</v>

121
00:06:56.081 --> 00:07:00.460
such a dog. He's such a dog, but that is not good at all.

122
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.160
That's a giant distraction. That right. Eyes closed.

123
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.930
<v 0>Up. It's it's only the second round. Yep.</v>

124
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.440
<v 1>And it's a five round fight. Let's see it. Felder winds up.</v>

125
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.020
But here's the thing about those kinds of swollen eyes.

126
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.830
If they have a good corner, man, they always do. And they have end swell.

127
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:18.900
They can push that aside. They can move it a little bit. Yeah. Let's just,

128
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.980
if it opens up is when you want to try it. Right.

129
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.660
Let's see what Felder can do in this round. Boy. There's really.

130
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.910
<v 0>No speed advantage. They're both pretty dialed.</v>

131
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.590
<v 1>In. I'd say focus faster. I don't know about that.</v>

132
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:33.070
I think you're just.

133
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.530
<v 0>Texting this entire second has just.</v>

134
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.120
<v 1>Jumped up a really well-matched fight. Really? Well-matched six or seven,</v>

135
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:44.980
especially when Felder understands how significant that is as, as does hook.

136
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.710
<v 0>The winner of this gets a huge fight against the big name.</v>

137
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.790
<v 1>Yeah. Well gauge he's waiting in the wings, right? Nobody wants to with him.</v>

138
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:52.630
And he's the scariest.

139
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.200
<v 0>Guy in the division of Dana gates. You turn out a bunch of fights. Yeah.</v>

140
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.320
Gage years that alley, you know, it might be Ali. It's the combination of both.

141
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.940
Yeah. Was gauging, waiting for Bali. He wants Tony. He like, he wants,

142
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.410
he wants the title. Well it's.

143
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.630
<v 6>Nobody's calling. Nobody calls.</v>

144
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.620
<v 2>Out. No nobody's calling out to no one ever has.</v>

145
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.280
So buddy, [inaudible].

146
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.630
<v 6>Finding him because he, you know.</v>

147
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.260
<v 2>When is that? When is that could be a fight calling out,</v>

148
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.370
told him I get per capita.

149
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.900
<v 6>In the lightweight division called out Tony. Nobody.</v>

150
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.400
<v 2>No one's gotten up. No, one's got the mic. I like Tony.</v>

151
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.110
[inaudible] Tony. Where are you at? No, no. Dave, just pretend he doesn't exist.

152
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.190
They just jumped over him.

153
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.160
<v 1>It's April 18th. Brian man,</v>

154
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.890
hits that leg and then just bounce. Boom. He's throwing that load.

155
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:54.100
Calf kicks so much. Oh, look at this. The show list.

156
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.500
<v 4>Though. You didn't jump on them.</v>

157
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.050
<v 3>Ooh, kangaroos though, is going to be hard. Oh.</v>

158
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.580
<v 6>Duties.</v>

159
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.480
All he needs is that right hook in that right leg in and that he's got the

160
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.890
seatbelt and you know what? He could pull him back into the truck.

161
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.150
If he knew that guy a lot of time,

162
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:16.070
if he took his right ankle and went behind filter's left ankle would collapse

163
00:09:16.071 --> 00:09:18.920
him. But you have to be really confident with your truck.

164
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.720
<v 1>And strong as, man, this is hard. We can fill this leg dude.</v>

165
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.230
Cookers.

166
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.890
<v 6>Right foot. That's the one that's based. The left one is around his right knee.</v>

167
00:09:27.891 --> 00:09:32.420
Right? If that right foot hooks Felder's left ankle dude.

168
00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:33.860
And they collapse. That'll collapse.

169
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.890
<v 1>Him. Isn't that? What a Cron did to his crown.</v>

170
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.700
<v 6>But with the truck game, if you're, if you're not, you're not going to do it.</v>

171
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:44.650
You're not going to feel, it feels awkward. I saw him, man.

172
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.390
He's got it right here. And he could just go from the truck to the back anyways.

173
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:51.860
He could use a man that right. Here's the thing he's winning around doing this.

174
00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.100
Yeah. Just hanging [inaudible].

175
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.780
<v 0>Well.</v>

176
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.180
<v 1>It. That was just a moment. And there's no damage done.</v>

177
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:04.160
I don't know if that last closing. It depends on how this last two minutes go.

178
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.380
<v 4>You know, judges are man. Yeah. Especially. Okay.</v>

179
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.740
<v 1>Hit that low kick again. He's able to get that without getting punched. Well,</v>

180
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.600
he's throwing it so sweet. [inaudible].

181
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.320
<v 2>I don't.</v>

182
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.300
<v 1>Even have a double when he does that, just dive into a double.</v>

183
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.690
Just hit him with a nice left hook.

184
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.800
And it felt just not seeing it very well because of that left side body shot

185
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.440
because his right eye so swollen, that,

186
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.010
that left side of is a dangerous weapon. Brian.

187
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.710
<v 0>If you're watching this fight was still on, like usually watch your fights.</v>

188
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:38.480
What's that sound like just alone.

189
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.250
<v 2>Ask you questions. No, they all get</v>

190
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:49.460
[inaudible]. I used to have sugar right there too. So to the left and the left 

191
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.293
Kelvin.

192
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.870
<v 1>Dan with that one low kick that one little kick it.</v>

193
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:05.510
He just threw Dan hunter did not like it. He did.

194
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.590
<v 2>Not. Oh, Darlene. Now don't kid yourself.</v>

195
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.650
Felder's face.

196
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.530
<v 1>Yeah. This is the real issue. Is that one eye?</v>

197
00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:18.980
That right eye it's really swollen. It's no thing helped me. No,

198
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.590
nothing's helping, but his nose is a mess. Anyway,

199
00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:26.600
his nose is a mess coming into this fight. He's not worried about that. Oh,

200
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.680
I'll just get some nasty meats, man. Dan Hooker's.

201
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:36.110
Oh, we went for the spins. Oh, he clipped him.

202
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.110
Well, a little bit of a stumble of legs together too, but.

203
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.970
He shot. Tell her such a fun.

204
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.620
<v 2>Look that spinning back fist he did. This is what the cut.</v>

205
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:55.430
We want to hit him with the elbow that spin. He wobbled. Oh,

206
00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.740
oh

207
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:02.960
[inaudible]. We got three more rounds. Guys are so good, man. We

208
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.793
 got 30 seconds, man. I feel like it's rough house Saturday. Huh?

209
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.490
<v 1>Such a good fight. It's so evenly matched. So back and forth.</v>

210
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:17.140
Dan is so good.

211
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:22.000
And so is Felder and Feld is such a aggressive second round to Felder.

212
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:23.290
No, got to do it.

213
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.350
<v 6>Choices. And he said one choice. And he said, no,</v>

214
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.800
why are you asking the question? There was only two answers.

215
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.300
<v 2>What do you to give it to you? It's closed. It's.</v>

216
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.320
<v 0>Closed because the first half had the position on the back control.</v>

217
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.030
<v 1>That spinning elbow in the punches by Felder. And the fact that chase him down,</v>

218
00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:49.080
I give it to Felder in that situation because of damage. I got to see this,

219
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.800
like the fact that had his back, but he really didn't do any damage.

220
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.360
He held a position for, you know, a good 30 seconds or so,

221
00:12:57.361 --> 00:12:59.400
but maybe longer. Right?

222
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.570
But the reality is when it comes to actual damage and big shots landed.

223
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.140
<v 0>Foot next to Felder and then also.</v>

224
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.590
<v 2>Felder to nothing.</v>

225
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.690
<v 1>You have a two and fellow man I'd have to look at it like a problem is when your</v>

226
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.110
face is beat up the judges, Hey man, we're in New Zealand.

227
00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:18.390
These judges might never give it to felt, Hey, they can't.

228
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.780
<v 0>Be any worse than New York or wherever the scored Houston.</v>

229
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.640
<v 6>Do. There's going to be some out there as I hate fight companion Ali.</v>

230
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.410
Let me talk about his hookers. Um, that was not good, huh? No,

231
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.073
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:34.293
<v 2>Sometimes</v>

233
00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:40.230
[inaudible] sometimes you miss you guys keep saying,

234
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.590
Felder.

235
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.640
<v 1>Is pushing the pace on, which is very rare.</v>

236
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.450
He's going after, but not, not tactically.

237
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:54.690
Like Barboza but like super aggressively,

238
00:13:54.691 --> 00:13:59.160
like in your nice jab and he's catching a man. Oh man,

239
00:13:59.161 --> 00:14:02.640
this is a real fight. This is a real fight. Real dangerous fight.

240
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:06.210
Felder's mind is so strong.

241
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.140
One of the things about him that's so interesting is he's such a smart

242
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.130
articulate guys, a great commentator. But behind that,

243
00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:18.090
this had Inferno, you know, there's something going on inside the guy's head.

244
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:23.130
Yup. Whatever's going on in his head. It's dark. Nice uppercut. There.

245
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.150
He clipped with that upper cut up. Now hook is trying to get it back.

246
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.720
Seemed to get like ramping up. He's trying to get back that upper cut.

247
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:37.470
Ooh. That left is dangerous and hookers not picking his right hand up.

248
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.270
His hands are super low. A lot of the time, a lot of the times,

249
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.260
those long arms he's does. He's being a pest it's volume. But,

250
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:50.190
but well, so he's trying to set stuff up and so his Felder,

251
00:14:50.191 --> 00:14:51.024
but neither.

252
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.180
<v 0>God that you felt her lands. It really,</v>

253
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.420
it's not doing much damage on Hooker's face, but man, when he lands,

254
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.210
he's making him pay, dude.

255
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.380
<v 1>Felder's doing more damage in this round a hundred percent. Oh, look at this.</v>

256
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.280
He's also throwing for the bleachers, trying to knock his face.

257
00:15:12.281 --> 00:15:15.580
I was trying to knock his face off. Anytime. makes a mistake.

258
00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.630
If leaves himself in the pocket and he knows Felder's coming back with missiles,

259
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.000
that jab is so nice to let.

260
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
<v 0>That left hook. Now this one's over. Ooh, good. Right-hand by Felder.</v>

261
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.060
It was a good exchange for to, oh, it's.

262
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.460
<v 1>Not bad that he learns at a right-hand that exchange.</v>

263
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.160
<v 0>Just doesn't have that power. Does he have.</v>

264
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.710
<v 2>The same power as he's waiting to set.</v>

265
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.600
<v 1>It up? The problem is his power is being stifled by the fact that Felder is so</v>

266
00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:42.640
aggressive and threatening.

267
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.180
He makes you think he looks like he's taking less damage. A looks at us,

268
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:47.500
you know? Wow. Which.

269
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.000
<v 0>Is weird though, because filled him.</v>

270
00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:50.560
I just have a lot of scar tissue in his face,

271
00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.120
but Felder's Lin in the bigger shot.

272
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.350
<v 1>The power shot. It's got better skin. Sometimes it's one or two shots.</v>

273
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:59.920
One or two shots can be weird. Your nose or weird do your eye.

274
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.520
And it doesn't necessarily have to be the hardest. It just hits you. Perfect.

275
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.420
Now let's be honest to fellows, hookers catching them. Ooh.

276
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.940
That's a nice left by felt. Ooh, look at that. There's.

277
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.270
<v 2>Changing. It looks super. Even to me,</v>

278
00:16:13.271 --> 00:16:15.430
it looks like the left-hand by.

279
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.900
<v 1>Beautiful. Left-hand by, that one went straight down the pipe.</v>

280
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:23.200
They're about to start swinging him. God, this is a crazy fight.

281
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.490
<v 2>Oh. Let him up coming in game that too. Well,</v>

282
00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:30.220
I think also Felder's having a hard time too. He.

283
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.210
<v 1>Can't see out of that. Right? I kids there's a lot of blood on fillers. Yeah.</v>

284
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.510
Oh that nice job. I hook her. Look at that. I just see a red mess. Oh see it.

285
00:16:38.511 --> 00:16:39.880
And he pulled back out of that kick.

286
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.100
Oh he's lightened that nose up hookers. Got that job time to him. Yeah.

287
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.500
Sheldon loves this bad when he's bloody and.

288
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.790
<v 4>Like this, he loves it. Ooh, nice. Boom.</v>

289
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.150
<v 2>Right here by folder. Oh my goodness. But.</v>

290
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.450
<v 0>Two pieces by hook and then he's out. Oh.</v>

291
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.350
<v 1>Felder caught him a little bit with that left hand there as he was charging in,</v>

292
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.850
this is wild. This is a high stakes game here kids.

293
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.810
<v 0>Because you wanted this one was going to be good. Yeah. How happy.</v>

294
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:12.250
<v 6>Are you that that's five rounds.</v>

295
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.870
<v 2>Yeah. Yes, exactly. Two more rounds. This oh.</v>

296
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.003
<v 1>That's got to hurt.</v>

297
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:26.050
See whoever wins these next 40 seconds can steal this round hundred percent.

298
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.510
Oh by. And then he got out.

299
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.310
Who's got the clean left-hand well that reach advantage comes to the whole right.

300
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.650
<v 0>Hand. See what happens. What's here though. You haven't so far.</v>

301
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.630
<v 4>Has this round. Yeah. I w I would agree. Hooker's face looks fine.</v>

302
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:43.103
Filters should for take down.

303
00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.850
<v 1>Hmm. Interesting. But flicker turns them around. Yep.</v>

304
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.160
crushed thunder. Yeah. Showing the strength,

305
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.800
showing his physical strength too.

306
00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.460
<v 0>So you'd probably have it. You know,</v>

307
00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.480
I drink a lot of whiskey and I've talked a lot of to bride.

308
00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.110
I'd probably say 2, 1, 2, 1. Yeah. Filters going into it.

309
00:18:03.111 --> 00:18:07.370
I would say this round is pretty clean. You got felt. Yeah.

310
00:18:07.371 --> 00:18:10.580
I felt her up to one real one. This round we lost the first two.

311
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.920
I don't know about that. I'll do where all.

312
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.320
<v 2>I love Felder bleed. Everywhere.</v>

313
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.600
Loses power. Oh, two to one to to one to one. I can see that too,

314
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.700
oh, I can see that too. It could be.

315
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.080
<v 1>Two. And who knows how they scored that one round where had his back. Good.</v>

316
00:18:33.081 --> 00:18:36.800
Honest, Jen. They're in New Zealand and they're in New Zealand. I said,

317
00:18:36.801 --> 00:18:38.450
not in Houston. Sorry, Houston.

318
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.350
<v 0>Except for that one. Raff sucking Dick did. He should shut down his Mmh.</v>

319
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.050
<v 1>Jonathan Martinez. Uh, Andre, you will fight.</v>

320
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.870
That was the worst robbery of the night. It was on fight pass.

321
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.160
We were a hundred percent convinced. Martinez won the fight.

322
00:18:55.161 --> 00:18:58.520
He dominated the second and third rounds. You will probably broke his arm.

323
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:00.740
So he had something real wrong with his arm, his right hand.

324
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.410
And afterwards they gave it to you all.

325
00:19:03.411 --> 00:19:07.610
And I looked over at Dominick Cruz and his jaw dropped. He went like when,

326
00:19:07.611 --> 00:19:09.800
when they jumped to like what.

327
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.150
<v 2>Dude [inaudible] party.</v>

328
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.820
<v 1>So when they, when they, I'm not sure it must be someone.</v>

329
00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.660
<v 2>Who's working in boxing.</v>

330
00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:20.210
When you turn around and box in the first round they do.

331
00:19:20.211 --> 00:19:22.130
I thought when you turn the first round, you give it to somebody.

332
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.260
That's I think that's how they, they don't do that. Same commission.

333
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.350
55. Holy. These guys arms are jacked.

334
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.730
<v 1>They're not really 55. Felder's 190 pounds. And so, hookers,</v>

335
00:19:34.731 --> 00:19:37.700
huge used to fight 45, which is that's crazy.

336
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.620
<v 2>Oh, Felder</v>

337
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:42.830
snapped his head back.

338
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.590
[inaudible] wow. Jesus Christ. This is sick. Oh my goodness. Come on. Come on.

339
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.600
What the? The right hand. Paul's up. Oh my

340
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.540
God. What a Felder's just so undeniably sound.

341
00:20:11.541 --> 00:20:16.250
He's so game he's [inaudible] he's all in.

342
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:21.110
He's off to take over a little bit, Dan.

343
00:20:21.111 --> 00:20:25.100
He is well, he's risking it. He's doing what you gotta do. You gotta do it.

344
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.270
He's throwing himself into the fire. Oh geez.

345
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:31.450
I'm Felder.

346
00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.530
<v 0>I like the exchange. Let's play the game. Let's see who.</v>

347
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.770
<v 2>Goes forcing himself. He stumbled.</v>

348
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.240
<v 1>On himself on, which you could have a couple of gyms. Jesus Christ.</v>

349
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.410
Now Hooker's starting to show it felt her shut Felder's oh,

350
00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:48.400
but those low kicks by money in the bank. I like it.

351
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.720
[inaudible] Come home. Boy. Oh boy. I love you.

352
00:20:58.721 --> 00:21:02.510
Stands cone to staying calm Felder, staying calm, keeping that pressure.

353
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.513
You see.

354
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:05.920
<v 0>Looking at him. Oh, look at this.</v>

355
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.250
<v 1>For the take down attempt. No, not Felder, not with Felder.</v>

356
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.670
Did he wrestle? You're wrestling? There's no good here.

357
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.600
<v 0>I don't think either one of them are, have wrestling. No.</v>

358
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:19.410
<v 1>Others is such an athlete, man. He's just his strike while he stays.</v>

359
00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.190
He's also very intelligent.

360
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.400
He does what it has to do to be P what he has to do to be prepared.

361
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.310
He's not going to go into a fight with holes in his game. You know,

362
00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:30.220
there's guys that go into a fight, hoping they don't get taken down.

363
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.280
Felder's knocked that guy. He just seems like he, yeah, he's the,

364
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:36.640
I worked on what he's bad at every day in practice. And he's turning around.

365
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.400
<v 2>Break. He's a sober fella, you know? Oh, look at it. That's Felder.</v>

366
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.810
<v 6>Fought a high level wrestler that kept taking him down.</v>

367
00:21:45.811 --> 00:21:47.070
That he couldn't stop the take downs.

368
00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:52.050
<v 1>That's a good question. Oh, look at this. Hooker's got his back now.</v>

369
00:21:52.051 --> 00:21:52.884
He's all right. It's control.

370
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:57.860
<v 2>He's fine. Let him, it all depends. It all depends on how good is it?</v>

371
00:21:57.861 --> 00:21:59.160
You get to work in that hand.

372
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.511
<v 6>This is a great,</v>

373
00:22:00.511 --> 00:22:05.220
if this was a Khabib could be every Khabib's fans would be happy as. Yeah.

374
00:22:05.221 --> 00:22:09.240
He's going to go down. He's gonna ride. This is a. He got him on the fence.

375
00:22:09.241 --> 00:22:11.850
He's going to drag them down and watch he does this every time.

376
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.040
<v 2>But it felt like I can't, I don't stay here.</v>

377
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.980
<v 1>For too long just for judge's perceptions. Okay. Now he's turned it.</v>

378
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.420
<v 2>Around and nobody's got careful. Here we go.</v>

379
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.350
We're in New Zealand.

380
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.780
<v 6>Yeah. But in a position like that against the fence around,</v>

381
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.680
if the ref broke them up, broke them up and brought them back to the center.

382
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.660
Nobody would give a. But if it was copied,

383
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.270
they would never do that. Right. They would never do that.

384
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.700
Like they would never take a beam off the fence.

385
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:41.790
<v 1>[Inaudible] break up fights on the fence on,</v>

386
00:22:41.791 --> 00:22:43.260
I hate when they break them up on the ground.

387
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.930
And I know people disagree with them. They think it'll make the fight boring.

388
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:46.973
I say.

389
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:53.130
<v 2>Taylor hookers, punch, punch.</v>

390
00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.380
<v 1>Put them down. Could take it. And,</v>

391
00:22:55.381 --> 00:22:59.130
but he's also realizing he's in New Zealand and he's now

392
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.310
emotional because Felder's putting the heat on him.

393
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.700
Fella's putting that aggressive heat on them. You know this isn't just like,

394
00:23:05.701 --> 00:23:09.660
he's catching him with. He's pressing him. And he's getting in his face.

395
00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.700
<v 2>Yeah. And he's making it real. Oh geez. Dan, he's making it real dangerous.</v>

396
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.290
<v 1>He hasn't lost a stitch of speed in the third round. Well, he's again,</v>

397
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.130
he's a guy. That's not going to come into a fight. Unprepared. Right-hand

398
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.370
[inaudible] boxing. Jab I've ever seen hook it on one.

399
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:32.520
None of it hook and wants to go to the ground. I started taking them down.

400
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.940
This is not good. Now it's not good. Oh, big elbow.

401
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:40.560
This is a big round for Paul Felder. Big he's in the championship rounds here.

402
00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.180
<v 2>By the way. Oh,</v>

403
00:23:42.181 --> 00:23:46.820
elbow off the break elbow in the clinch by felon again

404
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.013
again.

405
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.840
<v 6>If that was Khabib, he'd be winning right here. Right?</v>

406
00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:57.520
<v 2>Much that round. No, no, no, no. In this break, in this break, I would like to.</v>

407
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.790
<v 1>Say hunches Felder is so far ahead in this round.</v>

408
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.360
Literally is landed. Nothing in this round that made you go.

409
00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.970
<v 2>Ah, I wonder, I wonder the percentage of.</v>

410
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.120
<v 6>Uh, rounds, the like, uh,</v>

411
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:14.290
the guy in the position that hookers in would win. Even if he got tattooed,

412
00:24:14.291 --> 00:24:17.650
a couple of times now pushed him against the fence. It's not like this round.

413
00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:18.490
He's not.

414
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.100
<v 1>Doing Jack. He's just holding on. There's no way.</v>

415
00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:25.780
<v 6>I agree with you. And I understand what you're saying,</v>

416
00:24:25.781 --> 00:24:30.010
but what I'm saying is don't you think there's judges out there that would give

417
00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:32.710
it to the guy that's, you know, it has the control against the.

418
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.020
<v 0>Fence. I've done tough that round. Maybe the.</v>

419
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.710
<v 1>Guy in Houston that gave all four rounds of dominant or to John Jones over</v>

420
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.080
Dominic Jones,

421
00:24:41.081 --> 00:24:45.730
winning that fight or res I watched it five times and I

422
00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:47.680
watched it two times the next day.

423
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.860
And then I watched it three more times since the third round is the only

424
00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:52.660
confusing round. It's a little dicey.

425
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:56.620
I would say the third round is hard because John is pressing the action.

426
00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.380
I don't think Dom. I don't think nobody got right.

427
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.073
<v 2>I hate when people.</v>

428
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.200
<v 1>Look at pause and I also feel like John won,</v>

429
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.830
just dominated the championship rounds. That's got to count for something.

430
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.860
I agree with you. 100%. It's got to count for something. Okay.

431
00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:14.020
So let's set the record.

432
00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.850
<v 6>Straight. Okay. Check this out. This exact same round. You,</v>

433
00:25:18.851 --> 00:25:21.910
you, for sure. You thought Felder land way more punches than. Right?

434
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:23.080
But then towards the.

435
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.650
<v 2>End had him against the fence. I mean, you control anything.</v>

436
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.230
So you just controlled them. You just held her, wins.

437
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.860
<v 6>That round a hundred percent. Everybody wins that round. It's on their side.</v>

438
00:25:32.861 --> 00:25:35.860
Right? Okay. That's clear. Yeah. Okay. That's.

439
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.870
<v 0>All I want to skip you to, to going into this fifth. Now,</v>

440
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.440
when you look at the numbers too, so some people may gave the first,

441
00:25:41.441 --> 00:25:42.274
second round to,

442
00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.870
then you give that third round a and this could be it fourth and second.

443
00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.610
<v 1>Again, you got to deal with fuckery. And here's the thing about bad judging.</v>

444
00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:55.300
I mean, this is just an idea, but it is possible.

445
00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:58.060
The bad judging leads to other people going well,

446
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.460
we can't be as bad as the people in Houston. Yeah, you're right.

447
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:02.950
There's like the standard low. Oh, you're crazy.

448
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.920
<v 0>If you don't think one of these cues are going to give four rounds to one,</v>

449
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.770
no matter what happens. Yeah. If.

450
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.200
<v 6>You could put it against a guy against the fence and hold them,</v>

451
00:26:11.201 --> 00:26:12.550
like he did them. Does that count.

452
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.790
<v 2>For anything? Yeah. It's like, what is it called? Control. What's the most</v>

453
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:18.550
it's control. It's not.

454
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.700
<v 1>Everything, but it's something gets more important.</v>

455
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:27.340
[inaudible].

456
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.480
<v 2>Actual damages.</v>

457
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.990
<v 6>Yeah. Okay. But let's say there was no damage at all.</v>

458
00:26:31.991 --> 00:26:35.440
And one guy ended up holding the other guy against that guy. When I went,

459
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.050
that guy wins because he proved that he's controlling.

460
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.060
<v 2>The aggressive move. Even though there was no punches,</v>

461
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.980
I don't want to start adding punches.

462
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.480
<v 6>And strikes significant strikes. Then it kind of changes it. Right. Okay.</v>

463
00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:49.220
<v 1>I mean, again, we're going back to this one theme. We keep repeating,</v>

464
00:26:49.221 --> 00:26:51.350
but I think it needs repeating. We need a better,

465
00:26:51.351 --> 00:26:52.880
more comprehensive scoring system.

466
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.280
<v 2>Man. I'm just getting, why is no one do anything.</v>

467
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.750
<v 0>Joe, at all we, before of us, the three of us, we talked about all the time.</v>

468
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.450
No one ever does anything. We wouldn't be able to do anything.

469
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:05.720
<v 2>I was saying it's end of the sport. If we don't do it.</v>

470
00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.980
<v 1>Let's talk about it. After the end of this.</v>

471
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.830
Cause this it's only 15 more minutes. It's crazy. And this is wild.

472
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.880
She's got that long jab. And he's still doing that.

473
00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.710
<v 2>Oh. I fell Felder. [inaudible].</v>

474
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:22.430
<v 1>This is a, this is a travesty. It's a Travis cheddar together. See,</v>

475
00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:26.360
that would be a robbery robbery. Cause Felder's pushing the fight.

476
00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:30.590
<v 2>[Inaudible] don't.</v>

477
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.290
<v 1>Let him do it. Now. It doesn't take time. It's got control.</v>

478
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:34.760
But Feld has got to get out of this.

479
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.000
See the reason why is doing this is because the other is not working.

480
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.770
And he's losing that standup games game and fell his going to get free.

481
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.890
And when Feld it gets free, he's going to land an elbow on the bread question.

482
00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:46.970
The question.

483
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:50.870
<v 6>Is, at what point does what hookers do it at this point right here,</v>

484
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.240
uh, um, he's got to do damage over shadow the damage he took off.

485
00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:03.740
<v 2>Early in the road. He didn't do that. [inaudible] landed some, man.</v>

486
00:28:03.741 --> 00:28:07.880
We're exactly halfway. So this is where it gets interesting hookers Landon.

487
00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:10.370
Now though, but.

488
00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.560
<v 1>Definitely landed. A couple of good jabs did.</v>

489
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.330
<v 2>Oh, nice job by fellow jokers got up. Ah.</v>

490
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.190
Oh my goodness. This is crazy. Oh my God. Crazy.

491
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.930
<v 1>This is so evenly matched. How much now? Such a good.</v>

492
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.240
<v 0>Stylist matchup like look.</v>

493
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.540
<v 1>At the shoulders on. They don't even malaria. They belong in his body.</v>

494
00:28:32.541 --> 00:28:36.650
Now Dilulio belong on 170 pounds. Tommy Hearns body. He's got that long.

495
00:28:36.651 --> 00:28:41.420
Real similar, real similar. Yup. I'm trying not to focus on his lats.

496
00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:42.883
He's got, he's got a.

497
00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.350
<v 2>Skinny, skinny legs, no and just all took a human major around.</v>

498
00:28:48.351 --> 00:28:50.210
So I don't have to look at them. He's lats.

499
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.560
<v 1>Shoulders and biceps. We are the size of his shoulders and his biceps are giant.</v>

500
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.210
I think it's a crazy,

501
00:28:56.540 --> 00:29:00.320
but that's a really great body for fighting because I remember Roy Jones Jr.

502
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.790
His biceps. Crazy, no triceps at all. Just all biceps.

503
00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.730
He would throw lead, left hooks instead of a jab. Oh,

504
00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.400
I'll tell you what your boy Hooker's getting tired. Well,

505
00:29:10.401 --> 00:29:14.570
so it's Felder for sure. Oh, pop that jab. Whoo.

506
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:19.400
<v 2>It fell to returns with one of his own. Oh my goodness. This is amazing.</v>

507
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:25.010
<v 1>What a fight. This is holy. What a fight. Oh. I felt this jab is fantastic.</v>

508
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.720
This is so much more fun than doing. Oh my God. I bet. Oh,

509
00:29:29.721 --> 00:29:30.650
it's not even close.

510
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.970
[inaudible].

511
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:35.210
<v 2>Look at.</v>

512
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.130
<v 1>This. Try it again for the take down</v>

513
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:42.030
[inaudible].

514
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.970
<v 2>Oh no. Got to make a difference in New Zealand. New Zealand.</v>

515
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:47.950
<v 1>Too. Oh, there's gotta get up. He's gotta get.</v>

516
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.240
<v 2>Out. If he wins. If he finishes the rowdy nine seconds,</v>

517
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:55.480
he went to give him the rent. He got the take down. And

518
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.570
how did he give it to the guy at the bottom?

519
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.680
Cause he's the guy that bought him the out of him. And he's not doing any.

520
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.500
<v 0>Well, not this fifth round, but fella wasn't beating the sham. The fifth round.</v>

521
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.393
He took them down.

522
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.490
<v 1>Won this round. Well did because.</v>

523
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.110
<v 0>The take down the only difference the judges will, for sure.</v>

524
00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.600
<v 2>You telling me that take down. It's not going to make a difference.</v>

525
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.340
[inaudible].

526
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.670
<v 6>If you would have ended in the Mt. Dude, that would be a big thing about.</v>

527
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.120
<v 2>The judges. This is the only snippet thing that happens around. So he gets it.</v>

528
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:32.763
I know it sucks.

529
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.870
<v 1>Bothers me, man. You got to give this to Felder. No, not this round. No,</v>

530
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.230
no. It's a close fight, man. You don't give it to the guy.

531
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.690
<v 2>Give it to the guy. Come by. Not to get</v>

532
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.980
[inaudible].

533
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.950
<v 0>The previous four. So you got to get at least one to two.</v>

534
00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.510
It's going to be close, man. I'm telling real close. We.

535
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.263
<v 2>Fight.</v>

536
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.770
<v 6>By like pride rules. By the end of the fight. Don't put your hand in the fight.</v>

537
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.420
I'll wear Crocs right now. And you had.

538
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.500
<v 2>To pick, it was still working. But no, no, it was so close. It was so tight.</v>

539
00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:11.290
It could've gone either way. The fight look.

540
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.820
<v 6>A guy's taken another guy down. That's gotta mean the most right there.</v>

541
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:16.663
That was definitely.

542
00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:20.470
<v 2>A lot. How the end of the fight look exactly. I know you guys think</v>

543
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.990
[inaudible] over each other. Don't talk over each other. You don't.

544
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.360
<v 0>Upstage it. Cause you, you said that's like in the John Jones fight,</v>

545
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:31.240
like the fourth and fifth round mean more towards the end.

546
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.020
Cause that means in the fifth round is just as important as the first round.

547
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:38.650
<v 2>No, that's not the sport. Listen, listen to that. But that's the nature of</v>

548
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:41.020
each other. There's.

549
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.770
<v 6>Other philosophies though, because the way I looked at the way I look at it. If,</v>

550
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:49.030
if that first round was so significant, like you, you hurt him so bad.

551
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:50.260
If it was so significant,

552
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.210
how come you're getting your kicked in the fifth round?

553
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.450
<v 2>Who knows happens in the fight. Wasn't that significant to the sport?</v>

554
00:31:55.451 --> 00:31:58.900
Wasn't that significant, right? No, but that was so wrong.

555
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.380
<v 6>The Japanese, the Japanese stick the same way. So here's the thing,</v>

556
00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.270
guys.

557
00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.060
<v 1>Scott, please calm down guys. Everybody calm down right now.</v>

558
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.700
<v 2>So your, both you.</v>

559
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.220
<v 1>Did you just cut the cheese? I'm the outfit. Hey.</v>

560
00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.800
<v 0>Eddie. I see what you're saying. How towards the end,</v>

561
00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:19.470
when they're both tired of there, the rounds were significant.

562
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:24.930
It's just not a sport. Significant hesitations are sports as an advantage.

563
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.590
<v 2>Except for, except for leg strikes.</v>

564
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.920
My bet is Dan hunter gets.

565
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.090
<v 0>A decision. You're Dan. He gets the decision.</v>

566
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.970
<v 2>He gets a significant $3,000 to take there at the end.</v>

567
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.480
[inaudible] I didn't back you on this one. You're on your own.

568
00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:55.130
[inaudible] on television. There's winning and missing the pocket.

569
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:57.680
That's your punishment.

570
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:01.640
<v 1>For still being on television. When you know it's over. Sounds like babies.</v>

571
00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:05.510
<v 6>Dying. I know it does come up. You got to give this to Felder.</v>

572
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.380
Give us some volume Felder. Oh no.

573
00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.600
Hold on. Here. It goes.

574
00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:20.920
<v 7>[Inaudible].</v>

575
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.420
<v 1>That's how close it was. Oh.</v>

576
00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:27.360
<v 2>No, no, no, no. Don't be like, Hey, give me my money,</v>

577
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:32.290
Brian. You can't say that's a robbery. That's not a robbery, bro. First.

578
00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:33.400
<v 1>Of all, two things, one,</v>

579
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:37.810
you weren't scoring the fight to braid funding.

580
00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:39.040
That's a great landing.

581
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.940
<v 2>Way. Well,</v>

582
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:44.230
if in the fourth and the fourth round take for sure could have gone either way,

583
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.390
but I got surprised that won.

584
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.050
[inaudible].

585
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:53.230
<v 1>Close fight. That's such a close fight. They're both great.</v>

586
00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.990
<v 0>I, I I'd have to rewatch it, but I would've probably gave it to Paul Felder.</v>

587
00:34:01.991 --> 00:34:05.440
But I did think the judges were going to give it to just to be straight on it,

588
00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.310
to give it to.

589
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:09.250
<v 6>The guy who's looking the best at the end. Here's the thing. We weren't.</v>

590
00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.670
<v 2>[Inaudible] themselves at the end and steal the fight. I didn't make that up.</v>

591
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:19.810
[inaudible].

592
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:24.400
<v 1>Okay. But the problem is everyone knows when they're going into a fight,</v>

593
00:34:24.401 --> 00:34:28.180
did their offering say here, give me some volume, Jamie,

594
00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.780
it was close, but he got.

595
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:43.210
<v 7>He busted me up. Pretty good. That might be it for me.</v>

596
00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.120
<v 8>Good for him. He said, wow.</v>

597
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:49.570
<v 2>I love it. I love it. Yeah. Go be one of the best commentators all the time.</v>

598
00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.550
It was an awesome commentator. He's a smart guy. I love that guy.

599
00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:55.330
<v 1>He's a smart guy too. And he's been fighting for a long time.</v>

600
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.090
That's the kind of guy, man, as your wing.

601
00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.700
<v 6>Man at a club, you know what I mean? If you're single, you got a club.</v>

602
00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.773
You want this.

603
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:07.570
<v 2>Three time champion. You can retire. He's taking his glove off. Hey man.</v>

604
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:09.160
That's so.

605
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.420
<v 1>Classy by Dan. Now I love Dan. That's a great fight, man. Listen,</v>

606
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.460
[inaudible].

607
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.930
<v 2>You can't, you can't be upset. You can't.</v>

608
00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:21.280
<v 1>Be upset with that decision. For sure.</v>

609
00:35:21.281 --> 00:35:23.830
If you're not watching what we're drunk and we're,

610
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.340
we're shouting and yelling and having a good time watching the fights,

611
00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.220
but I'm not shocked. The Dan one. No, not at all.

612
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:32.890
And I wouldn't be shocked at Paul Felder won that fight either.

613
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.500
That was a fight that was about as close as you can get

614
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.300
Dan Hardy saying, thank you.

615
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:53.270
<v 2>You know what? He's going to have an amazing broadcast. He could.</v>

616
00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.390
<v 1>Be a concert pianist. Paul Felder could do whatever the</v>

617
00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.680
realistically he's already in there. You know.

618
00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:02.680
<v 2>What I mean? As a comedy, everybody loves him.</v>

619
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:09.200
[inaudible] no, no, nobody talks. I'm Felder about his commentary.

620
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.990
<v 1>What? Dan can take a punch. Yeah, no.</v>

621
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:17.220
<v 0>You can [inaudible].</v>

622
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.180
<v 1>To going back and forth with these guys too. It was beautiful.</v>

623
00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:24.590
<v 2>The guy behind them gets, he gets knocked out by butterflies, regular basis.</v>

624
00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.820
That guy serious.

625
00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.330
<v 1>The guy behind him, a stiff breeze puts him in a coma.</v>

626
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:35.180
It was for you. I can Brandon up so bad. If there's somebody who.

627
00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:39.620
<v 2>Looks a little bit, a little bit silly, I just look at, oh man, the guy I'll go.</v>

628
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.813
Your hair looks good.

629
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:48.560
<v 7>[Inaudible].</v>
