00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. There's a thing about your films though,</v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:06.510
that I think like, I keep getting back to this,

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:10.860
but because you did go over there, it's almost like in your films,

4
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:14.400
like you have something, you have to tell people, but it's like,

5
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.740
you have to give them medicine, but you got to give it to them. And.

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.710
<v 1>I don't think of it that way. I wanted to do I take thorny subjects,</v>

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.920
but they're entertaining too, because I want to know what happens next.

8
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.720
Like you, I think you have an interest in,

9
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.930
so even political matters can be fascinating. Yeah.

10
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.960
Who else would do Nixon's life? Right? I mean, come on.

11
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.400
He was not the most popular guy. Now he's in a plane for me. It was a challenge.

12
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.150
Yeah. Uh, same thing with the JFK murder. I mean, it was so,

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.853
so gnarly.

14
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.230
<v 0>That one's extra complex, right?</v>

15
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:48.950
Because you took some liberties there to try to move the plot. No.

16
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.600
<v 1>But liberties in the spirit of the, of the, uh, I didn't violate the truth.</v>

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.900
Right. So in this, I mean, I had to combine characters. Yeah. So.

18
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.910
<v 0>That is a complex story.</v>

19
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.010
That the story of JFK's assassination is very complex because I can learn a

20
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:08.420
lot from a person in what their opinion is. Like, what do you think happened?

21
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.670
Well, Lee Harvey, Oswald acted alone. I,

22
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.650
you get these very specific character types where these people have these

23
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.310
predetermined patterns that they plug into. And the Lee Harvey,

24
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:22.850
Oswald acted alone is one of the weirder ones. Yeah, sure.

25
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.920
That is one of the weirdest arguments. And when,

26
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:28.280
when I talked to them about the magic bullet know, like, and they go, well,

27
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.410
that's actually been proven that that can happen. I mean,

28
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.270
that drives me nuts because I'm a guy who shoots guns. I'm a hunter.

29
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.490
And I know what happens when bullets hit bones.

30
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.840
It doesn't ever come out like that.

31
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.490
<v 1>Ever. And also I think, you know, it was a hell of a shot. Well, hell.</v>

32
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.840
<v 0>Of a shot can happen.</v>

33
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.780
I don't think it's that bad of a sh I don't think it's that big of a deal.

34
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.630
I think that's overstated. There's many things that are overstated.

35
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.690
One of the things that's overstated is the scope was off. You know,

36
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:55.100
people always say, well, the scope was off. We'll,

37
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380
anything can knock a scope off.

38
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.190
You can drop a gun in the evidence room and the scopes off that's that's

39
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:03.050
nonsense. That's people don't understand guns,

40
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.030
but the bullet hitting those two people and finding its way on the Connolly's

41
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.120
gurney magically with very little distortion,

42
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:13.190
the boat at all is straight up horseshit.

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.540
And the fact that that still gets touted as being well,

44
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:19.200
this is actually how it could have happened.

45
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.700
And we are things happen with bullets. Sure. Weird things happen with bullets.

46
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.000
But one weird thing that never happens with bullets is when they hit bone and

47
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.820
shattered bone, they always distort always.

48
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.560
<v 1>Yeah, I'm making it. I made a documentary it's almost finished about, uh,</v>

49
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.580
we went back to the case again, taking all the information from the, uh,

50
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.390
assassination records review board that came out of the film. They were,

51
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:45.740
they passed an act. The JFK act Congress did. It was amazing. And uh,

52
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.310
they allowed the board to exist for five years and they went through a lot of

53
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.040
detail. They weren't out to prove anything,

54
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:56.870
but they w they found a lot of little detail that we put into

55
00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:00.040
this documentary, which I think you'll, I'm sure I'll love.

56
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.520
It goes into it into CE 3 99, the bullet,

57
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.180
but also goes into so much else on the autopsy. That's screwed up.

58
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.860
<v 0>The two autopsies, the one in Bethesda and also the one in Dallas.</v>

59
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.970
There was no in.

60
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.960
<v 2>Dallas. Well, they, they, they did examinations.</v>

61
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.070
<v 0>Yeah. Of what happened to him in examinations in Dallas.</v>

62
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.200
<v 1>Everybody saw a huge gaping wound in the rear right. Of is Mr. Kennedy,</v>

63
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.170
his head, and that was covered up. Um.

64
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.030
<v 0>Yeah, there was, um,</v>

65
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.190
there was also the reason why they needed to make that magic bullet work.

66
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.790
The guy who got hit under the underpass. No,

67
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:42.930
I know you're I could see your enthusiasm on this idea. Yeah. And also.

68
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.720
<v 1>You know, come on. I mean, if you're an infant treatment,</v>

69
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.870
it's a ho you can't fire three shots like that.

70
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.550
Why aren't you not firing at him when he's coming towards you? If really,

71
00:03:52.551 --> 00:03:54.090
if you're serious, it's a very.

72
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.350
<v 0>Unlikely but possible. I mean, it can be done. The shot can be done,</v>

73
00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:02.040
but that's one of the least ridiculous things about that story is whether or not

74
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:03.630
one person could have pulled off those shots.

75
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.830
<v 1>I don't think it would be done. I don't think,</v>

76
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.650
I think the world's best marksman couldn't do it.

77
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.000
I remember reading something about that. It's a hard shot, but.

78
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.720
<v 0>Hard shots can be made hard, shot three shots in that time period,</v>

79
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.900
depending upon how much he trained for it, depending on, I mean,

80
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.140
I've I've know some people that are spectacular marksman that can do some

81
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:26.970
ridiculous and do it so fast that he wasn't, he wasn't, but he was also trained.

82
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.800
And if you,

83
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.700
depending upon how much training he did between his time in the service and his

84
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:36.210
time, actually getting ready to shoot Kennedy, you can get a lot better.

85
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.430
I don't know how much training he did. I mean,

86
00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:40.830
you could take someone who's three years ago, a terrible shot,

87
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.230
and then they kill someone, you know, well, he couldn't have done it.

88
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:46.080
He's a terrible shot look. Three years ago, he was a terrible shot. Well,

89
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:48.810
if that guy was training time, well,

90
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.790
I don't think the rifle look, it can be done, but again,

91
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.520
whether it's likely or not, that could be debated,

92
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.790
but it's the least ridiculous thing about that story. Well,

93
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.410
wait till you see the documentary. Cause we, we.

94
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.450
<v 1>We go, we, I think we pretty much prove that there's no chain of evidence on,</v>

95
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.350
on the rifle either.

96
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.390
<v 0>Hmm. I don't know. I'm sure. I'm sure.</v>

97
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.500
Did you read David Lifton's book best evidence years ago? Yeah.

98
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:16.800
That's what got me into the Kennedy assassination. Somebody gave it to me,

99
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:20.820
a friend of mine, a musician friend of mine when I was on the road. And I read,

100
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.460
I read it unfortunately all day,

101
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.670
right before my standup comedy shows that night. And I was so depressed.

102
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.090
I didn't think anything was funny. And I went on stage. I had a terrible show.

103
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.110
And then, uh,

104
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.710
I had to shake myself out of it for the second show because I was bummed out.

105
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:38.250
I was like, I had never considered it before. I'm like, Jesus Christ.

106
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.930
They killed the president and he covered it up.

107
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.140
<v 1>Yeah. And we're paying for it to this day. Cause I think, uh,</v>

108
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.770
Mr. Kennedy was one of the, really on the road to being a great president.

109
00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:49.110
I think he did a lot of great things that people don't even know.

110
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:52.170
And we put that in the documentary when he was actually doing in Africa.

111
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.550
People don't know what he was doing around the world and Asia in Cuba,

112
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.150
obviously south America, what his plans were.

113
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.260
People don't understand that it was a big divide between Lyndon Johnson, who he,

114
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.740
he was about to get rid of him as vice-president. And for the next election,

115
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.520
there was a big divide in thinking between Kennedy and Johnson.

116
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.040
Kennedy was without doubt pulling out of the war. There was a directive. We, we,

117
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.580
we bring it up in the, from the, uh, uh,

118
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.400
sec Def conference in Hawaii from earlier that year he was pulling out and he

119
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.590
made that very clear.

120
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.760
<v 0>Well, there was also the Northwoods document, which.</v>

121
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.540
<v 3>Is really crazy, shocking when you actually.</v>

122
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.930
<v 0>Because this is not speculation or any kind of conspiracy theory,</v>

123
00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:38.080
this is all from the freedom of information act signed by the joint chiefs of

124
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:42.610
staff. They were going to blow up a jet airliner and blame it on the Cubans.

125
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:45.760
They were going to arm Cuban, friendlies and Intacct Guantanamo bay.

126
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.700
They're going to do all this to get us to go to war with Cuba. Yeah.

127
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.050
And it was it's, it's stunning that this, this is an,

128
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.950
this is an actual plan by the United States government vetoed by Kennedy.

129
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.130
<v 1>Wasn't there a plan also to fly a plane into a building?</v>

130
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.300
<v 0>I don't know if there was, there was a plan, a plan to blow up a drone jetliner.</v>

131
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.750
They were going to take a jet liner fly and blow it up in the sky and, and,

132
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.750
you know, attribute, uh, all these deaths to them that came about.

133
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.030
<v 1>Actually the Northwoods came about as a result of the movie,</v>

134
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:15.760
because that was what they was found by the assassination records review.

135
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.980
<v 2>Board. Really. Wow. It's one of many.</v>

136
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.930
<v 1>Documents that have come out. That's why it's important for my safe spaces.</v>

137
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.830
Peace of mind to finish this thing. It's kind of like, okay, this is the end.

138
00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:31.600
I have to just put down the evidence because I couldn't do it in a film. Right?

139
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.730
<v 0>Yeah. That's what I was going to get to. Like what,</v>

140
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.640
what is it like when you have this passion for this story?

141
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.260
And this is a critical story in the history of the United States and a

142
00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.090
clear piece of, I mean, it's,

143
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.440
it's a clear historical record of an assassination of a president and most

144
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:50.920
likely whoever who, I mean, I don't know. Who do you, who do you think was.

145
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.410
<v 1>I think, um, it, I'm not going to, you know, get sued because they're all bad.</v>

146
00:07:56.411 --> 00:08:00.370
But I think that Alan Bellis has to be looked at a lot closer. And I think he,

147
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.870
he was no longer in the CIA,

148
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:05.470
but he had a tremendous amount of influence and I think he needed some

149
00:08:05.471 --> 00:08:08.530
organized, very organized top people to help him.

150
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.520
So I think it could have been a group of people that were involved and then

151
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:16.570
maybe involving certain people in the Pentagon too,

152
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.230
because there was an awful lot of strange things that happen. Yeah.

153
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.820
<v 0>He certainly had some ideas that didn't jive well with the people that were in</v>

154
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:25.580
power.

155
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.540
<v 1>Then this was fired by Kennedy. Let's call it beta bay,</v>

156
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.130
which had never been done. Right.

157
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:33.730
This was a shock to the American way of government. I mean,

158
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:38.200
we come from a pro military system and here was Kennedy questioning it.

159
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.060
And then, uh, w you know, when, after he was killed, I mean,

160
00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:47.560
it was insane for Lyndon Johnson to appoint him to the Warren commission where

161
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:51.340
he managed to control pretty much the hearings and who, who was heard,

162
00:08:51.341 --> 00:08:54.970
who wasn't heard and what the CIA was delivering to the, it was a joke.

163
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.430
It was transparent. A joke.

164
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:56.920
<v 0>There's a,</v>

165
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.790
a couple of things that are Joe Arlen specter being the guy who comes up with

166
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.870
the magic bullet theory is another joke. Yeah, there's, there's a lot of that.

167
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:07.020
That's just very disturbing when it's one of those things where you go over that

168
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.610
subject and you just leave in this state of discomfort

169
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.060
and unease, and it's very hard to relax afterwards.
