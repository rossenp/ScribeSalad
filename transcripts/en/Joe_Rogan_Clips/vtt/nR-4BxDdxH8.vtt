00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now, you, you had an extensive amateur career too,</v>

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:10.020
man, which is a thing, a lot of like how you're. So well-schooled.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.980
<v 1>That kinda helped me a lot. You know? Um,</v>

4
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.720
I first started training when I was six years old and now I trained for a whole

5
00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:22.100
year. And when I was seven years old, I had my first amateur fight. Um,

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.710
I was always this big chubby kid where, uh,

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.730
there wasn't people at my age at that weight. So I always had a fight,

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.660
bigger guys and older guys. So my first fight I won,

9
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.560
but they gave it to the other guy at 12 years old, finding a seven year old.

10
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:41.300
So then I got robbed. I got robbed. I feel your first fight.

11
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.800
And I, and I have the video to.

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.090
<v 0>Oh, just put that online. Yup. Let the internet decide.</v>

13
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.320
Wow. So you first fight at seven years old. That's incredible, man. That's,

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.620
there's no substitute for that guys who get into combat sport young.

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.190
That's the guys who have what I was talking about that you possessed before that

16
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.280
sort of fluidity, the efficiency to punches. It's like,

17
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.180
you're you develop throwing punches.

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.230
<v 1>Right. I think it's all muscle memory type of, you know, um,</v>

19
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.220
a lot of millwork and just working hard, man, working hard.

20
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:12.200
And this is a sport that I love and I've been doing,

21
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.590
this is the only thing that I know. So thank God that it paid off.

22
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.120
<v 0>It's uh, it's such an amazing story. I love a story like that.</v>

23
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.660
It's such a Rocky story, such a Cinderella story. Cinderella.

24
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.450
<v 1>It's amazing. Well, yeah, everybody underestimated me there.</v>

25
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:30.110
They're just waiting for me to, to get knocked down. And then when they,

26
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.120
when they see me again, knocked down, they're like, oh,

27
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.820
and it's crazy that the announcers where we're saying, oh,

28
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.610
Anthony is a great finisher. Look at how he's gonna finish them.

29
00:01:37.611 --> 00:01:41.540
And what do you know? I ended up getting them with the, with the hug. Yeah.
