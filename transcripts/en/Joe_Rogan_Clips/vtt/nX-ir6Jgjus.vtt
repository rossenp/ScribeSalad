00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
<v 2>There's nothing like that for us, for music, you know, like I,</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.850
he took me there and you guys hang, not really. I mean, there was at one point,

4
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.870
you know, I bartended at the Viper room for years. Really? Yeah. Well,

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.130
that's how I ended up moving to LA. I was, uh, I was home.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.290
It was getting really miserable in Berkeley.

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:26.160
I'd been home for about a week from the end of touring. Uh, everywhere I went,

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.120
it was an issue, not, you know, mostly positive, but still it's like,

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.500
you feel like everybody's looking at you.

10
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.470
There are kids camped out on my lawn a couple days,

11
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.080
a bunch of days in a row,

12
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.480
at least one like a hundred people come up to me a day,

13
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.380
but one of them was like, Hey, are you that guy from county guys? Yeah.

14
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.090
You're Adam dirty.

15
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.500
<v 0>Yeah, you guys are so lucky. Oh, thank you. I mean,</v>

16
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.970
cause you suck and there's so many good bands in the bay area. It's wild.

17
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:55.200
That abandoned, as you would be so success to your face. Yeah. I was just like,

18
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.020
it happened like four or five days in a row.

19
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.450
I mean a new dwarfed by the amount of people that were coming up,

20
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.130
just loving the band, but still, it was like,

21
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.300
it started to feel like if there's going to be one of these every day is one of

22
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.860
I'm going to have a gun. You know, it's like,

23
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.390
is this Mark David Chapman is like,

24
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.400
it seems such a weird obsession to walk up to a total stranger in the line for a

25
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.210
bank, you know? And just say something like that. Yeah. Like,

26
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.740
and it was so weird. Uh, but we, we got really famous really quickly.

27
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.510
And uh, I was the only people I knew in LA really were people at the Viper am.

28
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:31.350
I I'd met a few of them playing across the street at the whiskey on the first

29
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:36.000
tours. And uh, so I was went home that day. I'd been home for, I think,

30
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:39.750
seven days. And it happened like six of those seven days. And uh,

31
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.020
I got a phone call and it was, it was sound Johnny,

32
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.870
Sal Jenka who ran the Viper and his Johnny Depp's partner.

33
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.520
And they called me up and they're like, Hey,

34
00:01:47.521 --> 00:01:49.260
we want to invite you to this party tonight.

35
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:52.230
And I was like kind of half and half out. I wasn't really listening. And,

36
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.840
and finally they're like, wait, what's going on man?

37
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.450
And I told them what was happening and they're like, I can't hang on.

38
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.570
I can put you on hold. I sat there on the finding of what was going on.

39
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.530
They came back and they said, okay, it's Kate Moss, his 21st birthday tonight.

40
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.450
And we're throwing a party here. The club's closed.

41
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.910
We're just throwing a party for friends. We want to invite you.

42
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.170
We got you a room at the Bellagio and you have a reservation on the flight at

43
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:16.710
six o'clock Oakland to Burbank, just get on it.

44
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.240
Someone will pick you up at the airport.

45
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:21.060
<v 2>You've got to rim at the Bellagio, get the out of there.</v>

46
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.300
So I like grabbed my stuff, went to the airport,

47
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:29.010
went to this party at the vibrant, with just like interesting people.

48
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.490
And I was like, I didn't go home again. That was it. I moved to LA after that,

49
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.490
it was, uh, I did, I stayed at the Bellagio for a few days.

50
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.090
I moved to like a bungalow at the sunset Marquis. And then eventually, uh,

51
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.840
I rented this house in the Hills, one, the, one of the bartenders,

52
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.020
Shannon McManus at the Viper, her best friend was Christine Applegate.

53
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.790
<v 0>And she was my landlord. She ran me this old, like she had this place.</v>

54
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.580
It was like a little cottage in Laurel canyon.

55
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.110
And it turned out it was built by the cowboy star, Tom mix in the twenties.

56
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.060
And then it was Nevins like in town, pad.

57
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.030
And he named it rogues or treat when there was a little sign up there after this

58
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.140
TV show, he was on called the rogues and like the sixties. Uh, and then I dunno,

59
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.810
I think it was the, I don't know what it was after that,

60
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.250
but she owned it and I stayed there.

61
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:14.980
I wrote most of our second record in that place before I bought a place.

62
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:17.440
But yeah, man, the Viper and for a couple of years there, I,

63
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.940
I bartended all the time.

64
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.230
Cause it was just less crowded on that side of the bar. So I,

65
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.560
my friends all worked there, so I was be there anyways, hanging out with them.

66
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.730
And after awhile I bartended.

67
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.440
<v 1>While you were a rockstar. Oh yeah.</v>

68
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.650
<v 0>Huge rock at the height of it. Wow.</v>

69
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.770
<v 1>Uh.</v>

70
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.030
<v 0>Well when I was back there and I'd be hanging out with Shannon,</v>

71
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.710
smoking cigarettes, drinking beers behind the bar, you know, in the,

72
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.170
in the downstairs bar there, the little one and I don't know,

73
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.500
at one point I'd help her out with stuff. And at one point she's like,

74
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.510
I can go to the bathroom. There's nobody else. Will you just mind the bar?

75
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.710
And I was like, yeah, sure. So I did it. And you know,

76
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:53.440
I had no qualms about berating people for tips.

77
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.950
<v 2>Um, I'm a rockstar and they're not my tips, so why not? So I made her,</v>

78
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.660
so I made her like a few hundred dollars in there,

79
00:03:58.661 --> 00:04:01.330
like five minutes she was gone. And uh, she's like,

80
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:03.850
you gotta do this all the time. So I just started going there. I mean,

81
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:06.010
that's where I lived anyways. I was kind of there every day.

82
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.060
The only people I knew.

83
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.190
So I just started bartending every night and it was like my home, you know,

84
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:14.710
it was like, I felt it was like a cheers thing. I felt like.

85
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.130
<v 1>Okay, there, it's kind of a cool way to interact with people too,</v>

86
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:19.360
because there is a barrier.

87
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.990
It is less crowded over there and it's probably kind of fun. Yeah.

88
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.870
<v 0>You know, you, you, uh, talk to him if you want to, if you don't want to,</v>

89
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:28.840
you got to get a beer for someone else. So I, you know,

90
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.100
and there was just so many people, it was like, what I thought like, uh,

91
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.840
the left bank would have been like in Paris, in the twenties. I mean,

92
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:42.370
it was like Alan Ginsburg coming in and William Burroughs, the Hughes brothers,

93
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:45.850
all these different filmmakers, you know, musicians, Tom petty. Yeah.

94
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.360
It was just really wild. Gimme Haynes from the surfers. You know,

95
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:53.170
we were all just hanging out there. Wow. Johnny Johnny's clubhouse. And we all,

96
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.800
we had barbecues on sunset on Sundays, you know, and we just sort of,

97
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.250
for a few years, it was this really cool,

98
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.340
like club kind of wow. Like a clubhouse. It was very much like that.
