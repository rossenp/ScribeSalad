WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.960
<v 0>But I, but like, I don't know. And they,</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.920
they have this lunatic on he's on all the time.

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.760
They're they're paid half hour shows,

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.200
but this Peter Popoff guy. Oh yeah. With the miracle spring water.

5
00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:14.640
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the prosperity. Yeah. The prosperity preachers.

6
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; talk about a bill of goods, man. Sad. You know that,

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.630
that guy CRE flow dollar, he, his name is KRE.

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.350
I'm guessing that's not his Christian name, but it's his,

9
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:26.630
but it's his evangelical name is I don't think he.

10
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.590
<v 1>Made that name up.</v>

11
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.990
<v 0>Right? I would, I would hope so. That,</v>

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.710
that was the dude you tweeted about him years ago.

13
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:35.790
That was the dude who was out in the world getting donations because he needed

14
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.990
to update or upgrade his G four. Yeah.

15
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.060
To a G six &lt;laugh&gt; and I was like, G six Christ, this,

16
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.460
this guy, he was going saying, I need donate. Cause I need to spread the gospel.

17
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.380
Yeah. And so you need to give me money so that,

18
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:54.420
because my G4 just ain't cutting it anymore. I need to upgrade. I was, I wish,

19
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.260
I wish he had gotten to 7 37 max eight, but that's just me. It's it's just.

20
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.890
<v 1>So amazing that that hustle still works. That the, the,</v>

21
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.970
the prosperity ones are so gross because they go after people that are so poor

22
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.930
and destitute that they can't pay their bills. And they tell them,

23
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170
if you just send me money, God will pay you back tenfold.

24
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.650
And I know what you're saying. You don't have any money, but you do, you do,

25
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:16.490
you take that money,

26
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.250
you send it to Jesus and Jesus will bring prosperity in your life.

27
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.800
And then they all these folks that are giving testimonials about how I was down

28
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.520
on my luck. I didn't have money for rent. I didn't have money for food,

29
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.560
but I knew that Jesus needed this money.

30
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.560
So I sent Jesus the money and Jesus paid me back tenfold.

31
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.880
And now my life is filled with joy and prosperity.

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.080
<v 0>Am I being hateful? When I say that, that is what? Religion?</v>

33
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.110
Praise a on the, the not.

34
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.470
<v 1>Religion tour. The.</v>

35
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.150
<v 0>No, I don't. People searching for answers. Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.550
<v 1>But I think for some people there's like, I mean, this is older, wiser me,</v>

37
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.590
right? When I was younger, I would agree with you a hundred percent.

38
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:55.910
But I think at this point,

39
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.990
I think there's some benefit to like having community

40
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.980
and having this in environment where everybody goes to be humbled. And every,

41
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:10.300
everybody goes to agree that they're gonna be good people that follow the ethics

42
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.860
of Jesus and you put a little money in the dish and you know,

43
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.180
they have to keep the operation running. And there's a lot,

44
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.140
I think there's a lot of churches that do a lot of good,

45
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.500
but I think for every one or two that do a lot of good there's the,

46
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.730
these that are just stealing money and driving roll Roys.

47
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.610
<v 0>Hypocrites, just.</v>

48
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.690
<v 1>Hypocrites, giant castles, you know, like that Joel,</v>

49
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.850
whatever his name is. What's that guy's name een. Yeah. That guy, Houston, that,

50
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.570
he owns a huge arena. He, they, they do the show in the, and,

51
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.600
and he caught a rash of when he didn't let all the hurricane victims stay in his

52
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:45.520
place. Yeah.

53
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.680
<v 0>See, he was hole up in his 10 million mansion at the time I'd be.</v>

54
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.600
<v 1>Amaz. It was only 10 million.</v>

55
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.800
<v 0>You know? Well, it's not his only property, you know? Sure.</v>

56
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.560
He has several houses. It's.

57
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 1>Just so distorted the, the, the whole idea of it all. So distorted. But I think,</v>

58
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.440
I think there's a lot of community churches that do a lot of good where they,

59
00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:07.000
they provide people with comfort. I, you know,

60
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.520
it doesn't necessarily have to make any sense. It doesn't make any sense,

61
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.240
but it provides them with comfort. I appreciate.

62
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.040
<v 0>Like, I respect people of faith. I think it must feel wonderful.</v>

63
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.360
I don't know how it feels, but I,

64
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.990
it must be wonderful to believe in something yeah. Like that. So devoutly,

65
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:27.950
without any evidence, without any indication or proof whatsoever,

66
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.510
that what you so firmly believe in is true,

67
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.230
but it's the hypocrisy of it that I just can't abide by. Right? Like these.

68
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.063
<v 1>Prosperity guys.</v>

69
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.180
<v 0>Yeah. Like the prosperity guys, like people who used to have a,</v>

70
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.700
or claim to have some kind of holier than now moral code mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

71
00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:49.740
that now think like the pimp president's cool. It's like, I get it. But like,

72
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.140
but your whole thing was like that bill Clinton was the biggest scumbag in the

73
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.720
world. Right.

74
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.940
And he needed to be impeached and castrated mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but like,

75
00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.090
let's have some consistency it's hypocrisy that I can antibi by.

76
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.170
Let's have some consistency is all well.

77
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.330
<v 1>Particularly with Trump, because Trump was, uh, this is not a knock on him,</v>

78
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:08.890
but he was a lifelong Democrat. I mean,

79
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.730
he only really became a Republican when he thought about running for president.

80
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.810
<v 0>Yeah. And he was an independent for a minute that he was a Democrat again,</v>

81
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:17.490
that he was a Republican, it's a pure.

82
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.240
<v 1>Hustle. I mean, the, the glass has been clean and squee and you could see right.</v>

83
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.760
<v 0>Through it. That's why it works on the evangelicals. That's what I'm saying.</v>

84
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.920
Yes. Right. That's their whole he's, he's like the pimp Jo OS ting. Yeah.

85
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:32.880
Like he's like, that's what it is. Well, he found his hustle.

86
00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.640
<v 1>Yeah. And I don't wanna be mean about this,</v>

87
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.280
but I think it's accurate that there's,

88
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.000
there's a level of intellect that just

89
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.990
subscribes to that kind of stuff. That, like I had a friend,

90
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.750
she was in the Mormon church for a long time and she left the church,

91
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.070
but she was really honest about it. She said,

92
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:54.990
I have a problem that I'm susceptible to.

93
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.710
Like she's suscept because she grew up a fundamentalist.

94
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.660
And so she's susceptible to, you know, to like yoga type people,

95
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.940
like, oh, the crystals and the, the light feel,

96
00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.820
the light she's susceptible to all that.

97
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.500
And she would recognize her susceptibility,

98
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:15.620
but she was being really honest about it. You know, that she's like,

99
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.493
I have a real problem.

100
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.220
I grew up believing something that doesn't make any sense.

101
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.810
And I believed it wholeheartedly. And she goes,

102
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:25.330
and that sort of formulated a big part of how I

103
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.810
ascertain what is accurate in the world. So she's left with these like

104
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.970
childlike skills of,

105
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.050
of being able to discern what's. And what's a hustle. She's like a little.

106
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.490
<v 0>Kid.</v>

107
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.920
I have a great amount of respect for people who grew up in a cult and who can

108
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.480
make their way out of it. Mm. I mean, can you imagine when you're a child? Yeah.

109
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:52.320
That you're most impressionable and, and you're steeped in that mm-hmm,

110
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.193
&lt;affirmative&gt;, that's all, you know,

111
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.760
like you don't know that there is an alternate perspective and,

112
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.360
and you're able to grow up and say, oh, wait,

113
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.960
there's a whole big world out there. Maybe I'm not being told the truth.

114
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.280
That's incredibly powerful. It's really hard. I think for,

115
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.640
to break with the only thinking that you've ever known in your life.

116
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.040
I think it's amazing. It's one of.

117
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.840
<v 1>The, probably one of the hardest things that a grown adult has to do.</v>

118
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.070
So recognize is that the paradigm, this, this,

119
00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:22.150
this framework they've been living in their life under is all utter horse.

120
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.230
It's like, I mean, the Mormon one is so crazy too.

121
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.310
Cause it's like the, the results are great. The people are so nice. Yeah.

122
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.470
Like they're the nicest cult members of all times.

123
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.180
&lt;laugh&gt; but then you go back and look at the actual F framework of the religion

124
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.460
itself. You're like, wait a minute, wait a minute. He was 14. You're like,

125
00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:44.460
hold on. Joseph Smith was 14 in 1820.

126
00:06:44.461 --> 00:06:48.180
When he found golden tablets that contained the lost work of Jesus.

127
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.980
And only he could read them cuz he had a magic rock.

128
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.180
<v 0>But like that's Judaism and Catholicism. It's all,</v>

129
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:58.130
they're all crazy mythological horses it, but.

130
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.730
<v 1>They know who the guy was like. I mean, he's so recent.</v>

131
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.330
<v 0>Too recent. It's too. Well, that's the thing, is it, you know, it's,</v>

132
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:05.730
it's like Scientology. It's like, yes. Well we know it's a lie.

133
00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:08.410
Scientology's even crazy. Well a science fiction writer. Yeah.

134
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.450
Literally was a failed, a failed science fiction writer, terrible writer,

135
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.490
terrible failed science fiction writer.

136
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.050
<v 1>A dead, never made a second draft in his life.</v>

137
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.120
<v 0>And one day said the, if you wanna make real money, start a religion. Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:23.640
That is his greatest quote. Yeah.

139
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.440
<v 1>And did it.</v>

140
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.840
<v 0>And then God bless him. Can't knock his hustle. &lt;laugh&gt; people wanna buy into.</v>

141
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.480
<v 1>That. But what's amazing that how are 2019,</v>

142
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.720
it's still rocking some way mean it is.

143
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:37.480
Even after all those documentaries,

144
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.270
even after the layer re show all these things, just.

145
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.230
<v 0>They go out in the world, they tell everybody it's horses.</v>

146
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.190
And then a brand new Scientology center opens in Miami. I'm like, seriously,

147
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.110
really? We know we already know a brand new one.

148
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:48.490
<v 1>Opened.</v>

149
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.630
We already know some people don't know the people who don't know are never gonna

150
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.510
know. That's what it is. It's like, you're going, if, if, you know, if,

151
00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:59.900
if you wanna put into money, like some people, people have a hundred dollars.

152
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.980
Some people have $5. And this is like intellectually.

153
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.260
Some people have a lot of room to work with. Some people don't, they just,

154
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.180
their brain doesn't work as good.

155
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.780
Just like some people have poor genetics when it comes to their ability to run

156
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.740
fast. Some people have really brain development.

157
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:19.810
Genetics let you.

158
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.210
<v 0>This.</v>

159
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.090
Cause obviously you would have sympathy for someone who was taken advantage of

160
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:26.810
or swindled or the victim of a con con person.

161
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.250
How much sympathy do you have for the gleefully ignorant

162
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.490
or the willfully ignorant. Meaning like the information is there.

163
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.800
It's available before I give Scientology my money. I just, I don't know,

164
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.680
Google it right. How,

165
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.160
how much sympathy do you have for like the willfully ignorant people who,

166
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.240
who sort of it's it's like the dude from my airplane. They bought their tickets.

167
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.400
Yeah. They knew what they were getting into. Yeah. I say, let 'em crash.

168
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.333
You know like.

169
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.160
<v 1>Well, I'm a big fan of Willie D from the ghetto boys.</v>

170
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.120
And he has a quote that I always like to use. You gotta let, Ahoe be a ho.

171
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.960
And I think in that sense, like you gotta let, dumies get fleeced.

172
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.943
It's just part of,

173
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.440
and part of it is there for us to see part of it is there for you to go what

174
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:17.710
they gave away, all their money. Ah. Like there's something to that, that's it,

175
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:20.150
it benefits us. Like I'm not a.

176
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.430
<v 0>Fan of these videos where kids try to skateboard off the side of a building and</v>

177
00:09:24.431 --> 00:09:28.550
they slip and fall and land on their head. And everybody's like, oh. But,

178
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.830
but those videos serve a purpose. And that purpose is not,

179
00:09:32.831 --> 00:09:36.260
everybody gets to do the handstand on the side of holding and survive. Right.

180
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:39.260
Some people fall and they land on their head and they're never the same again.

181
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.680
Yeah.

182
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.380
And then they they're left with like a third grader's IQ for the rest of their

183
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:46.740
life. That's real man. So it's George Carlin's bit about, you know,

184
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.580
the kid who swallows the most marbles doesn't get to grow up and have kids of

185
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:52.420
his own. That's how it's supposed to work. Yeah.

186
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.770
<v 1>Unfortunately it sucks if it's your kid good.</v>
