00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
The restrictions are supposed to be lifting up here in Los Angeles on Friday,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.880
which means nothing for us. For comedians.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.320
It means something for like some re retail, some other stuff,

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.240
but they're doing it nice and slow.

6
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.040
And did you see the list of that the governor's office put out of stuff you're

7
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:22.350
allowed to do? Mm-hmm you should pull that up, Jamie. Cuz it is.

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.670
It's quite hilarious. First of all,

9
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.270
it's it's kind of condescending it's it's like treating you like you're a moron,

10
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.150
like here's things you're allowed to do.

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.150
One of 'em that I thought that was hilarious. It said soft martial arts.

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.110
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah, it did said TA Chi. This is you're allowed to do this outside.

13
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.540
Oh no. Soft martial arts. No. Why? Why cant? Can't you do?

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.620
Why can't you shadow box? Can you do that? Yeah. Or it's only. Okay.

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.020
If you do things that don't work, like you're saying Marshall, Marshall, art,

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.980
art. That's an art of war. Right? And Tai Chi is, it is uh,

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.460
it's much more of a meditation than it is an art of war. I think there's,

18
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.050
it's very beneficial, but like, look at it says athletics, number one.

19
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:07.090
What does that mean? Badminton, singles, singles.

20
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.610
Throwing a ball, a baseball, softball stop. Here's the problem with that? Yeah.

21
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.770
If you're throwing a baseball, you're basically shaking hands. Yep.

22
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.570
And you're doing it with an organic skin, right? Baseball.

23
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.850
The outside of it is cow skin. You could throw a ball by yourself, but,

24
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.000
but that's not what their right. That's just sad.

25
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.760
You're gonna throw it and go face. I'm saying throw it and go pick it up.

26
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.480
&lt;laugh&gt; throwing.

27
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.960
<v 1>Fly balls to yourself in.</v>

28
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.360
<v 0>The park. BMX biking. Okay. Thank you. You're allowed to canoe singles.</v>

29
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.640
Oh, like it's specifies what's singles.

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.640
<v 1>Are they talking about crabbing? Like crabwalk.</v>

31
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.550
<v 0>No like catching crabs. You go crab and like fishing. No, that's what it means.</v>

32
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.350
You can go crabbing people do it all the time. Oh yeah. In California. Not here,

33
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.910
but in Northern California. It's a big deal. Yeah.

34
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.670
I've done it before you catch, uh, blue crabs. I think they are.

35
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.190
I think they're blue. Might I don't what species they are.

36
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.430
But you catch 'em off the piers, like of the,

37
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:01.990
there's a lot of areas around San Francisco where people catch crabs.

38
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.500
Um, it's really big in like, uh, like Maryland and you know,

39
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.980
like those guys love crabbing. Oh. In, in Alaska too, they do a lot of crab.

40
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.140
That was the thing. It was just a California list. That's why I was like,

41
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:18.860
I didn't, they must have 'em. I mean the ocean's right here. Uh, gardening,

42
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.460
not in groups. Oh you can explore rock pools. Thank you.

43
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.410
Oh wow. Where can we do that at Malibu? But you can't get to the beach.

44
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.090
It's closed cycling golf singles. Walking.

45
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.850
No cart, Tony. Oh my gosh. You can't have a cart.

46
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.650
Why can't I have a cart? What if it's my cart? I can't take the cart.

47
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.370
It's electric. It doesn't even hurt the environment. Like what is, uh,

48
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.000
why can't I take the cart? Yeah.

49
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.800
<v 1>Or why, why can't they clean it? Why.</v>

50
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.480
<v 0>Does that, is there a logic to that? Let's stop. I mean, if it's your cart,</v>

51
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.080
is there a logic to that?

52
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.040
And how is it any different than the cart at the supermarket?

53
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.920
Like that is getting passed around like a cheap ho think it's because they have

54
00:02:58.921 --> 00:02:59.720
to have people clean it.

55
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.240
<v 2>And whatnot. And they don't want to have to have staff on whatever.</v>

56
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:02.600
Cause they've.

57
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.480
<v 0>Opened up. Right. But they have it at the supermarket. No, I know. But uh,</v>

58
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.880
well you know what I'm saying? Your point. Yeah. Yeah. It's like,

59
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:10.440
it's real squirrely. It's like the places you absolutely have to go.

60
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:11.240
They're allowed to.

61
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.480
<v 3>Open. Yeah. And even the shopping cart,</v>

62
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.800
I was shopping the other day and I opened up the, the kitty part, you know,

63
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.750
to put other up in and I'm like, they didn't,

64
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:22.430
there's no way they wiped that part. Well, &lt;laugh&gt;, there's just no way.

65
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.710
If it was on here, I got it. After a.

66
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.590
<v 0>While. I'm sure the people that work in those places, the kids,</v>

67
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.190
especially like 18 year olds, they're gonna slack off. Oh yeah. Like,

68
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.030
no one's dead. They, they don't see it. You know?

69
00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:37.430
They're not going to the hospital. Hold on.

70
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.020
Don't don't scroll down yet was a lot more we missed, uh, go back up.

71
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.300
So right here. Yeah. So we were at no cart, golf, hiking,

72
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.700
trails paths, allowing, distancing. How is it? Okay.

73
00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:55.340
When you're running. Because if you're running paths,

74
00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:58.420
people that are walking this gonna come in time when you're right there.

75
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.990
Is that all right? &lt;affirmative&gt; I don't know.

76
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.150
<v 3>This is all very bizarre.</v>

77
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.870
<v 0>Well, it's all it really is.</v>

78
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:08.990
Like we're dealing with multiple different diseases too. Are these trails open?

79
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.950
<v 2>I thought they were still closed.</v>

80
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.710
<v 0>Are they opening those up? I think they opened them up again.</v>

81
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.030
We'll find that out next. Oh, you can. Kiteboard okay. Oh, meditation's loud.

82
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.140
Oh, we're allow, can meditate. What the man. Outdoor photography.

83
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.420
Oh, I didn't know. I thought that if I was hiking,

84
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.340
I couldn't take pictures of what I was hiking with. Thank you.

85
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.820
Thank you for allowing me to do outdoor photography. Um,

86
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.340
picnics with your stay at home.

87
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:37.100
Household members only can't meet up with other people that aren't sick. What?

88
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.730
Quad biking, rock climbing. Roller skating. Roller. It's weird.

89
00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.850
It's cuz like we're, we're we're asking people to be extra,

90
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.970
super responsible with this. Right. But we,

91
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.210
we don't ask the same thing about car accidents. Look at stop. Right? Go back.

92
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.290
Soft martial arts. Look at that. Tai Chi Chung what's.

93
00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.970
<v 3>Chung. Well.</v>

94
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.200
<v 0>I know what Chi is. It's like a,</v>

95
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.040
a type of like a breathing exercise. I'm pretty sure. Um,

96
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.400
and you know what Tai Chi is, it's almost like a series of rhythmic movements,

97
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.160
but I, why are you calling that a soft martial art?

98
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.080
It's such a weird definition and not in groups. It's just like so specific.

99
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.070
Like if a person wants to go outside and they have shadow boxing routine,

100
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:26.750
they do. And they like to practice Mo Thai. Why can't they go practice Mo Thai?

101
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.270
They can't just go outside.

102
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:31.710
Like imagine like you're pent up in your apartment and you can go on the beach

103
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.150
and just like spark up a little and just throw some combinations under the sun

104
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:40.030
and the sand you can't do that. Is that threatening to people.

105
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.260
Why? But you're allowed to do well. That's jazz. That's not even a martial art.

106
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.740
Let's just be honest. It's great people that do it.

107
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:50.260
They find it very therapeutic and it's good for the body. You know,

108
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:53.620
you're doing these slow poses. So it gives you, you know,

109
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.320
you're exercising control over your body, but it's not really a martial art,

110
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.800
not it's, uh, it's weird. It's like, you wouldn't fight with it.

111
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.360
So what is it? You know what I'm saying? Like you're not gonna fight with TA.

112
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.400
<v 3>Chi. I've never heard the terminology before.</v>

113
00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:12.120
Is there such thing as soft and hard martial arts? Yeah. I.

114
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.320
<v 0>Guess you could. Yeah. You could kind of define it like that. People would,</v>

115
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:18.750
some people would say that it is a soft martial art. They would,

116
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.750
I guess they would kind of say, but it just doesn't make sense to me.

117
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.310
It's not a martial art. It's a martial.

118
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.190
Art is something that you would use in a fight.

119
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.870
If you are trying to have a thing with there's rules to martial arts.

120
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.590
So you could say like, well, how come boxing is just boxing?

121
00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:37.500
How come they're not allowed to kick you or take you down? Like,

122
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.860
is that a full martial.

123
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.900
<v 2>Art thing right here? Uh, I was looking around there's a, this is a potential,</v>

124
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.740
oh Jesus Christ from, from Northwestern university.

125
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.860
A COVID tracking thing that they're de tested with like less than 30 people,

126
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.580
but oh my.

127
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.580
<v 0>God, that's so crazy. Detract.</v>

128
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.420
<v 2>Stroke patients and like changes in your breathing and lungs or some.</v>

129
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.490
Then there like sounds in there that connect to a device,

130
00:06:59.491 --> 00:07:03.290
which is your phone and let you know if something.

131
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.000
<v 0>Comes up, what is,</v>

132
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.690
what better way to get integrated with the grid than to create a virus that

133
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:12.490
makes you wear a mask, takes away your humanity. Can't touch each other.

134
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.890
Gotta stay away, no social contact.

135
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.690
So you're get more and more addicted to your TV in your phone,

136
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.120
more and more addicted to your laptop. I'll free you,

137
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.360
but you gotta take a test and then I gotta put a tracking thing on you cuz I

138
00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:30.960
wanna make sure that you're a good boy, Tony. You're a good boy.

139
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.920
You don't go catch no COVID and spreading it around.

140
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.080
So I gotta know where you are so I can chart out the health of the public.

141
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.070
<v 3>Frightening who.</v>

142
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:42.470
<v 0>Can't give that up. Folks.</v>

143
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.670
Five stage reopening process based on risk for Los Angeles announced.

144
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.230

Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; this is as a Friday. Hey, this Friday,

office retail, essential healthcare, outdoor recreation and libraries.

152
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.180
I thought we already outdoor recreation. This was.

153
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.860
<v 2>Sort of what we were talking about earlier, but you have to wear,</v>

154
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.660
they say here it's on this screen. You have to wear face,

155
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:18.700
cover covering mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you go out there in the trails.

156
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.890
<v 0>You must. So are they making runners wear face masks while they're running?</v>

157
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.983
No.

158
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.850
<v 2>Not out on the streets. I don't think,</v>

159
00:08:26.851 --> 00:08:28.850
but maybe if you're in a trail you could probably get stopped.

160
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.971
<v 0>Find out if that's true,</v>

161
00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:33.930
because I've been reading all these things that say that there's, you know,

162
00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:34.930
we joked around about it before.

163
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:37.410
Like if someone passes you when they're running, like how close are they to you?

164
00:08:37.411 --> 00:08:41.920
But it doesn't seem like there's any sort of science to say that it spreads that

165
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:42.920
way. Like.

166
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.360
<v 2>I know that's what I've I've read that. And didn't think that that was true too.</v>

167
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:49.840
But I, I texted Brandons shop. He said he got a ticket for being on that trail.

168
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.520
Did I don't know what the ticket was for, but Jesus Christ. Yeah. I was like,

169
00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:55.680
did you really get a ticket? He said, yeah. Did he get.

170
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.320
<v 0>A ticket for just being there? Or did he get a ticket for not wearing a mask?</v>

171
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.400
I'm not sure. Wow. So, um, museums, cultural centers and galleries.

172
00:09:03.401 --> 00:09:07.360
Thank God. They can open up Lama and you can stare at a plexiglass box at some

173
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.640
dip glued together.

174
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.400
Get that stage three separated with velvet ropes,

175
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.390
stage three high risk businesses, body art, massage bars, nightclubs,

176
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.110
movie theaters, and bowling alleys. So we have to wait.

177
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.230
We have to wait for the next stage. Yeah, it doesn't say when that,

178
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.350
and then stage four higher risk businesses, entertainment venues. Oh,

179
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:34.550
wait a minute. That might be us. I don't wait a minute. Yeah.

180
00:09:34.551 --> 00:09:39.340
Like what entertainment venue is that like that like a, a large arena.

181
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.900
There.

182
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.940
<v 2>Might be more like a thousands people, more like a concert venue.</v>

183
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.380
<v 0>Don thing. Don't say a thousand. Jamie, you give 'em a bad idea. 2,003,000,</v>

184
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.220
3000. We, we want theaters. Yes. We can do do comedy in theaters.

185
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.740
If they shut down all the arenas and I just have to do 10 shows instead of one,

186
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.290
we could do that. This.

187
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.050
<v 2>Is just Los Angeles. I know. But.</v>

188
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.570
<v 0>These it doesn't matter. They'll they'll this is.</v>

189
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.050
<v 2>Also, Ohio's just passed a law. They said to, to change what the, uh,</v>

190
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.290
the department of health is doing.

191
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:11.450
So that they're like over superseding the rules, like in their Congress.

192
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.450
So they only have 14. I don't know.

193
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:18.040
<v 0>So lots, listen, I think ultimately, I mean, we're hating this,</v>

194
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.200
what California's doing.

195
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.920
Like ultimately there's way less people that got it here than got it anywhere

196
00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:27.920
else. So it's probably a good idea. But as a comedian,

197
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.720
it sucks. It sucks as a person who, uh,

198
00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.430
is not in the highest of risks. It, it sucks.

199
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.470
I know quite a few people that have had it and we're gonna actually have Michael

200
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.190
yo come on next week.

201
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:46.390
I'm really interested to talk to him cuz he had it real bad and he got it from

202
00:10:46.391 --> 00:10:47.210
New York.

203
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:50.590
And then there's been some speculation that the people who got it from New York,

204
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.790
they get it from Europe. But the people that got it in California,

205
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.420
a lot of them got it from China, which is really in interesting.

206
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:01.460
Cause like I wonder if, as it went through Europe, it got worse.

207
00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:04.940
Like that's that's possible. Right.

208
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.380
And wasn't that something that they speculated that there's some sort of

209
00:11:08.381 --> 00:11:09.260
different strains. Yeah.

210
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.940
<v 2>But what couldn't New York people just come to LA easier people from China.</v>

211
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.090
<v 0>Um, yeah they could, but I think the, when they tracked the origin, that's the,</v>

212
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.130
they can test. Yeah. Yeah.
