00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 1>It's yeah. It's some kind of Brontosaurus.</v>

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 0>Weird going in the restaurants. Did you feel weird?</v>

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.920
<v 2>Yeah, it was nice, but the waiter had a mask. Oh, that was done.</v>

5
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.550
He was talking to us so stupid. He was like, Hey man, I love your podcast.

6
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:15.750
I'm like, are you, where are you?

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.940
<v 3>I see your eyes. We're not that get used to that. Must've been nice.</v>

8
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.610
Cause I don't think that's going to happen in our life for at least.

9
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.010
<v 2>I don't think go to San Diego man.</v>

10
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490
<v 0>It's [inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.480
<v 3>He's a very strange dude. Something's going on?</v>

12
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.270
<v 2>Did you see that article? That who was that guy?</v>

13
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:37.200
There was a conservative politician in, um, uh,

14
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.620
I'm thinking about San Diego. I'm thinking about Texas. I've been saying that.

15
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.570
<v 0>One goes, we all go.</v>

16
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.410
<v 2>To the moon. Love to leave. Texas is mad. Like you come over here,</v>

17
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.610
you just bring your liberal, right? No.

18
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.850
<v 0>Okay. Easy. You ever been to Austin? I love Austin,</v>

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.290
but I'm saying liberal. I mean Austin's liberal. Is that good?

20
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.280
<v 2>Um, did I send that to you guys? That article about the San Diego guy</v>

21
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.230
and here it is, I'm going to say send it to you Jamie. Cause it's on San Diego.

22
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.280
<v 0>With the six deaths.</v>

23
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.540
<v 2>Six. That's what I'm saying. I said.</v>

24
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.680
<v 0>You sent it to me. I said, if.</v>

25
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.550
<v 2>You talk about that.</v>

26
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.400
<v 3>You will be, you'll be taken off YouTube window Saunders,</v>

27
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:21.810
those doctors who said that you have a 0.03% chance of dying in LA or something

28
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:22.470
like that.

29
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.120
And they were that that video was taken down Facebook and YouTube will take down

30
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:27.960
your video if they can.

31
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.780
<v 0>I guess I'm free. Brian. You'll enjoy this. You'll love this.</v>

32
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:34.020
I just found out from, uh, our boy, that meant pixels. Then you are, Hey,

33
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:35.970
can you and Brian, the first five minutes,

34
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:40.680
not talking about penises or cuss or you who gives a duty is YouTube.

35
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
YouTube demonetizing your channel and taking them when you cuss in the first

36
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:44.574
five minutes.

37
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.750
<v 2>Oh, you Fox, you ruined everything. Pfizer.</v>

38
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.730
Jim Desmond says San Diego has all has only had six pure

39
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.800
Corona virus, deaths. Whoa. So what he's saying is all the deaths that they had.

40
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.580
Everyone had an underlying cause except for six. Yeah. That were pure.

41
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.773
Corona virus. Six. Yeah.

42
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.160
<v 0>3.3 Million. Hear me out, boys. I love takes much of the next guy, LA Jolla.</v>

43
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.380
When we go to the comedy store there, I love it down there.

44
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:14.640
We're not gonna save as much on taxes, but San Diego, we can serve fish tacos.

45
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.720
<v 2>They're locked down.</v>

46
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.000
<v 0>There, open up more than us.</v>

47
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.170
<v 2>I know, but we should listen. I mean, there's no simple,</v>

48
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:23.430
easy way to do this.

49
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.600
<v 1>We got to look at how the states act over the next couple of weeks and just</v>

50
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.740
judge these states and talk about what states, uh, are, are, uh, also.

51
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.200
<v 0>Diana, but also just Atlanta.</v>

52
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.940
<v 2>All these states need to, if you want to help people talk about health,</v>

53
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.360
no one knows no one's doing it. All these people are talking about. It's fear.

54
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.160
They're talking about the disease, how quickly it spreads, how people carry it.

55
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.731
And they don't even know.

56
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:50.040
They're talking about all these things about the disease, which is great,

57
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.660
but put out you want to help people put out a message to change your

58
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.273
diets.

59
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.450
<v 1>How about the Belgium.</v>

60
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.680
<v 2>Health minister, hilarious gate gate.</v>

61
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.850
You get your life into Whetstone and people. It destroys people.

62
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.350
Roby destroys him. It was the one of the number one factors in,

63
00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:09.550
in people that had really horrible

64
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.610
city flu does that like obese and people with pre-call all diseases, diseases,

65
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.540
diseases, underlying conditions. That's going to you over this one.

66
00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.940
We were led to believe it was going to be something that it wasn't.

67
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:25.240
They thought it was different than it was. We're lucky. Now they can backtrack.

68
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.840
We're lucky, but we have to admit we're lucky. And we have to admit,

69
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.530
obviously people did a lot of great work and the first responders, the,

70
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:36.880
the bravest human beings alive is hands down that we were scared about it in our

71
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:41.620
homes. And these people are dealing with sick patients in DAS every day.

72
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.910
But we have to recognize the difference between what happens to them.

73
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:46.744
And what's, what's hard.

74
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.250
And what happens to the rest of us and what can be fixed with nutrition?

75
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.280
What can be fixed with medicine? What can we fix? What could it be?

76
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.370
But also the actual odds of dying from the disease.

77
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.800
There's a lot going to say is at a certain point in time,

78
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.590
you got to let people be free. And I don't know when that is,

79
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.080
give us a guideline. It should be like people that don't for me.

80
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.270
I was going to say, I don't know why that is.

81
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.960
<v 3>But mobile don't believe that the people in power right now that the larger</v>

82
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.220
issue, the larger issue, I think is that you have people in power,

83
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:16.960
especially in I'm sorry,

84
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:20.900
but I feel this way about Eric Garcetti and Gavin Newsom. And I,

85
00:04:20.901 --> 00:04:23.230
and I love the people around him who,

86
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.150
who have this arbitrary executive control to

87
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.190
make decisions that affect all our lives and destroy businesses may be

88
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:37.960
irreparably by with some health bureaucrats by saying, well,

89
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.200
you know what? Everybody has to wear a mandatory, we're going to mandate masks.

90
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.350
And we're going to extend this. Now that we flatten the curve. And by the way,

91
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.060
the hospitals in Los Angeles are empty. They are,

92
00:04:47.061 --> 00:04:50.650
our health system is not overrun and we have flatten the curve,

93
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.830
but you know what? Take a seat for another three months, take a seat.

94
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.320
<v 2>Oh, and that snitch on your neighbor just tweeted that out.</v>

95
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.770
Just snitch on your neighbor, but snitch on businesses,

96
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.300
we're still conducting business.

97
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.471
<v 3>It was unprecedented.</v>

98
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:06.700
And I think this is executive overreach and it was challenged in Wisconsin and

99
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.470
overturned in my opinion. Rightly so. We'll see. Now, as these states open,

100
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:12.970
we'll see if the death toll class,

101
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:17.800
but we know that this is a disease that threatens people with underlying

102
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.410
and severe morbidities and

103
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.410
who are much older. So is it, doesn't it make sense to target quarantine?

104
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:29.800
Can't we quarantine people who are like, say 70 and over logic.

105
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.263
<v 2>No, no, none of that. But.</v>

106
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.550
<v 3>We're dealing with dealing with ideology. I'm sorry. And I, I I'm amazed.</v>

107
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:38.170
And I think that you want to hear what I think.

108
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.010
I think even people like the CNN and Garcetti and his people,

109
00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:44.770
I think they're really interested in restructuring society. Yes.

110
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.000
<v 2>I think I didn't get drop out at all costs. I think it's about power Russia.</v>

111
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.670
They're going you is what we've been trying to do this whole time. Coming out,

112
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.510
you guys are doing it. Oh dude. In Russia, they're loving it. When you,

113
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.610
how do you, how do you think they want restructure?

114
00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.520
Like if you were just guessing. Well, I, I.

115
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.880
<v 3>What I think is this. So, so when you keep an economy shut down long enough,</v>

116
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.110
you have to look at this $3 trillion stimulus package.

117
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.180
That's that's 3000 billion dollars, $3,000 do that.

118
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.530
Yeah. But it's important to know.

119
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.670
<v 2>How big that is. Okay. A lot of money. It's $3 trillion.</v>

120
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.570
<v 3>And it, what happens with government,</v>

121
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.570
when what you're doing is really essentially spending your way,

122
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:29.840
trying to spend your way out of a problem. What that really means though,

123
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:33.740
is government has to take over these aspects of the economy in your lives that

124
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:36.800
they didn't before. And I think this is about power.

125
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:39.920
I think this is about the expansion. And I really do.

126
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.240
<v 2>City's quote, we talked about on the way up here, but they should see it.</v>

127
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.060
Garcia had a quote that we have to wear masks.

128
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.730
And if we do the right thing to wear masks,

129
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.560
we'll get back some of our freedoms. Yeah. That's one man, but just fun.

130
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.720
But imagine saying it that way, get back some of our freedoms,

131
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:02.120
like you can't take away freedoms. We can.

132
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.230
<v 3>Reconstitution.</v>

133
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.220
<v 2>Like this. It's simple. Mayor Garcetti orders,</v>

134
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.650
Angelenos to wear masks whenever leaving home.

135
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.080
<v 3>W we can recall him. You just need you.</v>

136
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.560
I think you need 330,000 signatures petition. Let's do.

137
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.520
<v 1>It. Let's get together. And we call him, call the man.</v>

138
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.363
<v 3>Down.</v>

139
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.310
<v 2>And am. I don't think, I don't think they know that.</v>

140
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.970
I don't think they know how to let go of power. And I think,

141
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.860
I think this is not the same argument that we had two months ago when we entered

142
00:07:30.861 --> 00:07:31.550
into this,

143
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:36.350
that argument was we have to stop this thing because it kills a giant percentage

144
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:38.900
of the population is going to run through us 33 million.

145
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.733
<v 1>Remember that gen.</v>

146
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.670
<v 2>And 30 turns out, look, it's horrible if you get it. But if,</v>

147
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.340
if you get it for the most part,

148
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.120
you're probably going to be asymptomatic or are not going to have bad symptoms.

149
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.950
It doesn't take it. But the problem is, it sounds callous to say that, right?

150
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:58.730
Because that, what about someone who lost someone who had it all the time from.

151
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.800
<v 1>The flu or hardest.</v>

152
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.190
<v 3>To make them make motorcycles?</v>

153
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.320
<v 1>Check this [inaudible] question. Brooke Callan.</v>

154
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.020
Let me ask you a question. What would you rather have

155
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.500
someone give your whole family COVID or that same person get

156
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:17.750
drunk and Ram their car into your whole family?

157
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.500
<v 3>I'd rather have them give the COVID because the death rate between zero and 18</v>

158
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:22.760
COVID.

159
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.400
<v 1>Or a drunk driver crashing into your entire funnel,</v>

160
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.700
I will lick everybody's face in this room. Right? Same thing. Obvious question,

161
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:29.534
right? Yeah.

162
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:34.070
<v 2>It's an option. It's almost a question that everybody's like, come on. Exactly.</v>

163
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.580
How many, think about how many car accidents there are every year.

164
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.380
Think about how easy it is,

165
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:43.310
how easy it would be for someone to make a mistake and kill people,

166
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:45.650
doing a number of things that we do all the time.

167
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.930
<v 1>All the time happens all the time. Imagine,</v>

168
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.570
imagine we chalk it up as the price for driving.

169
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:52.543
<v 2>Diseases. Think.</v>

170
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.480
<v 1>About this. You know, they could,</v>

171
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.000
you know how they could destroy the legalization of marijuana right now.

172
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.820
You know how they could do it easy. This is how they do it. They can say, no,

173
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.540
they could destroy it. They can make weed illegal right now,

174
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.300
all they gotta do is say it.

175
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.010
Start doing what they're doing with the coal forging, the coal,

176
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.560
the death certificates, anybody that dies, anybody that crashes with, uh,

177
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.190
anybody that dies from a drunk driving accident, just put marijuana accident,

178
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.810
call the DW BBQ, drunk or driving while barbecued,

179
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.703
no matter right.

180
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.560
<v 3>There to do that. Hold.</v>

181
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.200
<v 1>On, hold on. And then, and then every night, every night,</v>

182
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:30.270
when you turn on the news, you put on the death,

183
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:33.480
count of all the people that are dying of marijuana, driving deaths,

184
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:38.400
and then start looking at putting footage of all these car wrecks that are going

185
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.770
all the time. We never see them. Okay. Here.

186
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.430
<v 3>Yes. And so let's, let's go on. But I think this disconnect,</v>

187
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:45.690
I also think there's a disconnect,

188
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.200
but with a lot of journalists and a lot of politicians,

189
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.660
there's a major disconnect between them and everyday Americans who have to make

190
00:09:54.661 --> 00:09:58.710
a business work. Right? So if you had Paul Krugman, who is a Nobel prize,

191
00:09:58.711 --> 00:10:03.120
winning economist, who is a regular op-ed contributor to the New York times,

192
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.860
he wrote the most condescending article.

193
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.200
He's never had a real job in my opinion, but that's a different story.

194
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.250
But Paul Clifford, he's writing for the New York times.

195
00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:13.770
He's got a he's he's always been incredibly left-wing.

196
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.440
There's a difference though. He's he's good at talking and writing

197
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.200
[inaudible] Tesla's hours are just.

198
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.230
<v 1>One of the Elon Musk hits be careful.</v>

199
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.860
<v 3>Powers of cage fights. Why don't we go? Why don't we, what am I watching?</v>

200
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.030
I got so high from this. This is a blunt.

201
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:41.280
[inaudible] Let me finish the thought was this I do though.

202
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.990
He said that right-wingers,

203
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.530
he'd lumped a whole group of people called right-wingers into one thing, right?

204
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.140
And he said, right,

205
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:53.160
wingers are coming up with these conspiracies and are against the lockdown

206
00:10:53.161 --> 00:10:56.970
because they care about the Dow Jones. And that's what he,

207
00:10:56.971 --> 00:10:59.610
and that's how he categorized everybody who was against the Dow Jones.

208
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.720
I bet the shutdown in our family instead about getting families, people who,

209
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.880
who have spent their lifetime building a business,

210
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:10.200
and it's going under and may not come back or somebody who has spent all their

211
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:12.870
time building a brand and relies on that.

212
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.470
And so there's never any consideration for that because those people have never

213
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:18.600
done that. And when you've never done that, you don't know what it's is.

214
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.150
<v 1>I think they're doing it. They want to destroy the economy.</v>

215
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:22.410
I think they're doing it on purpose.

216
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.750
I think that's the whole purpose of this to get Trump out.

217
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.880
<v 3>Exactly. I'm never this cynical.</v>

218
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.300
I'm never this conspiratorial trying to destroy him because the first time in my

219
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:33.300
life where I'm thinking to myself, that's the price. These people might be.

220
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.830
<v 1>As he's been right about the whole Trump stuff, all that, the Russian.</v>

221
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:42.450
<v 3>Let's be real careful about drawing conclusions about why that's</v>

222
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.640
[inaudible] Hold on a second. It's a good point. But this is really important.

223
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:51.720
It's just a natural part of human nature to not want to relinquish power.

224
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.220
The founding fathers knew that founding fathers knew that,

225
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.120
which is why you don't have executive overreach,

226
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.010
which is why it can be challenged in the courts.

227
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:05.170
<v 2>Is why it has to be, it is a natural human behavior. [inaudible].</v>

228
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.270
<v 0>I do too. That's that cop who lost his job?</v>

229
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:09.010
Was it Greg Anderson and Greg Henderson,

230
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:12.850
whatever the dude in Washington who was like this ain't right, man. Exactly.

231
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.210
And then lost his job. He he's like, we technically can't do this.

232
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.800
It's against the constitution.

233
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.650
<v 2>Whoever that guy is, find out who that guy is. I'm pretty sure.</v>

234
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:24.340
<v 0>It's Greg Anderson check check, man. He's a BJJ black.</v>

235
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:26.890
He's a black belt and he's a special forces guy. Yeah.

236
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.593
<v 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

237
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.790
I'll never be happy because I'm not built like this guy.

238
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.340
<v 0>About Anderson. I'm sorry about with, about Anders. Well,</v>

239
00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:40.520
he also played linebacker at Alabama. You. Okay. So you're starting linebacker.

240
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.860
<v 2>Stronger, a little more powerful than I, oh, he's a monster.</v>

241
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:50.080
<v 0>Two and eight power, but Jocko's a beast too. It's such a good fight.</v>

242
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.120
This is written all over it. Yeah.

243
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.490
<v 2>Jocko's a very good striker.</v>

244
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.160
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

245
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.260
<v 2>Fun to watch. And Anders is so tough, dude. When he fought Cleal Rountree round,</v>

246
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:02.500
she was lightening his legs up and he never even flinched.

247
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.300
<v 0>Anders, starting linebacker, USA, Alabama. And I'm going to try football.</v>

248
00:13:07.301 --> 00:13:10.720
And he said, I'm going to try fighting. And he's been playing that long,

249
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.260
starting linebacker for the national championship, Alabama.

250
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.910
<v 2>And here's the thing, you know how,</v>

251
00:13:15.911 --> 00:13:19.120
like when you see like 18 year old kids in jujitsu,

252
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.920
like they get good really quick. It's kind of scary. You know, like,

253
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:28.390
I don't know what it is about people when they get older where it doesn't work

254
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.720
like that. And I think it's not just physical thing.

255
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.930
I think it's also like a resources thing.

256
00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.990
You don't have the resources to think about it all the time.

257
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.960
You don't have the resource to be obsessed with like, yeah.

258
00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:44.350
18 year old kid is still lives at home. Can try to be the world's best boxer.

259
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.940
You know? And you're running up hill.

260
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.950
<v 0>On a bed at night. They live in it.</v>

261
00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.870
<v 2>Living it and they get good quick.</v>

262
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.900
<v 3>Man. And his body doesn't get hurt. He recovers faster.</v>

263
00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.123
<v 2>Back.</v>

264
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.530
<v 0>People. You know, people want to on Greg Hardy.</v>

265
00:13:56.531 --> 00:14:00.400
He hasn't been fighting that long and he's in the UFC and has like eight fights

266
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.080
and he's won most of them. And how.

267
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:07.120
<v 2>He fought Volkov, right. Vocal with one arm, Bella. Yeah. his arm up.</v>

268
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.720
He built vocal. It was the Bella tour, heavyweight champ.

269
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.280
And before he fought Derek Lewis,

270
00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:15.250
a lot of people thought he might be the dark horse of the division hundred.

271
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.180
<v 0>Percent tall.</v>

272
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.920
<v 2>Why didn't he stop? Fabricio.</v>

273
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.850
<v 0>Derek Lewis too, until the very end.</v>

274
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.810
<v 2>Nice Louis. He's absolutely one of the most entertaining guys ever.</v>

275
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.860
Cause you never know.
