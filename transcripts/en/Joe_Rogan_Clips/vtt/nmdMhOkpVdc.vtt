00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>Well go full screen with that. Jesus Christ. Smoking causes blindness</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.300
blind, smoking causes throat and mouth cancer brand.

3
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.710
<v 1>It's see bread and in the same font. Wow. My God.</v>

4
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:15.910
It's so hilarious. Do I laugh? So.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.620
<v 0>It doesn't work dead. It doesn't keep people from buying that's what.</v>

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.510
<v 1>And then, I mean, imagine that imagine picking up a new pack,</v>

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.710
everything that.

8
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.450
<v 0>Is so bizarre.</v>

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.530
<v 1>They did, they got straight up, they got dead babies, they got.</v>

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.190
<v 0>Five clauses, emphysema, grandma.</v>

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.280
<v 1>Every single one of them is so.</v>

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.640
<v 0>Yeah, I've never seen that. I've seen, um,</v>

13
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.600
in England they have a big picture of like people that have, you know,

14
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:46.950
like lung cancer and on the cover. And it says smoking will kill you,

15
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.993
but they don't have this.

16
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.130
What the it's causes peripheral vascular disease and makes your feet

17
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.270
rot gangrene.

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.280
<v 1>Th th th the most tame picture I saw on a pack of cigarettes was, um,</v>

19
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.960
it was a picture of a toilet with blood in the water.

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.510
And I forget what, what the point was on that one,

21
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:08.610
but cigarettes make your asphalt bleed.

22
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.140
<v 0>Isn't that crazy? That that doesn't even work like you you're selling someone,</v>

23
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.900
something that you're showing them all the terrible that he could do.

24
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.090
And everybody's like, yeah, worth it. Right.

25
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.740
<v 1>I know. I used to be convinced. I remember Dr. Drew,</v>

26
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.750
Dr. Judy used to pester me to try to get me on that celebrity rehab show before

27
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.950
I was sober. And he had another project, which was trying to,

28
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.040
uh, it was focusing on getting people to quit smoking cigarettes.

29
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.070
We used smoking at the time I smoked for 17 years.

30
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:42.900
I started smoking when I was 16 and stopped when I was 33. Whoa.

31
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.910
Yeah. 17 years. I.

32
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.060
<v 0>Do you feel any ill effects of it now? 43?</v>

33
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.810
<v 1>Uh, almost 43 and cardio. I think it's pretty good. What up?</v>

34
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.740
My cardio was all that nitrous oxide, dude. I. I'm a dude.

35
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.560
I went and I went through those whippet cartridges.

36
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.840
There's 24 per box and there's 25 boxes per case.

37
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.240
So per case there's 600 cartridges.

38
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.860
And it was not unusual for me to go through 600 in like 24 hours,

39
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:15.150
24 to 36 hours.

40
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.880
I went and I took every measure to try to limit like

41
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.740
the air that went into my lungs to try to make it

42
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:29.430
like all nitrous oxide. Like I was the whole time holding it.

43
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:33.660
I'm holding in a long flow of that. And I'm just with my camp,

44
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.460
the canister from Starbucks and.

45
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.160
I was like a wizard at like loading up six and two while holding the last

46
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.200
ones. You know? And dear that was when all the, all the crazy would go down.

47
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.160
Cause that would be like awake on cocaine for three days and inhaling nothing

48
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:55.110
but nitrous oxides. And at that point is when starts popping off and people,

49
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.513
people are,

50
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.950
people are walking around my apartment who are never physically there.

51
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.870
<v 0>I watch.</v>

52
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.720
<v 1>CNN about. Oh dude, like actual people, man.</v>

53
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:08.080
I watched a dude walk through my apartment and pick up,

54
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.970
pick up my bong and take a hit and blow out smoke and then like put it down.

55
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:17.890
And the dude walked through the wall. He was never there ever. I had

56
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.650
No idea. I had like tactile hallucinations.

57
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:27.820
I had feel things big time, dude, because here's like,

58
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.540
here's my whole thing. And, and I kind of still believe this to this day is,

59
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.510
you know, that like our little, our little,

60
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:38.980
a three dimensional experience is, is very small,

61
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.350
small part of what's going on in the universe. Right?

62
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.030
There's there's dimensions. There's, you know, all frequencies, everything.

63
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.770
And that like that. If you do enough drugs like, um,

64
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.760
that the barriers between these different compartments of the universe and

65
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.850
becoming eroded somehow, you know, like I started hearing voices and,

66
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.160
and to an extent, I believe still that that was real, like a,

67
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.920
these spirits that were talking to me, I'm hearing the voices.

68
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.600
<v 0>I had a conversation with a friend of mine who sells weed about a very similar</v>

69
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:15.190
thing where I was saying that I think that something happens when you,

70
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.070
when you smoke pot, it's not just that you get high,

71
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.780
but that the way you interface with the world changes and then the world changes

72
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:24.130
because of that. Not,

73
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.800
not the world changes like a world change for you or for him,

74
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.540
but the world that I'm experiencing.

75
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.780
<v 1>Different. Yeah. Like in the quantum physics kind of sense. I don't.</v>

76
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.040
<v 0>Know. I'm too stupid for that.</v>

77
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.230
But what I'm saying is that my feeling about the world is that when you,

78
00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.990
when you change the way your brain works,

79
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.900
which is essentially what you do when you get really high and he changed the way

80
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:47.830
you think about the world. I think the world that you experience is different.

81
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.270
Sure. It's like, you know,

82
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.630
like people think like this is a very simplistic way of looking at it,

83
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.990
but it's sort of parallel. You know, some people think, oh, the world sucks.

84
00:04:55.991 --> 00:04:58.360
Everything sucks. And their life always sucks.

85
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.540
And then there's people that are always super positive and super happy and their

86
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:06.400
life is always happening. There's something about when you get like really high,

87
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.380
especially marijuana, because marijuana is a sensitivity drug.

88
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.780
It's almost like the opposite of a lot of drugs.

89
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.120
Cause a lot of drugs make you insensitive. Like alcohol makes you blunt, right?

90
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:22.630
You, you're not aware of people looking at you. You don't give a. You're like,

91
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:26.080
whoa, you get drunk. You get her loud and you're crazier. And your,

92
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:28.300
your social cues get skewed.

93
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.600
You don't see marijuana is the opposite marijuana.

94
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:35.140
You get like really aware of other people.

95
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.470
People will call it paranoid because you start thinking about all these

96
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.680
possibilities that you never thought of before.

97
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.700
But I feel like the way you interface with the world becomes very different.

98
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:48.010
You're aware of all these different possibilities.

99
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.490
You start thinking about things that you up when you were in high school.

100
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.390
You know, you start.

101
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.520
<v 1>Thinking of mushrooms are the worst for that. Oh yeah.</v>

102
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.240
<v 0>Oh sure.</v>

103
00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.050
<v 1>Yeah. I made a mistake make you accountable. I get so introspective.</v>

104
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.130
I mean, I've, it's been forever, too introspective. I got, I got two interests.

105
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.470
<v 0>How to like, just.</v>

106
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.250
<v 1>Start picking myself apart. Like, uh, and you know,</v>

107
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.160
putting myself on trial in a sense right now, like, uh,

108
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.660
just too introspective or I've just like determined that I just suck, you know?

109
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.970
<v 0>Well maybe that's just a perspective.</v>

110
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.080
Like I think the introspective aspect of it, one of the reasons why it comes up,

111
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.890
it feels like to me is because there's a bunch of about yourself that you don't

112
00:06:27.891 --> 00:06:31.220
like, but you don't address. Right. And so then if it forces you, Hey,

113
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.330
in order to truly live in the moment you have to be balanced,

114
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.100
you have to be like, I've looked at it all.

115
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.800
And I understand I've made mistakes and here's where I'm at.

116
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.800
But if you've never looked at yourself, if you never looked at those mistakes,

117
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.000
then you, you should have like this backlog of you have to deal with.

118
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.780
<v 1>And I agree with that. Do you understand? I know, I agree with that.</v>

119
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:55.520
Except when it becomes just a morbid, flogging of oneself,

120
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.070
right? Oh yeah. Which is, which is what, which is what.

121
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.000
<v 0>But I feel like that morbid flogging of yourself comes from you. Like the,</v>

122
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.860
the debt analogy is a good analogy because if you're in like massive debt and

123
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:09.440
you go to spend money, you're like, oh, this is, I don't even have any money.

124
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:12.410
How am I spending this money? Whereas if you're even,

125
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.780
and you go to spend the money, you're like no big deal.

126
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.730
I'm just spending some money. All right.

127
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.750
I think that when you don't have an accounting of who you are and what you've

128
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:24.380
done, and especially, I think the big one is your effect on other people.

129
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.520
You know, that's the one that comes up with me on mushrooms or on pot,

130
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.210
especially on edibles. It's like how I've interacted with other people.

131
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:36.110
And even if I thought it was justified, uh, and maybe I was justified when,

132
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:39.770
when it comes up on pot, especially on edibles,

133
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.210
the big one for me, at least that's where I feel like the most accountable.

134
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.400
I'm gonna have to think about like my behavior, the most,

135
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.180
I always feel like with the edible thing, it always feels like,

136
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.230
could I have done better instead of just being like, was I okay? Like yeah,

137
00:07:54.231 --> 00:07:58.100
that guy was being a Dick to you. Yeah, him. It's never that. It's always like,

138
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.560
maybe I could have caught on earlier to how he was

139
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:07.520
feeling and Bri assessed how I was communicating with them.

140
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.940
And then instead of being defensive or aggressive, right. I mean,

141
00:08:10.941 --> 00:08:12.050
maybe I could have handled it better.

142
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.560
<v 1>Well, Hey man,</v>

143
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.690
sounds like you're working a great spiritual program with your edibles.

144
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.940
<v 0>Well, I try to do it all the time, but when I'm with edibles,</v>

145
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.310
like I said this before and people are like, oh no,

146
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.280
but I think pop makes you a better person. I really do,

147
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.290
because I think all that responsibility.

148
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.840
<v 1>I wish I wish I could smoke pot, but you know,</v>

149
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:36.080
my pot Don's connected to my Booz bone bones connect.

150
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.290
<v 0>You don't have to write lucky. You didn't, you don't honestly,</v>

151
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:43.370
no one has to do anything. I get as much high and as much, um,

152
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.140
mental clarity from yoga as I do from anything, I really do dope. I mean,

153
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.290
if someone told me I couldn't smoke pot for the rest of my life,

154
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.250
but I could do yoga or I could just smoke pot the rest of my life and not do

155
00:08:56.251 --> 00:09:01.170
yoga. I think I would take the yoga. Wow. I really do, because yoga gives me,

156
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.000
um, I mean, I love the feeling of pot. I really do, but yoga gives me,

157
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.330
um, a relaxation when it's over. Like, uh,

158
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.200
there's a clarity that comes from things that it's like, it's fresh,

159
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.110
like after like post yoga class, those are like the,

160
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.530
that is the friendliest nicest group of people go. Stan,

161
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.410
you want to meet some nice folks? Stand outside of a yoga class,

162
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.580
window yoga classes exiting. You'll meet like the most balanced, nice people.

163
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.970
Cause they drained all the of themselves. Hey,

164
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:33.270
can we hit pause so I can take a leak already? I know

165
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.330
we're not, we're not pausing though.
