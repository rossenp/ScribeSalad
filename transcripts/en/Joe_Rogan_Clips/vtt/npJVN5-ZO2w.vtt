00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, you know, I, a story about,</v>

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.450
I had a teaching tool that had to do with something I pulled off in Hollywood

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.770
for my kids, and I'm big on delayed gratification. Um,

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.290
and you know, after I won the Oscar for best actor, my kids are like, well,

5
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.400
what'd you get the trophy for? I said,

6
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.170
well, you remember a year and a half ago we were in new Orleans.

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.450
Papa would go away. You wake up in the morning.

8
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:34.500
I was already at work and I'd come home and have dinner with y'all and tuck in

9
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.630
and you wake up the next morning I was gone again. And remember, you said,

10
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.870
I looked like a giraffe because I was so skinny and like, yeah. And I go, well,

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.850
what I was doing for those 30 days when I was gone all day a

12
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:48.270
year and a half later, somebody said,

13
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.050
deemed that excellent work. And they gave me a trophy for that work,

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.530
what I did a year and a half ago. And I remember I saw him click.

15
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.390
They were like, oh, oh, our future is a compounding interest.

16
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:03.420
You know what I mean? And ask them, oh, there you can build,

17
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:07.980
you can do something today and get rewarded tomorrow. Um, and it was,

18
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.070
it was an example that worked for them. Um,

19
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.420
and understanding, you know, that you can, you can get,

20
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.960
you can invest and make choices to engineer more ROI.

21
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.300
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I know that was a milestone for you.</v>

22
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:24.760
And obviously you won the Oscar for it,

23
00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:29.220
but there's something about these physical transformation roles. When,

24
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.530
when an actor does something where you realize like, they're,

25
00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:36.700
they're literally torturing themselves. I mean, when you, what did, how,

26
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.100
what did you get down to? How much did you weigh?

27
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.070
<v 0>I weighed 1 35 and look, you know, this, I was not torturing myself.</v>

28
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.970
I was militant. The hardest part is making the choice.

29
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.670
It was my responsibility.

30
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:55.240
If I looked like I do now playing Ron Woodriff in Dallas buyers club,

31
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.630
you are out of the movie, the first frame, all. He doesn't,

32
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.770
he's not staged for HIV, your mouth. What's my job. I had to lose the weight.

33
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.000
Once I made my mind up, I did the smart thing. I gave myself five months.

34
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.660
I got on a diet or I'd have my tapioca pudding or whatever,

35
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.210
three eggs in the egg, whites in the morning, five ounces of fish,

36
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.320
a cup of vegetables for lunch,

37
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.560
five and physical of vegetables for dinner as much wine as I wanted to drink.

38
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.100
And I lost 2.5 pounds a week, like clockwork, no exercise.

39
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.120
<v 1>As much wine as you wanted to drink much as a one. How does,</v>

40
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.700
what kind of diet is this?

41
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.183
<v 0>It worked too,</v>

42
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.690
and it didn't matter if I was going to the treadmill and burning 2000

43
00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:38.800
calories a day or not 2.5 pounds a week clockwork.

44
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.510
And what happened during that time?

45
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.420
And this is another reason that I really didn't torture myself when people say,

46
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.680
oh my gosh, this has been so hard. I was like, no. What I learned from it that,

47
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.660
that the body's more resilient than we give it credit for I,

48
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.730
the power I lost in the neck down equally or more so sublimated to the neck

49
00:02:54.731 --> 00:02:58.840
up, I was, so my mental game was so acute and so on.

50
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.720
I was clinically smart.

51
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.400
It didn't matter if I drank my wine till one in the morning at 4:30 AM,

52
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.510
no alarm clock bang. I was up every morning,

53
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.340
had incredible amount of mental energy. I had no leverage from my neck down.

54
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.670
I mean, my knees, I had no insulation anywhere. You know,

55
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.210
my body would hurt when I try to run 10 feet. But from here up,

56
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.190
there's some things I actually miss about it.

57
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.790
<v 1>What do you think? What, what was the process like?</v>

58
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:30.480
Why did your brain work better when you were starving yourself?

59
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.130
<v 0>I think because it wasn't relying on, I think on a cellular level,</v>

60
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.270
I felt my body going, Hey, these are baseball term.

61
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.750
You got people over there on the bench, in the dugout.

62
00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:46.110
Then you got people out in the field that are, you know, sitting in the, uh,

63
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.710
in the, in the bullpen, not working out on a cellular level,

64
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.140
cellularly my sales and they were in the dugout.

65
00:03:55.141 --> 00:03:58.290
And over there in the bullpen had to get up and go, whoa,

66
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.980
we're not getting fed what we used to get fed. We gotta, we gotta exercise here.

67
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:06.300
We gotta come to hut hut. Um, because the,

68
00:04:06.301 --> 00:04:10.320
my body's not getting, we're not getting what we used to get. Um,

69
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.090
we're not placated by what we used to get our installations gone. Our, our,

70
00:04:15.091 --> 00:04:17.460
what we rely on on is gone, what we used to rely on is gone.

71
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:21.600
So I think my whole body woke up and my brain got really

72
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.850
super, super sharp on that as well.

73
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:27.120
So I think it was the going without the there's a bit of a, um,

74
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.900
it was what I went without that sharpened up and made my brain on a cellular

75
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:31.890
level, much more hungry.

76
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.960
<v 1>W what do you weigh? Normally?</v>

77
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.990
<v 0>180 8. Jesus.</v>

78
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.140
<v 1>Christ. So you lost 50 pounds. Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.860
There's roles where guys do this,

80
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.220
where it defines their career in some way, Robert de Niro,

81
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:51.210
when he gained weight for raging bull, uh, Christian bale, when he did, uh,

82
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:53.760
the machinist. Yeah. Yeah. Th there's these,

83
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.410
these roles where a guy or a woman just transform Charlise

84
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.400
neuron. When she played monster, they, they transform their body.

85
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:06.540
And this it's like, it's a different level of commitment.

86
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.730
And when you entered into that film,

87
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.800
it was this the first time that you'd ever had to do that.

88
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.200
<v 0>Yeah. First time I ever had to do it.</v>

89
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.840
<v 1>I mean, you, you got jacked for that. Uh, well,</v>

90
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.840
I don't know how Jack do you wear before for that dragon movie? I'm sorry.

91
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:22.340
I forget the name of rain and fire. I love that movie.

92
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.090
<v 0>That was my favorite and God, I miss fans. And it was a great movie.</v>

93
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.590
Talk about a guy who was about no. Well, that was a sobering character. I,

94
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:32.820
I miss that guy. Yeah.

95
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.400
<v 1>It was a fun character. But you were jacked in that movie.</v>

96
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.890
Were you Jack normally, or did you have to get Jack for that movie?

97
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.530
<v 0>I got more jacked for that logo, our family, my dad, we, we come from a, um,</v>

98
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.700
our anatomy and the McConnell Hayes had big tricep. My dad,

99
00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.120
you see your loved it. I'd be sitting there as a kid. Um,

100
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.800
and my dad was a big guy, 6, 4, 2 65, played Kentucky in a bear.

101
00:05:55.801 --> 00:05:58.850
Bryant got drafted by the green Packers. He was a big bear of a man.

102
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.640
And he comes in the living room one night and I'm in front of the TV watching my

103
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.740
favorite show, incredible Hawk. And there's correct.

104
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.420
And I'm like standing in front of the TV, doing all this. He goes more,

105
00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:09.530
what you doing? I was like, dad, look at it, man. I mean,

106
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:13.880
it's got these baseball sized biceps, look at him. Wow. And he goes, ah,

107
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.920
he takes off his shirt and he goes, let me tell you something, son.

108
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.270
He goes that right there and pull the bus up. He goes, that's nice.

109
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.190
Makes the girl scream. You know, it's for show.

110
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.290
He goes that right there he goes, that's the work muscle.

111
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.430
That's the one that puts the roof over our head as for dough

112
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.050
showing dough, the tie steps for dough. So I had big triceps.

113
00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:49.380
So when I went and worked out and if I take a little bit of creatine,

114
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.280
my triceps go bananas.

115
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.630
<v 1>So that was a minor transformation. It wasn't that difficult.</v>

116
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.370
<v 0>No, I would do. It was, it was minor. It was a lot, a lot of boxing. And, uh,</v>

117
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.600
um, and, and, and just some nice, you know, throwing some weight around.

118
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.350
<v 1>You just got fit, but for Dallas buyers club.</v>

119
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.180
<v 0>Yeah. Well,</v>

120
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:13.420
I tried to stay within 10 pounds of striking way to whatever I need to do for

121
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:14.254
the role.

122
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.460
<v 1>W was it hard to make the decision to do that for Dallas buyers club though?</v>

123
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:21.070
Because that was a giant transformation. I mean.

124
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.700
<v 0>It, wasn't hard. I was looking for something to be all consumed with something,</v>

125
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.690
to be obsessed with a singular obsession. This is my job.

126
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:36.040
So my life revolved around that my wife made me meals chose me.

127
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:40.180
I didn't go to pizza hut and say, no, thank you. The pizza I'll have the salad.

128
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.290
I did not even put myself in front of temptations. I, I was a hermit.

129
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.090
I stayed in my,

130
00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:51.040
my wife made me the meals and I studied and wrote and created the character

131
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.940
all day long. And I'd never got tired of that. So my world was,

132
00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:55.601
I was in a bubble.

133
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:59.890
I just put myself in a bubble for five and a half months and that commitment to

134
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:04.690
put myself on that island to know that this is it's good to have this singular

135
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:09.520
obsession. You, you cannot go far enough McConaughey. That was,

136
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.340
there's a freedom in that. There's a freedom. I've always found them being,

137
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.830
having, having a character that can commit that much to.

138
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.600
<v 1>Can not go far enough though. That was your thought process.</v>

139
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:24.570
<v 0>Yeah. I knew when I got down to 1 35, I was like, whoa, okay, that's good.</v>

140
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.020
And mind you, I will tell you this. When I started to eat more at 1 35 to say,

141
00:08:28.021 --> 00:08:30.180
let's slow this train down and quit losing weight.

142
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.020
My body had already got the message and had its blinders on that were going

143
00:08:34.021 --> 00:08:35.670
south and it kept going south.

144
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.110
So that was a bit scary because I kept losing the way because my body had gotten

145
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.830
it already gotten in the, in the rhythm of losing weight. And like I said,

146
00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:45.690
it turned a blind eye on getting any more food.

147
00:08:45.691 --> 00:08:49.560
So there was a tough transition there for about two weeks to get my weight,

148
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:53.070
to balance out again and say, let's just hold at 1 35. So.

149
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.500
<v 1>You dropped below 1 35 at one in time.</v>

150
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 0>Just went below with 1 35, got down about 1 32, and then brought it back up.</v>

151
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.020
<v 1>Now,</v>

152
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.600
how long did it take for you to physically recover from something like that,

153
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.130
where you're back to normal.

154
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.950
<v 0>And I'm still recovering really?</v>

155
00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.260
<v 1>Cause I thought that I thought that when I saw you in that film, I told my wife,</v>

156
00:09:15.261 --> 00:09:16.130
I remember saying this, like,

157
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.360
this is going to take a long time for him to bounce back because I know how hard

158
00:09:20.361 --> 00:09:22.280
it is for guys to cut weight for fights.

159
00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.090
And I know a lot of guys that have really depleted their body doing that.

160
00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:30.800
And when I saw you that God and skinny, I was like, he's eating his body.

161
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:34.040
Your body ate itself. Music is the only way.

162
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.720
<v 0>Yeah, I look, I came back and I did true detective after that.</v>

163
00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:41.540
And I got on true detective. I got to about 1 67 and held,

164
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.550
and I loved that weight as well.

165
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.220
Cause I had a little more leverage at a little more athletic ability.

166
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:48.080
I have more insulation around my joint,

167
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:50.750
but I was still pretty stripped and ripped.

168
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.650
I'm slowly coming back from that. I did learn this.

169
00:09:54.651 --> 00:09:58.820
I had to come back very slowly cause I had heard stories about people that go,

170
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.710
well, now I'm back now, I'm going to gain weight.

171
00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:02.980
I can eat as much as I want and that you can,

172
00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:06.800
you can grow back and look deformed. You can, your features can come back.

173
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.990
If you rush it, they can come back in odd ways.

174
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.140
So I very slowly put the weight back on.

175
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.010
I then did a role a few years ago,

176
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.790
I guess it was about 4, 3, 3 years after that was fired though,

177
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.890
where I put on 47 pounds. So I was two 20. What was that?

178
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.960
A lot more gold. It's called gold.

179
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.900
Just a hell of a lot more fun to put that weight on and to take it off where I

180
00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:32.180
was just cheeseburger king. Um,

181
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.530
and my family loved me in that role cause I was captain fun. I was yes.

182
00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:41.240
To everything milkshake for breakfast. You got it. Let's go. Now. That was,

183
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.930
I've never talked about at that time. I was still mentally sharp,

184
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.270
not as sharp as I was when I was down at 1 35,

185
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:52.580
but at two 20 libido was through the roof.

186
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.740
I couldn't get, I couldn't catch a cold.

187
00:10:54.741 --> 00:10:58.040
If I swam in the canals of Amsterdam man,

188
00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:02.180
I was like the abominable snowman. I was insulated, um,

189
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.620
and had great energy. Um, during that time now coming back from that,

190
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.500
I still got a couple of things on my back here around the waist. I'm like,

191
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:10.520
where'd that come by?

192
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.190
That that came up with that role in gold and it what's that still doing,

193
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:15.980
hanging around. Um, you know,

194
00:11:15.981 --> 00:11:20.480
so I did have to come back slowly. Um,

195
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.100
but I will say this, you know, 180 8

196
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.880
since then. That's my fight. And wait,

197
00:11:28.881 --> 00:11:33.110
before I look a little different than the 180 8 before then,

198
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.890
before Dallas buyers club, it's a different one, ADA. So.

199
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.660
<v 1>It did take a physical toll.</v>

200
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.920
<v 0>Sure. I would say, you know, even, you know,</v>

201
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.140
neck and things like that, you know, neck and, and you know,

202
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:50.000
bone structure is the same, but where,

203
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.860
and now how much of this is just getting older too and having less bad sales.

204
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:58.540
I'm not sure. Um, but yeah, it, it, it didn't hurt.

205
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.140
Like I said, I think I stretched my body. I noticed when, you know,

206
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.630
when I got down to that weight at 1 35, if I tried to sprint 10,

207
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:11.620
10 yards and I just, my knees would buckle. I had no insulation. My knees hurt.

208
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.790
<v 1>Yeah. I watched it again recently just to kind of get it into my head.</v>

209
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.870
And that's what I was thinking like,

210
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.690
this is going to take a while to bounce back from like,

211
00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:22.740
I almost forgot how gaunt you got it. It was,

212
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.450
it was striking episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free

213
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.550
on Spotify. That's right.

214
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.700
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

215
00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:33.840
They're going to be available everywhere,

216
00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:37.440
but after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

217
00:12:37.441 --> 00:12:41.460
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

218
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.530
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

219
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:47.640
Buh-bye.
