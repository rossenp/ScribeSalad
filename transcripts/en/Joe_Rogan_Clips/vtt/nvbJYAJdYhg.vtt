00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Tell me about your new movie. Let's leave it at that.</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 1>Um, it's called motherless Brooklyn.</v>

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.750
Uh it's. It was, you know,

4
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:17.640
it was kind of a big swing cause I wrote it and I produced it and this

5
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:22.260
is the first time you've done that. Directed it. Um, I know I,

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.000
I produced and directed the,

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.320
the first movie I directed is keeping the faith with it's. Um,

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.180
it's me and Ben Stiller play a rabbi and a priest who were best friends and

9
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.170
they, and they both fall for the same girl. Did you ever see that one? No,

10
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.680
it didn't. It's funny. Yeah, you'd like it. Um, Ben is hilarious and it, uh,

11
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.060
that was obviously later, um, that was a later, uh,

12
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.280
kinda movie, but it was an, um,

13
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.150
I've lived in New York there almost 30 years and I like making movies in New

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.570
York a lot. That was pretty light when this one is more, um,

15
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.220
this takes place in the fifties, in New York and it's kind of, um,

16
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.950
it's got to Chinatown at lake confidential, kind of a noir, um,

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.220
bent to it. It's a, it's a mystery,

18
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:13.080
a murder mystery of kind of that leads into some of the stuff that happened in

19
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.960
New York in the fifties. That is hard to believe. Um,

20
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.790
because New York was New York was run by, um,

21
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.390
an, uh, it was run by basically a Darth Vader,

22
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.350
like figure who was never elected to public office. And Pete, excuse me,

23
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:31.410
people thought he was the parks commissioner of New York,

24
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.850
but he was for N from 1930 to 1968.

25
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.830
He had uncontested authoritarian power over New York city in New York state.

26
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:44.730
And he made every significant decision about the way that the modern

27
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.550
infrastructure of New York was built, where the roads went,

28
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:51.420
where the bridges were built, what was torn down, where the projects were built.

29
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.920
He, um,

30
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.420
and he was very racist and he baked like really

31
00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:00.300
discriminatory things that almost sound like conspiracy theory.

32
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:03.750
They're so wild and intense into the decisions he made.

33
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.640
He was responsible for the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn and going to LA.

34
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.240
And nobody knows this. Like you think of New York is the great,

35
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.570
that's like the great egalitarian melting pot city where democracy works,

36
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.820
except that it was run by a total autocrat for 38 years. Yeah. For,

37
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:23.040
for he he's largely,

38
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.140
it's broadly accepted that no mayor or governor of New York could do a single

39
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:29.040
thing without his say.

40
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:33.420
So from basically about 1930 to about 1968,

41
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.350
how.

42
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.260
<v 0>Is that even possible? And how come no one knows about this. How did you.</v>

43
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.990
<v 1>Find that? Well, people do there's, there's, there's huge.</v>

44
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.010
Like in one of the big, um, burns brothers, documentaries about New York,

45
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:47.190
there's a whole, literally, almost a whole episode on him. Um,

46
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.720
there's a great book about him, uh, that won the Pulitzer prize and there's, uh,

47
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.990
his name was Robert Moses and he, you know,

48
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.090
there's Robert Moses state beach in New York. And,

49
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.370
but literally people think he was the parks commissioner, but he was,

50
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.750
and he was like, can Skywalker. I, he, he was like a Jedi Knight.

51
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.010
He was a big liberal,

52
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.300
progressive believer in progressive change and government reform.

53
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.250
And in his early years he got crushed by Tammany hall and,

54
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.320
and the power brokers. And he went, he went, dark, went completely. Yeah.

55
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.260
That's not the most imposing picture of him that you've got up.

56
00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.094
There's other ones.

57
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.400
That's one of the ones of him find one of the ones of him standing in front of

58
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:28.150
his models.

59
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.350
There's famous ones of him that looks like a man actually to the left of that.

60
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.930
And keep going to the left of that. Um,

61
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.800
cause there's a scene in our movie where Alec Baldwin is literally like that.

62
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.480
Yeah. That Alec Baldwin plays a character. Who's based on him,

63
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.870
inspired by him. I should say. It's not at all in my film.

64
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:51.370
It's not the true story, but yeah, there you go. Um, and um,

65
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.010
but I think this idea, I was really interested in this idea, you know,

66
00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:01.840
what's great about Chinatown as a film is, um, it's mostly sexy.

67
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.960
The, you, you don't know what the hell is going on in that movie.

68
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.140
Like until the, until 20 minutes before the end,

69
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.990
you have absolutely no idea really what's going on in that movie.

70
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.100
But it's just sexy. It's like the music is amazing.

71
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.020
The photography's incredible.

72
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.070
The other actors are like adult and real and he's he's Nicholson, right?

73
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.980
The hook is like, Nicholson is so cool. You really will kind of follow him.

74
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.400
You'll watch the way he deals with anything. And just,

75
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:34.990
you're just laughing and enjoying it. Right. But underneath it all,

76
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:39.090
when you're done, you go, did that, is that true?

77
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.000
Did LA is LA basically built on stolen water?

78
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.010
Is that like the like LA is original sin is that people

79
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:48.880
made fortunes,

80
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:53.200
the valley was just farms and they stole the water from up north and, you know,

81
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:57.610
rig the game and made these gigantic fortunes by irrigating San Fernando valley.

82
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:01.960
And you, you, you come away with like,

83
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.830
you come away with an awareness that like the California,

84
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.980
story's not exactly what it's cracked up to be. Right. It's,

85
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.580
there's some big crimes underneath it. And, and the people who, and,

86
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:18.130
and that in that movie, it's like, yeah, the people ripped everybody off.

87
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.380
They fake droughts. They,

88
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.010
they created fortune cells and the type of people who did that also raped their

89
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:28.930
daughters. Literally. That's like what that movie is about. It's um, and it,

90
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.050
and it's pretty bleak. It's like, you can't make a difference.

91
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.090
You cannot change anything like any,

92
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:38.050
if you try the person you're trying to help is going to end up with a bullet

93
00:05:38.051 --> 00:05:40.150
through her eye, dead on the steering wheel. Like it's,

94
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.990
it's a really dark movie and people forget that. Cause you just, oh,

95
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.630
Nicholson fade Dunaway. It's like, nah, that's a, that's a really,

96
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:51.400
really bleak movie. But I love, I love the idea that,

97
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.280
that you can do things where like the F the pleasure of it

98
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:00.800
is like the pleasure of movies it's grown up.

99
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.930
It's kind of what we've been talking about. It's like,

100
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.550
like if you said to most people, if you showed Chinatown and most critics today,

101
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:12.380
they'd go long, boring, whatever. It's like, you want to say, off, like,

102
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.250
off. Like what, what is it that you w who, why are you,

103
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.350
why are you assuming people can't handle grown up? You know what I mean? And,

104
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.910
and I think that,

105
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.710
that I really dig those things where you go through the movie starts,

106
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:32.180
you look at it and you go, this looks really good. This looks really grown up.

107
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.850
This is big. The actors are like,

108
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.490
like adult and authoritative. The dialogue's great. The music is great.

109
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:43.910
It's hypnotic. And your brain just goes, I don't know what's going on.

110
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:46.130
I don't care. I'm bought in. And then,

111
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.610
and if there's a character in it that you can hook into you float,

112
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.850
you float through those movies, you just kind of go, where's this going?

113
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:56.870
What's going on? Oh, man, that guy who she's great. He's great. Wow.

114
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.330
Like this is just all juicy and great.

115
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.320
And by the end you get somewhere and you kind of go, I'll be damned.

116
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:06.710
That actually was about big things. That those things really happen. You know,

117
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.390
that's, I really dig those movies. I dig Chinatown LA confidential.

118
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.010
Um, I think the godfather works that way. The Godfather's about immigrants.

119
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:20.480
You know, it's about immigrants normalizing in America. You don't,

120
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.230
it's like, that's a long movie. You just settle in for that moment,

121
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.490
your brain settles in and just goes, this just couldn't be better.

122
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.000
I couldn't be happier to be watching this scene after scene,

123
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:35.870
after scene that night. And I wanted to make, I wanted to try,

124
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.340
I wanted to try to make one of those, you know, uh, myself,

125
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.880
like I wanted to try to, to, um,

126
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.530
make one of those, because I don't, it's, it's cliche to say, like,

127
00:07:48.531 --> 00:07:51.920
they don't make those anymore, but it, but I think, you know,

128
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:55.280
they were always hard. It's not like they were easy once and now they're hard.

129
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.380
They're all, they're always hard. But I,

130
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.820
I would look at people like Warren Beatty, he made reds, you know,

131
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.670
which is one of the great movies from that era.

132
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.090
Even like spike Lee doing do the right thing.

133
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.420
I don't know if you remember when that movie hit. It was massive.

134
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:15.140
It was a huge deal to me. I was like 18 or 19. Yeah.

135
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.040
I saw that movie and I was like, he just rewrote the game,

136
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.510
like this kid who the hell is that he wrote it. He directed it. He acted in it.

137
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.190
And he got public enemy to do the music.

138
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.030
It's about his neighborhood in New York, but it's about like race in America.

139
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:30.530
It's like, oh my God,

140
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:35.150
that guy just took like a huge swing and connected on like

141
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.170
every level. And it didn't even give you some BS kind of like,

142
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.780
don't worry. It's going to be okay. In the end,

143
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:47.150
it was like Martin Luther king says violence is not the way Malcolm

144
00:08:47.151 --> 00:08:50.810
X says. Sometimes it's the only rational response. What do you think?

145
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:55.220
You know what I mean? It was so ballsy. It was so ballsy that movie.

146
00:08:55.710 --> 00:09:00.000
And I think like after awhile, it's sorta, like,

147
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.050
I just started feeling like, well, you know, I don't really need to gig.

148
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.350
I might as well. I've worked with a lot of great people.

149
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.750
I've worked with some pretty great directors, including spike.

150
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.870
And I was kind of like that in New York a long time.

151
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:17.340
And I just thought it was really weird. No one knew that story. And I was like,

152
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:19.410
I'm going to try to make one about this, you know,
