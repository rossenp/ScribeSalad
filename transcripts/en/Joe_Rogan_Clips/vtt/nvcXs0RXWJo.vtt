00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.710
<v 2>Like so many things that Terence McKenna said, it's both true and untrue.</v>

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:09.570
I think it's untrue in a literal sense,

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.590
but very true in a poetic sentence because the

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.780
historical cultural context of a drug is part of what you bring to that drug

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.710
experience. The molecule does not contain information.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.580
The ketamine molecule does not bring an experience to you.

8
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:30.510
That is something that is generated in your brain by your consciousness.

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.640
And so w if you have a new substance that has no

10
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.680
cultural associations,

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.460
then maybe it was like that for you don't have expectations,

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.020
don't have expectations. That's.

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.280
<v 0>A big part of it, isn't it?</v>

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.610
<v 1>It's a huge part of them. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,</v>

15
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.230
I made a piece in the new season of my show about, um,

16
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.430
five MEO DMT containing toad venom. Um,

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.820
and there's a big controversy in the toad venom community,

18
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:04.770
which believe it or not is a community and they are

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.140
purists.

20
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.500
<v 0>Are they friends with the OPO files?</v>

21
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.150
<v 1>Oh, definitely not. No, no. They don't like the OPO files.</v>

22
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.750
<v 0>So what is the venom community? Think?</v>

23
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.760
<v 1>They think that this venom has some spiritual component</v>

24
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.890
derive from its association,

25
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:26.310
with the toad that makes it better than synthetic five MEO DMT.

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.680
Now I've analyzed several samples of toad venom and

27
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.250
before five MEO DMT was made illegal in the United States.

28
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.590
And in terms of what you find,

29
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.160
if you inject it into a mass spectrometer five MEO,

30
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.180
DMT is the only psychedelic that's present in some samples.

31
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.150
There might be trace quantities of another psychedelic called Bufo Tinian,

32
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.440
but it's a minuscule amount of a less potent molecule.

33
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.660
So predominantly you have five MEO DMT,

34
00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:59.580
which is likely the strongest naturally occurring serotonergic psychedelic.

35
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.060
And for conservation purposes,

36
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.010
it's necessary that people stop milking toads because it's become too popular.

37
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.060
Mike, Tyson's talking about it all the time I made, I mean,

38
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.560
and it's like, it sounds ridiculous. Like Mike Tyson could have an effect on,

39
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.960
um, conservation,

40
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.970
but if a celebrity says they like something that can have a tangible effect on

41
00:02:23.971 --> 00:02:24.780
the environment.

42
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.720
<v 0>The people who have toads for that very reason,</v>

43
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.060
because Mike Tyson talked about those toads.

44
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.120
Now they have toads and they milked these toads.

45
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.300
<v 1>Oh yeah. I mean, me too. I, I talked to the, uh,</v>

46
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.410
billionaire who flew a private jet full of toads to

47
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.600
Greece to create a private towed sanctuary.

48
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.400
Wow.

49
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.690
<v 0>Wow. How many toads.</v>

50
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.210
<v 1>Does he got the photos? It didn't look like that many.</v>

51
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.380
It didn't look like a jet fuel.

52
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.980
<v 0>Five MEO. DMT does not strike me as something that you'd want to do a lot.</v>

53
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.990
It's so terrifying.

54
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.630
That's probably most terrifying experience I've ever had on psychedelics because

55
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:04.030
I ceased to exist. Like is the,

56
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.830
the one drug where I feel like when I took it, I wasn't there anymore.

57
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.600
I, I was gone until I came back. Like, I,

58
00:03:12.601 --> 00:03:17.340
I felt like I didn't have thoughts. I didn't have, I,

59
00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:17.980
I knew,

60
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.570
I knew I was experiencing the five MEO DMT

61
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.180
realm or whatever it was, but I didn't,

62
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.870
there was no context in terms of, uh,

63
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.640
I didn't realize I'm on my couch sitting at home. Like I was gone, I was gone.

64
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.990
There's no visuals.

65
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.430
It was just this white sort of pixelated,

66
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.200
like grayish, white gone world, you know?

67
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:48.070
And it was terrifying because it felt like death was the one thing that felt the

68
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.390
most like, oh my God, like now, now I don't know.

69
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.960
I'm not here anymore, but coming back from it,

70
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.320
I think it was very valuable. Like, as I was returning,

71
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.020
I remember thinking so much about,

72
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.520
so much about the, the way in which I talk. I remember thinking that like, God,

73
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.450
you're just like so much of the way I would communicate was

74
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:16.660
not just me trying to get my thoughts across,

75
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.760
but me trying to say things in a way that would be impressive or in a way that

76
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.790
would be flowery or, you know,

77
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.490
try to make it look like I was more intelligent than I was or whatever.

78
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.880
But I remember like remembering that like really clear little, like, well,

79
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.860
I kind of clean up the way I talk. So I'm full of. Like thinking that as I was,

80
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.780
as I was trying to figure out how I was going to describe this experience,

81
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.110
I was realizing, as I was thinking like, God,

82
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:47.350
I got to figure out how to describe this. Like, boy, I talk like I'm full of.

83
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.630
Like, so there was value in that. But I did it a few times.

84
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.860
I think I did it three times,

85
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.970
but it was a terrifying every time terrifying,

86
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.960
like while you're gone, like why you slip away? I remember just thinking like,

87
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.220
whoa, this is not good. This is not good. Like, you feel like, oh my God,

88
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.030
I up. Like, I really died. I really,

89
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.970
I really stopped being here. And it also makes you think like, well,

90
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.440
maybe this is going to the light.

91
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.770
Maybe this is what they talk about when they talk about going to the light,

92
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:21.070
when you die, like maybe you're having this kind of experience.

93
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.500
Cause it's really disturbing, but then pretty peaceful when it's over. Like, uh,

94
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.240
it felt pretty good when it came back.

95
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.920
But the concept of giving away all of my control of reality like that,

96
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.910
for some reason, N N DMT doesn't scare me as much.

97
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.860
<v 1>It's a totally different drug. Yeah. Experientially, chemically it's, you know,</v>

98
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.510
Silicon is closer to DMT. Then five MEO,

99
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:49.360
DMT is mushrooms are closer chemically speaking.

100
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.000
And yeah,

101
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.560
I think that it defies description in a different way than other psychedelic

102
00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:58.580
experiences do with something like DMT.

103
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.330
It's difficult to describe because there is such an abundance of imagery and

104
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.980
thoughts and associations that it's extremely difficult to communicate that to

105
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.310
someone with five MEO DMT, there's nothing.

106
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.610
And that's also difficult to communicate that white out.

107
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:15.830
And there is an absence of everything.

108
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.750
<v 0>Completely. Do you find it terrifying?</v>

109
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.400
<v 1>I have found it terrifying. Yes. It's. It's very, I've, you know, I have,</v>

110
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.560
I had a very profound experience with it in 2017 and I have no real

111
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.850
desire to use it again.

112
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.610
<v 0>I'm not going back there.</v>

113
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.050
I'll go back to N N DMT. I'll go back to that.

114
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.400
<v 1>Oh, me too, because it's just a different drug entirely.</v>

115
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.500
And I think that DMT can be integrated into

116
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.680
a normal life, much more easily than five MEO DMT. Actually,

117
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.810
I credit DMT with like sort of,

118
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.320
I talked about the sort of COVID denial that I had at the beginning of the

119
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:57.830
pandemic where I was, you know, I can't stop making my TV show. Uh,

120
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.500
we're all gonna get it anyway. We can't just stop working.

121
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:03.020
We can't shut down the world. We can't stop flying.

122
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.710
And then I spoke to DMT and had this, um,

123
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.720
image of MC Escher, his angels and demons,

124
00:07:11.721 --> 00:07:15.960
but instead of angels and demons, it was pangolin and horseshoe bats and,

125
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.520
and, uh, and came out of it and, and thought,

126
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.580
uh, of course I feel horrible. Of course this is depressing and confusing.

127
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.630
This is actually one of the worst things that has happened in my lifetime.

128
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:33.890
And I just have to accept it now. And I felt so much more at peace.

129
00:07:33.891 --> 00:07:38.360
It just stripped away the denial. And I could just say, all right,

130
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.370
this is happening. And.

131
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.000
<v 0>So you were just wrestling with the reality of having to shut down.</v>

132
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.200
<v 1>Yeah. And kind of,</v>

133
00:07:45.201 --> 00:07:49.010
I resented some other people on my team who in retrospect were behaving in a way

134
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:52.160
that was completely rational, where I was thinking like, oh, come on.

135
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.220
We're not going to go on this shoot really. But,

136
00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.470
but they were right and I was wrong and I had to stop.
