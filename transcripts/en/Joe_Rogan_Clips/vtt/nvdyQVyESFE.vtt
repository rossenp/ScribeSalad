<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.060
I bet that's why Eddie Murphy stopped doing standup. I mean, it's just like his,

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.250
his movies are doing so good and he you're more insulated in that world

4
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:16.060
too. He got too famous too. It's like, it's almost like it's a better way.

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.300
<v 1>Yeah. What do you think is going to be like when he comes back? Who knows?</v>

6
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.690
If he's gonna, I mean, it's a lot of money on the line for him.

7
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.030
I'm sure he's got a lot. He's got a lot of money, but I mean.

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.200
I watched Norbert the other night, I've been talking to people post about, oh,

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.890
it's.

10
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.900
<v 0>Fun. Oh man. It's funny.</v>

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.260
What's coming to America the next night family movie night.

12
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.540
<v 1>What was that movie he did with Owen Molson lice by or something like that?</v>

13
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.740
Something spy I.

14
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.680
<v 0>Spy. Was it? Hmm. Oh no. It.</v>

15
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.930
<v 1>Was actually a really good movie. I enjoyed that movie a lot. He's.</v>

16
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.400
<v 0>Not alive movies, man.</v>

17
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.990
He's one of those guys where his movies don't get the respect that they deserve

18
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.210
for some strange reason. Like a,

19
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:57.950
what was that one that he did with Steve Martin?

20
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.050
<v 1>Uh, Bowfinger. Yeah. That is a great movie. Do you know the story behind that?</v>

21
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:03.884
Right.

22
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.810
About the Heather Graham character was allegedly and hash was supposed to be,

23
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.400
it was based on an hash really. That's what I heard based on her. Yeah.

24
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.520
How she was dating Steve Martin. And she ended up with a woman. Yeah.

25
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:18.950
And then ended up, she ended up with, then she ended up,

26
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.540
she ended up with Ellen degenerate. That's right.

27
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.180
And then she ended up marrying a man after that. That's right.

28
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:26.840
Just keep it moving. Yeah. Whoever's going to take me. I'm good with it.

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.990
I've actually met her and she was very nice too. So I, you know,

30
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.910
I felt what happened to her, man. I don't know.

31
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.190
She was shooting a series up in Canada for a little while.

32
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.840
That's where I met her. But Eddie, you know,

33
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:40.310
the problem with Eddie was not the problem.

34
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.050
What happened with Eddie was his movies in the eighties were so huge.

35
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.840
You know, it's like opening with a phenomenal joke.

36
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:48.591
And then the rest of your act,

37
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:50.810
you can't follow it despite how good the rest of the jokes are.

38
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.630
<v 0>I put in so many of those movies, it was, we're still really good.</v>

39
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:56.030
They just didn't get the respect for something. Beverly.

40
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.600
<v 1>Hills cop 48 hours coming to America, trading places.</v>

41
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.740
I mean hit after hit, after hit, not like a little bit of a hit. He was the man.

42
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.700
And then, you know,

43
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.870
you got another 48 hours and then you got Beverly Hills cop two and three

44
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.760
Steven. They were good. Yes.

45
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.280
That was the first time I saw sequels that were like, wow,

46
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.260
that's just as good as the first one. But it wasn't.

47
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.800
<v 0>You're like a time period where he wasn't doing films or they weren't as</v>

48
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:22.190
popular. And then you get films like bow finger.

49
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.420
<v 1>And yeah. So I think, um, after he did that,</v>

50
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.860
one movie was like a, like a military kind of movie.

51
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.570
Yeah. In the late eighties,

52
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.140
it was somewhere around trying to branch out or something after golden child,

53
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:39.680
it kind of fell apart a little bit. Oh, is that what it was? Yeah.

54
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.210
There was a pre or post.

55
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.020
<v 0>My girl wants to party all the time. That was post. Okay. So that was an issue.</v>

56
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.880
Yeah. That was a.

57
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.860
<v 1>Different, you know, find this Henderson. Yeah, sure. Yeah. He, you know,</v>

58
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:54.890
he wrote that Freddy really? Yeah. Apparently fine. It's fine.

59
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.450
He told me he wrote it for him. Wow. He was,

60
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.340
I used to help Eddie with that back in the day.

61
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.750
And cause finest was actually a really big,

62
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.980
he had a really big song back in the day called skip to my Lou. Really? Yeah.

63
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.490
It was a really dope R and B track, like early eighties.

64
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.650
<v 0>I remember I was in New York city in Eddie Murphy had that song. Nope.</v>

65
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.633
I was in Boston.

66
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.190
I was in Boston and Eddie Murphy had that song come out and I was like,

67
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:20.820
this guy can do anything. That was one of those things where like when,

68
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.600
when a person does that, like Rick James produced it for him. Did he really? Oh,

69
00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:25.800
that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

70
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.440
There's some of those guys that could just kind of do anything.

71
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.140
They could do movies, they could do comedy.

72
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.410
<v 1>He's got a reggae album out now. You know, that was,</v>

73
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.280
it came out like three years ago. Yeah. Eddie Murphy. Yeah.

74
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.350
A couple of years ago, Eddie Murphy released a reggae album.

75
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.140
<v 0>See, I always feel like with certain dudes,</v>

76
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.760
like whether it's him or Jamie Fox or dudes who had just have the,

77
00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:48.900
like this really diverse set of skills,

78
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.930
they're probably just always doing something. Whether you know about it or not.

79
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.870
<v 1>They got a they're they're just creatives that they can't stop creating. Right.</v>

80
00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.790
And then they get, you know,

81
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:03.570
I think the thing with a lot of people are creative and a lot of people,

82
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.650
I think what you need is the Eddie Murphy. That's the reggae.

83
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.910
<v 0>Red light featuring Snoop dog. Whoa, Snoop lion.</v>

84
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.600
<v 2>Look at this. He's playing guitar.</v>

85
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.340
<v 1>Yeah. He plays instruments and. Yeah. Okay.</v>

86
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.280
<v 0>We can't play any of it, but it's a flashy, just a little fluff.</v>

87
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.060
I'm going to have to go and get this now. That's correct. Well, I'm not shocked,

88
00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:31.110
man. I'm not shocked. And I,

89
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:34.920
and I know he was thinking about doing standup again,

90
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.050
but I do not know if he's actually doing standard.

91
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.610
<v 1>Do you know? It was at his house? Uh, January of last year,</v>

92
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.540
January, 2019, Tiffany Haddish took me to his house.

93
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.860
And uh, it was this night that I was really not supposed to be there.

94
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.220
I wasn't invited, but Tiffany was like, come with me and I'm like, hell yeah.

95
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.870
So I went and it was,

96
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.550
it was this incredible night at Eddie Murphy's house where, um,

97
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.050
I walked downstairs. The first person I see is Jamie Fox. It was like, Hey man,

98
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:07.350
what's up? I'm like, what's up Jamie? And he's like, yeah. And then, uh,

99
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.540
and then I turn, I see Neil Brennan. And then I,

100
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.960
and then I look at the bar and I see Sasha Baron Cohen and Eila Fisher sitting

101
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:15.810
at the bar. And I'm like, what the have I won? And then I see Kimmel.

102
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.630
Then I say, bill Hader. And then I hear behind me yell,

103
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.420
is this what you can means? Always do a hangout with each other.

104
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.480
And I turned around and it's, Q-tip from a tribe called quest. And I'm like,

105
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.110
what up tap? And they were like, what the is going? What have I walked into?

106
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.090
Wow. And then Jeff Ross was there and then Chappelle came,

107
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:37.740
Chris rock came and I was like, what if I walked into?

108
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.980
But the good thing is, you know, cause you were comics. We all know each other.

109
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.263
And then I, you know,

110
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.590
I'd only met Eddie once for like a split second at a fight. And uh,

111
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.930
he knew my name then. But when I walked, when I walked in the base, he goes,

112
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.640
Hey Russell, thanks for coming. I'm like.

113
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.140
<v 3>Eddie Murphy knows my name. That's all I can think of. Holy,</v>

114
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.760
Eddie Murphy knows my name.

115
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.620
<v 0>I met him once with Charlie. I rented a Charlie. Charlie.</v>

116
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.570
<v 1>Was so great. He was such a sweet guy.</v>

117
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.970
<v 0>Charlie and I did a tour together, uh, for a maximum, the bud light comedy tour.</v>

118
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.370
And um, with John Heffron and then just randomly, uh,

119
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.740
I was in Maui in just Charlie was in Maui and uh,

120
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.130
I went over and sat with him and Eddie Murphy was weird.

121
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.410
It was so strange. How was he when he was with Charlie? Just real friendly man.

122
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.640
<v 1>Yeah. He was really nice. It was like nothing weird about him. And.</v>

123
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.770
<v 0>Super-friendly his first words goes you a funny. Yeah. I was like, oh my God.</v>

124
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.640
<v 1>These are the things that faint. Yeah, dude, I, uh,</v>

125
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.110
I was like that whole night. I honestly didn't say a word to anybody.

126
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.140
I was just in shock. The entire time was just like,

127
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.130
I know every time I turn my head and then I was standing in the doorway like

128
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:55.420
that and it's, it's me standing beside Eddie and then Chris rock,

129
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:56.890
Jamie Foxx and Neil Brennan.

130
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.930
And they're all trying to convince him to do standup again. Wow.

131
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.790
And I'm just there, like I have nothing to add to this conversation.

132
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.640
Like I'm not on Jamie's level, not on Chris's level, you know,

133
00:07:09.641 --> 00:07:13.570
Neil credit spells. I'm like, I'm just there, but they didn't make me feel like,

134
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:16.120
what are you doing here? They made me feel included. So that was nice.

135
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:19.330
But that is nice. But uh, they, you know, there was like, Eddie was like,

136
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:22.930
I haven't done it in 30 years. I'm like, I'm pretty sure you've still got it.

137
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.940
Oh, he's got it. He said, he said, he's got about five minutes. Uh,

138
00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:28.780
I got about five minutes, but you know,

139
00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.480
you guys are out there doing it every day. And I know he,

140
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:36.010
I know he wants to do it, but it depends on how he approaches it. You know?

141
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.580
Well.

142
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.670
<v 0>It depends on how he feels or if he just decides he wants to do it.</v>

143
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.480
The thing about standup is that you have to do in front of people. You know,

144
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.740
you got to go out there and do it.

145
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.170
<v 1>There's no theory to it, right? Yeah. It's.</v>

146
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.280
<v 0>Not like music. You can,</v>

147
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.410
you could create an album with just you and your friends.

148
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.840
You can't really create a comedy set without being at

149
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:59.290
a place where you're going to have random people come and pay money to see you.

150
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.650
<v 1>And that's the other problem he's got overcome is that people are going to be</v>

151
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:05.020
coming, expecting, you know,

152
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:07.720
maybe they were expecting delirious or raw coming out of him. Right.

153
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:12.490
It's a 60 year old man. Now he's got 10 or 11 kids. I think he does.

154
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.000
When I, when I met him, when I was at his house, his,

155
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.190
his baby was only maybe a couple months old or a month old. Wow. And then,

156
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.390
uh, end of the night, I got stuck in the basement of his house. What happened?

157
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.020
Well,

158
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.620
everyone was leaving and I didn't know where Tiffany went and I'm literally

159
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:33.070
standing against the wall. And I'm the only uninvited guy there really.

160
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.300
You know what I mean? Like all the Netflix people were there and I'm like,

161
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.330
oh boy, I don't know what the. And I'm looking around, like,

162
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:42.580
I know where the Tiffany went. And uh,

163
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.510
I finally like as me and then eight of Eddie's kids were sitting at this one

164
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:50.530
table and I'm just standing there like a creep, like right across from them.

165
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:52.840
And I see Kenya Barris going upstairs and I was like,

166
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.310
Kenya don't leave without me. So I left,

167
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.720
I went up with him and as you walked up there, the door opened to suggest,

168
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.190
just get the out of the house. And I was like, um, said the lady, Hey, uh,

169
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.410
I came with Tiffany and she's kinda my ride. Cause she did,

170
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:12.390
she picked me up and I'm like, um, I don't know where she is.

171
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.540
And then they were like, oh, I think she went to the backyard. I go, okay.

172
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.940
And I'm like, I don't like, what am I supposed to do with that?

173
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:20.370
I'm not going to go walking around the guy's house. Right. Where do you get,

174
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.120
how do you get to the backyard? God, one of his sons was walking by and goes,

175
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.100
oh, I'll take you to the backyard. And I said, oh, thank goodness.

176
00:09:26.101 --> 00:09:30.690
So I go to the backyard, it's massive backyard. And this house is insane.

177
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.140
Where does he live? Um, Beverly Hills. Of course. Yeah.

178
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.340
But in that really exclusive gated community,

179
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:43.230
they're like we're Denzel lives alone in these massive houses.

180
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.860
Yeah. Like I think, I think honestly it was about 30,000 square feet.

181
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:47.930
The house weird.

182
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:51.620
<v 0>Must that be, to be that guy to like, you know,</v>

183
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.970
know those people who those people are when you're young and then all of a

184
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:57.020
sudden you're one of them people.

185
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.720
<v 1>It's listen. I mean, I'm still a gas from it a year and a half later.</v>

186
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.060
<v 0>I guess I can only imagine. I mean,</v>

187
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:09.230
there's like an exclusive a list celebrity group of humans.

188
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.790
And there's like, I guess like when a guy like him has a party like that,

189
00:10:13.791 --> 00:10:16.370
like those are the only people that are just going to be semi-normal around him.

190
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.280
Yeah. Yeah. He can't have that late. Eddie is this,

191
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.600
this is going to be a funny speech.

192
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.440
<v 1>Yeah. No, none of that. You can't have no weirdos can't have any.</v>

193
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.340
And that's why I didn't want to say anything. Cause I wasn't sure what I'm like,

194
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:31.460
am I going to say something stupid and be like, who brought this guy?

195
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.230
You can't have any normies. Yeah. And I felt too normal. Yeah. I felt,

196
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.813
it felt like a mortal.

197
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.480
<v 0>Isn't that funny? Like, like you go to the common story fit right in. Yeah.</v>

198
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.020
But if you go, like when you're around too many celebrities,

199
00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:46.490
you do feel like a fraud. Yeah.
