00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 1>Hmm. And you would think, uh, it would be,</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.580
if you're going to hang yourself from such a short distance,

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.820
it would be even harder to get a fracture like that. Right.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.400
Cause you're not like jumping out, looking at an old Western movie,

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.890
like Clint Eastwood movie when they would hang him, hang them high.

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.440
<v 0>So the one thing that they also had in here was he left a note, oh Jesus. Uh,</v>

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.150
the note said like, there was like four things. It said first that the,

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.610
it had the name blurred out, but it said this person left him in a shower,

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.490
locked for an hour, but then said,

11
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:39.390
someone else gave him like burnt food and then bugs were crawling over his

12
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.800
hands. And then he just wrote no fun,

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.880
but there's a ballpoint pen.

14
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.030
Like the one I have in my hand sitting right next to it. And like,

15
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.260
if you knew he was on suicide,

16
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:51.930
watch you wouldn't give him a ballpoint pen that you could kill himself with

17
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.530
Jamie, you.

18
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.000
<v 1>Should be a detect.</v>

19
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.410
<v 0>What they're saying. And he had his us, his sleep apnea machine was in there.</v>

20
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:58.781
It was there.

21
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:03.240
You could see an extension cord coming from the hallway into his room that

22
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.020
he could have just used that to kill himself in hangups. Jumpsuits.

23
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:07.854
Why does he have nine?

24
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.290
<v 1>Yeah. The jumpsuit thing is freaky.</v>

25
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.680
Like they're trying to explain it by bringing in some, some new.

26
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.050
<v 0>So somehow this is actually a different video.</v>

27
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.120
That's shown a couple of different things than what I saw this morning.

28
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:21.330
I didn't see this arm thing. And I didn't see the picture of his arm.

29
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.340
<v 1>Thing. Looks like an injection spot. Is that what it looks.</v>

30
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.860
<v 0>Like? Here's the actual, this is what I saw. Here's the note.</v>

31
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.900
<v 1>What does this say? Sorry. It's at 60 minutes. Get their watermark.</v>

32
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.610
So funny. Sorry. 60 minutes. Thank you. Thanks for getting this.

33
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.750
So this isn't.

34
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.610
<v 0>Kept me in a locked it's blurred right here.</v>

35
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.620
It says the names board kept me in a lock shop,

36
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.450
shower stall for one hour neck or, uh, someone, I don't know the name,

37
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.920
sending burnt food, giant bugs, crawled on my hands and then no fun.

38
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.480
And then they're saying, and then you end up,

39
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:55.020
but then this ballpoint pen was next to it that he could have stabbed himself in

40
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:55.890
the neck or whatever, you know?

41
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.870
<v 1>Yeah. It's hard to kill yourself with a pen. Yeah. But do they get pens?</v>

42
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.510
<v 0>That's not usually, but this is like a.</v>

43
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.430
<v 1>You know, high profile cows. Yeah. I don't know. It's just, yeah.</v>

44
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.060
I don't think he should have it. It might look it's,

45
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.860
it's bad to say either way.

46
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.680
If you don't know and I'm guilty of that a hundred percent.

47
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:20.610
I'm like that guy didn't kill himself. I am talking. Oh,

48
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.620
I'm not talking in terms of like,

49
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.630
we have to understand this is really important. We're uh,

50
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.240
we're doing a podcast when you're doing a podcast.

51
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:33.750
You don't have to be factually accurate. You just have to talk.

52
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.790
And hopefully if you up, you correct it. And it's funny. Um,

53
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.260
I'm not a science expert,

54
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.470
but when these guys are saying that the guy died by strangulation,

55
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.720
there's all these points of consistent strangulation.

56
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.340
And it takes forever to get these pictures.

57
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.500
And then there's the video cameras didn't work.

58
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.210
And this is the second time he tried to kill himself.

59
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.150
And he's a high profile witness and a really, really,

60
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.410
really important case involving pedophiles at the highest levels of government.

61
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.750
Yeah. I wouldn't, I would think that that's the kind of guy you whack.

62
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.450
It's like, you just wanted to buy the name. What's up with the sneakers.

63
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.800
The kids are wearing that have a, a green tag on them. I was,

64
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.890
it was explained to me, are we telling the boomers now is a green tea.

65
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.480
I'm not a boomer. Right? I'm a generation X and boomers. A state of mind. Oh,

66
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:22.450
okay, cool, man. This green tag, what is it? A off-white. Is that what it is?

67
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.690
Yeah. So they have this green tag on this pair.

68
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:28.720
I was buying a pair of Nike's for my kid and they're like, oh,

69
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.410
those are all fine. I go, what's up with this green thing? Yeah.

70
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.450
What did they go? You leave that on. I'm like, you.

71
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.060
I'm not leaving this stupid plastic tag on. No, you don't leave that on. Wait,

72
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.960
what, what can people do that thing? Giant tag.

73
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.040
They leave these stupid tags. And these are huge. They're cumbersome.

74
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.610
They look dumb, but where I'm on their shoe, it's part of the thing.

75
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.280
It's part of the grant. This person was trying to explain it to me.

76
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.220
It's part of the brand, look in five years, it's going to go away. Oh,

77
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.150
why is it here? Because it looks different. Now. It looks different.

78
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.770
It's like a flag should have a knife and this should go up to these kids and

79
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.740
just cut that off and go. No, we're about to go to war.

80
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.380
They're making you soft and stupid.

81
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.320
This is probably a plot by the Russians and the Chinese.

82
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:18.370
And the Iranians could try to make sure that our kids grow dumber and dumber.

83
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.580
The main thing. There's two things that are really,

84
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.420
really kind of happening in that region. One, the traffic, uh,

85
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.800
the trafficking of fentanyl and heroin and all these drugs

86
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.110
through one of the main drug routes up into the U S and there's a few factions

87
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.350
fighting over that, uh, region, low Salazar,

88
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.090
which are a small cartel faction that has allegiances to see lower

89
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.880
cartel and Alenia cartel,

90
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:48.670
which has historically been in control of a lot of Juarez.

91
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.320
So they're both kind of buying for control of the area. Uh,

92
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.680
a few hours before the massacre actually took place.

93
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.800
There were a bunch of firefights between these two factions in the area.

94
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.890
So one of the main theories is that these, uh, the,

95
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.990
this group of Mormons basically were casing mistaken identity kind of driving

96
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:10.810
into some of the areas where they're being protected by some of these people.

97
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.960
And it's one theory, right? Um,

98
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.610
the other thing that people kind of need to think about is that the largest

99
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.010
minable, uh,

100
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.990
mineable deposits of lithium on the planet right now are a few hours away from

101
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.840
where that massacre took place. Really? Yes.

102
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.170
And that is not conspiracy theory theorizing here,

103
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:34.090
but it's a pretty important thing in that region.

104
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.480
And there's a lot of interest in that space and control for that space.

105
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.920
And they're not mining it currently.

106
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.280
There's pro there's a bunch of projects in play right now.

107
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.910
So they've identified the deposits. Uh, yeah. You know,

108
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:47.320
people can look up the numbers, but it's,

109
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.980
it's the largest mineable deposit of lithium on the planet.

110
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.460
And there was some sort of deal, uh,

111
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.100
in the past where a Canadian mining agency was going to have rights to it.

112
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.760
And the mining agency was bought by the check by Chinese company.

113
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.560
So again, after that massacre, a lot of things happen.

114
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:09.350
A lot of the negotiations that happened that prob that deal was one of the

115
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:13.750
things that got killed after that situation. Oh, no. Right. So it's, it's, it's,

116
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.730
it's, it's an interesting area. There's a lot of things happening there.

117
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.550
That's kind of put a tremendous amount of pressure on the cartels in some way.

118
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:22.190
Right? Well, uh, historically, any sort of, uh,

119
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.190
any sort of mining operation usually has industry around it,

120
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.430
which is perfect for the cartels, you know, um, uh,

121
00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:33.860
extortion protection rackets, um, uh, feeding the, the, uh,

122
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.900
drug use in the area from the workers.

123
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.690
<v 2>I wi I blue pill with the out of it.</v>

124
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:41.510
I don't try to get my son into conspiracy theories at all.

125
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.010
That's going to be later. I'm like,

126
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.920
I just want him to get to be later that's later, I'll get him when he's like,

127
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.730
that's right. But right now he can't handle it. There's no way.

128
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:54.350
There's no way he doesn't need to ask him to. And all his whole life,

129
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.360
every minute is happiness, just love and happiness.

130
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:02.120
And we just, we just want to make him every day.

131
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.590
He loves school more than anything. He loves school more than, he loves school.

132
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.420
And then after school, it's all about fun.

133
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.150
And he decides what we're going to do. He calls the shots.

134
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.420
You're going to go to karate. He goes today, we're going to do karate.

135
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:16.130
And then we're going to cause he's all in the baseball too.

136
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.130
And then we're going to go to the batting cages. My boom, that's it.

137
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.830
We go to karate, batting cages. Then I go teach jujitsu.

138
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.650
Then the next day he'll say, daddy, I think we're going to,

139
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.400
I'm going to take a relaxation day, worked a lot. The last couple of days,

140
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.680
let's go get let's order pizza from, uh, from, uh, Dino's in Burbank.

141
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.210
Amazing. And then we'll watch some teenage mutant,

142
00:07:38.211 --> 00:07:42.140
ninja turtles. He's all about teenage. He decides.

143
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.150
And then every day it's a different thing.

144
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.160
What he wants it let's go to the movies today. Afterschool.

145
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.050
<v 1>This is an evolution of you learning from like the pain of your childhood and</v>

146
00:07:51.051 --> 00:07:52.190
like doing all the right things.

147
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.660
<v 2>My son, my dad, my dad, my dad had 19 kids.</v>

148
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.990
And I was just one kid with my mom was like a weird offsite.

149
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.680
Like he had a family with five kids and then he got a bunch of other women

150
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:06.830
pregnant. He was all over the place truck driver. He had 19 kids.

151
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.280
I was one of 19, yet out of eight different checks. He was banging.

152
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.330
And he, um, never, I found out I met,

153
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.940
I met a couple of my half brothers and half sisters that were,

154
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.540
were actually part of his real family. And we met one day.

155
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.900
We went to the old spaghetti factory in Hollywood and he told,

156
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.690
they told me all about them. And I didn't know. I thought he had five kids.

157
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:29.870
He had a family with five kids and my mom was some chick. You know,

158
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:32.210
he was sitting on the side. That's what I thought. I didn't know.

159
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:35.450
He had a punch others because how would they go? She goes, how many?

160
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.840
My half sister goes, how many? I was half, half sister, half brother.

161
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.860
Cause how many kids do you think your dad has? I said, ah, six,

162
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.080
try 19. I go. He's like Helio, Gracie, holy.

163
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.670
Real similar. And one thing that he never told any, he never said the words.

164
00:08:52.671 --> 00:08:56.310
I love you to anybody, to his real. He never said it to me.

165
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.220
Cause I would see him like once a year, that the words never came out of his.

166
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.180
I've never told my mom that.

167
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.140
Apparently he's one of those guys that will never say, I love you to anybody.

168
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.490
And I'm the opposite dude. I tell my son,

169
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:12.810
I look them in the eye every day was like, you know, who loves you the most?

170
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:17.730
You know, I'm in the, I love you the most or the mom and I whisper in his ear.

171
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:22.320
I'm like, you know, I'll kill anybody for you. Don't ever forget that. Whoa,

172
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.220
you're getting crazy, crazy with them. But it is important.

173
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.000
People know that you live in. It's a funny thing. Get now it's a funny thing.

174
00:09:30.001 --> 00:09:32.010
Like first he's like, okay dad. Okay. And now he goes,

175
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.440
I'm not going to let you forget daddy. I won't forget.

176
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.620
I call you promise because I won't forget. I go.

177
00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:40.110
I just want to make sure you don't forget. And he goes, okay. And he goes,

178
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:45.090
I daddy, I won't forget. I promise. And I hug him every day,

179
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.500
every day, man.
