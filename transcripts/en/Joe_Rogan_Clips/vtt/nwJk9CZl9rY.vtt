00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, there was two moments where I was like,</v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:07.200
this is a real opportunity for us to come together.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.150
And one of them was the moment the lockdown happened. It,

4
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:15.120
it felt to me very similar to right after nine 11,

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.890
where everybody was confronted with their own mortality, like holy, like we,

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.620
we might be on the verge of a pandemic,

7
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:27.600
like in a movie where a lot of the people we know die and here we have to be

8
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.490
kind to each other. We have to be now, this is what's important.

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.090
Family's important. And I remember thinking I've never been closer to my family.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.920
Never been closer to my friends.

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.860
We're calling each other all the time where we were. It was like, it was,

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.880
there was, there was real hope in that. I was like, if we get through this,

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.100
we're going to be tighter. We're going to know what means something,

14
00:00:44.101 --> 00:00:48.180
what counts does standup comedy, everything else, man.

15
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.550
What's important is love and friendship.

16
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.240
Then it started to get angry.

17
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.130
It only took like three or four weeks where people started getting like they

18
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.340
were scared. So people started getting shittier with each other online.

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.460
And then I basically swore off Twitter and I was like,

20
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.280
this is just too toxic and too hostile.

21
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.630
The second moment where I thought we had the opportunity to come together was

22
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.030
George Floyd. So George Floyd died.

23
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.920
And all of a sudden you have these black lives matter protests. And I'm like,

24
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.820
maybe we can finally make a dent on racism.

25
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.060
Maybe we can finally make a dent in police brutality.

26
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.960
Maybe this is a moment where we can come together and realize what's important

27
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:35.790
is community solidarity, that we were all in this together. Like this is crazy.

28
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.790
And then the cops need to be reformed. Like they can't live like,

29
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.080
and maybe we should take into account PTSD. Maybe we should take into account.

30
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:46.650
The fact that these guys are pulling up on people every day that might shoot

31
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:47.191
them in the face.

32
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.220
They might never be able to see their family and their kids let's rework.

33
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:54.030
This let's think this through. Nope. Then chaos.

34
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:56.880
And then all of a sudden it became like what we saw yesterday,

35
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.270
where they're breaking into Amazon, go in Seattle.

36
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.720
Like that guy owns the Washington post.

37
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.790
<v 1>He owns the most left wing newspaper in America. And you're like,</v>

38
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:10.050
not good enough.

39
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.963
<v 2>Well, you saw, they set up a,</v>

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.830
like a fake guillotine outside of Jesus's his house in Washington, DC. And it's,

41
00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:17.840
it's just, it's madness. I told rich, I totally agree with you, by the way.

42
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:19.640
Like when, when the, when COVID happened,

43
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:22.580
I thought I can't really see how we're going to split in partisan fashion over

44
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:23.300
this thing.

45
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.050
Like everybody wants to live and everybody would also like to eventually get

46
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.090
back to regular life and the better we can live,

47
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:31.910
the better we can get back to regular life. So it seems like, okay,

48
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.640
we're on board. When it came to the lockdowns, the original lockdowns,

49
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:36.360
I was like, okay, I'm on board. You know, I'm,

50
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.700
I'm taking this thing really seriously.

51
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:39.980
I've got parents in there in their sixties. I feel like, you know,

52
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:43.850
I'm in good health. I'm, I'm fairly young. I'm 36. But for my parents, I don't,

53
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.020
I don't want my parents getting this thing.

54
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.420
And so we're still taking this thing real seriously. I mean,

55
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:50.030
I'm still wearing a mask around in public places. And I think people should,

56
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:51.290
I think that's a responsible thing to do,

57
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.070
but it immediately turned into who can we blame for this? Who can we blame?

58
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.180
Who's doing it wrong.

59
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.920
And it seems like there were only like a couple of things that really can do

60
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.160
that are obviously wrong. Like nobody has a good solution on this thing. Okay.

61
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:07.900
It ravaged Italy. It ravaged Spain. It ravaged New York. Like there,

62
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:08.800
there are a couple of things you shouldn't do.

63
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.140
Don't take the olds and send it back into the nursing homes with COVID right.

64
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.750
I mean, that's like an obvious one, but beyond that,

65
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.380
like just staying away from each other and socially distancing. And we're like,

66
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:20.590
this is all kind of common sensical stuff that people have known since the flu

67
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.110
pandemic event in 1918, like nothing, nothing has really changed.

68
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.540
And yet it immediately turned into who can we blame?

69
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:27.490
Who's who's to blame for all these dead people.

70
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:30.520
Maybe it's Ron DeSantis or maybe it's Cuomo, like who, who can we blame?

71
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.370
So that was terrible. And then on the Floyd stuff, I had the same feelings.

72
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.340
Like, I don't know, a single human being who watched that tape and didn't think,

73
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.740
okay, that guy deserves to go to jail Shelvin right there.

74
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.670
The officer in that case and the.

75
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.700
<v 3>George flight test, everyone, I know every.</v>

76
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.880
<v 2>Single person was like, yeah, that's that's real bad. Like that's the cops,</v>

77
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.030
like I know tons of cops I'm friendly with tons of cops and not one of them was

78
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:51.130
like, yeah, that's a good police procedure. I'm glad he did that. Like,

79
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.880
no one thought that. And so when people are like, okay, well,

80
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:55.240
we're going to look at police brutality.

81
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.160
Maybe we'll take a look at qualified immunity.

82
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.280
Maybe we'll take a look at police unions and the kind of restrictive covenants

83
00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.520
that they have with the cities and how we make sure that everybody knows who's

84
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.680
the bad cops are. So they can't get hired at different places.

85
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.860
Like all those are solutions, but it quickly turned from, well,

86
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:11.140
we don't want to talk about solutions. Solutions are a bad idea.

87
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:15.190
What we need to do is we need to shout about everything we can possibly imagine

88
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.580
all at once. And you know what, instead, let's have a conversation about like,

89
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.990
was George Washington, a bad guy? Let's have a conversation instead about like,

90
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.490
just completely defunding the police.

91
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:27.190
One of like a responsible conversation about things that make sense.

92
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.350
We'll talk about like, what if we just got rid of the police?

93
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.060
<v 0>I see is that discussion, that discussion, uh, when, when,</v>

94
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:34.530
when people were really saying defund,

95
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:37.560
the police I'm like cooler heads will prevail, but they're going to realize,

96
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.080
and I think they're realizing it now in New York city, I mean,

97
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:43.680
New York city has had record crime record homicide who would have thought,

98
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.370
who would have thought the Blasio is? I mean, I would've never,

99
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.630
I would've never imagined I would look at Garcetti and go, well, he's better.

100
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.340
That's exactly right.

101
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.820
Look at the Plaza. I'm like, God, I said, I have them over my house for dinner.

102
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:03.090
He's way better. DeBlasio is around hug murderer.

103
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.450
So weird he's so you can have protests,

104
00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:08.730
but only black lives matter protests.

105
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.460
<v 2>That one was that, that was, that was a solid, you know, that, that was,</v>

106
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.280
that may have been the moment when I realized that we were all AFT,

107
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.940
that was the moment when like we're in the middle of a global pandemic with

108
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.590
hundreds of thousands of people dead and an entire swath of our media and

109
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:26.070
healthy leads just decided randomly that if you were protesting against

110
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:27.090
lockdown, you were very bad. Right.

111
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:29.250
Then you were a racist and you're going to get people killed and you should wear

112
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:31.980
a mask. And I was like, well, if you're pro I sort of agree with the mask thing,

113
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.540
like, yeah. Okay. And then you get millions of people in the streets,

114
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:39.660
yelling at each other and breathing on each other and spitting on each other.

115
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.760
And you got health professionals on TV being like, well,

116
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.820
racism is a public health threat, I guess that you can do that. Now. It's like,

117
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.600
well, what the,

118
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.570
I know people who died in the hospital of COVID and their family could not visit

119
00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:48.930
them.

120
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.750
Like they literally died alone in the hospital of COVID and family could not

121
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:52.141
visit them.

122
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:55.380
And you're telling me that it's deeply important that we have like dance lines.

123
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:56.460
This was stuff happening at rallies,

124
00:05:56.461 --> 00:06:00.470
like dance in the streets in New York to fight racism. That's deeply important,

125
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.290
but a daughter being able to visit her dad before he dies. That's not important.

126
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.410
<v 0>I am for your freedom to protest, I'm 100% for your freedom to protest.</v>

127
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.930
I'm also for your freedom to go to the gym.

128
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.860
I'm also for your freedom to go to a comedy club. If you so choose, um,

129
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.170
for your freedom to go to a restaurant, look,

130
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.450
they figured out how to do restaurants. And a lot of places,

131
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:23.410
the servers wear masks, and many of them were face shields.

132
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.590
You distance the tables apart from each other, you do temperature checks.

133
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:30.430
You take people's names and addresses down when they enter so that if anybody

134
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:34.240
gets sick, if there's any sort of co and they they've been able to do that, no.

135
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.960
<v 2>This is right. The, the vectors of transmission are typically closed areas.</v>

136
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.250
People in solid proximity with each other for long periods of time, right?

137
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.060
That's the stuff where people are getting this stuff. And I,

138
00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:48.250
I trust most Americans, not like some Americans are be dumb asses.

139
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.203
Some people are just dumb.

140
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.690
<v 0>A lot of videos to watch YouTube, but there's plenty of Karen's out there.</v>

141
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.360
How sad is it if your name is Karen and you're a good person,

142
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.520
all the good Karen's out there. I'm sorry, ladies. I'm really sorry.

143
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.360
But.

144
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.020
<v 2>It's like, this is, I made this point online. I got shellacked for it,</v>

145
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:08.470
but I was pointing out that most Americans are wearing masks right now by

146
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:08.981
polling data.

147
00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:12.070
59% of Americans say that they always wear a mask when they leave the house.

148
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.880
And if you look at the map of mask wearing across the board in the places where

149
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.070
there are the most cases, people are wearing masks, that's not,

150
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.110
I wasn't saying masks don't work. I wear a mask.

151
00:07:20.111 --> 00:07:22.270
I think that the evidence shows that they do something.

152
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.070
We don't know that they're not like full protective.

153
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.680
The cloth masks are not as effective as surgical masks,

154
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:29.880
which are not as effective as the N 90 fives, but wear a mask. Good. The,

155
00:07:29.881 --> 00:07:33.280
the point that I was making is people are acting in fairly rational fashion.

156
00:07:33.281 --> 00:07:34.990
Meaning if you think COVID is like around you,

157
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.480
you're wearing a mask and you're socially distancing. So this,

158
00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:40.840
this idea that Gavin Newsome knows best how you ought to live your life.

159
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.970
Like I got some trouble with that,

160
00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:45.550
especially because California saw the same uptick as Texas and Florida and

161
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:47.410
California never opened. I mean, we've been here the whole time,

162
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:48.550
California never really opened.

163
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.640
<v 0>We were doing pretty good up until the protests. Yeah.</v>

164
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:53.380
Everything seemed like it was on an uptick.

165
00:07:53.381 --> 00:07:57.250
The comedy store was talking to them about becoming an essential business and,

166
00:07:57.251 --> 00:08:00.430
and opening up because they had opened up bars and they had opened up

167
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:04.210
restaurants and they didn't really have a designation for comedy clubs.

168
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.560
They sort of talked about it as a live performance venue.

169
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:12.160
But then that puts comedy clubs at the same place as the staple center,

170
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.070
which sounds crazy. Right? So they're like, listen, we can do this.

171
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:18.520
We can just have half capacity, temperature checks do it. Right.

172
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.340
They're doing it right in a lot of places all over the country, we can do this.

173
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.190
The audience has to wear masks. This is totally doable.

174
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.060
And so they were right about to do that. And then post there's.

175
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:31.060
Other thing is we were trying to figure out like, is it protests only?

176
00:08:31.061 --> 00:08:34.930
I think it's bars too. Yeah. The thing about bars is close talk.

177
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.500
People are talking. Yeah, they're drunk. And they're on top of each other.

178
00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:40.630
I think bars probably sent a certificate update. Right?

179
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.930
<v 2>Lots of singing. Lots of, lots of vocalizing.</v>

180
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.680
My churches and synagogues were remained vector for this. I mean, but again,

181
00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:50.200
these are all things that are fairly common sensical and we can agree on it.

182
00:08:50.201 --> 00:08:53.260
And yet we're beating the hell out of each other over this stuff.

183
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:55.860
And there's the suggestion. We know what to do. If only we just did it.

184
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:57.690
This would stop. It's not gonna stop. Okay. It's not gonna stop.

185
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:00.330
It's it's a very transmissible disease. We don't have a vaccine.

186
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.680
As long as people are out there,

187
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.720
it's going to continue to pass where I'm asking.

188
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:06.750
If you're in close proximity with others and that's pretty much it,

189
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.280
the hospitals are getting better at this. Thank God.

190
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.050
<v 0>Yes they are. And the crazy thing was that they were saying like the,</v>

191
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.960
you can only protest if it's a black lives matter protest.

192
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.620
What about a protest for increasing your immunity?

193
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.430
What about a protest for educating people to the, the,

194
00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:25.190
the techniques and the strategies for increasing your immune system?

195
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.990
It is there are there out there,

196
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.320
and there's no discussion about this amongst health professionals. Excuse me,

197
00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:33.350
amongst politicians. If you listen to health professionals,

198
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.900
people that really understand the human body, they'll tell you.

199
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.450
There's a lot of strategies. There's a lot of things you could do. First of all,

200
00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:42.110
eliminate alcohol, eliminate caffeine, eliminate sugar,

201
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.670
eliminate all the in your diet. Start taking vitamin supplements, get outside,

202
00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:51.020
get some vitamin D get, get your body healthy exercise. Do,

203
00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:54.200
do all these things. And you will increase your immune system.

204
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.400
You increase your body's health.

205
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.270
You don't hear a word that all of it is just stay inside lock. You know,

206
00:09:59.271 --> 00:10:02.600
we have to stay apart to keep everybody safe and calm.

207
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.200
<v 2>The number one vector for transmission remains the home, right?</v>

208
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.840
That's still the number one vector in every society is the home people going

209
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:12.080
home and giving it to each other. And when they, I remember for me,

210
00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:13.640
one of the breaking points in LA was,

211
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.180
was when they decided they were going to shut down all open areas.

212
00:10:17.181 --> 00:10:18.230
They're going to shut down all the parks.

213
00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:20.840
They're going to shut down all the beaches. And I was like, what? Well,

214
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:21.380
not only that it.

215
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.200
<v 0>Goes against science because there's been papers that have been studied that</v>

216
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.970
show that this virus dies almost instantaneously when it's exposed to sunlight

217
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.710
or even artificial sunlight.

218
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.430
<v 2>Yeah. None of it makes any sense, but it does feel like bottom line.</v>

219
00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:37.700
There were a bunch of gaps in American society and then a bad thing happened and

220
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.550
all, everything just sort of fell apart. It was sort of like a house of cards.

221
00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:43.250
And then there's a little bit of weight put right on top of the house of cards

222
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.200
and everything just collapsed in on itself.

223
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.540
<v 0>People are panicking, you know, they're getting scared.</v>

224
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:49.130
And then the economy is collapsing.

225
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.840
So the economy collapsing at the same time as the George Floyd protests led

226
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:54.890
people to start looting.

227
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.480
And then people that didn't give a about George Floyd or black lives matter were

228
00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:02.840
just stealing. And then this police was letting them steal.

229
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.140
They were standing down in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica,

230
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.100
literally cops standing there while people were [inaudible].

231
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.650
<v 2>I got to say, the media coverage of this stuff is just awful. The media,</v>

232
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.370
the media were cheering this stuff on and they were simultaneously making two

233
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.380
arguments that conflict with each other. One was,

234
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.300
these are mostly peaceful protest. First of all,

235
00:11:20.301 --> 00:11:24.620
mostly peaceful is the most is it's the loosest most loosely defined

236
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.330
arbitrarily applied term in history. J Simpson was mostly peaceful that night.

237
00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:32.540
OJ Simpson was mostly peaceful that night for like an hour 15.

238
00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:36.260
He was really not peaceful. But for the other hours between sunset and sunrise,

239
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:37.580
he was unbelievably peaceful.

240
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.870
Like I've never heard this term before where a protest turns into a vast riot,

241
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.930
you know, wrecking all of Melrose. And everybody's like, well,

242
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:48.230
it was mostly peaceful. Well, what the, what is that? What is that?

243
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.791
So how about this?

244
00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:52.400
How about you either say that the protesters and looters are two different

245
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:53.890
groups of people and we treat them differently.

246
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.810
If you're protesting that's first amendment activity,

247
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:57.370
the minute you shatter a store window, you go to jail.

248
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.770
<v 0>Right? That's the way they should run. Or.</v>

249
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.890
<v 2>Alternatively, if it's, if you're sitting there at the same group,</v>

250
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.010
then they need to be treated as law breakers. So I believe the first,

251
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:07.690
I believe you were a protest or you should be protesting.

252
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:09.970
If you're a leader and a rider, then you should go to jail.

253
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:12.040
But the media refuses to make that distinction.

254
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.780
And then they act like the cops are the bad guys.

255
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:17.260
When they come into to arrest people who are violating the license in Portland

256
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:20.250
right now they're trying to burn down the courthouse and the,

257
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:22.780
and the feds come in and start arresting people. And people are like,

258
00:12:22.781 --> 00:12:27.160
this is the Gestapo. It's like, okay, speaking as one of the tribe, let me say,

259
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:29.140
this is not like the Gestapo. Okay.

260
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.860
Like the Gestapo was not famous for rolling up on people and then charging them.

261
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:34.360
And then if they didn't have a charge releasing them,

262
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:36.940
that wasn't like the Gestapos thing. Like, I'm sorry.

263
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:39.910
But you decided that you wanted to throw a firebomb at the,

264
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:43.480
at the federal courthouse and your local mayor said he wasn't going to let the

265
00:12:43.481 --> 00:12:48.430
police do anything. And so DHS came in and arrested you tough. I mean, like,

266
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.180
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.060
That's at some point somebody has got to restore some semblance of law and order

268
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:52.510
here.

269
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:53.130
<v 0>Well, it's,</v>

270
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:58.050
it's a weird situation because I don't exactly understand why they're attacking

271
00:12:58.051 --> 00:12:58.884
the courthouse.

272
00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.090
I don't exactly understand why they're smashing the windows at Amazon go it's

273
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.230
theirs Martin. Right?

274
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:07.770
<v 2>They, they, they must hate these paint cans, right. Even from, from the jerk.</v>

275
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:08.604
Right.

276
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:10.950
<v 1>But it's, it's.</v>

277
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.450
<v 0>It, it went from this to literally tear down the</v>

278
00:13:15.451 --> 00:13:18.270
structure of society. Okay.
