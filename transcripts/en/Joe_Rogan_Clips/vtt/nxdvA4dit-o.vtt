00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.950
<v 1>What's exciting to me is that I think this is the first time in my life that</v>

3
00:00:07.951 --> 00:00:11.940
I've ever seen so much communication on these subjects.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.500
And I think so much recognition about the consequences of tribal

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.300
toxic tribalism, this tribal thinking that everyone seems to be engaged in,

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:24.030
on the right and on the left. I mean, in America,

7
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:28.890
you need to go no fruit then going back and forth from CNN to Fox news to say,

8
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.130
something's wrong here. These aren't, these are supposed to be news outlets.

9
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:33.810
You have two completely different narratives,

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.020
and that has nothing to do with what we're talking about with gender politics

11
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.620
and radical left socialism and Marxism. W what,

12
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.070
what you're seeing in universities though, um,

13
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.630
is a radical departure from what I always considered.

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.030
University's great for what I always considered universities great for is

15
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.130
separating from your parents,

16
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.490
challenging belief systems and being engaged in the,

17
00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:05.490
the works of brilliant people who you can compare all of their

18
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.480
findings and their discoveries and, and sit down and debate them in class.

19
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.180
And when I was a kid, when I was in high school,

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.720
I went to a very good high school Newton south high school in Newton,

21
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.370
Massachusetts. And, uh,

22
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.840
one of the things that they did is they put on a debate between a guy from the

23
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:26.100
moral majority, which was this a right wing, uh,

24
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.250
Christian group that I don't even know if they're around anymore, but there,

25
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:34.050
this was 19. I was 14. So 81 and,

26
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.100
uh, Barney Frank,

27
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.640
who was that congressmen is now one of the first openly gay guys, uh, in,

28
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.000
in Congress. And, and, uh,

29
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.130
you got to watch these two people in this auditorium debate their

30
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.100
points, and this moral majority guy had this, you know,

31
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:54.510
right wing Ronald Reagan sort of point of view and Barney, Frank,

32
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.580
who's kind of crazy.

33
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.400
And he's got busted in some male prostitute scandal. And, uh,

34
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.960
but the gay community, that's not that big of a deal. And, uh,

35
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.970
just w Barney Frank took them apart. It was brilliant to watch,

36
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.310
but it was a real debate. It was fascinating.

37
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.170
And he got to see a mediocre mine versus a great

38
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.020
mind. And you got to see this little thing. And I was like, wow,

39
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.580
this is it's one of the things that's always attracted me about the,

40
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.250
the idea that two people with different viewpoints can get together in front of

41
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:33.140
a neutral audience. And these people can sort of decipher which,

42
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:35.900
which way these people are thinking and why they're thinking. Yeah.

43
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.470
<v 0>And bad is that is,</v>

44
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.090
and rife with conflict as that is the alternative is to separate,

45
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.430
as you pointed out into two camps that don't talk.

46
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.610
And the thing is that the consequence of not talking is that you fight that

47
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:50.460
that's the end game,

48
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.230
because the only way you can stop from fighting with other people is by

49
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:59.290
negotiating with them. And you know, one of the things that's also interesting,

50
00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:03.700
and this is partly why Silicon valley leans to the left is that a fair bit of

51
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.470
your political preference is determined by your biological temperament.

52
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.880
It's a strongly influenced.

53
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.170
So if you're a creative type who's kind of disorderly,

54
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.430
then you're likely to be on the liberal left end of the distribution.

55
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.390
And if you're a non-creative type, who's orderly, and,

56
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.430
and especially if you're orderly,

57
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:29.200
then you tend to be on the right wing end of things. And so, and well,

58
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.050
why is that? Why, why do those variations exist? Well,

59
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.330
they exist because some of the time,

60
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.750
your best strategy is to do what other people have done and shut the hell up and

61
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:41.620
just do it, run the algorithm, right? The pathway's already laid clear.

62
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.430
It works, stay in the rut and move forward. Okay?

63
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.970
So that's the conservative approach. And when things are going, right,

64
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.460
it's the right approach. The problem is,

65
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:54.460
is that sometimes it's not the right approach because something has shifted.

66
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.350
And so something new has to emerge.

67
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.590
And so then there's a bunch of people who are adapted to the new,

68
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.750
and those are the entrepreneurial and creative types.

69
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.750
And of course they dominate Silicon valley because it's a very entrepreneurial,

70
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.580
it's a very entrepreneurial, what would you call it? Geography.

71
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.720
And so they're going to lean to the left, but they have to understand,

72
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.450
people have to understand that the left and the right need each other,

73
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.960
the liberals and the conservatives need each other liberal start companies,

74
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.460
conservatives run them. And the problem with the conservatives is, well,

75
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.790
they can only run a company in one direction because they're conservative.

76
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.290
They don't think outside the box.

77
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.370
But so if the company is working in the product line is good and everything is

78
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.260
stable. Like hire some conservatives,

79
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.020
cause they'll maximize efficiency in the move down that track.

80
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.770
But if the track is no longer going in a good direction,

81
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.990
because something's changed the environments change, well,

82
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:47.200
then you got to bring in the creative people. And so we need each other.

83
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.420
And the only way that we can survive the fact that we're different and the fact

84
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.660
that we need each other is by continually talking, we have taught constantly.

85
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.030
It's like, well, how much of what we're doing?

86
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.780
Should we preserve versus how much of what we're doing? Should we transform?

87
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.290
And the answer is, well, we don't know because the environment keeps changing.

88
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.560
So what do we do about that? We talk, oh,

89
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.880
I was on a CBC Canadian broadcasting corporation interview a couple of days ago.

90
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:15.490
And they took me to task. I tweeted out this, uh,

91
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.680
this invitation to the Keck boys to fill out this program that I developed

92
00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:24.550
called future authoring. And it helps people make a plan to get my boys. Yeah.

93
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.520
Well, they're, they're an online group. They're they're they,

94
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.690
they run Kekistani, it's this fictional polity.

95
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.670
It's a P it's a satire of identity politics, essentially. We're gonna,

96
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.690
we're going to be our ethnicity, highly demonized. Santa's highly demonized.

97
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.480
<v 1>With good reason for,</v>

98
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:48.250
with some individual examples of racism and Nazi-ism

99
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.770
and.

100
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.760
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. There's lots of misbehaves. It's like graffiti,</v>

101
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.300
it's like online graffiti, something like that. So, um, and,

102
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.620
and the Keck boys are the ones who are often using the Pepe memes, for example,

103
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:04.550
and you know, the left regards Pepe as a hate symbol, the frog Pepe,

104
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.240
the frog feels good. That's right. That's right. It kind of reprehensible frog.

105
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.730
And so I tweeted out to them. I said,

106
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.970
Keck boys seek your four Chan rescue yourself from

107
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:20.540
the underworld use code peppy for future three.

108
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.830
So it's free for one week. So they had to figure out what it meant.

109
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.080
And then I showed this picture of Michigan J frog,

110
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.630
which is the frog from old Warner brothers, cartoon dancing,

111
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:31.580
frog that wouldn't perform when he was watching it.

112
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.460
So CBC hauled that out and said, well, look,

113
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:39.320
aren't you aren't you like appealing to the radical, right? And I said,

114
00:06:39.321 --> 00:06:40.850
well, no, what I'm doing? I said, look,

115
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.140
these people are attracted by the radical, right?

116
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.790
Although they're satirists and juvenile satirists and graffiti types,

117
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:49.940
and they're playing a weird satirical game being naughty.

118
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.820
That's exactly what they're doing. They're they're provoking. And I,

119
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.440
my sense was, well,

120
00:06:54.441 --> 00:06:56.930
why don't you develop yourself as an individual and get the hell out of the

121
00:06:56.931 --> 00:07:00.980
ideological trap? So here's my program, which helps you write about your future.

122
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.430
And that'll help you decide who you are as an individual,

123
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.940
because that's the way out of the ideological trap. It's like,

124
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:11.000
and that's the way, obviously what's the way out of tribalism. First,

125
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.170
the way out of tribalism is not to never join a tribe.

126
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.610
You actually have to join a tribe as you mature, right? Because what happens is,

127
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.420
first of all, you're an infant. And then you have your parents to,

128
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.630
to make a relationship with. But then when you move from your parents,

129
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.200
you have your tribe, you have your group, maybe it's the music you listen to.

130
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.940
It's the gang. You hang around with whatever.

131
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.580
You have to be socialized into the tribe.

132
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.960
You have to cause otherwise you stay dependent infant. Okay.

133
00:07:38.961 --> 00:07:42.290
But now you're socialized into the tribe. While is that where it ends?

134
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.333
It's like, no.

135
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.900
The next thing to do is differentiate yourself from the tribe while still

136
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:50.270
knowing how to behave within the tribe. Well,

137
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.040
that's the call to individualism and that's,

138
00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:54.860
I think what the west got right is we figured that out. It's like,

139
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.390
you're more than your,

140
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.750
you have to be a member of a group because otherwise you're not socialized.

141
00:07:59.751 --> 00:08:03.320
You're not good for anyone. You don't have to be able to play on a team. Man,

142
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.160
you have to have team loyalty. Okay? But that, isn't where you should stop.

143
00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.030
You should take the next step and become a fully developed individual and

144
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.110
see the problem with being just a group member is that the group,

145
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.670
it's the problem with conservatism. The group is a fixed entity.

146
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.820
It has its rules and its regulations. And if you're a member,

147
00:08:22.821 --> 00:08:25.880
that's all you are, but the group can go badly wrong.

148
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:29.150
So the group needs individuals to keep the group alive and revivified.

149
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.570
So you have to become an individual. So you can, revivify the group.

150
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.980
And that's the cult.

151
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.570
That's the call in the west to heroism essentially to noble way of living is to

152
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.340
develop yourself past your group identity so that you can reconfigure the game

153
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.810
when that becomes necessary.

154
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.390
And I think that there's a very influential line of developmental psychology

155
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.200
pioneered by John Piaget that laid that out as a developmental,

156
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.560
what would progression first? You're

157
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.620
a child. Then you're a member of a group.

158
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.440
Then you're an individual it's like get to the individual level.

159
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.140
That's the solution. It's a solution to tribalism,

160
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.720
but you have to accept responsibility to do that.

161
00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.840
<v 1>And this is what your future authoring program is basically all about. I mean,</v>

162
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.910
it's, it's a wonderful program. It's, uh,

163
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:19.060
along with this book rules and guidelines for life,

164
00:09:19.061 --> 00:09:22.450
I think that's one of the things that a lot of young people are lacking is a

165
00:09:22.451 --> 00:09:26.860
structure to how to go about establishing who they are in the.

166
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.470
<v 0>Yeah. Well, that's, what's really cool. And it's been really quite remarkable.</v>

167
00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:36.370
I would say, is that what I've noticed when I've been speaking publicly,

168
00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:37.840
say over the last year and a half,

169
00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:43.090
because there's a hole in our culture where there should be a discussion about

170
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.950
maturity, truth and responsibility. No, one's talking about that. Okay.

171
00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:50.890
So now I'll come up and I'll start talking about that. I'll say, look like,

172
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.990
what should you do with your life? Well, take care of yourself,

173
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.370
but take care of yourself in a way that also means that simultaneously you're

174
00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:01.420
taking care of your family.

175
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.930
And that also means that simultaneously you're taking care of the broader

176
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:06.430
community. So that's kind of your goal.

177
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.190
So orient your self towards that personal success,

178
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.250
but in a way that your success breeds success.

179
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.020
Because if you're going to establish a name,

180
00:10:14.021 --> 00:10:16.840
why not establish like a really good aim? That's a good one. It's good for you.

181
00:10:16.841 --> 00:10:20.440
It's good for everyone else. Yes. Okay. That'll give you life.

182
00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:23.710
Some meaning now adopt make a plan, generate a vision.

183
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.280
That's what the future authoring program helps people with Mika develop a vision

184
00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:30.070
of what your life could be like. If, if it was worth living,

185
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:31.900
despite all its suffering, it's like,

186
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.570
what would you need so that you would be happy to be alive?

187
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.520
You'd find your life meaningful.

188
00:10:36.521 --> 00:10:39.400
So you don't get all bitter and resentful and cruel and hostile and

189
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:44.110
ideologically addled and like murderous and genocidal. It was like none of that,

190
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.723
you think real hard,

191
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.540
how would you have to configure your life so that despite its suffering and the

192
00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:52.480
malevolence, that's part of it that you would regard it as worthwhile,

193
00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.380
that's up to you to develop a vision, then put a plan into practice.

194
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.220
And so when I talk to people about this, and most of my audiences are young men,

195
00:11:00.221 --> 00:11:03.220
it's probably about 65, 35 more and more women are showing up.

196
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.640
But that's about what it is right now. The halls are dead silent.

197
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.980
You could hear a pin drop because nobody's said so clearly for like 50

198
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:15.730
years, that almost all the meaning that you will need to get you through.

199
00:11:15.731 --> 00:11:19.180
The hard times of your life is going to be a consequence of adopting

200
00:11:19.181 --> 00:11:23.620
responsibility, not of rights and impulsive action, impulsive freedom,

201
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.390
like fine rights. Yeah. Got it. Freedom.

202
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.290
No problem. Even freedom to do impulsive things fine. But that,

203
00:11:32.291 --> 00:11:36.160
isn't where you're going to find the meaning that keeps you sustained through

204
00:11:36.161 --> 00:11:40.630
the storms of life. That's going to be, you take care of yourself.

205
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:43.720
You take care of your intimate partner. You take care of your family.

206
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.570
You don't run off. You take care of your community.

207
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.820
You rescue the wisdom from the past.

208
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.010
You stand up straight and you be courageous.

209
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:54.790
Despite the fact that life is tragic. And by malevolence, it's like,

210
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:57.760
that's the that's ancient wisdom. That's what that is.
