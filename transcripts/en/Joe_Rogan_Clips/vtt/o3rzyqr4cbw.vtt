1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>The general good experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.020
I don't like when people are telling other people what to not to do.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.620
And it's based on their own personal ideology. I don't like.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.640
<v 1>It. I don't like it at all either. Cause I'm, I'm, I'm very much of look,</v>

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.350
you do what you want to do with your life.

6
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.680
As long as it doesn't interfere with mine or step on any of my, my rights.

7
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.240
We're good. How Texas have you.

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.490
<v 2>Texas through it through brother texted, born and raised. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.210
<v 0>It's a great place. So this,</v>

10
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:32.030
this is my two positions that I was saying before. So number one, position,

11
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:36.800
I am 100% in favor of law enforcement and I think they need to be better

12
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:38.630
trained. And I think you need to get rid of those bad.

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.570
I think there's a lot of them. I think there's a lot of bad cops.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.350
<v 1>And I got to get this off because this,</v>

15
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.010
this is something that me off a little bit. That is a nuance perspective.

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.150
However, on social media and in general,

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.070
the idea of having a nuanced perspective on a particular issue is so far gone.

18
00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:02.840
Now that you can't even really have a conversation. I can say in one breath,

19
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.850
I am pro cop. I am pro cop. I have a lot of friends who are cops. However,

20
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.230
there are also a good number of them who are evil as were probably racist and

21
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:13.730
need to be dissolved.

22
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.090
<v 0>Sociopath, psychopaths, murderers. Yes.</v>

23
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.920
<v 1>But some reason it's either, Nope. Either all cops are bad or they're all good.</v>

24
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.060
And that's what I can't get down with. You can't.

25
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.730
<v 0>Get down with that. And I'm with you. I think we can also say in one breath,</v>

26
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.840
I'm pro cop, but I'm also pro these peaceful protests.

27
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.250
I think these peaceful protests are important. And there was some, I mean,

28
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:39.500
maybe I did a bad job of explaining what I was trying to say,

29
00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:41.630
but whatever basketball player was mad at me the other day,

30
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.000
cause it was something that I said that I think a lot of these people are

31
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.970
fighting like an invisible enemy when they're, when they're protesting.

32
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.800
What I mean by that is yes, we need bad cops. Yes.

33
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.660
Cops should stop shooting. Whether it's black people or white people.

34
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.940
<v 1>The wrong reason that people, because people love too. I remember our last,</v>

35
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.390
our last segment, we made a mistake verbally and people jumped on it.

36
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.610
You said we need bad cops. Yeah.

37
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.940
<v 0>Is that a really imagine saying I'm dumb. We need bad cops. We need cops.</v>

38
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.910
We need good cops. But there,

39
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.580
and there's definitely bad cops and bad cops that shoot people,

40
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.760
whatever race they are are terrible.

41
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.460
Clearly there's a problem with cops shooting black people. Yeah.

42
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.230
Clearly there's also statistically not even just shooting people. If we,

43
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.840
if you look at the, see, if you look at the, the, the, the, the,

44
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.650
the deaths statistics for cops and black people,

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.600
there's a thing that people like to do where they say, well, actually,

46
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:40.940
cops shoot more white people than black people.

47
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.870
Let's say there are more white people.

48
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.060
But the other thing that I think is as important,

49
00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:50.900
if not more important is cops or physical with black people more than they are

50
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:54.350
white people, cops are physical with brown people, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans.

51
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.260
They're, they're physical with them more than they are white people,

52
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:01.510
statistically, by as much or more than 25%. Yeah. There is a problem.

53
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.753
Also,

54
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.770
there's a problem with people that don't know what they want.

55
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.560
They just think that getting defunding, the cops are bad.

56
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.020
This is what I meant by fighting an invisible enemy.

57
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:17.350
I just did a job of explaining it to you.

58
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.820
The thing we should want is a safe community,

59
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.580
including people that get pulled over by cops. Yeah.

60
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.090
So that's the one thing that needs to be addressed first. Right?

61
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.140
Get rid of the bad cops, fund them better. Train them better. Yeah.

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.770
And we should, we should all want this. This shouldn't this defund,

63
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.680
the cop is crazy. A lot.

64
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.860
<v 1>Of its movement has been co-opted by.</v>

65
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.480
And I always, always hesitate because I, like I said,

66
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:47.760
I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I have to call a spade a spade.

67
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.650
There were a lot, there are a lot of suburbs.

68
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.790
There's a subversive group in this country that wants to topple the current

69
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:57.360
structure of the United States so that they can gain power because they think

70
00:03:57.361 --> 00:03:58.770
they can rule better. Yeah.

71
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.120
And a lot of those people generally speaking are Marxist. Yes.

72
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.450
That's pretty much it there. That's why like I make a delineation.

73
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:08.550
When people ask me about black lives matter, for instance,

74
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.210
black lives matter to the sentiment I can get down with black lives matter the

75
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.980
organization I can not. And why is that?

76
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.630
Because they are not for the same thing. So we're not the leader. The,

77
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.720
the founders of black men, like the founders of black lives matters,

78
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.640
literally just came out and basically said, she's a trademark.

79
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.870
She didn't basically said, she said, blatantly, she's a trained Marxist. She,

80
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.920
the, both of them, the founders of black lives matter are these, the same.

81
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.850
<v 0>Folks that went on stage with Bernie Sanders at one time, I believe so.</v>

82
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.650
Don't quote me on that and took the mic from him.

83
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.920
<v 1>The two women are, who are, who were the founders of black lives, matters.</v>

84
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:42.810
The organization, they are trained.

85
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.300
Marxist said it with her own mouth on the show.

86
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.640
<v 0>And what, so what is their goal? What do they want?</v>

87
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.420
<v 1>Or what do marches one, they want to top of the current structure they utilize.</v>

88
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.290
They have, they have their use. So speak. They're useful idiots that create,

89
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.550
they create chaos.

90
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.490
It's a top of whatever structures in place so that they can come in,

91
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.390
fill the vacuum.

92
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.880
And then what do they do with the useless CA what did they do with the useful

93
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:06.510
idiots? They dispose of them because they are rebellious in nature.

94
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:09.360
And thus will top all the power structure that's in place then. So.

95
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.090
<v 0>Who were the useful idiots that you think that they.</v>

96
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.900
<v 1>Are useful?</v>

97
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.340
The people running around spraying black lives matters while

98
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.270
riding and looting. Yes. Not protesting, but riding.

99
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.050
<v 0>And looting. That's the distinction. And this is what I did a job explaining.</v>

100
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.290
There's a lot of people that are out there protesting.

101
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.840
I don't necessarily think they understand what,

102
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.670
like what needs to be done,

103
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.440
what needs to be done to keep us safe is not defunding the police.

104
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.390
<v 3>Right now. It needs to be done. Maybe.</v>

105
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.780
<v 0>They need to go through the police department with a fine tooth comb.</v>

106
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.710
And every one of these that has multiple complaints, just get rid of them. Yeah.

107
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.670
Just get rid of, find out what the is going on. Yeah. If there,

108
00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:52.680
if the multiple complaints don't make sense, then leave them alone.

109
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.550
But find out like that guy, that guy that killed that guy.

110
00:05:56.551 --> 00:06:00.110
And look for anybody who could do that to a person who can lean on a person's

111
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:03.500
neck like that, someone's wrong with you. Something's wrong with you.

112
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:05.180
And you should have never been a cop in the first place.

113
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.420
And we all know that there are people like that when you talk to people that are

114
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.620
in the military, there are folks that they have to work with that are sociopath,

115
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.750
and they hope that Bud's training.

116
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.660
And that seal training is going to weed those guys out of the ranger training or

117
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.420
whatever, whatever the it is that they have to do. But it doesn't always,

118
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.403
doesn't always,

119
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.410
and sometimes they get in a situation and Jocko was talking about how you'll get

120
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:28.580
an entire seal team that they have to disband and re and,

121
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.550
and reset up because they have bad leadership.

122
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.000
And so you did the same guys and they come in with good leadership and they get

123
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.660
trained correctly. And it turns around and it turns out, you know, look, look,

124
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:41.270
if we, if we joined some sort of a military group and you're,

125
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:45.530
you're being led by some piece of, commander, what do you do?

126
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.340
Where do you go? And your faith in the whole entire organization is.

127
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.130
So a lot of this stuff is top down.

128
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.520
So you have a lot of these cops that are in these bad neighborhoods.

129
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:57.410
And they've been dealing with corruption for there's a,

130
00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:59.480
there's a movie called the seven five.

131
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:03.800
And it's about the 75th precinct in New York. And Michael Dowd,

132
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.300
who is one of the guys in the movie was a bad cop. And he's out now.

133
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:11.210
And he did time and like that, but it's a crazy movie.

134
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:14.990
And I had him on the podcast, but his first day on the job,

135
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.670
did they throw a dude off a balcony or some like that?

136
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.730
And he was told to shut his mouth. Something happened like first day on the job,

137
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.720
he re he witnessed some crazy. And they were, he was basically told, Hey,

138
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.060
this is how we do. Like, get all that goody, two shoes, Dragnet,

139
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.610
out of your head. This is how we do things here.

140
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.620
And so then you're indoctrinated into this force that's already. And.

141
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.540
<v 1>I think that's where a lot of people kind of, uh,</v>

142
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:43.000
that's why I think a lot of people come from when they talk about the systemic

143
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:44.590
aspect of this, right? It's,

144
00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:47.230
it's that culture that breeds the mentality that says, all right,

145
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:49.870
this is the way things are going to be done. So you either, either get,

146
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.900
either get out or you lay down. Right. Right. And so that,

147
00:07:52.901 --> 00:07:54.100
and so in a lot of that,

148
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:56.770
that responsibility is born on the leadership in these places.

149
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.480
And that's what needs to happen.

150
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.480
There needs to be a restructuring and reorganization of the leadership from a

151
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.870
top down perspective that I do believe. And I agree with you.

152
00:08:04.871 --> 00:08:07.780
I'm like you got a guy who has multiple, multiple complaints. I mean,

153
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.700
at a certain point where there's smoke,

154
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.120
there's probably gonna be some fire somewhere. And so at that point,

155
00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:16.240
if you can't really reasonably justify why this person is getting a lot of

156
00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:17.860
complaints and it, like you said,

157
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.020
if it doesn't make sense why they're going to plankton. Okay, cool.

158
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.220
But if you're like, all right,

159
00:08:21.221 --> 00:08:24.940
this just seems real suspect either do a deeper investigation of it or get rid

160
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:25.774
of them. Yeah.

161
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.620
<v 0>And there's a problem with most people when you give them ultimate power over</v>

162
00:08:29.621 --> 00:08:32.200
someone else. And it's not just the power of having a gun,

163
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.760
it's the power of being able to tell someone, do what I'm telling you to do.

164
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.200
There's a crazy video.

165
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:42.010
I watched the other day of a white guy pulling over another white guy.

166
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.620
And he's telling the guy get out of the car and the guys, well,

167
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:46.570
why do you want me to get out of the car? He goes,

168
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.800
cause I'm telling you to get out of the car. And he pulls out his,

169
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:52.300
his pepper spray and he goes, Hey man, he goes, I'm going, I'm speeding.

170
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.410
I'm going five miles an hour over it. He goes, stop filming. He goes,

171
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:57.140
I don't have to stop filming. And he goes,

172
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.490
and why you pointing your pepper spray at me? And he goes,

173
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:01.350
if you don't get out of the car, I'm going to hit you with it.

174
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.800
And so this is back and forth with this guy and he goes to hit it. He goes,

175
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.740
it's out. You're lucky. This is your lucky day. He goes, no, he goes,

176
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:10.890
you're crazy. He's like, you're, you're going to pepper spray me.

177
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.870
Cause I'm going five miles an hour over the speed limit.

178
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.330
So this is an example of a person who should never be in a position of having

179
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.450
ultimate power over someone that like that is that if a guy was a really good

180
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:24.540
cop was a veteran, he would've been able to diffuse a situation.

181
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.240
He would have walked up to him. And how you doing, sir? Uh,

182
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:29.070
you know why I pulled you over? You're going a little bit fast.

183
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:31.050
You're going five miles an hour over the speed limit, blah, blah, blah,

184
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.990
whatever it was. You don't point pepper spray at a guy who just,

185
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.710
just because he's filming you when he's filming you, he's allowed to do that.

186
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.460
That's you, you, this is like an audition for you to keep your job.

187
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.530
That's what it is. Like do a good job right there. Cause you're,

188
00:09:45.531 --> 00:09:46.950
you're going to get on the internet right now.

189
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.600
And there's a lot of people that are on the internet.

190
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.170
There was a horrible one that I watched where this guy was in this verbal

191
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:55.230
altercation with this woman. And it wasn't heated.

192
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.680
She didn't do anything wrong and he's, he's yelling. She's not listening.

193
00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.920
So he grabs her rag, dolls, her to the ground face,

194
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:04.170
plants her and gets her in the rear naked choke.

195
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:08.340
And he's screaming at her and these other terrible rear naked choke too.

196
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.120
And these other people are standing by watching this and filming it.

197
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:17.670
And it's madness. This is a terrible way to handle the situation.

198
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:22.650
Just a person who's either got PTSD or he's all up. And my buddy, Joe,

199
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.000
she's a person, just a person who happens to get this job now. Guess what?

200
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:28.880
Here's the other problem. Who's going to be a cop.

201
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.450
<v 1>Now. That's the thing. Who's going to be a cop. I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

202
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:34.700
I wouldn't want to be a cop, right? I wouldn't want to be a cop now.

203
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.900
<v 3>Man. I can only imagine.</v>

204
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.120
<v 1>I think the problem is,</v>

205
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.190
is like people don't understand like the relationship between community and

206
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.830
police should be a symbiotic relationship. That's, that's what it should be.

207
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.800
Because even the Saint to the same degree, there needs to be training.

208
00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:51.410
I think there needs to be training, not mandated training,

209
00:10:51.411 --> 00:10:54.470
but people should be on a cognitive. Especially if I I's a gun owner,

210
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.340
someone who carries a gun on me, 99% of the time in my car, on my body,

211
00:10:58.341 --> 00:10:59.174
on my person,

212
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.350
I should understand the dynamics that a police officer is looking at me from and

213
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.600
dealing with people who carry guns and vice-versa.

214
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.540
So the officer needs to be an understanding and be aware of the fact that, okay,

215
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.210
you're living in a population where people carry firearms.

216
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.690
So the idea of the presence of a firearm in the hands of civilians should not

217
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:18.050
terrify you that much. It just shouldn't. Now I get it.

218
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.650
There are bad apples all over the place. Thus that brings it full circle.

219
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.160
Me as a citizen should understand that because there are certain people who are

220
00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:29.090
bad apples who carry firearms that are interacting with the cops. It may be,

221
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.420
it may want to do ill will towards the cops that I, as a citizen,

222
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.280
should understand and have the responsibility. It says, all right,

223
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.220
there are certain things I'm going to do whenever I'm interacting with the cop

224
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.280
that signals to them, Hey, I mean you no harm. I mean, you know, threat,

225
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.360
I get pulled over. I, I, the first thing I do is I pull over,

226
00:11:44.361 --> 00:11:45.081
roll the windows down.

227
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:48.590
I have my ID and I have my concealed carry license in hand. Right.

228
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.880
Everything I'm doing is just to put the cop at ease. I'm demonstrating the cop.

229
00:11:52.881 --> 00:11:56.830
Look, I understand you don't know who I am. I don't know who you are. Right.

230
00:11:56.831 --> 00:12:00.280
So we're going to give each other this mutual respect that says, all right,

231
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.660
as long as you respect me, I'm going to respect you. And generally speaking,

232
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.060
though, I speed a lot.

233
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.400
You get cops recognizing you. I have, it's like 50, 50. Oh,

234
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.670
that's a lot. Yeah, it is a lot actually.

235
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:23.380
And the funny thing is the best time was I was in a car at the

236
00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:27.550
time I was, I was in the car with, uh, with my acceptance.

237
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.130
She was my girlfriend, my then girlfriend. And then one of her best friends.

238
00:12:30.131 --> 00:12:34.690
And we were driving back from Houston. And so I was speeding. And so I think,

239
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:38.170
I think I had like a M six at the time. And so I was speeding and he was like,

240
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:42.250
you need to slow down. I'm like, shut up. I'm so going home.

241
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.660
And then I get pulled over and then I get pulled over and they're laughing.

242
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:46.810
They're.

243
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.650
<v 3>Like, ha ha. We told you you idiot. Ha ha ha ha.</v>

244
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.790
<v 1>And so I'm sitting there and I'm like, I got egg on my face and. And um,</v>

245
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.940
cop comes over and he's like, he's like, yeah, you know, I'm getting, you know,

246
00:12:57.941 --> 00:13:00.700
I do what I normally do. All the windows down handed my, my driver's license.

247
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:04.780
He goes to, he goes to the runs, my information, come back. He's like.

248
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.630
<v 3>You know, there might be a weird question, but you don't call me on the car.</v>

249
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.480
I was like, yeah. And he's like, oh man, I.

250
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.130
<v 0>Thought it was,</v>

251
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.610
this is why it's a question because your ID is different because you're my real

252
00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:20.880
name is Collins. Yeah. But do you give out your real name?

253
00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.590
<v 1>Um, I give out my real first name.</v>

254
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.650
I don't give out my last name because I don't want to have to shoot anybody.

255
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:30.210
I'm being dead serious. I mean, I get, I get a lot of weird stuff, so yeah.

256
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.910
And I don't, I mean, look, if you want to find my real name, you can find,

257
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.480
you can pull up on Wikipedia, but um, I don't want to make it easy for you,

258
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.480
but I mean, if you want to have those problems, let's me have at it. But,

259
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.440
and it could've had people threatened me before by over what?

260
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.710
Just my stance and things like that. I've had people threatening.

261
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.900
<v 0>You for your stance on responsible gun ownership. They want to shoot you.</v>

262
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.630
You don't understand. It's so rude. It's so ridiculous.

263
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.380
<v 1>I don't understand it, but you have. But I mean,</v>

264
00:13:55.381 --> 00:13:59.850
there are a lot of psychos out there and even anti gunners can be psychosis.

265
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.120
This.

266
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.320
<v 0>Is the,</v>

267
00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.080
I've had this conversation about you with people that are not gun owners that

268
00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:05.850
don't like guns. And I said, listen,

269
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.280
there are people out there like yourself that are the best example of

270
00:14:11.281 --> 00:14:15.630
what you would hope for a gun owner. And if you're that's your neighbor,

271
00:14:15.631 --> 00:14:18.600
you should be happy that that guy's armed. If some goes down,

272
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:23.040
you need someone to help you. You want people to be able to help themselves.

273
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:24.293
But back then in my neighborhood,

274
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.300
I think people are going to have a different attitude about this with all this

275
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.950
defund, the police talk, I really do. And th the looting and the, and,

276
00:14:30.951 --> 00:14:35.070
and not only that, but here in Santa Monica, they have police, right?

277
00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:37.230
The police are there and they were told to stand down.

278
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.630
They were told to stand there while people were alluding.

279
00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.330
<v 1>I think another thing too, there, I think there is a, uh,</v>

280
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.840
a semantics issue going on with the defund, the police,

281
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.130
at least from what I'm seeing.

282
00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.050
Because initially when I heard about the diff on the police, what's up,

283
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.680
what the hell are y'all talking about? Like, we can't be this stupid,

284
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.180
I guess there is a segment that's even within the fund to police,

285
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:58.880
there are different sex. There are the people who are like, no,

286
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:03.800
we just need to reallocate certain portions of the funding for police in

287
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:06.920
different places. And then there are people who are like, no,

288
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:10.520
we just need to absolve all police, take away the funding and get rid of.

289
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.490
<v 2>Them. Those people are out of luck, but here's a.</v>

290
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.270
<v 1>Funny thing about that. Let's take what's going on in Seattle and Chaz.</v>

291
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:23.150
And how fast do we realize within a blink of an eye that

292
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.810
crime is going to happen? It doesn't matter what, it doesn't matter.

293
00:15:26.811 --> 00:15:29.660
What type of utopia you think you're going to establish there.

294
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.100
We're going to be messed up people. Well,

295
00:15:31.101 --> 00:15:33.950
someone got shot there yesterday being in it. And from what I hear,

296
00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:37.550
it was pretty much a hit. Was it? I think not the one from yesterday,

297
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:38.384
but the one before that,

298
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.390
cause there was another shooting and apparently it seemed like it was a hit.

299
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:44.780
Like they were looking for this person and they went to kill them. And I'm like,

300
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.330
you were supposed to, Chaz was supposed to be this utopia, no cops, no money.

301
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.050
All of it. And within a blink of an eye, what do you have? Well, no,

302
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.540
they also don't have.

303
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.260
<v 0>Hospitals in Chaz. Right? Like what are you going to do? If someone does get.</v>

304
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.093
<v 1>Shot,</v>

305
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.130
somebody bled out because cause the cops probably don't want to go in there.

306
00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.630
Yeah. Well they wouldn't let him in when I saw, yeah, this is not going to end.

307
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.120
<v 0>Well folks, it's not, it's not going to end. Well, the,</v>

308
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:14.920
the way to handle this in my opinion is to fix the tr

309
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:19.810
the current structure to do it in a logical way. That makes sense. Yeah.

310
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.340
It's not to take everything down.

311
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:24.490
So to take this back to what you were saying about black lives matter,

312
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:28.060
don't you think there's probably people in black lives matter who don't have

313
00:16:28.061 --> 00:16:31.150
these sort of Marxist ideas. They just don't want black people getting shot.

314
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.410
<v 3>Absolutely. Absolutely. The sentiment of black lives matter. I am all for it.</v>

315
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:37.750
I'm on it. I'm all for it.

316
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.460
<v 1>The organization though,</v>

317
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.510
that's the problem I have because they're essentially the leadership of this.

318
00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.790
<v 0>So you think that the leadership has,</v>

319
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.990
I think they have like a remote secret motive that the people that are involved

320
00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:51.190
that are doing all the groundwork.

321
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.660
<v 1>No, they're not. And I did a whole video about it.</v>

322
00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.900
Cause I remember I remember black lives matter and it was a video I did,

323
00:16:58.901 --> 00:17:00.540
I think two years ago, black.

324
00:17:00.541 --> 00:17:02.980
I remember liking this is when I was with the NRA and black lives matter was

325
00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.740
attacking me NRA basically saying, um,

326
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.950
that they don't really care about black gun ownership, so forth and so on.

327
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.330
It was like an attack piece.

328
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.270
And I think it was the branch of black lives matter. That's here in LA actually.

329
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:18.520
And so I did a response video and I, and I, and I, and I w it was like a 15,

330
00:17:18.521 --> 00:17:21.760
20 minute video and I broke it down systematically. I'm like, alright, well,

331
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:25.300
okay. We started off with black lives matter because of police brutality.

332
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.900
<v 3>Cool. I'm all for it. But what has happened now,</v>

333
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.270
all of a sudden they get this massive wave of funding.

334
00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:31.921
<v 1>And,</v>

335
00:17:31.921 --> 00:17:36.250
and their whole direction shifts into some other stuff that I have no idea what

336
00:17:36.251 --> 00:17:38.770
it has to do with anything with respect to now,

337
00:17:38.771 --> 00:17:43.720
it's become this kind of like all encompassing umbrella of LGBTQ and some other

338
00:17:43.721 --> 00:17:46.540
stuff. But then, and then even aspects of, I guess,

339
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.700
I don't want to say Antifa is under the umbrella,

340
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.000
but the whole Marx has kind of communist socialist aspects of politics,

341
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:55.470
kind of creeping into that as well.

342
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.790
And then when you couple that with the idea that you have the actual founders

343
00:17:58.791 --> 00:18:00.180
saying that they are trained in Marxism,

344
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:04.860
and then you have what you see now playing out where you have these very

345
00:18:04.861 --> 00:18:09.030
peaceful protests being co-opted by violent people who are now just engaging in

346
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:12.150
writing and looting, and then branding it black lives matter.

347
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.720
They're wolves hating their wolves, hiding amongst.

348
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.160
<v 0>Sheep. I think there's, there's a bunch of things happen at the same time.</v>

349
00:18:19.161 --> 00:18:20.780
And I think when it comes to the riding alluding,

350
00:18:20.781 --> 00:18:22.560
I think there's a lot of just opportunists. No,

351
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.920
I don't think they're necessarily that organized.

352
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.950
<v 1>Yeah. Some of it is organized. I do believe that. And then I do,</v>

353
00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.550
and you're right, because there was a lake, for instance, in Dallas, in Dallas,

354
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.760
when the coffee shops that I go to all the time, he was telling me he was like,

355
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.150
you know, all the windows were broken out. And really, he was like,

356
00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.360
they really was just a bunch of kids just running around,

357
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.520
taking advantage of the chaos and just kind of breaking away. You have.

358
00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.340
<v 0>To take into consideration these kids haven't worked in three months. Yeah.</v>

359
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.800
They're probably broke as and looking for free. Yep.

360
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:51.770
There's a ton of them and there's just opportunists.

361
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.390
And you saw that in New York, for sure.

362
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.960
<v 1>Yeah. I'm pretty sure y'all had that here too. Yeah, for sure. For.</v>

363
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.900
<v 0>Sure. But the crazy thing about New York is, um,</v>

364
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.370
a lot of it was apartment buildings filming down on the streets because you

365
00:19:04.371 --> 00:19:07.910
know, in New York, everyone's in Honduras. Yeah. So they're filming,

366
00:19:07.911 --> 00:19:10.970
there's so many videos of people filming on the streets while all of this

367
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.990
madness is going,

368
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:15.470
this is one crazy video where all these people breaking into and this guy runs

369
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:17.720
his treat and another guy hits him with a car and he goes flying to the,

370
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.210
and the car takes off, bro. It's mad.

371
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.290
And then they're just smashing through Soho and breaking into art galleries and

372
00:19:24.291 --> 00:19:26.210
stealing everything. And like, it's.

373
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:29.450
<v 1>It's new, but it also bodes the question.</v>

374
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:33.890
When you have chaos, you inevitably will get destruction.

375
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.460
Yes. That's. I mean, that's, that's what happens,

376
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.100
which is why you need structure, which is why you need to keep in mind.

377
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.640
I am no fan of big government. I'll be the first one to tell you,

378
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.990
I am no fan of big government. However you do. Yeah.
