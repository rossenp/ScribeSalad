00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.763
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.560
What do you think of all this Pentagon UFO we've recovered crafts,

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:08.550
not of this world.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.450
<v 1>Uh, okay. Yeah, I think, um, two things I think again,</v>

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.520
can always be true at the same time. Um,

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.250
I don't think we're the only intelligent life out there. I mean,

7
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:23.030
I'm classifying us as intelligent. Um, but, um,

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.680
I also don't think we're hiding some alien spacecraft somewhere.

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.060
Um, so.

10
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.400
<v 0>Why do you think the Pentagon would come out and say something like that?</v>

11
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.810
<v 1>Well, I, I think w um, look we did, uh, with, with, uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.200
he comes up here, comes a pitch for my show, um,

13
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.110
for black folks to classify black fellows to class. So black.

14
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.870
<v 0>Files declassified. And how could one watch this show? Oh.</v>

15
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.350
<v 1>God, that was a good first season. Wasn't it? Um,</v>

16
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.120
it was on discovery on science channel.

17
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.760
<v 0>Discovery. I love the science channel.</v>

18
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.760
<v 1>We did an episode on, on, uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.940
advanced aeronautics threat identification program, a tip,

20
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.960
which was the Pentagon's admitted, you know, came out and said, yes, we have a,

21
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.260
uh, a program that we ran a program it's no longer in existence called ATP,

22
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.270
which was designed to identify, uh, unidentified aviation threats,

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.660
basically. So it's not talking about UFO's necessarily. It could be Austel,

24
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.630
you know, prototype aircraft that, you know, it was what, what is the.

25
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.830
<v 0>I talked to commander Fravor, David Fravor,</v>

26
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.880
David was in here and he explained his incident off of the coast of San

27
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:28.580
Diego. And he said they track this thing.

28
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:33.410
It dropped from 60,000 feet to one foot above the sea in a second.

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.110
Yeah, he wasn't, it wasn't just him seeing this. Right.

30
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.430
There was a radar operators.

31
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.420
<v 1>On board and, uh, his wing man. Exactly. Yeah. So,</v>

32
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.370
but I think, um, they.

33
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.960
<v 0>Said it was tracking them and then it actually actively blocked their tracking.</v>

34
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.560
<v 1>And then no, no visible means of propulsion. Exactly.</v>

35
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.590
<v 0>No fault, no heat signal.</v>

36
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.180
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, so I think it's look and he's a very credible he's is credible.</v>

37
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.110
Right. And, and so, uh.

38
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.950
<v 0>I mean, not the only one. Yeah. Not everything. I mean,</v>

39
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:10.070
but what do you think of that? Yeah. Uh, well I think, um,

40
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.520
yeah, I think.

41
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.270
<v 2>We don't, we here's what I think, I think we, we.</v>

42
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.950
<v 1>Haven't resolved that issue. We don't know there was no, uh,</v>

43
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.600
uh, final report that gave some sort of conclusive evidence that said,

44
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:30.080
this is what this identity or this object was. Um,

45
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.340
it is considered still to this day to be an anomaly, perhaps, you know,

46
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.650
they don't, they just know clarification,

47
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.810
which is interesting and all by itself. And again,

48
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.570
kind of goes back to this look, we, the only intelligent people. No,

49
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.900
but do I think that the government is capable all

50
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.650
these years of holding a secret like that? No, I really don't. I think there's,

51
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.070
there's a much like with MK ultra or anything else,

52
00:02:55.071 --> 00:03:00.010
I get eventually hits the fan stuff comes out and I don't think the

53
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.190
I'm not one of those. And I, I say this and I'm sure a lot of people disagree,

54
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:04.024
but, uh,

55
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.000
I just don't think that the government's capable of keeping secrets for the

56
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.240
longterm. Certainly not at this magnitude. Um,

57
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.440
but I think there are certainly things that have happened that we, uh,

58
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.280
can't explain and, and one of them would be the setting by Fravor. Yeah. Yeah.

59
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.930
So, um, but materials, you know, materials that,

60
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.360
that aren't, uh, you know, uh,

61
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.080
from earth look, hits the earth from space all the time.

62
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.600
And that qualifies as a material.

63
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.830
<v 0>That is not found. Right. Well, okay.</v>

64
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.830
They said they've recovered crafts, not from this world.

65
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.450
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.400
I'd like to I'd I would want to sit down with the individual saying that and

67
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.080
say, okay, clarify.

68
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.900
<v 0>This. Please want to take them to one of them brothel. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.</v>

69
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.920
I absolutely, I sit there with the CD behind that mirror. It was like, okay,

70
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:01.320
man, do what you really say, go.

71
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.320
<v 1>Bring one of those hookers in from the sixties, but now.</v>

72
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.150
<v 0>No, no, no. Don't do that to her. Or, you know, uh,</v>

73
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.180
no, though, what, what, you know,

74
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:15.360
what is actually happening and why would they come out with a statement like

75
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:15.810
that?

76
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.110
<v 1>Well, I'm going to tell you something it's between you and me, uh,</v>

77
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.030
is a second season of black files declassify. We're going to be looking at that.

78
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.810
Why do you think I do now?

79
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.930
I don't know what the that's that's the big question is why would they say that?

80
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.710
And, um, I don't have an answer for that. I don't, I don't know.

81
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.530
And that's why I say it it's a shocker.

82
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.080
It definitely bears further investigation that goes without saying.

83
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.610
<v 0>There was a thing that was coming, they would want to prepare people.</v>

84
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.710
And I think if you wanted to prepare people,

85
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:51.360
the best way to prepare people is to slowly give them signs that some is about

86
00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:52.194
to go down.

87
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.180
And one of the best ways to say we have found things that are not of this

88
00:04:57.181 --> 00:05:01.290
world. Okay. Think about that for a little while. We'll see. In a few months,

89
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.810
a few months, a few months of accepting that without any,

90
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.800
see there's no, there's no event, right? It's just a statement.

91
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.600
What was the exact wording? That's fine. We bring that up. Yeah, here it is.

92
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.340
Yeah. Crashes.

93
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.180
Harry Reed said he believed crashes of vehicles from other worlds had occurred

94
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.340
and that retrieved materials had been studied secretly for decades. Now,

95
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.150
you know, Bob loser, do you know, the story of Bob was our Bibles are,

96
00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:35.040
was in here. And he, he said some things that were ridiculed,

97
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.410
but turned to be turned out to be absolutely true.

98
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.740
One of the things that he said was that there was this element,

99
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.600
this element one 15,

100
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.340
and that they had figured out a way to stabilize this element in these other

101
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:47.761
planets.

102
00:05:47.761 --> 00:05:52.680
And that's what they used to propel these vehicles with a different kind of

103
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:55.350
propulsion that manipulated gravity.

104
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.620
And it essentially had some sort of a warp where they, they didn't,

105
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.341
they,

106
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:05.330
they weren't subject to the same laws of physics with this propulsion system

107
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:09.710
that we are with what we have, which is just igniting fuel and, you know,

108
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.120
pushing the explosion, pushes the, the rocket right into, into this,

109
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.280
the space, which.

110
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.980
<v 1>Could explain sort of the, the, the Fravor siding. Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.410
<v 0>He, and the way he described these vehicles in the 1980s and the early</v>

112
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:27.760
1990s is exactly the way favors vehicle worked.

113
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.640
Exactly why, the way the gimbal video worked,

114
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.420
these things for whatever reason they fly one way.

115
00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:37.600
And then they turn sideways. Like, like if you had a plate,

116
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:42.820
the plate turns up and down and then that's the way it

117
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:45.610
travels. And then somehow or another that's,

118
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.670
that's how it travels insanely fast that it,

119
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.480
it does something to manipulate gravity around. It sounds super weird,

120
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:56.530
but the fact that this guy talked about this in the early nineties,

121
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.240
and then this is the exact video, the dependent gon refers to the,

122
00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:04.780
you actually see these objects that they can't explain that don't give off a

123
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:09.520
heat signal that move in this exact same way at spectacular rates of speed.

124
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.910
And then that's how the tick-tock craft work. Right.

125
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.280
<v 1>Well, I mean, w yeah, I, I, yeah. It's, yeah,</v>

126
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.910
there's a, there's a leap there necessarily, right. You got to make, I.

127
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.180
<v 0>Don't want to make that leap either. I know what you're saying for years.</v>

128
00:07:25.181 --> 00:07:26.140
I was like, it's all horse.

129
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.810
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I'm not, you know, again, not saying it couldn't happen,</v>

130
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.600
I'm just saying there's certain parts of the cycle. Like, okay,

131
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.960
how are we talking about it? Well, look, Harry Reed was, you know, was, uh,

132
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.040
he was very interested in this stuff. I mean, he, you know, he, uh,

133
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.570
allocated some, some federal funds, uh, to one of his buddies and, and, uh,

134
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.040
Nevada, you know, create a, uh, sort of, uh, a center, you know,

135
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:52.750
for examining this and for developing space exploration

136
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:56.800
capabilities. Um, so Harry Reed is certainly interested in us. They,

137
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:03.430
I talked to Lou Elizondo who ran a tip. Right. And

138
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.030
you don't really get that answer when you say, okay,

139
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.740
Lou was a tip holding on to materials, you know, that,

140
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.330
uh, came from, uh, alien craft. Um,

141
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.333
no.

142
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.610
<v 0>You know, it wasn't a tip that was involved in that.</v>

143
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.420
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, no, that's okay. Yeah. I get that. And again, I guess,</v>

144
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.720
I guess what I'm saying is I'm, I'm open to say, yeah, fine. Like anything can,

145
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.110
anything's possible, I suppose, in this world, uh,

146
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.750
things that I do know is it's, you know, it's,

147
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.650
I have a really hard time believing the government could keep this all buttoned

148
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.820
up over a period of time. Um, and, uh,

149
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:43.780
genuine.

150
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:48.640
<v 0>Ridicule factor board that would help. I mean, that's,</v>

151
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:50.980
that's a part of the whole, thing's about all,

152
00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:53.290
all the UFO stories are so ridiculous.

153
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.760
<v 1>Well, that's why, um, you know, that's what I set up a trip to begin with,</v>

154
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.900
right. Was so, you know, that they could have sort of a legitimate outlet,

155
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.860
um, and a place for this to go, but yeah, Fravor himself talks about it. Look,

156
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:07.890
it's not in their best interest to, to get back on the carrier and say,

157
00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:12.540
by the way, we responded unidentified flying objects. Um,

158
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:17.190
but they did. And, um, yeah. And, and you're right.

159
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:17.731
So that's the,

160
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:21.900
the natural tendency is to kind of look the other way or roll your eyes and

161
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:24.600
that's, and that can act as a deterrent.

162
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:27.143
<v 2>Yeah. I, I.</v>

163
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.090
<v 1>You know, I don't know. I just, but I do think that, um,</v>

164
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.420
it bears further investigation. There's no doubt about that. Um,

165
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.260
and I think that the ATF program, uh,

166
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.540
that the Pentagon was running, you know,

167
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:43.590
for the minimal cost of that compared to the cost of another air asset, or,

168
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.980
you know, platform of some sort, I think they should have kept it going. Right.

169
00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.880
And they should have normalized to some degree because it's in our national

170
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.430
security interest to know, have the Russians,

171
00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:56.640
or have others developed materials, right. Or propulsions,

172
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:59.280
everybody's working on new propulsion systems, right.

173
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:03.300
Everybody that has the ability and the resources. So hypersonic craft,

174
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.240
or that's, that's just common, right. That's that's gonna happen.

175
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:10.980
And whoever wins that particular race is going to be further up the food chain

176
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:11.814
than everybody else.

177
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.170
So it's in our national interest to be exploring any

178
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.330
legitimate or potentially legitimate citing to understand what that is.

179
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:24.470
That doesn't mean you're chasing UFO's or, or sort of spacecraft from,

180
00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:25.304
from other.

181
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.420
It just means you should know what the hell that is or what's out there.

182
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.910
So I'm, I'm a big proponent of that.

183
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.040
I'm just saying also you have to proceed with caution.
