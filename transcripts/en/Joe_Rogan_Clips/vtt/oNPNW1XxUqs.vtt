00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.170
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You've,</v>

2
00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:07.230
you've obviously gone through some improvements and some change,

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.570
like what's changed with you over the last,

4
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:12.590
like four or five fights because you you've,

5
00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:16.440
you keep getting steadily better. But particularly the last two,

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.470
I think you should be on a four fight, win streak, because there was

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.620
One decision. I forget how to pronounce her name.

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.453
<v 1>[Inaudible] yeah.</v>

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.210
I don't know how to say it, but down then. [inaudible] I think she's on the,

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.900
yeah, she, and she's on this a card. The.

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.890
<v 0>Yeah, I thought that was a bad decision, but you,</v>

12
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:46.500
you had her locked up in the truck. I get sometimes when I,

13
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.330
when I do commentary, people get mad at me,

14
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.220
like either the fighters or other people,

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.170
but that was one where fans of her got mad at me because you guys were

16
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:59.160
riding in front and you had an, a triangle and I was yelling pulled ahead.

17
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
I was yelling, pull her head, pull her head. Cause you had it locked up.

18
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.940
It was locked up. I'm like, she's got it. She's got it. Just got it.

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.960
I'm like pull their head,

20
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:10.200
pull the head and people like you Dick telling her to pull the head.

21
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.950
<v 1>Well, I didn't hear her if I heard you. I thought you were in my corner.</v>

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.080
And I did hear someone say.

23
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.210
<v 0>We're literally right there. It's.</v>

24
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.160
<v 1>So funny. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.540
<v 0>Yeah. It's like you had it really had it. It was so locked in,</v>

26
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.820
but I felt like that was a decision.

27
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.680
It wasn't the worst decision I've ever seen.

28
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.030
We've seen some really bad ones lately, but it was, it was not good. It wasn't.

29
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.900
Yeah. So that would have put you on a four or fight win streak.

30
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.130
But the Hannah ciphers when Hannah ciphers is tough and she's like physically

31
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.750
tough. She's a, like a strong girl, you know? And when,

32
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.400
when you got her down and smash it with those elbows, I was like,

33
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.800
something's going on? Like you're you're on another level. Why do you feel it?

34
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.000
<v 1>Yeah, I did. I did. Um, I don't know. It's uh, I had, uh,</v>

35
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:57.450
a lot of like, uh, I dunno,

36
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.690
I guess ups and downs in my career,

37
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:05.550
like is literally like up, down, up, down, like win-loss loss and loss. And um,

38
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.190
I think, uh, after the Rhonda fight,

39
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660
I fought random Marcos about this time last year. And, um,

40
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.710
and I was just so at the way that went down because I was like super nervous

41
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:19.350
going into it. Um, I felt like this,

42
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.300
that was going to be a fight that kind of set me above the heap because

43
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.200
Rhonda is so tough and she kind of has that same, like up-down that I do.

44
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:30.240
So I'm like, okay, this is going to set me apart.

45
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.220
I'm going to get a streak going. Um,

46
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.650
this is going to be the fight that puts me in a rankings and I,

47
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.420
and I put a lot of weight on it and it,

48
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.480
and I had like ESPN following me that week too.

49
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.950
So I was just super nervous. And like the entire time during the fight,

50
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:45.960
like I wasn't in the fight.

51
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.230
Like I was overthinking every position.

52
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.100
Like there was a point where I had ran up against again,

53
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.670
the fight seems like it was 30 minutes long,

54
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.620
even though it was like two minutes, you know?

55
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:02.470
But like the moment that I had her up against the cage, I remember like,

56
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:05.890
just thinking, oh, if I hold her here, she can't do anything to me.

57
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.180
And that's like the exact opposite of what you should be thinking in a fight.

58
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.200
You should be thinking, I need to hurt her. You know, like I need to hurt her.

59
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.870
I need to do whatever it, whatever it takes to look like,

60
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:20.200
I'm trying to finish the fight. So I hesitated, uh,

61
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.320
my corner was yelling elbow. I didn't throw the elbow,

62
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.260
ran them through the elbow. And then from there I was just like, uh,

63
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.270
like two steps behind. I felt like.

64
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.370
And so that fog was a really weird thing for me because I had never

65
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:36.760
really thought about the mental side of fighting.

66
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.150
Like I thought I was doing everything right. Like I would visualize and,

67
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.010
you know, um, uh, tell myself all positive things and, you know, do,

68
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:49.900
do everything that you, you think you have to do before a fight. Um,

69
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.820
but that just kind of showed me, like,

70
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.840
I'm not doing enough because I knew I had the skills to beat her, but,

71
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.710
or at least the skills to make it look more competitive, but I didn't show it.

72
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.190
Do you think it.

73
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.890
<v 0>Was the added element of the cameras following you around and just put this</v>

74
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:03.310
additional.

75
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.160
<v 1>Person that like it, like the pressure was already there.</v>

76
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.900
And then I found out about, uh,

77
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.850
the ESPN thing and I feel like it was just me over it because

78
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:16.630
I've always had this, uh, I guess this, uh,

79
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.330
fear of losing too much, you know?

80
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.300
And it started when I got into the UFC,

81
00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.460
I had like my tough fight. Didn't go well, but I was one fight,

82
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.760
you know, in my MMA career. And I was in the UFC already.

83
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.260
So I went on to win a fight, but then I lost two in a row and got cut.

84
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.960
And from that moment on I'm like, like,

85
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.960
people are just gonna think of me as the person who loses all the time.

86
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.050
And then I went on a four or five win streak and Invicta,

87
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.140
but then when I came back to the UFC, I lost a dried.

88
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.880
And even though it was like probably the fight that people still talk about to

89
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:54.280
this day, even though I lost. Yeah. Yeah.

90
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.320
Like I always get complimented on that fight,

91
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.060
but it was still another loss of my record. So like I've always had this kinda,

92
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.040
I don't know, like this,

93
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:07.900
a great cloud looming over like my confidence because of my

94
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:08.440
record.

95
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.280
<v 0>Did it help that she went on to do such great things?</v>

96
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 1>It did. It did. But when it came to fighting someone like Randy,</v>

97
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.450
who kind of had a similar story where she is talented,

98
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:27.400
but she's fought a lot of tough people and lost to them or gotten like weird

99
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.670
decisions against people. Um, I don't know.

100
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.900
I just felt like this was my chance to prove that I'm not that like,

101
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.850
I'm a better fighter than my record shows. And so then when the ESB,

102
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.220
the in thing was thrown on and I just like,

103
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:46.450
it was just me begging up a situation that wasn't that big,

104
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.990
you know, like it, it was no different from, you know,

105
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:53.470
my fight with fascia Yoder. I felt more present in my dried fight.

106
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:55.690
Like it was no bigger than those fights,

107
00:05:55.691 --> 00:06:00.560
but I just bigged it up in head and I felt like it was a result of me just

108
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.490
pushing down all this anxiety that I have every time I fight and not really

109
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:05.570
addressing it. So.

110
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.430
<v 0>Did you address it since then? Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.960
<v 1>I did. Um, I just, uh, we, we started reading like those, uh,</v>

112
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.500
mids of we, me and my husband. He,

113
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:18.800
he read them and then he started doing like the mental coach thing for me.

114
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.730
Um, but, uh, it, everyone, everything,

115
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:26.330
every resource that I looked at says pretty much the same thing is that you have

116
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:31.280
to focus on being present and being present each day and not

117
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:35.720
like dwelling on the past, not bringing the past into that present moment,

118
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:39.740
just trusting in your reactions and trusting in your, uh,

119
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.600
your preparation. And so that's what I've been doing is like, uh,

120
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.460
I've I have been doing like more like actual visualization exercises

121
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.040
and just every time I'm in the gym,

122
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.480
I just focus on being there at the gym.

123
00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:59.600
I'm not thinking about like, what's going to happen if this happens,

124
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:01.400
what's going to happen. That that happens. I just,

125
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.460
I focus on the drill we're doing on the exercise. We're doing,

126
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:07.820
I go as hard as possible. And I think, uh,

127
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.650
just having that fight and having it go so badly,

128
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.070
forced me to go into the gym and just say, it. You know?

129
00:07:16.071 --> 00:07:18.890
And it it's literally just like that. it. Mentality.

130
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.950
<v 0>That was the worst that could happen. Where you didn't show up.</v>

131
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.960
He didn't fight to the best of your abilities.

132
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.290
<v 1>Exactly. When I hesitated, I didn't show up. I didn't,</v>

133
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.700
I didn't stay in the moment I was thinking about what's going to happen next was

134
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.780
what just happened, you know? Uh, what's going to happen if I lose. Like,

135
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:39.740
I'm thinking that in the fate, like it, when I went to the gym the next day,

136
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.090
like literally like the next Monday I went to Joel, like, it. You know?

137
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:48.080
And I just went hard and like the next sparring session, I said, it.

138
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:49.820
And I went hard. And like,

139
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.990
those were like the best sparring sessions I had up to that date.

140
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.660
Like people were at guys, guys who like,

141
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.260
you usually wouldn't really say much after I sprout. And they're like, yo,

142
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:02.330
you're on something today. Like, you're,

143
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.070
you're like just like combinations and your volume and this and that. Like,

144
00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:10.460
yeah, you're really getting after it. And I'm like, okay, okay.

145
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:12.980
I think I have like, kinda unlocked something so.

146
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.020
<v 0>Well, it's really powerful the way you're addressing it,</v>

147
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.860
that you're so honest about what went wrong. That's huge.

148
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.670
Cause sometimes people make excuses or they come up with some, some, you know,

149
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.590
something that went that didn't go their way,

150
00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:27.410
that should've gone their way and they don't address the real issue.

151
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.040
You're you're addressing the actual issue that was going on in your brain.

152
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:32.210
And you know, that, that's what it was.

153
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.753
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.</v>

154
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.010
But it's like something I kind of had to learn from the get-go. Yeah.

155
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.130
<v 0>Have you ever thought about going to like a sports psychologist?</v>

156
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.230
<v 1>I have. I have a,</v>

157
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.030
like there I've tried a couple of people in the past and I really

158
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:50.630
just feel like everyone kind of says the same things. Uh,

159
00:08:50.631 --> 00:08:54.560
so I feel like if you're getting it from any resource, that's good.

160
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.030
Like I started using, uh, that mindfulness app. Um,

161
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:03.030
I forget what it's called. Um, yeah,

162
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:07.020
his face isn't as it as the ones, a little cartoons. Um, and that,

163
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.490
that really helped, uh, just like kind of calm my nerves and keep the anxiety,

164
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.850
uh, from, from being crippling.

165
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:20.280
<v 0>Sometimes what happens when you go to a coach is the fact that you physically go</v>

166
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:23.010
to someone and you sit down with this.

167
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.130
It's like a different level of commitment. You sit down with this person,

168
00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:29.820
this person formulates a strategy for how you address some of the issues that

169
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:33.810
are going on in your mind. And then sometimes you can go to a hypnotist,

170
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.490
like Vinny Shoreman do you know Vinny Shoreman he he's fantastic.

171
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:41.570
And he's done a lot of he's. He actually hypnotize me.

172
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.440
I asked him to hypnotize me cause I want to know what it was like.

173
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.230
It's very weird. It's very weird. It's like, you're there,

174
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.780
but you're not really there. It's like, you're in a room next to me.

175
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.110
He didn't touch me. Nothing. No, no, no, nothing weird.

176
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.690
I just wanted to, I just wanted to experience what it was like. And then,

177
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.680
you know, like sometimes I procrastinate too much. Sometimes I'm lazy,

178
00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:04.140
sometimes a failure to get more work done than I do. I'm like,

179
00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:05.850
I want to know what that is, you know?

180
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:10.020
And he is really good at working with fighters at addressing.

181
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.740
He does a lot of stuff through like FaceTime and too. Like using it.

182
00:10:13.741 --> 00:10:16.410
He lives in England, but he's worked with Joe Schilling.

183
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.020
He's worked with a lot of different fighters,

184
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.000
but he basically tries to get you to understand, first of all,

185
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:26.880
you're already on a really good path because you understand what you did wrong.

186
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.790
Right? And then you understand to be more present those two things.

187
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.250
They're critical. That's everything understanding what went wrong,

188
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.990
letting it go. You're already doing that.

189
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:37.410
And then concentrating on what you're really good at and just saying, it.

190
00:10:37.411 --> 00:10:41.910
And letting it go and expressing yourself, being, being you that you know,

191
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:43.800
that you can be when you're on. Right.

192
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.930
It's like how to capture that and hold that thought and then bring it inside the

193
00:10:48.931 --> 00:10:52.980
octagon and be able to recreate those feelings when you're actually under

194
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:54.150
pressure of competition.

195
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.890
<v 1>Mm. That sounds cool. But like hypnotizing, the like,</v>

196
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.420
does he like take out the.

197
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.450
<v 0>No, it just talks to you just close your eyes,</v>

198
00:11:03.451 --> 00:11:06.930
you lay back and he just sort of talks you through it. It's very weird.

199
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.940
<v 1>It was not like therapy it's you definitely feel like a changing your</v>

200
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:12.990
brain.

201
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.600
<v 0>Yeah. You feel like you're in a different state. It's a weird state.</v>

202
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.170
It's a very weird like, uh, after it was over, I was like, huh. Okay.

203
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:20.004
That's real.

204
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.240
Because I had seen like comedy hypnotism before.

205
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:27.180
Have you ever seen a comedy hypnotism show where they have a bunch of people

206
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:30.300
come up and like you're having sex with a, you know,

207
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.950
Rihanna and you think you are.

208
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:35.730
And there's a lot of weird stuff that people do in these, uh,

209
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.440
comedy hypnotism shows where I was like,

210
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.890
maybe I CA I don't think they could do that to me because I'm not going to

211
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:44.430
believe that I'm really on a cruise ship right now and pirates are coming or

212
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:45.020
whatever.

213
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.830
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And he'd go hide. Yeah. They always LSE the ones where they like,</v>

214
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:53.100
make him like, turn it into an animal or something.

215
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 0>Or every time you say this word something happened and I'm going to wake up in</v>

216
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:03.190
3, 2, 1. Okay. Huh? Yeah. It wasn't like that.

217
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:07.060
But it is like he you're listening to his voice,

218
00:12:07.061 --> 00:12:10.000
but you're in a different state of consciousness. It's very strange.

219
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.380
But you it's, you're,

220
00:12:11.381 --> 00:12:15.730
you're able to put away the outside world for a brief amount of time and he

221
00:12:15.731 --> 00:12:17.230
concentrates on flow,

222
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:21.040
like getting you to a state of flow that flow state when everything's going

223
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:23.530
great. You know, that feeling when you see things and you're,

224
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.340
you're hitting someone with someone with something before you even know that

225
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.800
there's an opening there. And that was in those, um,

226
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.770
those athlete books to just have flow state thing,

227
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.150
flow state is everything right.
