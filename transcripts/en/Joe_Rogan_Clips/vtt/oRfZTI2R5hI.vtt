00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Has there been discussion, like,</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.330
has anybody brought this out? Like, uh,

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:09.510
Dan Crenshaw was not aware of this when I discussed it with him when he was

4
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:11.700
talking about federally legalizing marijuana,

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.640
it's not just about saying it's okay for kids, right?

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.260
It's about mitigating these problems that you have with cartels,

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.890
because when there is a,

8
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:25.170
an illegal opportunity to sell something that there's a demand for,

9
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.500
then the criminals are going to sell it. If that's what you have now. Exactly.

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.770
And it has there been discussion like to someone to bring this up, like,

11
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:36.600
this is one of the primary problems with having marijuana federally illegal with

12
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.890
California, having it state legal, that there is this massive confusion,

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.970
then this, you know,

14
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.380
diminishing of penalties in California with growing illegally.

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.380
<v 1>There totally is. And you know,</v>

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.980
you've got the opposite ends of the spectrum and,

17
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:52.700
and here's what we're learning with regulation. And I've always said this.

18
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:53.534
I said, look,

19
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.680
if we're going to regulate and we need to regulate to stop this black market,

20
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.150
let's do it smart. You know, let's for one, everything we, we,

21
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:07.820
we really tried to push here in California was regulate legitimate

22
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:10.760
cannabis, the correct way, keep people safe, test.

23
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.300
<v 0>It, test it, make sure those pesticides, cartel, pesticides, aren't.</v>

24
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.351
<v 1>Homeless. Absolutely man.</v>

25
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:18.020
And as long as people aren't hurting themselves or other people,

26
00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:21.980
they're not destroying waterways, we're not getting in gunfights over it. Great.

27
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.620
You know, no problem. But for like the, you know,

28
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:26.570
the outdoor trespassing with these cartels,

29
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.530
let's take that funding and put more effort to stop in that, you know,

30
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.650
let's not water it down to misdemeanors and infractions and do things like that.

31
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.120
And, and, you know, it's,

32
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.330
and even we can even take cannabis out of the equation. Joe,

33
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:40.790
from the standpoint of, I remember a few years ago,

34
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:45.140
I was quoted by the associated press of saying if cherry tomatoes were so

35
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:49.760
desired on the black market and were illegal and people were paying $4,000 a

36
00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:51.020
pound for cherry tomatoes,

37
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.560
we be having gunfight silver cherry tomatoes and having banned poisons on cherry

38
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.080
tomatoes that our kids would be eaten in their salads, you know,

39
00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:59.960
because of the black market. So you can take, you know,

40
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.740
cannabis even out of the equation and look at the environmental impacts and look

41
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:04.551
at the public safety.

42
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:07.880
But we have to do something to regulate this thing uniformly over the bow,

43
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.790
across the board, and we have to break the black market,

44
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.150
but what I've seen and I go into the last chapter of my new book,

45
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:17.540
hidden work sensibly on this is what are the challenges moving forward after

46
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:21.560
seeing regulation in play for two years, boots on the ground,

47
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.250
watching it and having a great relationship with legit legitimate cannabis

48
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:25.760
growers.

49
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.440
And I'll tell you a few stories that really opened my eyes and got us unified,

50
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.620
right? Cause the whole thing is we need to be unified on this, on this concept,

51
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.790
not polarized left ARIDE anti-cannabis pro cannabis, let's get unified,

52
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.600
environmental safety, public safety, all of it. Um,

53
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.610
but because of how we've regulated and the licensing fees and the

54
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:50.390
protocol and everything else, we've had all of these, you know,

55
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.250
black market growers in the two 15 days that wanted to get legal and saw

56
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.820
everything coming in the cost to do it and being on big brother's radar or law

57
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.680
radar. And they backed out like in Humboldt county, we had it like,

58
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.390
I want to stay in the better part of 10 to 50,000 growers ready to regulate.

59
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.570
And we barely got a thousand, you know, and they went, you know,

60
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.230
I can't afford to go through this permitting process. I can't afford the delays.

61
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:16.060
So I'm just going to go back on the black market.

62
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.680
I'm not going to be on the radar. Wow.

63
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.120
And that has to stop if we're going to regulate. Right. Um, the thing that was,

64
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.540
was really interesting and uh, I never saw this coming, but when,

65
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.680
when we were about to roll out prop 64 and you know, it had been voted, uh,

66
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.350
for recreational and the medical laws were tightening up.

67
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.430
I was the first law enforcement guy being from a marijuana enforcement team to,

68
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.810
uh, to go into these a California grower association, hosted grower meetings.

69
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.290
And my first one was in Santa Cruz right over the hill from my place. Right.

70
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.400
And I mean, I'm in the, you know, I'm in the, BTU's the cammo bottoms, the polo,

71
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.240
I'm going into my, you know,

72
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:53.320
my training attire for Matt and the look on 500 growers faces.

73
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.500
When I walked into that meeting, just like, what's he doing here?

74
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.440
Conflict of interest. He's working us. He's a,

75
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.290
guy's watching her license plates and I'm just like, guys, everybody breathe.

76
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.470
I'm going to tell you a story. I'm going to show you a PowerPoint.

77
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.550
It's going to be graphic. I'm not here to work anybody. You know,

78
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.300
I'm here to unify. Just hear what I have to say, no judgment.

79
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.910
And so I was honest. I.

80
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.270
<v 0>Was aware of how big the situation was before you show them that I would have</v>

81
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:18.930
thought so.

82
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.560
<v 1>Because they're in the industry, right. We'd better than just about anybody.</v>

83
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:23.220
I would cry all.

84
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.390
<v 2>The time. They're not seeing the cartel. Well, it's just that I paid attention.</v>

85
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.190
They just grow apart. Yeah. That's.

86
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.571
<v 1>All. I,</v>

87
00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:32.430
I didn't see that guy was that kind of true camera once he got a backpack,

88
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.250
like 300 pounds of pipe. But anyway, and.

89
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.300
<v 0>Explain that, I mean,</v>

90
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:40.980
these guys literally would back in hundreds and hundreds of yards of

91
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.180
pipe and have to being like for hoses on their backs back.

92
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.590
<v 1>Other tough. Yeah. I've got,</v>

93
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:50.040
I've got photos in the new book on trail cam with felt on their feet,

94
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.110
covering their tracks with these sea bags,

95
00:04:52.111 --> 00:04:55.410
a hundred plus pounds and a spool of pipe going up, man. I'm like, I.

96
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.800
<v 0>Know how hard that is to do. I mean, these guys just took a legit job.</v>

97
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.660
They'd be like the best employees.

98
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.750
<v 1>You'd ever have. Okay. They would, they would, man. They're a, they're tough.</v>

99
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.600
And they're, I mean, to look at the environment they live in for six months,

100
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:08.160
man. Yeah. They're all outdoors.

101
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.490
But I was at this meeting and I gave the presentation.

102
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.140
I talked about it and it was crazy to see, look a shock on these, um,

103
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.950
these grower groups faces, I mean, some women were in tears. Um,

104
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.160
some of the guys were just like off and pumping their fists. And they're like,

105
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.040
that's. We are not about that.

106
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.340
We're not about doing anything bad with our water. We like our wildlife.

107
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:32.850
We just want to grow cannabis. We want to be regulated, you know?

108
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.230
And it was such a turnaround, you know,

109
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.380
from the traditional relationship between law enforcement and the cannabis

110
00:05:40.381 --> 00:05:41.760
world. Um, and to see,

111
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.770
to be the one guy there with all of the growing community there,

112
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.520
and then go from complete horror that I was there as an adversary or judgment or

113
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:51.960
anything of that, or, you know, to,

114
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.040
to do anything negative from an enforcement standpoint to suddenly having real

115
00:05:56.041 --> 00:06:00.410
talks of what was out. And, and I could kind of see the authenticity,

116
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.850
the genuineness on some of their faces, the way they reacted to my slides,

117
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:08.480
to the videos. And so, um, when I left that first meeting,

118
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.960
I remember I just got flooded at my patrol truck and I had Apollo with me,

119
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:14.480
my little lab and she's an icebreaker. I thought, well,

120
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.120
it could be an interesting meeting. I should have the dog for pets, you know?

121
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.680
And she jumped in and I,

122
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.860
all these growers were coming to my truck and I'm packing up my stuff and went,

123
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.670
wow, this is weird. And it was all these, you know, farmer supervisors, um,

124
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.030
from all over the state, you know, Mendocino county up in the animal triangle,

125
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.160
Santa Cruz. And they're just giving me their cards and go, Hey, Lieutenant,

126
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.710
I have workers, I have resources. We will hike in and clean up a grow with you,

127
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.920
let us help them at team, let us help the cannabis program,

128
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:44.360
whatever we can do and no charge. And, and that was genuine, man.

129
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.120
I was really, really taken back by that in a positive way.

130
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.620
And I realized if we get the legitimate farmers on our side and they're aware of

131
00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:53.660
this, they will help market that message.

132
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.270
So they have money and they have money. Yeah.

133
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.740
<v 0>Gentlemen, farmers are making a lot of money. That would be a great way for,</v>

134
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.020
you know, we, I mean tax wise, I mean,

135
00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:04.900
there's extremely high taxes on cannabis as it is. Right.

136
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.130
But if we could allocate that taxes absolutely. To you guys. Yeah.

137
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.280
That would be incredible. Yeah. Where's the money going?

138
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.290
Let's have a certain percentage of it designated for wardens. That's.

139
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.400
<v 1>Starting to happen too,</v>

140
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:22.000
because what's now that we've had a couple of years and we're seeing some of the

141
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.390
regulatory funding on the taxes trickle back. Um,

142
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.280
I'm in contact with my team all the time.

143
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:30.970
I still get to see him periodically and train and do things like that and really

144
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.310
give them a shout out for all the amazing, you know,

145
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.610
risks they're taking in the work they're doing and,

146
00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:38.440
and promote their message what throughout they're doing. But, um,

147
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.530
the money's starting to come back to us now. So we're starting to get equipment.

148
00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:44.320
We're starting to get more bodies. We're starting to get like overtime funding.

149
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:47.230
So the ridiculous long hours, our small team works.

150
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:51.370
They're compensated for that just just happened literally within a month or two

151
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.820
of being on the show with you. So we're seeing some positives from that.

152
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:56.890
Those rates raised, we're trying,

153
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.810
we're trying alert the press 40% as discussed this, uh, this coffee sauce.

154
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.913
good.

155
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.330
<v 3>Gosh, man, I'm not even a coffee. I'm loving this stuff. It's great stuff.</v>

156
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.260
It makes.

157
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.450
<v 0>Your mouth smack though. It gives you a little, it.</v>

158
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.230
<v 2>Does a little, yeah. You got to like clear your throat a lot. Yeah. It says.</v>

159
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.320
<v 0>Coconut oil and tumeric and all that jazz, um,</v>

160
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.120
healthy Colorado was the first state to legalize it. And Washington state,

161
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.800
did they have similar problems?

162
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.120
<v 1>They still have a black market, you know, and the thing right now,</v>

163
00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:31.000
because we're not regulating federally. And so every state,

164
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.200
anything that's grown stays in that state per law. Right. But every,

165
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:38.650
all the demand is back east in these non-regulated states and they don't grow

166
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:40.960
it. So Colorado has a, you know,

167
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:44.620
an interstate black market that's done by the, you know, quasi,

168
00:08:44.621 --> 00:08:47.140
legitimate growers as well as the cartel element.

169
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.220
So there's still that black market thriving within, you know,

170
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.440
the black market cannabis industry that isn't cartel public lands. We've,

171
00:08:54.441 --> 00:08:56.340
we've got different mixes and we, okay. So.

172
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.830
<v 0>It's a different kind of a problem in Colorado.</v>

173
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:00.870
So they don't have as many cartel grows.

174
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.320
<v 1>Many. They have some, they have some I've I've,</v>

175
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.650
I've talked to those guys and worked with them a little bit and they do have

176
00:09:06.651 --> 00:09:09.530
some, but again, they're kind of like more I'm at Montana now,

177
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.480
tight little growing window, you know, early winners, late thaws.

178
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.490
So they don't have a very big growing season outdoors.

179
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.580
The conditions aren't prime, like they are here in Cali. This.

180
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.510
<v 0>Is a, this is a giant issue that is largely undiscussed.</v>

181
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.540
And it's one of the reasons why I was so fascinated by that podcast is,

182
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.000
and this is a one more,

183
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.810
one more piece of the puzzle when you're talking about border control, right?

184
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.580
That somehow or another we've gotten into this

185
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.750
state and our country, this,

186
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.260
this place in our country where some people want to control the border and some

187
00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:43.910
people don't want any borders. Right.

188
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.010
And you have to understand that this is the number one problem with the border.

189
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:52.460
The number one problem with the border is cartel violence, cartel, violence,

190
00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:54.650
cartel, crime. That's the number one problem.

191
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.510
And the giant percentage of these people that are coming over and doing illegal

192
00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:02.210
activity are doing it because it's profitable, right?

193
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:04.940
The reason why it's profitable is because it's illegal.

194
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.980
And so they can do these things and sell marijuana all over this country

195
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.120
illegally because it's illegal. And if it was legal,

196
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.370
we could regulate it. We could tax it.

197
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.050
The money could go into schools and pay for guys like you and,

198
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.250
and go to fixing this problem.

199
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.700
And instead we're playing this little stupid game where, you know,

200
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:29.960
some states are legal and some states are let's let's, you know,

201
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:31.310
and it's federally,

202
00:10:31.311 --> 00:10:35.900
it's still a schedule one crime when there's millions of legitimate

203
00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:40.530
law, abiding tax, paying citizens that enjoy it. And it's crazy. It.

204
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.420
<v 1>Is. And, and to that point, you know, you, you look at, um, you know,</v>

205
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:47.390
the discrepancy and just the inconsistency on cannabis regulation,

206
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.920
some states some not federally, not. Um, but when you get to the border issue,

207
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.660
you brought up that good point of,

208
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.410
it's not just that cartel element for this CA this poison cannabis stuff,

209
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.160
or this toxically tainted cannabis is a better way to phrase it. Um,

210
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.350
it's the smuggling, you know, the human trafficking,

211
00:11:03.351 --> 00:11:06.980
it's all those other crimes I met with ketamine production. So I'm not, uh,

212
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.320
you know, I get asked a lot, like after, you know,

213
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.100
you had a great conversation with, uh, with, with Mike Baker on this was,

214
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.630
you know, our open borders going to work and no, we got to have some regulation.

215
00:11:17.631 --> 00:11:18.590
It's just not going to work.

216
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.730
<v 0>The world's not even. So that's why open borders aren't gonna work. Right.</v>

217
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.650
If the world was even, and there was, you know,

218
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:29.510
there's like extreme crime right below us. And,

219
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.980
you know, I had ed called her on, on who works for them. We just started.

220
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.320
<v 1>Dialoguing last week. I liked that guy. Good guy.</v>

221
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.450
<v 0>Boy, is he scared the out of you though,</v>

222
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:43.130
when he tells you the stories about Mexico, about how bad it is down there. And,

223
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.510
uh, there's,

224
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.040
there's just an insane amount of violence that's going on down there.

225
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.510
And it's insane amount of crime.

226
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.820
And so much of it is connected to the drug trade. Yeah.

227
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.720
And look, you're not going to kill it all if you make marijuana illegal,

228
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.490
but you would kill a percentage.

229
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.400
At least it would make it a little bit better and it would stop that.

230
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.410
<v 1>Yeah. And one of the things we do we get from, from getting that regulation,</v>

231
00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:12.060
if we can stop that black market for, you know, cartel weed,

232
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.100
we're going to save a lot of wildlife. Yes.

233
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.020
We're going to preserve a lot of waterways, right?

234
00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:18.600
Because all those other crimes are very heinous and very destructive.

235
00:12:18.601 --> 00:12:21.390
And I hate to see the human trafficking and all the meth problems and,

236
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.900
and anything that relates to violence or a deterioration of a soul. But,

237
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:29.310
you know, I love the wild man. The woods are mature church, yours too. I mean,

238
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.680
what you do for conservation,

239
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.820
the elk hunting that you're doing and all those different things. I mean,

240
00:12:32.821 --> 00:12:35.340
it's just, it's magical out there and it's just, most.

241
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.140
<v 0>People just don't even know. I don't think no,</v>

242
00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:40.950
but I just don't get a chance to experience what it's like to actually be real

243
00:12:40.951 --> 00:12:41.784
woods.

244
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:42.741
<v 1>Which are,</v>

245
00:12:42.741 --> 00:12:46.500
which are getting shrinker smaller and smaller and smaller even here in Cali

246
00:12:46.501 --> 00:12:49.620
that has so much beauty. Um, but I look at it this way. I said, look,

247
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.680
if we lose all of our open space to a problem like this,

248
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.770
and it compounds the problem and we lose our wildlife and good water,

249
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.330
you may not be into the outdoors right now. You might be a preservationist.

250
00:13:00.331 --> 00:13:01.164
You might be, you know,

251
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.350
on your fricking digital device all the time and looking at wildlife through a,

252
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.543
through a screen.

253
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.170
But if you ever do go out and you get that peace and tranquility and you get

254
00:13:10.171 --> 00:13:15.000
centered, like we do run a trail hike, a LA county mountain trail,

255
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.730
or open space, don't even get that far in the woods. It's just soothing.

256
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.580
You know, it brings us back to our center. And, you know,

257
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.870
if the new generations that aren't getting that from the cities can get that or

258
00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:27.510
they can get their kids doing it or their grandkids or hear about it,

259
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.680
but it's not there to go to, um, that to me, man, I w we're just,

260
00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:34.730
we're just not paying it forward enough. So this is, this is something I,

261
00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:38.970
I got to stay on and I really appreciate you and what you stand for. Um,

262
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.280
because of the message, I think just so many people don't.

263
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.440
<v 4>Know. Yeah. I just think that's a big part of.</v>

264
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.200
<v 0>It. No, what's interesting to me too,</v>

265
00:13:46.201 --> 00:13:50.760
is that the allocation of resources it's so when you have

266
00:13:50.761 --> 00:13:53.850
something that's illegal, you're not getting any of that money. No.

267
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.980
And if it was legal,

268
00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.090
there's an enormous amount of money that could go to schools and fix the roads

269
00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:02.340
and we can allocate it to a bunch of different, big time,

270
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:07.350
really positive ways to spend it. Yeah. And we're not doing that.

271
00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:08.160
And it's,

272
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.140
it's the reason why is because it's illegal and this is crime problem

273
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:17.520
is very similar to what they face during prohibition with alcohol and the rise

274
00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:18.930
of organized crime. I mean, right.

275
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.110
That's where they were getting their money from because there was such a demand

276
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.030
it's really a disgusting,

277
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.370
dumb way to approach a problem that is in many people's ideas of social

278
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:34.320
problem, that money could go to so many different positive things.

279
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.830
<v 1>Yeah. And when we're perpetuating it through that reason in many others,</v>

280
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.400
we're basically, you know, we're basically embedding the problem in our country.

281
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.460
And ed said, this called her own. We were dialoguing earlier this week.

282
00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.320
And he said, you know, um,

283
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.620
he's kind of looked at things from the border and south and the issues coming in

284
00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:52.490
from the border, from the cartel. He said, you know,

285
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.250
now I'm getting wind of your book and I'm starting to analyze what year you guys

286
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:57.710
are fighting on the ground, inside the borders in California,

287
00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:00.470
the rest of the country. He goes, it's embedded now. I mean,

288
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:01.940
it's not like it's just coming across. I mean,

289
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:06.260
the enterprise is embedded here in the nation because they have the pipeline,

290
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:07.400
they have the distribution,

291
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.220
they have a market and they don't have to deal with the border issue.

292
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.640
And they're comfortable because of exactly where we're at and what people aren't

293
00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:14.474
aware of.

294
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.170
<v 0>So in California, that it's just a misdemeanor, which is.</v>

295
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.420
<v 1>Even more insane. That's got to change, it's got to.</v>

296
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.140
<v 0>Change. You know what I mean? It should be something horrendous if you're,</v>

297
00:15:23.141 --> 00:15:25.750
if you actually have a background in crime, right.

298
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.580
Especially particularly violent crime,

299
00:15:27.581 --> 00:15:30.550
when you get caught doing something like that. I mean, it should be severe,

300
00:15:30.551 --> 00:15:31.420
severe penalty.

301
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.680
<v 1>Should absolutely be severe.</v>

302
00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:37.660
Now that the saving grace of that is when we get the

303
00:15:37.661 --> 00:15:40.810
environmental crimes that we bring from the fish and wildlife standpoint to

304
00:15:40.811 --> 00:15:42.400
those charges for these guys,

305
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.330
we get it back to felony status because we had an interesting thing happened.

306
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:51.040
Um, as soon as all that regulation started two years ago, and the wa you know,

307
00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:53.740
those trespass grow crimes were watered down. And what we're talking about,

308
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.980
district attorneys all throughout the state said, oh man,

309
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.770
we're not going to be able to prosecute these crimes. I mean,

310
00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:01.280
we're not going to have a, you know,

311
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.080
we're not going to have a jury that sympathetic to these issues. Um,

312
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.200
it's not worth it. Uh, some Sheriff's departments were saying, Hey,

313
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:09.580
we know how violent these guys are.

314
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.400
We know your team's been in like six gunfights man. Um,

315
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.620
your partner was almost killed in oh five. And the first one,

316
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.890
you guys take these guys head on, you know, you want to protect your wildlife,

317
00:16:17.891 --> 00:16:19.720
whatever, but they're not stopping.

318
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.050
And it's a misdemeanor and we can't convict him. So we're not going to play.

319
00:16:23.051 --> 00:16:26.740
So the backlash of those crimes being watered down,

320
00:16:26.741 --> 00:16:31.030
Joe was team stopped working at except us and like the feds, you know,

321
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.600
and not only that DA's, couldn't prosecute. So, um,

322
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.080
I remember speaking for the California district attorneys association on this

323
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.290
and saying, guys, there's a solution. Everybody,

324
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.560
no matter where they sit on the cannabis spectrum,

325
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.580
everybody hates to see Bambi, dead water poisoned.

326
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.890
Everyone has a little bit of environmental passionate.

327
00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.570
I'm on both sides of the fence. And that's where I say, here, we get to the,

328
00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:58.420
you, we can unify and not worry about where we sit on the performer against. Um,

329
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.520
and if you take these water code enhancements,

330
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.090
if you take the felony in the penal code from the band toxics, like Carbofuran,

331
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.110
um, if you take a stream bed, alteration, diversion, or dead wildlife,

332
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.110
or littering, close to a state waterway, you stack all those up,

333
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:14.650
you get all these penalties and you can convict on that. You know,

334
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.020
even in a sympathetic jury on say a cannabis issue.

335
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:21.910
So we started to prosecute these cases and he started to come back and it's an

336
00:17:21.911 --> 00:17:24.970
arduous end around. It's more work than we should have to do, but.
