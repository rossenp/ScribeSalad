00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>Hey, I saw an article this morning. I wanted to, um, get your thoughts on it.</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.140
Okay. Uh, I was reading about, uh,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.630
that they're thinking about putting a video gaming in the Olympics. Whoa.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.470
Yeah. And the way they were talking about it, they're like, this is inevitable.

5
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:19.380
This is going to be in the Olympics. And these, uh,

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.610
kids consider themselves athletes. The only hangup that they had on it was it,

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:28.080
the video games are violent and they don't want to promote that. But to me,

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.410
it was like, well, wait, was this really a sport?

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.160
<v 1>This is the Olympics trying to cash in. That's all that is.</v>

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.270
I think the Olympics are dirty. I think it's a dirty business. And, uh,

11
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.670
this was highlighted by the movie.

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.250
Ikaros if you watch that movie and you realize how, uh,

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.140
the IOC is in bed with the world anti-doping agency and

14
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:56.070
how, you know, how they sort of functioned together.

15
00:00:56.071 --> 00:01:00.420
And what it really is all about is making money and anything that

16
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:03.960
compromises that making money, they're going to vote against it. It's just,

17
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.930
it's not, it's a dirty business.

18
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.690
And if they did have it in the Olympics,

19
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.810
what they would basically do is take these guys who were making millions and

20
00:01:12.811 --> 00:01:16.050
millions of dollars playing video games at a professional level. Yeah.

21
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.110
And millions, they would make them work for free.

22
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.560
And then they would make all the millions of millions of dollars. But let's say,

23
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.290
yeah, you get to be in the Olympics. It's a dirty business.

24
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.730
I think the Olympics are dirty.

25
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.913
<v 0>That's terrible.</v>

26
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.140
<v 1>Yeah. Well his chess in the Olympics, no wrestling, but chess.</v>

27
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.150
You're actually moving pieces around video games, icons on a screen. Like why,

28
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.530
what, what do you mean? They took wrestling out.

29
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.000
<v 0>It took wrestling out of it.</v>

30
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.630
They took really took wrestling out of the Olympics. Yeah, no, they did.

31
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.530
Yes they did. Yes. I love wrestling and they took it out.

32
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:52.200
They might've brought it back, but it was gone. Right? Jamie?

33
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.030
<v 1>No, no, wrestling's not.</v>

34
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.710
<v 0>Out of the, yes. They took it out.</v>

35
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.850
There was no wrestling in the summer Olympics. Come on. I'm not kidding.

36
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.720
For real.

37
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.440
<v 1>For real, that doesn't make any sense. I know. That's crazy.</v>

38
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:07.410
Why wouldn't I never heard of that. I know there were,

39
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.070
there was at one point in time they were talking about it,

40
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:13.050
but I thought the thought it was put back in.

41
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.980
<v 0>What was it say it was out for at least one and.</v>

42
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.600
<v 2>2013 IOC voted to drop wrestling from the summer Olympic program.</v>

43
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:22.620
Effective 2020.

44
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.473
<v 1>Is a real.</v>

45
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.720
<v 2>Yeah. I don't know if it's happened yet because it's supposed to be for 2020.</v>

46
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.554
I don't know if it's.

47
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.800
<v 1>I'm pretty sure it was in the Olympics in the summer at what's that 2020 yet.</v>

48
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:34.200
So no, but I mean the last Olympics that he's saying it wasn't in.

49
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.520
<v 0>I don't think it was. Yeah. I think it was, I don't think it was.</v>

50
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.300
<v 1>I called Bob Costa. Call him now.</v>

51
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.720
<v 0>Bob. Bob is your, I cured.</v>

52
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.310
<v 1>Bob was uh, on an episode news radio kicked my. That was the episode.</v>

53
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.330
I thought he was hitting on this girl that I was dating. He beat me up. Yeah,

54
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:56.280
there it isn't the Olympics. Oh, I guess Tom Papa's.

55
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.830
<v 0>Oh, that's from the seventies. Look at that kind of second.</v>

56
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.540
Did you see that guy? You see that?

57
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.750
[inaudible].

58
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.670
<v 1>Look at that guy. Jesus Christ ninth.</v>

59
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.930
<v 0>18, 18 96. Go back to that. And they took it out.</v>

60
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.100
All right. So maybe it was in last time, but look at it.

61
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:16.300
They voted against it now.

62
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.400
<v 1>Checked. He is Jack weightlifting back then. Let me tell you something, bro.</v>

63
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:25.210
That guy is not jacked. He's jacked. Pure. Let me see this.

64
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.470
Let me see a little of this. If.

65
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.680
<v 0>The Greco-Roman introduced in Athens in 1896.</v>

66
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.510
<v 1>Going on here, the grabbing each other by the underwear,</v>

67
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.100
it was a different kind of wrestling.

68
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.230
<v 0>That's ladies.</v>

69
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.900
<v 1>Buhler. That is a rough sport. Oh my God.</v>

70
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.400
<v 0>Uh, I went, I found this though. It, uh, they're adding, um,</v>

71
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.070
video games to the Asian games in 2022.

72
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:51.790
And then it's gonna be a demonstration sport in Paris, 2024. It's common.

73
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.603
Well wrestling.

74
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.280
<v 1>Those guys don't need it. You know? And this is my message to anybody.</v>

75
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.970
Who's a pro video gamer. You don't need those people. What do they offer?

76
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.330
They offer. They want you to work for free. They gotta to make all the money.

77
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.180
You were already huge. And by the way,

78
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.420
the people who run that they miss the boat. They didn't see it coming.

79
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.410
They don't deserve it.

80
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.940
<v 0>What about the athlete part of it? What about it? Do you consider it a sport?</v>

81
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.430
<v 1>Well, no, it's a game, but it's a very highly skilled game. I mean,</v>

82
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.860
it's definitely something valuable. Like the,

83
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.980
it used to be thought of as a frivolous waste of time. Right.

84
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.160
But now you can make legitimate money with it, but you don't,

85
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.730
I don't think you classify it as a sport. I mean, they call it e-sports.

86
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.380
<v 0>Right. Are they an athlete? Is this the top gamer? An athlete?</v>

87
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.360
<v 1>The only caveat is that it's hand-eye coordination right there is</v>

88
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.230
hand-eye coordination. And D what do you consider a sport?

89
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.071
Do you consider something?

90
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:52.780
You move your entire body or just moving your fingers enough? Um, cause like,

91
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.730
is pool a sport? Billiards? Is that sport? I don't think it is. I think.

92
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.720
<v 0>It's a game. It's yeah.</v>

93
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.051
<v 1>It's a good,</v>

94
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:03.280
it's a game that requires hand-eye coordination and control and touch

95
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.930
tennis is sport.

96
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.633
<v 0>Right? Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.170
Tennis requires full physical being full mental being.

98
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.260
<v 1>Yeah. You're you're running around you jumping back and forth.</v>

99
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.660
You're swatting that ball there.

100
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.100
They're shooting at you trying to get out of the way. I mean the,

101
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.030
the amount of endurance you have and stamina and explosiveness all contributes

102
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:22.780
to your game.

103
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.530
<v 0>Would you make an exception for someone that's really good at Kubert? Yes.</v>

104
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.130
<v 1>For subway surfers in subway surfaces court. My daughter plays that.</v>

105
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.143
She's a little wizard.

106
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.820
<v 0>Um.</v>

107
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.360
<v 1>It's a, yeah, it's not a sport. The only one in the Olympics,</v>

108
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:43.000
because they realized there's massive amounts of people that are watching it and

109
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.770
playing them now. And they can make a lot of them.

110
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.120
<v 0>No arenas. I mean, they're going to they're filling arenas, Olympics.</v>

111
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.300
The live part of it is a billion dollar business. Yeah.

112
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.680
<v 1>There's a lot of sports that are in the Olympics that no one gives a about if</v>

113
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:59.240
they're not in the Olympics. Right, right. Like, like.

114
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.370
<v 0>Curling the, um, ski shoot one skiing and shooting one with it. Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.780
<v 1>Well that full-on or pentathlon or yeah, there's the one that Bruce Jenner one.</v>

116
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.093
Which one was that?

117
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.050
<v 0>That's the decathlon. Did he.</v>

118
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.930
<v 1>Have to shoot or nothing? Now throw a spear or something? No.</v>

119
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.480
<v 0>He did the javelin chaplains part of it. Technically a spear,</v>

120
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.750
but.

121
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.640
<v 1>Okay. Is archery. Archery is in the Olympics. Yeah. Is that a sport? Um,</v>

122
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.930
that's more of a sport.

123
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.450
<v 0>Right? You're using your full.</v>

124
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.410
<v 1>Body. Well, not really mean you are for like stability.</v>

125
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.890
You're stabilizing with your legs and you have a certain stance.

126
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.000
And if your Bose heavy to pull back, then it requires strength.

127
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.120
But that's a, that's blurring the lines.

128
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.920
I think archery is essentially a martial art with a tool, you know,

129
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:51.380
and then you're demonstrating, but you could do it on paper.

130
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.670
So it's target archery, but they do, they have target shooting in the Olympics.

131
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.590
<v 0>Um, well as part of skiing, right. Or they think they do it in both.</v>

132
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:01.520
They do it in summer to.

133
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.280
<v 1>Uh, just targeted. Yep. Just shooting. Right. That girl you told me about. Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.820
<v 0>That's interesting. I mean, that's close to a video game.</v>

135
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.820
<v 1>No, no video games are, well, I guess maybe, but like we were shooting,</v>

136
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.580
showing that Sarah Pailin thing, which she was trying to shoot off hand.

137
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.200
Totally hot holding the gun up. That's um, if you like,

138
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.030
that's more of a sport who you try to shoot off hand or

139
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.540
pistol shooting. I would say like pistol shooting would definitely be a sport.

140
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.480
Like when they do those courses, you ever seen those courses that they do,

141
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.650
like for training,

142
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.280
ready go light goes off and then you run through a door and then you turn a

143
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:45.140
corner and 10 times, and then you dive down. Yeah. And some are bad guys.

144
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.570
Some are good guys. And then sometimes they do,

145
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.830
there's a bunch of different ones they do.

146
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.770
And some of them are just targets and some of them are targets that are dressed

147
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:54.470
up like people. Right? Yeah. That's actually what the sport.
