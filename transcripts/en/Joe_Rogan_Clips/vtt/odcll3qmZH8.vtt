00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
<v 0>It's an awesome book too. And it's from a guy who's actually lived it.</v>

2
00:00:02.561 --> 00:00:04.480
Mm you know-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, there's a lot of, you know,

3
00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:07.640
there's a lot of wisdom in his life experiences that you,

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.520
you can get something out of. Um, I ask because you,

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.040
you obviously are a guy who seeks out knowledge mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. You,

6
00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:19.720
you, you work on your mind. What, what was it?

7
00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:22.630
Was it a look or is this series of books? Like what,

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.350
what got you thinking differently?

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.230
<v 1>Well, honestly, for me,</v>

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.230
what got me thinking differently was honestly just going through the most trying

11
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.710
time of my life. I mean, I had just gotten married now. It's time to be a man.

12
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:37.870
Now it's time to step up. Now it's time to provide. And all of a sudden,

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.390
I go through this lost streak where after my third loss,

14
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.380
I went home to San Diego, with my wife.

15
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:44.940
We sat on the couch and we sit there and we just cried. Who was the third loss?

16
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.980
Uh, third loss was, will Brooks the second time. Oh, that's right. So, um,

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.100
so I lost him twice, Eddie once, and then now the,

18
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.620
the Madison square garden one, but we went home,

19
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.220
we sat there and it was almost like, what do we do now is beator gonna cut me.

20
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.970
And I did I work this hard to now, you know, be where I'm at now.

21
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.890
You know what I mean? I was at, I mean,

22
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.250
I was at two years or a year and a half removed from being one of the top three

23
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:09.290
guys in the world had just beaten Eddie, Eddie, and you know,

24
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:12.370
all that kind of stuff. And now here I was three fights in a row loss,

25
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:16.890
but it was, it was that time where I realized, right,

26
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.730
I was actually starting to change my kind of mental, uh,

27
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.600
tr training and stuff.

28
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.920
I was starting my mental training as I was going into that third fight. Um,

29
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:28.840
or that, that third loss, that second fight with will Brooks. Um,

30
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.000
but I just hadn't been there yet. And honestly that one,

31
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.760
that one was more just like I got caught, you know? Um, but that,

32
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.280
that was really what kind of set the trigger. And, and I re,

33
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:41.640
and I think I just started to realize Michael, why, you know, you,

34
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:44.070
you sit there and you tell the people, you wanna be the best. You, your,

35
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.310
your actions speak louder than your words.

36
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.150
You work harder than everybody else you show. At first,

37
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:50.470
you you're the last one to leave. You take care of your body,

38
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.630
you do all the right things. At the end of the day, somebody has to be the best.

39
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.670
Why shouldn't it be you? And I kept asking myself that question,

40
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.590
and the only answer I could come up with was I deserve to be the best.

41
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.540
I really do. You know, I, and I can say that with humility to say,

42
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.540
I really do deserve to be the best guy in the,

43
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:09.100
in the entire world at lightweight. Now, nobody works harder than I do.

44
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:10.780
Nobody takes care of themselves better than I do.

45
00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:13.220
Nobody has made the sacrifices that I have and nobody lives the,

46
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.100
the clean lifestyle like I do and has,

47
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:20.020
has a calling on their life like I do yet when it came down to it,

48
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:24.770
it has taken years and years and decades to almost erase the small mindedness

49
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.170
that I've had in my past. Um, and we're all just a constant work in progress.

50
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.850
And I, and I think I just, I came up with work hard, good things might happen,

51
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.530
but most likely you'll be mediocre. You know, that's kind of,

52
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.210
that was kind of my mindset. Yeah. But what.

53
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.210
<v 0>Did you do different? Like what, what did you change.</v>

54
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.290
<v 1>For me? Yeah. Reading books. Um, like what specifically.</v>

55
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.920
<v 0>Do you remember? Um, what triggered it? What, what.</v>

56
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.840
<v 1>Helped you? There's a, um, there was a, a book called mind. Jim,</v>

57
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.240
have you ever heard of it? No mind, Jim. And they talked about, um,

58
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.120
he talks about making a mental highlight reel.

59
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.600
And since that day I've made mental highlight reels every couple months.

60
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.000
And even, even right now to this day,

61
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.640
there's on my mental highlight reel right now is beating Kyle sanderserson,

62
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.220
um,

63
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.600
at Mao on senior night when him and I were ranked at the same,

64
00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:12.080
we were ranked like fourth and fifth in the country, you know?

65
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.880
And not that I wasn't supposed to beat him, but the manner in which I beat him,

66
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:15.714
I almost majored him.

67
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.550
And it was one of those breakthrough moments where I gave myself and in front of

68
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.430
everybody to just go out there and beat a guy handedly,

69
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.390
this is a wrestling match, and it was a wrestling match, you know? And so.

70
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.990
<v 0>When you say, make a mental highlight real,</v>

71
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.110
this is of your past accomplishments.

72
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.910
<v 1>Past accomplishments. And I think the biggest detriment, the,</v>

73
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.750
the biggest detriment to the people that work hard and expect a lot of

74
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.980
themselves is when you have achievements,

75
00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:41.780
you don't take time to smell the roses.

76
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:45.420
You don't take time to pat yourself on the back. You fee, you think that, okay,

77
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:48.580
well, if I, if I, if I stop and I say, you know what? I am good. Oh my gosh,

78
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.620
I did do a great job. Holy cow. I was dominant.

79
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.620
You're not supposed to do that because that's prideful and that's, that's,

80
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:55.740
that's conceded and that's narcissistic, but really,

81
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.500
if you're not your biggest fan, who's gonna be, you know,

82
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.290
and I think that's what I did. I would accomplish something I'd say, okay, well,

83
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.130
I'm supposed to accomplish that. Right. I was, I won this tournament. Well,

84
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:04.970
I was supposed to, you.

85
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.130
<v 0>Were raise, but there's a balance, right?</v>

86
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:10.130
There's a balance between pating yourself on the back too much and kissing your

87
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:14.050
own and believing your own. And we see what happens with those guys.

88
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.570
&lt;affirmative&gt;, that's.

89
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.570
<v 1>Almost worse. Exactly. Well, and I, and I think,</v>

90
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.730
and I think we've all seen those cases too. Yeah.

91
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.400
We've all seen those cases where, or you see,

92
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.960
you see one guy pride comes before the fall, and then all of a sudden,

93
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:26.080
the fall happens. You say, okay, well, I don't wanna do that. Right.

94
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.320
But there is that fine line that, that middle ground where it's like, I,

95
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.320
I it's okay to love yourself. Right.

96
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:35.160
It's okay to look at yourself in the mirror and say that man, right there,

97
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.720
standing in front of me in the mirror is a badass. And you are,

98
00:04:37.721 --> 00:04:39.960
you deserve to be extremely successful.

99
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.590
But then when you go out in the world that you don't walk around,

100
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.670
like you're better than people you don't walk around. Like, you know, so I mean,

101
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:48.670
there's, there is no, you know,

102
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.190
finite a plus B equal C type of way to live.

103
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.230
But there is that middle ground between being your biggest fan,

104
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.310
taking time to stop,

105
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.990
stop and pet yourself on the back and re realize your accomplishments,

106
00:04:59.991 --> 00:05:02.660
which the highlight real thing is something great.

107
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:04.620
Cuz you can go through 10 things in your past.

108
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.260
And just continuing to remember those times where you,

109
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.740
you were in your flow state,

110
00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:12.940
where you absolutely performed at a ridiculous level, that you didn't,

111
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:14.540
that you kind of surprised yourself almost.

112
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.100
And I think that continues to happen step by step in brick, by boring brick,

113
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:19.780
you make these little bitty accomplishments.

114
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.500
And as long as you continue to remember them,

115
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.050
you can continue to increase that confident capacity that you have that you

116
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.730
should have. And, and start to go from, man. I didn't know. I,

117
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.810
I was capable of this to now the confident expectancy of okay. I, I,

118
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.490
I said I deserve it, but now I really am starting to believe that I deserve it.

119
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:39.970
And then once you actually believe,

120
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.760
then you get in those scenarios where it's you just him and someone's gotta win.

121
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.960
So it's you more, most of the time now, so this flow.

122
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.793
<v 0>State thing.</v>

123
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.320
So like when you are in a state where you feel like everything is just

124
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.400
clicking mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; do you try to,

125
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.960
how do you try to recreate that in your mind to remember that state?

126
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.080
<v 1>I think it's, I think it, it is writing things down after a practice or,</v>

127
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.360
or honestly, sometimes what I like to do is do, do you do that?

128
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.480
<v 0>You like have a journal, a training journal.</v>

129
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.400
<v 1>Yeah. Try to write things down. I mean, and, and that's,</v>

130
00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:10.920
that's things too that can be added to a mental highlight reel, you know,

131
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.910
like going,

132
00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.240
like having a really great sparring day and then remembering what you had for

133
00:06:15.241 --> 00:06:17.150
breakfast. Remember and how you're your day start.

134
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:21.550
I remember whether you did or did not watch TV before practice or you know,

135
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.390
those little things. And then,

136
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.910
and then I always talk about working extremely hard and surround yourself with

137
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:29.070
the best people possible. And that's why I've, you know,

138
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:30.470
I moved out to Las Vegas, right?

139
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.030
When I started fighting and then moved to San Diego and then moved and then

140
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.710
moved my training camp to Arizona and then now Florida and now,

141
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.460
so I've moved all over the country to find the best guys I possibly can.

142
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:43.500
So when you have a great day like that, sit down with the coaches and say,

143
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:46.540
Hey coach, you know, talking to Henry or Evan or come, or,

144
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.940
or one of these guys that is coaching me right now and talk about it.

145
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.580
Like almost overly talk about it,

146
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:54.580
which that those guys are always annoying to me. Or they always used to be like,

147
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.340
Hey, I did this right. And I did this right. And did this right.

148
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.170
As I always thought, well, you should just work. You shouldn't talk, just work.

149
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.250
Right. But you get,

150
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.090
I I've started to realize that those things need to be vocalized or they get

151
00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:08.450
swept under the rug. And you forget that you had a great day.

152
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.370
So now we sit down and we talk and we say, Hey man, that, that three,

153
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.730
two was really, really working great off the faint. And we worked that,

154
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.730
we worked that yesterday as we were hitting MITs.

155
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.200
And now you're continuing to show yourself that this thing really actually does

156
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:23.040
work. You're not just working to work, you're working smart. And then you see,

157
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.680
you see that working smart actually turns into results. And then you're, you're,

158
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:29.480
you're, you're like a lab rat in the gym,

159
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.880
working on these little experiments that you're, that you're making.

160
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.600
And you're actually collecting the data and seeing the results. Now, when.

161
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.230
<v 0>You're talking about a mental highlight real thing, is this sort of a,</v>

162
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.870
a rebuilding exercise, a rebuilding confidence exercise,

163
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.670
or is this just a solidifying skillset and understanding your

164
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.350
potential, cuz you've already done things before, like,

165
00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:54.110
because you were in a bad spot. Yeah.

166
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:56.310
When you started doing this mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you,

167
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.620
is this when you started constructing this highlight real thing. That's.

168
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.060
<v 1>What, yeah. That's when it that's when I really, I actually read the book in,</v>

169
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.340
in college and then found it on my shelf one day.

170
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.300
<v 0>Do you know who wrote it? Mind Jim. Gary. Oh, see you find it. Jimmy.</v>

171
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:09.780
Me Gary ack, Gary Mack.

172
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.740
<v 1>Gary M macpowerful for Gary Mac. Yeah. And then there was just a bunch of,</v>

173
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.300
and there was another book, um,

174
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.700
don't remind or remind me it's called how champions think. Um, but,

175
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.690
and it was just bunch of a bunch of instances where they would talk about tiger

176
00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:24.570
woods. They would talk about this guy or that guy mm-hmm, you know,

177
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.530
and then one of the chapters was doing a mental highlight real and I think it

178
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:30.330
can be used for both. I mean, no, like, I mean, you should do one today.

179
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.330
We should all do one today. Whether you're in a great place,

180
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:34.164
whether you're just,

181
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.610
you just close the biggest business deal you ever possibly could,

182
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.010
or you just are down in the dumps because you feel like the biggest loser on or

183
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.740
earth,

184
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.440
you do a mental highlight reel to just it's it's just like going to the gym and

185
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:47.640
then it changes. You know, maybe, maybe this month is different than next month.

186
00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:48.041
Maybe you,

187
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:51.720
you wipe off an old one and you put on a brand new one that you just remembered.

188
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.120
Because sometimes we forget successes that we have, it takes,

189
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.880
it takes me going to my Wikipedia page or me, you know,

190
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.640
going on some old interviews or, or somebody telling me on Twitter. Hey,

191
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.360
remember that time you did this for me to actually remember the successes that

192
00:09:04.361 --> 00:09:07.560
I've had, because I've been conditioned to pull myself up by my boots,

193
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.880
bootstraps every single day and forget about all my accomplishes in my past.

194
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.600
Cuz those don't matter. Those are stumbling.

195
00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:16.630
Those what I use used to look at stumbling blocks because what got you here,

196
00:09:16.631 --> 00:09:18.510
isn't gonna get you where, where you want to go.

197
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.790
And we have that some sort of that, that mentality.

198
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.990
But you have to take the time to remember and almost look at yourself the way

199
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:28.830
other people see you, because we all are our, our, all our biggest critics,

200
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:33.270
you know, the way my fans see me, the way you watch me fight is, and, and the,

201
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:34.750
the way you see my abilities,

202
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.740
it's probably even better than I have seen myself a lot in my past from an

203
00:09:39.741 --> 00:09:40.580
outside perspective. Right?

204
00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:45.060
It's so much easier to look at someone outside perspective because our own inner

205
00:09:45.061 --> 00:09:48.060
monologue or our own and, and our own selfim image,

206
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:52.740
dumies down who we are and, and how much we want to accomplish. Not all of us.

207
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.700
I mean, there's a lot of people out there who are cocky.

208
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:58.330
Narciss sit to narcissistic people who think they are the, you know, those.

209
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.330
<v 0>People have the hardest time coming back from losses though. Big time. Yeah.</v>

210
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:03.410
It seems like when they get head kicked or something and,

211
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.930
and then they realize they're human. Yeah. It's like, whoa,

212
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.770
you see it with a lot of those guys where yeah. They don't,

213
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.730
instead of facing their demons, what they've done is create this delusional,

214
00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.850
delusional self-image mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

215
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.840
And when that delusional self-image gets shattered and it's an undeniable

216
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.600
reality that there's people that are better than them. It's very,

217
00:10:23.601 --> 00:10:25.160
very difficult for them to bounce back.

218
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.280
<v 1>Yeah. Well, and I mean, I think I, I am by no means the poster child for,</v>

219
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.081
for that. I mean, it,

220
00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:33.800
it took me a loss that carried me into another loss and another loss. It was a,

221
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.830
I went 688 days without a win, never. But when I write a book, some days,

222
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.910
some days it's gonna be called 688 days.

223
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:45.550
And that's how long it took me to go from loss to win. And that's a long time.

224
00:10:45.551 --> 00:10:47.550
That's a long, time's a long time to be,

225
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:50.710
to question yourself every single day to wake up in the morning.

226
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.670
Wondering if you were gonna have a paycheck,

227
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.030
wondering if you were gonna get a phone call from your manager,

228
00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:01.020
wondering if you really wanted to open up your phone and see all the

229
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.580
negative comments that I told you,

230
00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:04.980
Michael Chandler wasn't as good as we all thought he was, oh, you,

231
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.980
I can't believe. I believe &lt;laugh&gt;. You can't hate that dude. You know,

232
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.980
but I mean, not even, you know, not even just the fans, it was, you know,

233
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:14.940
the media wrote me off and, and, and everybody, you, you know, the you're,

234
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.330
you're just, you get written off and, and it, it,

235
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:21.250
it shapes the reality when really the reality was, man, I,

236
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.450
I was put on this earth to do some great things, but it just took me. I look,

237
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.570
I look at it now. And I think, you know, if bad things happen to you,

238
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:31.530
but a good things come, a good thing comes from it. Wasn't really a bad thing.

239
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:33.850
And I look at it and I say, everybody's got losses. It's not a big deal.

240
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.370
You know, I remember the sting. I remember the pain.

241
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.120
I remember the embarrassment. I mean, what we also REM gotta remember too,

242
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:43.360
is this is embarrassing. You lose a fight. That's embarrassing. You know,

243
00:11:43.361 --> 00:11:46.640
it's a hard pill to swallow. Yeah. You know, so it's, it's tough.

244
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:50.640
<v 0>Especially when you were a former champion and then you're going these 600 plus</v>

245
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.480
days without a, a win. And that's,

246
00:11:52.481 --> 00:11:57.120
it really highlights the difficult nature of fighting as opposed to any other

247
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.120
sport where, you know, there's,

248
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.000
there's times where it's entirely likely that you're gonna

249
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.680
go a long time without competing again. Yeah.

250
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.560
You could go six months without competing again. You can go eight months, guys,

251
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.390
go a year. If you get a injured. Yeah. That's a long time. Any other sport,

252
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.390
if you lose a baseball game, you know, you drop a ball. Yeah.

253
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:20.750
Like you're back at it next.

254
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:23.310
<v 1>Day. The next day. Same thing with wrestling. Yeah. You know, wrestling,</v>

255
00:12:23.311 --> 00:12:25.910
wrestling was great because you know, you, you lost,

256
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.430
you lost a match on Saturday. You were able to,

257
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.550
to come back in the dual on Wednesday or even the next Saturday,

258
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.180
seven days you had to go &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, I mean a lot of times, yeah.

259
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.220
I mean, barring injuries or what whatnot. I mean,

260
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.500
it could be a year before you get to get to step back in the cage again.

261
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.780
And then every single day you spend questioning and every single day,

262
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.140
you also just end up putting so much pressure on yourself. I mean, my,

263
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.260
the biggest thing that I did wrong was I came into this sport. I wasn't,

264
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.210
and literally the 18 months after guarding the sport,

265
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.730
I was in a cage with Eddie Alvarez, top five guy in the world,

266
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.130
beat Eddie Alvarez. Then it was like, okay, now you have to perform. That.

267
00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:02.850
<v 0>Was that soon after starting the sport.</v>

268
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.130
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, August of 2009, I had my first fight.</v>

269
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.770
And then I fought him in 2011. That's.

270
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.530
<v 0>Crazy. Yeah. And you finished him.</v>

271
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.280
<v 1>And finished him, but, but then, but then now the, the,</v>

272
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.920
now the real game starts now. It's like, okay, Hey, you're there,

273
00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.960
you're ranked in the top three, top five. You know,

274
00:13:18.961 --> 00:13:21.560
your whole future depends on every single fight.

275
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.800
And then instead of think about every single fight,

276
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.920
you think about every single practice.

277
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.360
And instead of think about every single practice,

278
00:13:27.361 --> 00:13:30.000
you think about every single round in practice and not, not just every round,

279
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.320
but every minute in practice. So you hit me with a, you hit me with a one,

280
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.670
two immediately. That's the loss in my mind.

281
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:38.110
So now I have to come back and get it. You know?

282
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.510
So instead of just focusing on success, I was focusing on perfection.

283
00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.550
So every single day I was trying to be perfect and you can't be perfect. Mm.

284
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.870
The greatest athletes in the world will tell you, they are not perfect.

285
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.310
You know, they fail time and time and time again.

286
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.500
But I put all this pressure on myself to where I put myself up in this prison of

287
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.340
Michael, you suck because you just lost to this guy.

288
00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:03.060
Who's not even signed to any organization at all. And you just lost to him in,

289
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.060
in this, in this sparring round. And my, my view of,

290
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:09.180
of what the loss was was different than my coach who watched it. He said, no,

291
00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:12.140
you did all right. You didn't lose horribly. But in my mind, I lost horribly.

292
00:14:12.141 --> 00:14:14.540
I would've got finished, blah, blah, blah. The kind of like crazy stuff,

293
00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:17.210
you know? Um, so that's the thing too,

294
00:14:17.211 --> 00:14:19.810
is I started focusing on success and not perfection, you know,

295
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.130
stop putting so much pressure in yourself to be perfect.

296
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.090
Just focus on being successful.

297
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.770
Now I'm focusing on the big picture of being successful instead of these little

298
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.810
bitty instances where I'm trying to be perfect.

299
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.250
<v 0>Now, when you look at yourself and you look at your overall MMA skillset,</v>

300
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:34.650
do you, uh,

301
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.920
do you try to look at it all almost like as if you're managing yourself,

302
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.720
not managing yourself, like a fight manager mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but like,

303
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.520
like a project. Yeah. Like looking at it like, okay,

304
00:14:43.521 --> 00:14:46.080
this is what we need to work on. This is how I need to tighten this up.

305
00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.400
And ti do you, do you look at it as like an overall long term project?

306
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:51.760
Like how do you, how do you.

307
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:53.840
<v 1>Visualize it? Yeah, I mean, and, and I,</v>

308
00:14:53.841 --> 00:14:56.360
and I get that question a lot too is like, well, Hey, how much, how much,

309
00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.480
how do you prepare for an opponent? And honestly,

310
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.720
I'd say almost 90% of my training is focusing on myself. I mean, because if I,

311
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.720
if I put the right systems in place, if I get the right still skill sets,

312
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.070
as sharp as they can be fight night,

313
00:15:11.071 --> 00:15:13.910
there's not a guy in the lightweight division in the entire world that I think

314
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:14.350
can beat me.
