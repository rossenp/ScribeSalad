00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 1>I remember there's a woman who came to the comedy store after the last</v>

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.460
podcast that we did. And she apparently is also working on it.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.870
And she was trying to explain it to me, her version of it, you know,

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.750
after hearing your version of it, it was very similar,

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.400
but I believe she was from Romania.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.540
So she was struggling a little bit with English and she was so excited to

8
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:25.201
discuss it.

9
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:30.150
It's so fascinating when you see someone who's like for the

10
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:34.560
limited number of how many of you guys there are, and gals there are out there.

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.130
I mean,

12
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.750
whatever the number is when that spark gets ignited and other

13
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:41.850
people start tuning into it,

14
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.480
she was so excited that this was being discussed on a podcast.

15
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.510
And she wanted to talk to me about it, to say, you know,

16
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:51.330
please have more people on, please talk about this more. You know,

17
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:54.300
we need support. We need, you know, it's.

18
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.800
<v 2>It is it's,</v>

19
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.230
it does baffle me a little bit how difficult it is, swimming uphill, um,

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.120
to get more support for this kind of thing,

21
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:08.040
because it is just an enormous privilege to be

22
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.050
able to call your job thinking about the fundamental nature of reality, right?

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.170
Like, you know, I gave you my first book tour talk was last Tuesday.

24
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.870
And I had dinner the night before with, you know,

25
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.960
several philosophers of physics in the New York area of, you know,

26
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.480
from Columbia and NYU and Everett and, and, you know,

27
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:27.990
we're all friends and we could talk about, you know, our cats and our cars,

28
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.860
but every single word discussed at the table all night long was about the

29
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.820
philosophy of physics.

30
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.250
<v 1>Is it because you guys work in isolation essentially,</v>

31
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:36.360
and then when you get together,

32
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.100
you just you're so pumped up to be discussing these things with like-minded

33
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:41.610
souls.

34
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.200
<v 2>You know, in, in part. Yeah. I mean,</v>

35
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.400
I there's no one else in the physics department at Caltech who cares about these

36
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:47.970
issues. I mean,

37
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.850
some of them care in the sense that they are happy that I'm doing it,

38
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.520
but no one does it related to themselves. Yeah. Well,

39
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:56.880
there's a couple other people in the philosophy department who care about the.

40
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.780
<v 1>And a lot of folks you were saying get pushed into philosophy. And why,</v>

41
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.100
why is that? I mean, is it just because it's so complex that it's so esoteric,

42
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:09.270
there's so many people that just, they don't the support for, it's not there,

43
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.170
but the support for our philosophy is more common and mainstream. Yeah.

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.910
<v 2>Yeah. You know, there's different kinds of support.</v>

45
00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:19.500
One kind of support in academia is who do you hire? Right. W what,

46
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:23.100
what areas do you want? Like a physics department will generally say, yeah,

47
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.140
we should have some people doing particle physics.

48
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:26.580
Some people doing astrophysics,

49
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.790
some people doing condensed matter and solid state physics. And then,

50
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.970
and then it becomes hard. Do we need people doing biophysics?

51
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:34.260
Do we need people doing this?

52
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.350
And by the time they get to the foundations of quantum mechanics, there's,

53
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.550
there's usually very little support, um, philosophers there,

54
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:46.080
their job is being patient and clarifying difficult

55
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:47.430
conceptual questions.

56
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.460
And so they get that quantum mechanics is fertile territory for

57
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.570
philosophy like it, you know,

58
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:58.980
one of the big problems in philosophy compared to science is that many of the

59
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.740
questions that they're asking cannot be tested experimentally, right?

60
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.930
What is infinity? Well, you know, okay, it's hard to do an experiment there,

61
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.500
but it's an important question, right? And so you need patience,

62
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:16.480
but also it's harder to make progress because it's easy to be trapped

63
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:18.130
by your intuition, right?

64
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.430
Like when it's just you thinking and trying to think hard and be rational and so

65
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.620
forth, it's easy to fall into a trap of, well,

66
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.280
this looks reasonable to me and quantum mechanics doesn't look reasonable to

67
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.010
anybody. So it's a wonderful corrective,

68
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:33.520
it's a wonderful reality check when you think, well, reality has to be this way.

69
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:35.560
And then someone can say, well, look at quantum mechanics,

70
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.760
that's different than what you said.

71
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.740
<v 1>So philosophy and quantum mechanics, they sort of, they, they,</v>

72
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.540
they share some sort of a.

73
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.900
<v 2>Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely. I mean the things.</v>

74
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.610
So I was always a big fan of philosophy ever since I was an undergraduate.

75
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:53.110
And I discovered it for the first time,

76
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.190
but when I was an undergraduate and my favorite philosophy classes were like the

77
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:00.400
philosophy of morality or political philosophy, right.

78
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.530
I took philosophy of science classes,

79
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:07.330
but they seem to be kind of dry to me because they were all about how scientific

80
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:09.670
theories are constructed and chosen. You know,

81
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:13.240
the structure of scientific revolutions is the famous book that everyone reads,

82
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.050
uh, people like Thomas Kuhn and Paul fire, Robin, and so forth. And okay,

83
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:20.770
that's interesting, but it's sort of meta science, right?

84
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.730
It's like how science is done, not how the world works. And it wasn't until,

85
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.740
you know, circa 2000 that I discovered that there are philosophers of

86
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:32.020
physics who are kind of really doing physics. You know,

87
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.380
that they're not asking how physics works, they're asking how the world works,

88
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:38.950
but they're asking in a way that is comfortably, uh,

89
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.960
located in philosophy departments. And right now,

90
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.340
not so much in physics departments.

91
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.890
<v 1>There was a part of the book that,</v>

92
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.280
that shocked me because I had a ridiculous idea once.

93
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.030
And this idea was not my idea.

94
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:56.530
Apparently Laplas had a very similar idea as a thought experiment.

95
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:01.030
I had an idea once that if one day there was a computer that was so

96
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:05.740
powerful that it could accurately describe every single

97
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:09.100
object on earth that we would be able to figure out the past.

98
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.080
And LaPaz was saying that not only that he proposed for the entire

99
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.960
universe, like every single object,

100
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:19.990
electron everything in Adam in the entire universe,

101
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.430
that you would not only be able to show the past, but also predict the future.

102
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.600
<v 2>That's right. So this is called Laplas is demon. Although he never called it,</v>

103
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:31.450
that Pearson won the applause. Uh, it was a brilliant guy.

104
00:05:31.451 --> 00:05:34.000
He deserves to be much more well known. So I basically,

105
00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:34.840
I think I've mentioned him,

106
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.750
his name and every book that I've ever written for totally different reasons.

107
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.310
Uh, he helped invent probability as we currently understand it, for example. Um,

108
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:43.121
but yeah,

109
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:46.990
so Isaac Newton came up with the rules of classical mechanics in the 16

110
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:47.824
hundreds,

111
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.870
but it wasn't until applause around the year 1800 that this implication of

112
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:56.020
classical mechanics was realized it's a clockwork universe.

113
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.440
That the way classical mechanics works is if you tell me the state of a system

114
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.010
right now at one moment, by which in classical mechanics,

115
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.770
you would mean the position and the velocity of every part.

116
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.720
And you knew the laws of physics and you had arbitrarily large computational

117
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:15.200
capacity. Laplas said a vast intelligence, okay.

118
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.600
Then to that vast intelligence,

119
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:22.160
the past and future would be as determined and known as the present was

120
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.130
because that's the clockwork universe is deterministic.

121
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:28.340
Everything is fixed once, you know, the present moment. Now,

122
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.000
quantum mechanics comes along and throws a spanner into the works a little bit.

123
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.490
If you're a many worlds person, Laplas demon is still possible.

124
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.520
So if you know the wave function of the universe, exactly,

125
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.760
and you have infinite calculational capacity,

126
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.850
you could predict the past and the future with perfect accuracy.

127
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:50.690
But what you're predicting is all of the branches of the wave function.

128
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.060
So any individual person inside the wave function still experiences

129
00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.860
apparently random events, right? So you can't predict what will happen to you,

130
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:04.820
even if you can predict what will happen to the entire universe. Whew.

131
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.120
<v 1>Yeah. Sean, Kara, my goodness.</v>

132
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.400
There's a lot of people pause in this podcast right now,

133
00:07:10.401 --> 00:07:11.450
just shaking their head. Like.

134
00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.680
<v 2>You know, I wrote a little article that just appeared in quantum magazine,</v>

135
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.580
which by the way, if anyone here is a science fan, quantum magazine is the best,

136
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.670
um, online magazine for science these days, they have really,

137
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:25.610
really good high level art, um, articles, but all sorts of things.

138
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.590
And so I wrote an article called what is probability? Cause you know, again,

139
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.110
this is a philosopher's kind of question like, you know,

140
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.200
physicists will just put it to use and get on with their lives.

141
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.800
Philosophers will say, well, what do you really mean by probability? Um,

142
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:44.450
the traditional answer is if you're flipping a coin and you say it's 50 50,

143
00:07:44.451 --> 00:07:49.040
what you mean by that is that if you flipped it an infinite number of times,

144
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.530
half the time, it will be heads half the time. It would be tales.

145
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:55.490
That's what you mean. It's called the frequentist idea of probability.

146
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.750
But then what do you say? Like, well, what is the probability that, uh,

147
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.200
Donald Trump wins reelection? That's not going to happen. Infinite.

148
00:08:03.201 --> 00:08:05.870
Number of times, you're not going to do the experiment or even better.

149
00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.970
What was the probability that Lee Harvey,

150
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:12.680
Oswald actually was the lone shooter of JFK that already happened that's in the

151
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:14.990
past. Right. But we can easily say, well,

152
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.000
I think it was an 80% chance that that's true. Right?

153
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.190
So this is called Bayesean probability where rather than thinking of an

154
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:23.900
infinite number of things going on,

155
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.160
you're assigning a degree of confidence to your lack of perfect knowledge,

156
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.920
right? Like, I don't know exact, there's something. Yeah.

157
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:33.020
There's something going on. I don't know what it is.

158
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.790
So I assign a probability and that just like a frequency that, you know, those,

159
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.860
the credence, as we say,

160
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:42.890
that you assigned to these different ideas is a positive number.

161
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:46.610
Then all the credences add up to one because something happened. Um,

162
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.970
so in quantum mechanics, is,

163
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.240
is probability more like frequent is probability or is it more like,

164
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.620
and probability the answer is,

165
00:08:54.621 --> 00:08:58.230
it depends what your favorite version of quantum mechanics is in one of these

166
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.640
spontaneous collapsed theories. Uh, it's very much like a frequency. Like,

167
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:03.151
you know, you just,

168
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:07.350
things happen randomly and it's purely objective in something like many worlds.

169
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.280
Well, sorry, I shouldn't say in something like hidden variables, it's,

170
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:12.840
Laplace's demon all over again.

171
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:16.770
So Laplace's demon doesn't work in a spontaneous collapsed theory because you,

172
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.230
the laws of physics are not deterministic.

173
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:23.280
You don't know when things are going to collapse all by themselves. Um,

174
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.020
in hidden variable theory,

175
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.400
the hidden variables and the wave function of all deterministically,

176
00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:31.800
but you don't know what the hidden variables are.

177
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.770
So you can assign some probability to having them be different things.

178
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.840
So there's some ignorance involved,

179
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.470
many worlds is the coolest idea because it's, it's kind of,

180
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.310
and this is what it's kind of hard to wrap your mind around.

181
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.480
On the one hand, there is only the wave function. It describes the universe.

182
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:52.170
Exactly. But imagine that I measure the spin of an electron. Okay.

183
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:56.280
So I actually do know what the wave function is going to evolve into.

184
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.030
It's going to evolve into a 50 50 split of I observed the spinning up and I

185
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:02.580
observed it's spinning down. And then,

186
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.780
but I only ever find myself in one side or the other.

187
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:11.850
So there is always a moment in between when the

188
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:15.000
wave function splits. And when I know about it,

189
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.540
it splits much faster than I can know about it. The, the rate,

190
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.800
the speed of a wave function,

191
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:23.250
branching is some incredibly tiny number 10 to the minus 20 seconds or something

192
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:24.084
like that.

193
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.170
And the timescale of things happening in my brain is like 10 to the minus three

194
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:29.550
seconds at best. Okay.

195
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:34.530
So there will always be a time when there are two copies of me,

196
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:39.060
one on the branch where the spend was up one or the branch with has been was

197
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:42.330
down, but they're both identical. They don't know which branch they're on yet.

198
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.510
So they need to be good Bayesians and say, well,

199
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:48.810
what probability should I assign that I'm on one branch or the other?

200
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:52.080
And it turns out that the probability is work exactly like the textbook quantum

201
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:54.000
mechanics tells you the probability should work out.

202
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.350
And how's that the wave function squared is the probabilities.

203
00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.760
So there's a function square.

204
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:02.850
This is a rule called the born rule after max born,

205
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:07.800
who was a physicist who invented it. So, I mean read the book of course,

206
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.170
but, uh, like, like you said, it to the very start,

207
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:13.680
the history of quantum mechanics is just so fascinating and hilarious.

208
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.290
Schrodinger Erwin Schrodinger of Schrodinger's cat fame invented the idea of the

209
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:22.470
wave function and wrote down the equation that it obeys. Okay.

210
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:27.720
But what he hoped was that if you had the wave function of electron all by

211
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:30.060
itself, if you solved his equation,

212
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.690
it would sort of show that the wave function becomes localized,

213
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:37.260
peaked at one location, the electron kind of acts like a point particle.

214
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:39.630
And that's why we see particles. That was his hope.

215
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.990
What actually happens when you solve the equation is that the electron spreads

216
00:11:42.991 --> 00:11:46.080
out all throughout the universe. So he was, his hope was dashed.

217
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.960
And then he's like, all right, I have this equation. What is it like,

218
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:53.440
what is the wave function do? And it was max borne, a whole nother guy who said,

219
00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.170
what the wave function does is you square it.

220
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.630
And that's the probability of seeing something somewhere.

221
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.050
Like if the wave function looks like this at some spread out thing,

222
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.380
there's very small probability over here and large probability over there.

223
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.700
Cause the probability is the wave function squared. And Schrodinger said like,

224
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.400
oh my God, that's awful. I'm sad. I had anything to do with it.

225
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:16.720
He regretted being involved with this whole idea of probabilities and collapses

226
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:17.500
and all that stuff.
