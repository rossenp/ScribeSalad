00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.810
This is something that I want to discuss to cardiovascular disease and heart

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:07.291
attacks.

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:11.640
The difference between the rate of cardiovascular disease and heart attacks

5
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:16.500
today, versus like the early 19 hundreds, there's a giant spike,

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.580
a big change.

7
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.080
<v 1>Same as those other graphs we could, it would be essentially the same,</v>

8
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.210
the same reflection on the graph.

9
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.180
It would be an up angle that you would not want to skate, you know, and it,

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.180
and again, it's the question. What is driving this? What is driving this?

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.110
Because we were eating more saturated fat in 1900,

12
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.890
we were eating way more saturated fat in 1800 or 1840.

13
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.750
And the only oils we use were animal fats, which are not entirely saturated.

14
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.690
There are about half mano and half saturated, half mono and saturated,

15
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:47.870
half saturated with a very small amount of polyunsaturated.

16
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.900
So to say that it's to say that it's saturated fat driving.

17
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:54.080
This doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Again, this is just correlation,

18
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.240
but there's not, there's not even a correlation there.

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.590
The correlation is with vegetable oil. And if you get into this research,

20
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.940
it's complex, but it's pretty darn striking. If you look at linoleic acid.

21
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.260
So, and you look at the molecule it's polyunsaturated,

22
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:10.730
so it's a long chain carbon,

23
00:01:10.731 --> 00:01:14.600
and Polyon saturation means it has double bonds between the carpets and those

24
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.600
double bonds can be oxidized. When we talked about oxidation earlier,

25
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.170
and this formation of a lipid peroxides, well, those molecules,

26
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:24.440
poly unsaturated fats, and even Moto and saturated fat,

27
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.000
any unsaturation point in a carbon skeleton molecule, like a chain long chain,

28
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.750
fatty acid is going to make it susceptible to oxidation and then lipid

29
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:33.441
peroxides,

30
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:37.490
which are lipids that have had an electron stolen from that double bond. Um,

31
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.110
then those are more susceptible to,

32
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.080
those are more reactive with other lipids and they create these lifted peroxide

33
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.470
reactions as there's. Then you're getting oxidative stress from the lipids.

34
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.790
And if you look at so we should back up for a moment. It goes back to,

35
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:51.470
we were talking about earlier, the reason,

36
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.640
one of the reasons saturated fat has been thought of as bad for so long

37
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.280
is because it raises LDL.

38
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.650
But if LDL is not Denovo causing

39
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:06.700
atherosclerosis, then we have a whole different equation. Let's.

40
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.990
<v 0>Get into that because this is one of the big questions that I got.</v>

41
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:11.570
When I told people I was going to eat an animal only diet for a month.

42
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.560
They're like, what about your cholesterol? What are you going to do about your,

43
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.670
and I'll be like, Ugh.

44
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.070
And I tried to tell them that dietary cholesterol does not raise cholesterol and

45
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:25.370
your blood lipids. And they just glaze over. And they're like, well, you know,

46
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:28.370
you're taking in a lot of cholesterol and they it's just,

47
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.110
most people don't have the time to research this or to get into the

48
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.700
weeds and to try to shift their perception about what cholesterol is

49
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.580
about the benefits of cholesterol,

50
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.790
the necessity of cholesterol for the human diet, for production of hormones.

51
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.350
So let's get into that LDL and HDL. What is the difference?

52
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.780
<v 1>So LDL is low density lipoprotein,</v>

53
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.410
and it's formed from VLDL after it becomes IDL,

54
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.910
which is intermediate density lipoprotein. So when you eat fat in your diet,

55
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.330
it is generally in triglycerides form,

56
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.880
which has packaged into molecules called Kyla microns,

57
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.800
which move from the intestines to the liver in the liver cholesterol,

58
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.690
which is actually a steroid backbone.

59
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.860
Molecule is packaged with triglycerides into a VLDL,

60
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.100
a very debt, low density, lipoprotein particle. It's like a bus.

61
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.350
It moves triglycerides and cholesterol around the body because they're

62
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.250
nutrients because they're essential for human life. Because like you said,

63
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.370
hormones are made from a cholesterol backbone.

64
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.880
And if you did not have cholesterol, you would be very sick and die.

65
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.030
There's a genetic condition called Smith Lemley op-eds syndrome, which is a,

66
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.610
a mutation in one of the enzymes that makes cholesterol it's pretty far down in

67
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.280
the pathway, but a lot of these kids die in utero.

68
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.150
Those that are born have severe retardation, both mental and physical.

69
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.760
They're extremely, um, resistant.

70
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:55.090
They're extremely susceptible to infections and they have a lot of problems with

71
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.180
sleep and diabetes and other issues because they don't make cholesterol.

72
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:02.020
They have extremely low LDL because they can't make cholesterol in the liver.

73
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.480
And it probably in peripheral tissues either.

74
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.240
And so the way we treat these kids is with egg yolks.

75
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.750
We just give them tons and tons of dietary cholesterol in hopes that that will

76
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.590
be some sort of a supplement that,

77
00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:16.060
that they can use to make LDL as their LDL goes up. They do better.

78
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:17.290
They're never going to have a normal life,

79
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.180
but there are so many studies that point to the value of low

80
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:25.390
density lipoprotein. And if we just think about it evolutionarily,

81
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.280
why would nature?

82
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.870
Why would evolution have designed a particle that kills us within our body

83
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.620
that at the same time defends us from infection.

84
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.390
So there are good studies in animal models that show that if you knock out the

85
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:45.040
LDL receptor in, um, in, in mice and rats, they,

86
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.960
the levels of LDL and the blood drop a lot.

87
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.100
And those mice and rats are protected against infections.

88
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.490
So they can infuse bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria into those rats.

89
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.670
And a higher levels of LDL are protective in those studies.

90
00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:59.440
And the same thing has been true in human. You can look for it.

91
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.350
This is correlations. This is epidemiology. At some point,

92
00:05:02.351 --> 00:05:03.730
we should definitely talk about why that's not,

93
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.290
why epidemiology can be so misleading,

94
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.680
but higher levels of cholesterol are correlated with lower admission to the

95
00:05:08.681 --> 00:05:11.260
hospital for infectious complications.

96
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.590
And we definitely see in animal models and essentially with humans with the

97
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.270
Smith lemony op-eds genetic model,

98
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.860
that lower levels of cholesterol predisposed to infection because LDL lower

99
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.750
levels of serum cholesterol, meaning low density,

100
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:26.080
lipoprotein predisposed to infection because that low density lipoprotein

101
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:29.470
particle is part of the immune system. And so as HDL,

102
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.890
so HDL is high density lipoprotein. It leaves the liver.

103
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.830
It's kind of an empty bus. LDL leaves the liver as VLDL,

104
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.790
a full bus drops off people along the way becomes a less full bus.

105
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:43.690
VLDL becomes LDL. HDL is an empty bus that goes along the body,

106
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:45.400
picking things up and then returning to the liver,

107
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.610
but HDL and LDL both have roles in the immune system.

108
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
So why do we think that a molecule,

109
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.030
a lipoprotein particle that serves an indispensable role in the human

110
00:05:55.031 --> 00:05:58.340
biochemistry, or at least human physiology is killing us.

111
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.290
That's just the first step. Can I stop you there?

112
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.590
<v 0>Standard model? Like what do people believe?</v>

113
00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:06.040
Like if you asked a doctor that doesn't have a lot of nutrition training about

114
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:08.140
HDL and LDL, what would they tell you.

115
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.670
<v 1>At a, at a, at a very high level, they would say, HDL is good LDLs bat.</v>

116
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.870
You want less LDL and you want more HDL. Why would they say that?

117
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.090
Because there's something called the lipid hypothesis.

118
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:23.290
And the lipid hypothesis is that essentially in a

119
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.270
concentration dependent manner, LDL ends up in the arterial wall.

120
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.820
Okay. This is the little hypothesis I disagree with this.

121
00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:34.270
I think it's an incomplete hypothesis. And so they would say,

122
00:06:34.271 --> 00:06:35.800
if you have more LDL,

123
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.030
it's just going to kind of leak into your arterial wall because it naturally

124
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:43.150
gets taken up. And as more LDL ends up in your artery wall,

125
00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:45.700
you get more atherosclerosis and more plaque. What's the.

126
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.160
<v 0>Root of this hypothesis. It's.</v>

127
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.990
<v 1>A lot of epidemiology.</v>

128
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.050
Mundelien randomizations and genome-wide association studies.

129
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.230
So this is really interesting. We should dig into this.

130
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.440
So if you look at, um,

131
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.460
if you look at basic epidemiology, so let's just think about epidemiology.

132
00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:04.420
You've talked about this on the show before,

133
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:05.530
but I want to define this for people.

134
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.840
So epidemiology is essentially an observational study.

135
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.260
There's no experiment on they're giving people surveys and they're either

136
00:07:14.261 --> 00:07:16.300
following them moving forward, prospective,

137
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:19.960
or they're looking back at what they've done in the past a retrospective study.

138
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.410
And so epidemiology can generate correlations,

139
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:26.800
but we cannot draw causative inference from that data.

140
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.870
We can have a correlation which we then test with an interventional study LDLs

141
00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:34.420
kind of Tufts with tough to test with an interventional study.

142
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.350
But there's some really cool stuff here that starts to break it down.

143
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.680
If you look at overall cohorts of people.

144
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.990
So if you look at the Framingham study, for instance,

145
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.450
and you look at LDL on the X axis and incidence of cardiovascular disease on the

146
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:51.910
Y axis, I actually have two graphs of this that I'll show you that'll make.

147
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.160
That'll make it really, um, helpful to break it down. Um,

148
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.550
so if you look at those two and you don't do anything to,

149
00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:03.160
this is in the lipids and CVD folder, Jamie,

150
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.250
you see that CAC LDL only graphic.

151
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.450
So if you look at this, this is the basic data from Framingham, okay.

152
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.730
This is correlation.

153
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:19.300
This is epidemiology increasing risk of cardiovascular disease on the,

154
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.690
on the Y axis LDL on the X axis. Okay?

155
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.740
So it's things like this that make people say, oh yeah, LDL.

156
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.440
It's probably causing atherosclerosis,

157
00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:31.720
which is the formation of plaque within the arterial wall,

158
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.890
but go to the other one, Jamie CAC, LDL HDL.

159
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.140
So this is the exact same data stratified by a third variable.

160
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.410
And this is what is never considered with LDL. In my opinion,

161
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.590
the lipid hypothesis is flawed because it's incomplete.

162
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.820
It misses the third variable or fourth variable in this,

163
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.360
in this stratification, we've looked at HDL.

164
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.490
We've looked at the quote good cholesterol,

165
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:02.340
which we really don't know a whole lot about probably on immune participant,

166
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.650
but HDL levels do correlate with metabolic health synonymous with insulin

167
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.320
resistance. So what can we say about these people?

168
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.100
This is the exact same data that I split into four, four lines here.

169
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.970
Those with the lowest level of HDL are the most metabolically unhealthy.

170
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.290
These are the most obese,

171
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:22.500
the most likely to have coronary the most likely to have diabetes,

172
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.420
the most likely to have insulin resistance.

173
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:28.920
You can see they have a pretty good risk of a relative risk of cardiovascular

174
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:31.770
disease as LDL increases. But look at the bottom,

175
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.170
look at the people who are most insulin sensitive,

176
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.970
there's essentially no correlation or the correlation is massively

177
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.700
different between people with a high HDL,

178
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.590
good metabolic health and LDL increasing. Does that make sense?

179
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:48.440
<v 0>Sword?</v>

180
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.220
It says increasing LDL is very little increase in the cardiovascular disease

181
00:09:52.221 --> 00:09:53.300
risk with high.

182
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.640
<v 1>HDL. Yeah. So as you increase your.</v>

183
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.090
<v 0>LDL,</v>

184
00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.920
as long as you have high H T L increasing LDL has very little

185
00:10:00.921 --> 00:10:01.754
risk, very little.

186
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.050
<v 1>Chris, can we see that over and over and over and over? What if.</v>

187
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.260
<v 0>You just have high LDL and low HDL.</v>

188
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.020
<v 1>And you probably have diabetes, and in that case you have,</v>

189
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.070
then you're in trouble.

190
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:16.670
<v 0>So the issue is not eight LDL. It's low HDL.</v>

191
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:20.420
<v 1>The issue eight low HDL is reflective of an underlying pathology,</v>

192
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:23.060
which is metabolic dysfunction and or insulin resistance.

193
00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.150
The issue is insulin resistance, metabolic dysfunction.

194
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.660
So we're using HDL level as a proxy for metabolic healthier.

195
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.680
What is an optimal ratio of LDL to HDX? I actually it's,

196
00:10:34.681 --> 00:10:37.850
it's tricky because there is a whole group of people now, right?

197
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.150
So I have a good friend, Dave Feldman, who's doing, he's an engineer,

198
00:10:41.151 --> 00:10:43.970
super smart guy, doing a lot of really cool work on this.

199
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:48.200
And they're actually about to start a study with lean mass hyper responders

200
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.560
within the space, the carnivore ketogenic space.

201
00:10:51.561 --> 00:10:55.160
There are people who begin eating this way and they see their LDL go up

202
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.750
significantly. So some people don't see LDL rise, but I did.

203
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.830
I have a pretty high LDL. And so within the space,

204
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:07.820
there's a lot of people with high LDLs who look like me, pretty fit active,

205
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.390
don't have chest pain. Don't believe I have cardiovascular disease.

206
00:11:11.391 --> 00:11:13.610
We can talk about my blood work and what I've done to confirm that.

207
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.820
But there's a whole group of people called lean mass hyper responders.

208
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.170
And Dave's hypothesis,

209
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:23.150
which I agree with completely is that elevated LDL alone is too simplistic.

210
00:11:23.151 --> 00:11:27.560
A metric mainstream medicine gets hyper-focused on LDL or more specifically APRO

211
00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:32.060
B, which is a proxy again for the number of LDL particles.

212
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.820
That's too simplistic because I think there's context here.

213
00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:38.330
And the context is that I don't believe there's sufficient evidence to say that

214
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:42.770
high LDL in somebody that's metabolically healthy is the same as high LDL

215
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.550
and somebody that's metabolically unhealthy. There's a third variable.

216
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:47.750
We have to think about multi,

217
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.360
multiple variables because there's a context and it makes sense, right?

218
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.710
There are other things that are like this uric acid is a good too

219
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.083
incidentally,

220
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.280
both LDL and uric acid rise when humans fast.

221
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.960
So if you stop eating,

222
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:05.110
your LDL is going to go up and that's been demonstrated multiple times in

223
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:09.730
studies, fasting raises LDL. They've even shown this in hibernating bears.

224
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:13.270
Hibernating bears see have a rise in LDL,

225
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:17.680
but they don't develop atherosclerosis over the course of their hibernation

226
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:20.140
period. There's actually, um, a, uh,

227
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:25.090
a screenshot at the bottom in the lipid CBD, um, uh,

228
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.490
folder Jamie. And I'll pull up.

229
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.460
There's another study here with the hibernating bear study.

230
00:12:30.461 --> 00:12:34.720
It's pretty fascinating. The bears athero, um, hibernation.

231
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.650
And so we see this over and over in humans that fasting raises LDL,

232
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:40.360
fastening raises uric acid,

233
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.800
but fasting people who fast people who do ketogenic diets, they don't get gout.

234
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.440
They don't get atherosclerosis in quite the same way,

235
00:12:47.441 --> 00:12:49.530
or at least that's the hypothesis certainly bears don't. And.

236
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.070
<v 0>We observed strange that fasting would raise LDL.</v>

237
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.440
<v 1>It does until you think about LDL as a nutrient, a nutrient carrier.</v>

238
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.550
So Dave is developing something called the lipid energy model,

239
00:13:02.551 --> 00:13:04.770
and I want to give him all credit for this. I've actually got a set of slides.

240
00:13:04.771 --> 00:13:06.990
That'll probably make it clear when I talk about,

241
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:11.880
but Dave's hypothesis is that if you are burning mostly fat as

242
00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:14.490
energy, and even somebody that eats some carbohydrates can be burning,

243
00:13:14.491 --> 00:13:15.720
mostly fat as energy.

244
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.790
You are going to be moving more LDL in your blood to move that fat around.

245
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.990
And we certainly know that S interventions can do that.

246
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.340
And it makes sense when you fast you're depleting liver glycogen,

247
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.660
your ketones are going up and you are burning fat.

248
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:32.970
You're not burning as much glucose. You're burning more fat.

249
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.030
Your free fatty acids are going to go up. Your, your LDL is going to go up.

250
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.100
And so you kind of scratch your head there. At least I did.

251
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.053
And look at this and thought,

252
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.380
are you telling me that in something that would happen routinely for humans

253
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.320
fasting, like we talked about intermittent fasting, unsuccessful hunts,

254
00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:49.320
that's killing us in a way that's causing atherosclerosis.

255
00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:50.310
That doesn't make any sense.

256
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.250
And it certainly doesn't happen in bears and other hibernating mammals.

257
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.430
So LDL will rise in response to fasting.

258
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.140
LDL seems to rise and response to what we choose to burn as our

259
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:05.100
primary fuel. Now there's still, we're still kind of trying to figure this out.

260
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.660
Dave's had, he just texted me this morning. He's like,

261
00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:08.790
I've got all this really great data. He's almost ready to share it.

262
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:09.600
It's super interesting stuff.

263
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.410
But the whole idea of what LDL is doing in a human body,

264
00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:16.800
I think has been misconstrued and misunderstood. Again,

265
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.880
the lipid hypothesis would say the more LDL, the more atherosclerosis. Well,

266
00:14:20.881 --> 00:14:21.870
if that's the case, if,

267
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.180
and it's kind of tied into that model is the notion that LDL

268
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.900
must cause atherosclerosis Denovo or in and of itself,

269
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.100
because if more LDL equals atherosclerosis than LDL is causing atherosclerosis,

270
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:38.850
I don't think anyone who subscribes to the lipid energy model is going to debate

271
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:42.420
that. But if LDL causes atherosclerosis to Novo,

272
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.000
why don't we get atherosclerosis in veins?

273
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.550
Why do we only get atherosclerosis in arteries?

274
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:51.000
There's the same amount of LDL throughout our body veins and arteries are

275
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:55.490
contiguous system. And so why are we developing plaque in arteries,

276
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:56.091
but not veins?

277
00:14:56.091 --> 00:15:00.590
And that's why we never see plaque in veins unless they are transplanted into

278
00:15:00.591 --> 00:15:03.740
the arterial system. So there's clearly more things going on.

279
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:05.750
And in the case of arteries versus veins,

280
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:10.760
the prevailing hypothesis is that it's endothelial damage. So the inside of a,

281
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.900
the inside of a blood vessel is the endothelium and something has to damage the

282
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:17.540
endothelium for this to happen. It seems and higher pressure systems.

283
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:21.800
The arteries seem to damage the endothelium and this network of glycoproteins on

284
00:15:21.801 --> 00:15:24.050
the surface of the endothelium called the glycocalyx.

285
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.910
And that doesn't happen in veins. There's lower pressure.

286
00:15:25.911 --> 00:15:27.530
At least this is one hypothesis,

287
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:31.190
but for LDL to cause atherosclerosis in and of itself,

288
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.190
it just doesn't seem to be, it doesn't seem to work.

289
00:15:34.191 --> 00:15:38.060
And studies like that with Framingham, make me think there's a third variable.

290
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.910
So if you look at the general population, sure,

291
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:44.060
you might see a correlation between LDL and cardiovascular disease.

292
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.920
But if you look at it a little more precisely, or a little more carefully,

293
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.530
you start to separate out those who are metabolically healthy,

294
00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:55.310
which granted is the minority from those who are metabolically unwell.

295
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.070
If the majority of people in our society are metabolically on, well,

296
00:15:58.100 --> 00:15:59.720
of course it looks like there's a correlation,

297
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.250
but what about this group over here? You and me who are metabolically healthy.

298
00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.430
If our LDL goes up, is that going to cause atherosclerosis?

299
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.300
I think the evidence for that is paltry at best and is not there.

300
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:15.350
And I think that we are eating a diet that we believe to be ancestrally

301
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:17.330
consistent. Why would that kill us? Right?

302
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:23.110
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

303
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.260
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

304
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:28.690
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

305
00:16:28.691 --> 00:16:32.380
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

306
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:36.400
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

307
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.200
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
