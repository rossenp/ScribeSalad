00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 2>I had a dentist in Dallas when I was a kid, he used to hypnotize people and,</v>

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.600
uh, you know, he's gonna drill a cavity for me.

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:17.520
And I said, I'd like for you to hypnotize me. And so it was, you know,

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.670
your, your mouth is feeling like a block of wood.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.510
Your mouth is feeling like a block of wood nurse. I think he's ready. I said,

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.180
no, I'm not give me the Novacane.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.340
But then the only other time that I had,

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.290
what was kind of success in being hypnotized was, uh,

10
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.020
in 1983,

11
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.720
uh, it was a 20th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination.

12
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.740
And I had grown up in Dallas during the assassination.

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.740
There was a story that was quite widely circulated that school

14
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:02.280
children in Dallas had laughed when they heard the news.

15
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.270
And I wasn't sure that I hadn't been in one of them.

16
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.650
<v 0>I remember being astonished.</v>

17
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.250
I remember gaping. I remember, you know,

18
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.110
did a ha come out of my mouth. I don't know if it did, you know,

19
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.120
uh, but I, I,

20
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.890
I think I smiled in amazement. I'm not really sure. I mean,

21
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.790
you have to go back to what Dallas was like at that time it was

22
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.530
hysterical. You know, the,

23
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.570
the politics were off the rails and Kennedy was hated,

24
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.980
although not in my family, but, you know, there was this sense of,

25
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.180
uh,

26
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.890
Dallas has being a separate entity from the rest of the country.

27
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.830
And that Kennedy was the enemy.

28
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.850
And I was anxious that maybe I had been one of those people that

29
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:57.684
laughed.

30
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.280
And so I had a friend who was a therapist who did,

31
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.230
uh, hypnosis,

32
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.990
and I asked her to hit the ties me and see if she could take me back to the

33
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:10.830
classroom and, and help me remember.

34
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.050
And, uh, so she put me under,

35
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.050
uh, regressed, my memories, you know,

36
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:23.400
to the point that I hear the dinging Dean PA system and the

37
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.660
choked voice of our principal coming on. And did she tell you,

38
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.650
you're hearing these things, you know, she's asking me, you know,

39
00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:35.760
what could recall, what do I recall? And I, I remember seeing, you know,

40
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.120
the face of my friend, Steve Zinke, uh,

41
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.680
one of my classmates in the algebra class and I couldn't

42
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.590
get it myself.

43
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:51.300
And so she gave me a post-hypnotic suggestion that I would have a dream and it

44
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:54.480
would reveal to me, you know, what I,

45
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.490
what I experienced.

46
00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.300
And so I did have a very vivid dream and it was,

47
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.300
I was flying in a helicopter over the canopy of what I thought was

48
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.470
Vietnam jungle.

49
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.140
And you were looking for a child and, uh,

50
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.770
saw it in the top of a canopy, just lying on top of the tree.

51
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.750
And if we got closer,

52
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.590
I realized it was actually just a doll with his little X eyes.

53
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.960
And that was the dream. And I decided from that,

54
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:33.580
that I was that the me that I

55
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:37.180
thought, you know, might've laughed was just a figment, you know,

56
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:41.230
an effigy of some sort, and that, you know, I really hadn't laughed.

57
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.390
Uh, you'd have to understand what a scarring experience it was to have been from

58
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.510
Dallas at that period of time and how everybody in the world hated you.

59
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.310
<v 1>So it's a strange thing to try to remember.</v>

60
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.250
What was your reaction? How old are you.

61
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.080
<v 0>At the time? 13, I guess I.</v>

62
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.450
<v 1>Am, this is a very strange thing.</v>

63
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.640
Did you feel like you felt guilt at the possibility that you had laughed?

64
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.830
<v 0>Yeah, I did. I didn't want to be one of those people. And, uh, you know,</v>

65
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.300
I have friends from Dallas who do remember people in their classroom laughing,

66
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.160
and my experience that I re you know,

67
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.830
the real memory I have of it is that people looked around and just stunned,

68
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.430
astonishment. And part of the astonishment, I think,

69
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.080
was that we just thought nothing would ever happen in Dallas. It was, you know,

70
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.570
on the one hand it was totally crazy.

71
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.890
And the other hand it was totally paralyzed. You know, it was just a sense.

72
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.090
The conformity was so powerful that, you know,

73
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:47.740
you felt imprisoned by, uh, the sameness of every day,

74
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:52.180
every thought, uh, you know, just, it was very, very rigid environment.

75
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.043
So some.

76
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.640
<v 1>Spectacularly unique occurrence, like the president getting assassinated, right.</v>

77
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.340
Dealey Plaza to seemed impossible.

78
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.810
<v 0>Oddly enough, no, I mean, that was the thing, you know,</v>

79
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:06.310
if it was going to happen anywhere,

80
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.830
it seemed like Dallas would be the right spot. They hated Kennedy.

81
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.910
And even that morning,

82
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:14.620
I went out to get the newspaper and there was that famous ad welcome Mr. Kennedy

83
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.360
to Dallas, you know, just it's bleak thing. And then there was, uh,

84
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.660
you know, it's just, how is it bleak? Oh,

85
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.020
it made all these absurd charges about, you know,

86
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.430
his eating communist and so on and race, you know,

87
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.900
race. They had a racist undertone to it. Uh,

88
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.430
it was, there was, yeah, there it is.

89
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.070
It shows up, you can see how it can't read all that. Well,

90
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:47.950
it says welcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas. It,

91
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.470
you can see that it's saying a city,

92
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:55.240
a city it's about who we are and we are not you. And, uh,

93
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.550
it was, uh, uh, it was almost,

94
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.130
and then in the same newspaper, maybe your guy can find it. There is a wanted,

95
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.900
oh, no, wait a minute. I separate.

96
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.970
It was on top of the newspaper was a wanted poster for Kennedy with

97
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.530
full face and profile.

98
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.510
Somebody had placed it on top of that and like wanted for trees and or

99
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.890
something like that. There it is. Yeah. That was on our doorstep that morning.

100
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.100
So, uh,

101
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.190
that was the atmosphere of Dallas in

102
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:34.220
1963. Wow. There was, um,

103
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.250
there was, uh, you know,

104
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.170
Adelaide Stevenson had come to Dallas in October the month

105
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:45.080
before to make a speech about the United nations.

106
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:49.940
And he was a UN ambassador and he was assaulted. Um,

107
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.470
and, um, they went out to greet the crowd.

108
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.440
He was booed down. And by the way,

109
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.080
I think Lee Harvey Oswald was in the audience that night,

110
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.510
but he went out to try to talk to the crowd and

111
00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:09.620
Stanley Marcus was his escort. And he said, don't, don't try that ally.

112
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:13.850
You know, this is crazy. And people were really worked up. They, you know,

113
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.310
this woman was holding a sign and she wiped it down on

114
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:23.300
top of ambassador Stevenson's head. And the science said,

115
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.330
if you seek Jesus, seek peace, asked Jesus.

116
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.720
So that's some reason that that always

117
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.920
struck me as the Dallas. And I just want to say,

118
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.280
as I'm talking about Dallas and the past Dallas stuff today is a totally

119
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:46.790
different place. And I think in some ways, you know,

120
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:50.510
it was so chastened and humbled, uh,

121
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.080
by that horrible experience I've said in the past,

122
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.510
if Kennedy had to die somewhere,

123
00:07:56.511 --> 00:08:01.010
I'm grateful he did in Dallas because it made that city a far better place.

124
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.200
And you remember the police killings a few years ago, nine cops came out,

125
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.970
um, the way it was a block away from the daily Plaza,

126
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.740
but the way in which that city handled that tragedy by

127
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:19.670
comparison was so magnificent. You know, I just,

128
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.060
I have a lot of admiration for the city that Dallas has become.
