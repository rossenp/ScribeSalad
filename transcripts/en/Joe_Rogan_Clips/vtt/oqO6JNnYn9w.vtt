1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 0>Like he was the biggest person on the planet and he had the demons,</v>

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.920
you know what I'm saying? And, but he is fun too.

3
00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:09.360
Cause cuz you see him in a club and he see, he sees some girls and he be like,

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.640
hi, how you doing? &lt;laugh&gt; you like BMWs? And girls be like, what dude?

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.480
You like, you like BMW. You like Kai, you like BMWs and crazy.

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.040
He'd take the girls out and go get a BMW.

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.350
<v 1>We were talking about the power women and how you know it never, you,</v>

8
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:23.590
no matter how much money you make and stuff.

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.630
And they're all women are always kind of a rush, you know? And, and uh, and,

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.230
and Mike Tyson said to Tony, he goes, man, I've had it all I've had. I've had,

11
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.030
um, I've had money, I've had fame. Uh,

12
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:36.790
but if God invented anything better than Puty, he's keeping it for himself.

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.983
&lt;laugh&gt;.

14
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 2>That's a man who one, I went to his house and it was five. It was six limos.</v>

15
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.940
And nobody would get out the limo. And I said,

16
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:48.540
how come nobody's getting out the car? They said,

17
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.340
you gonna see that line standing over there. Mike Tyson in the lane,

18
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:56.260
in his front yard, like hangover his style.

19
00:00:56.261 --> 00:00:58.060
That's the only man whose house I ever went over.

20
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.010
There was a line in the front yard loose. Wow.

21
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.530
He was on the steps like this with a heavyweight belt. What,

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.570
what &lt;laugh&gt; what, how come nobody went to get out the car, play with my cat.

23
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.410
He was like, no, man, no, that's not a cat. That's a lion. That's real.

24
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.570
My Mike Tyson had a lion, a male lion or a female lion. That's awesome.

25
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:25.000
With a man, a lion in the, his front yard loose. Oh. It was walking.

26
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.520
It was off the leash, man. It was not in the cage. It was in the yard.

27
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.720
Oh my God. Then he came out and started wrestling with him and oh my God,

28
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.240
he wrestled. How big was the lion? It was big, man. It was a lion man.

29
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.640
He was wrestling with a lion,

30
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.950
came over there and grabbed him and started tussling with him and all that Jesus

31
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.710
and everybody was in the LIS.

32
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.750
So the lion could come up to a limousine and bust the window open to come in

33
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.310
there. I'm sorry. Easy.

34
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.390
He could just go like this booth and come right in there and just have lunch.

35
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.750
So everybody was in the car. You couldn't back out.

36
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:57.390
Cause it was all like five limos. So everybody's in the car.

37
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.270
Horrified thinking that Mike is getting ready to be eating by this lion,

38
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.980
but that isn't plays with him. And he takes him in the back.

39
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.660
That comes back out. And I was like, you know what?

40
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.180
I'm never going to be around another man in life.

41
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.060
That's gonna do that in front of you. &lt;laugh&gt; and you know what I'm saying?

42
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.580
Cause to me he was Mike Tyson is not a line team.

43
00:02:18.581 --> 00:02:21.460
You ever here about Mike working in Vegas? No, he just tame line.

44
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.460
He had one in his front yard man.

45
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.970
<v 3>So I'm in prison. I'm talking to my car dealer at the time and he has a,</v>

46
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.530
he has some cars to belong to a friend of mine.

47
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:34.850
That's supposed a friend of ours and he's disgusting if he doesn't pay for these

48
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.530
cars, I'm gonna sell these cars to somebody and get some horses and stuff.

49
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.290
I said, well, you can get horses and show you horses and some cars.

50
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.600
Cause I had a lot of cars. I, I probably get some horses to and he said,

51
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:49.560
yeah man, you can get, you get Kugar lions tigers. I know this guy got exotic.

52
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.320
I said, you do, can you get me some tigers? He said, yeah.

53
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:54.880
And the guy told me and the guy said, imagine how cool that be? You be.

54
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.080
Cuz I had a bunch of fans because imagine that man,

55
00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:00.480
you be the as Martin or for robber, you having a tiger right next to you man.

56
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.480
And I'm a young guy I'm I'm saying to myself, wow,

57
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.480
that would be cool right after. Yeah. Get me some Cubs man.

58
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.200
And then when I came home, I had those Cubs right there waiting for me. So.

59
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.440
<v 4>You raised them as Cubs? Yeah. Cause that's, that's how you,</v>

60
00:03:13.441 --> 00:03:18.120
cause I would see footage of you like smacking 'em around and jumping on one of

61
00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:19.630
your tigers. And I was like, holy.

62
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.110
<v 3>Oh I hadn't listen. They were babies. They had their mother, their mother,</v>

63
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.510
their babies. Now it.

64
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.230
<v 5>Ever gets, this is a crazy picture.</v>

65
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.630
You and your underwear with a tiger on a chain. That is,

66
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.710
that is one of the chance right there. That's you at peak. Crazy.

67
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 3>Yeah. And insane. Yeah. What was going through my mind? Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.020
I know what made me think about my friend said, Mike,

69
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.740
you can get some awesome animals. And I think really are you serious?

70
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.500
<v 6>And I remember the American team was saying, oh, well you never fought the best.</v>

71
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.940
I'm like, didn't fight the best. I thought Americans said the best team. Yeah.

72
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.700
But one guy, he doesn't like taking plans in his manager.

73
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.460
Don't like taking planes either. So I'm like, who's that?

74
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.610
And they told me it was Mike Tyson custom model. So me and my trainer,

75
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.530
we left Canada and we drove all the way up there. And while we were up there,

76
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.250
RA erotic was up there and they said, oh, razor retic came to inspire with us,

77
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.410
said, okay, I'll spar with you. I'm here for four days.

78
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.800
So first time Tyson actually met me. You know, he was a nice guy,

79
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.960
really nice guy. He took me in his room,

80
00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:28.120
showed me some old flicks that I've never seen before of old time fighters would

81
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:32.880
tell me about each fighter. Like he studied them. And then, um, you know,

82
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:37.120
this is where he got his old style is his style of fighting from. And um,

83
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.150
first day in the first day in the gym &lt;affirmative&gt; bell went,

84
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.630
he came across and he was trying to kill me like, you know,

85
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.590
I did my Muhammad Ali thing obviously stayed away from his power.

86
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.510
But the first day was really hectic.

87
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.630
And then the second day was hectic and it got better as it went along.

88
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.670
And then last day is I got actually the better of him the last day.

89
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.100
And I remember custom motto saying, you're gonna meet him someday.

90
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.260
Don't you do that?

91
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.740
And that always echoed in my mind that will we ever fight? Will we ever fight?

92
00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:14.020
Cause custom auto said that we're gonna fight. Wow. And it did happen. Wow.

93
00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.660
<v 5>That is crazy, man.</v>

94
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.840
<v 3>God.</v>

95
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.780
<v 6>That's crazy. He was built back then too. He had a big neck Tyson.</v>

96
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.690
<v 7>When I first had, he was 190 pounds, nothing but muscle 12 years old. Okay.</v>

97
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.090
That's what he was. But that's what he was. I mean, that's what God made him.

98
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:32.290
Right. That's crazy. So I go down there and I put first fight.

99
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.410
Nobody's seen Tyson. Nobody's ever seen Tyson, but 12 years old, zero fights,

100
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:39.010
but okay.

101
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.883
<v 3>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

102
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.560
<v 7>Now you go too far. You lie more than us. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

103
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.800
Nelson. I'm not lying. Okay. He's 12 years old. It's gonna be 13 soon,

104
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.200
but he's technically, he's 12 years old. Okay. Oh, come on.

105
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.880
I said, all right, I'll make you feel better. I'll put down 17. Thank you.

106
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.400
Now you tell the truth. I say he's not 17. &lt;laugh&gt;.

107
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.880
<v 5>He bit a chunk outta your ear. Right? Like what,</v>

108
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.640

109
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.400
<v 8>Bit him back. I I'm I'm serious. I will get new,</v>

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.390
and everybody was streaming and I wonder what they were streaming about.

115
00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:34.750
Telling me to watch out.

116
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.220

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.930

You still throw some bombs. I do. Probably for the camera. Yeah.

That's what you were doing, but I'm like, you could still move.

152
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.770
You still have it in you. Right. I don't know.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.210
<v 3>It's in your body. Have to be in, I don't.</v>

154
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.090
<v 5>Know to do that, but does it feel weird? What I was gonna get to when,</v>

155
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.970
if you were standing in front of that heavy bag and you start rattling off

156
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.080
combinations and people, you start thinking like, oh, I'm actually Mike Tyson.

157
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.240
Like I was that guy. I am that guy who went through that.

158
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.920
I am the youngest heavyweight champion of all time.

159
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.440
I am that guy that destroyed Tyrell, bigs.
