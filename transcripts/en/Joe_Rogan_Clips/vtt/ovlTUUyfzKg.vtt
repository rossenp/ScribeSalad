1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So much,</v>

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:08.040
like we have different shaped Aircrafts and fighter jets and cars.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.080
They probably have different shapes of these objects that operate

4
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:15.160
under similar principles. Right.

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.040
<v 1>Perhaps, but they all have the same power source. They all have the.</v>

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.630
<v 0>Same power source. And we're also dealing with, if you think about</v>

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.350
the laws of technological progression, you know,

8
00:00:26.351 --> 00:00:30.030
you think of Moore's law and you think of how things accelerate.

9
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.990
You've gotta think that if this civilization is who knows how many years more

10
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:38.430
advanced than we are, if not even years, I mean, I mean,

11
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.260
we're thinking about in terms of conventional terms, right? Way,

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700
the way we look at the world, I mean, they may,

13
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:47.620
they might be just superior in terms of their intellect.

14
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.860
They've gotta be maybe, maybe we.

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
<v 1>We don't know. Right. Well, the only reason I, I say that is because</v>

16
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.340
look, everyone doesn't necessarily start at a steam engine, right.

17
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.490
And go to an internal combustion engine and then, you know,

18
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.090
electric power and nuclear power and go up the ladder that we right. Come on.

19
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.010
Um, you know, the binary,

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.410
if the stuff is true about the origin and the binary star system,

21
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:14.850
and they have heavier elements that we don't have, and this element,

22
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.850
stable element one 15 is a naturally occurring material.

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.650
Maybe that's the first thing they started experimenting with.

24
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.480
And the version of their steam engine,

25
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.560
their first product was something that operated like this.

26
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.240
And actually when they came to earth to look around or, you know, whatever,

27
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.280
they were amazed at the stuff we were doing,

28
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:37.320
these guys burned stuff and squirted out the back to go forward. So, right. Um,

29
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.120
right. You know, who says they follow any kind of normal progression like that?

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.910
<v 0>My, my thought was,</v>

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.710
if you went back to the 14 hundreds and then you went from 1400 to

32
00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:50.830
1500, you're not gonna see that much of a difference technologically. Right.

33
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.310
If you go from 2000 to 3000,

34
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.110
I assume there's gonna be a radical change. Right. Well.

35
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.270
<v 1>The, yeah, the Delta, the rate of change yeah. Is,</v>

36
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.700
is magnificently higher than it used to be.

37
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.580
<v 0>Right. So if you think about what they had in 1988,</v>

38
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.620
and you think about what they probably have in 2019,

39
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.060
just logically seems like they would advance. I.

40
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.893
<v 1>Would think so.</v>

41
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 0>The only question is like, are they living,</v>

42
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.050
is that a thing in terms of like a biological thing?

43
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.570
Or are they some sort of an artificially created creation?

44
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.610
Like we are working on right now? I mean,

45
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.730
we're in the middle of working on artificial reality, artificial beings,

46
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:39.250
sentient beings, artificial intelligence, there's constant,

47
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.890
there's Silicon based life forms that they're essentially trying to create

48
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.840
Boston Dyna or was it boss dynamics that the company robots, easy robots.

49
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.920
<v 2>Yeah. You can make machines outta flesh. Yeah. Right.</v>

50
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.200
So a cyborg or cyberetic organism is just that, you know,

51
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:55.280
that's what a lot of people think those like gray things are, you know,

52
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:57.720
that people call the grays. Yeah. Is like, they were like,

53
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.120
there are machines printed from flesh. So what you're saying is like not so off,

54
00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:02.600
well, they could just.

55
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.120
<v 1>Be synthetic lights, synthetic. They don't even need to be, you know, machines.</v>

56
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.640
Well.

57
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.761
<v 0>They,</v>

58
00:03:07.761 --> 00:03:10.720
they seem to have no sex organs the way they're described by people that have

59
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:11.640
had interactions with them,

60
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.800
assuming these people aren't liars or crazy or whatever, right.

61
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.670
That they have no sex organs and that they don't seem to have any muscle

62
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.390
that is almost like a frame. Right. And they have enormous heads. I mean,

63
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:29.350
if you look at Australia pitheus or depictions of,

64
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.790
you know, ancient hoinades and then you go to human beings,

65
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.110
one of the things you see is bigger heads and weaker bodies. Well, you see.

66
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.300
<v 1>A clear progression of evolution too, where something like that,</v>

67
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.540
I would lean towards a synthetic organism. Yes.

68
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:45.100
Because it looks like it was made for a specific task. Right.

69
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:46.740
There's no reproductive organ.

70
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.420
So I mean that almost kind of leaves out any kind of, you know,

71
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.533
physical evolution.

72
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.660
<v 0>Right. Well, that's also our bottleneck, right?</v>

73
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.660
Our bottleneck is our biological imperative, the, the need to breed, emotions,

74
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.250
fear, anxiety,

75
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.410
all these different things that exist in order to force us into making sure

76
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.650
we reproduce. I mean, that's essentially,

77
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:12.250
there's human reward systems that aren't necessary once they can figure out a

78
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.290
way to make some sort of sentient artificial life. Right.

79
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.850
Some sort of thing that doesn't have these biological limitations that we have,

80
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.450
by.

81
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.280
<v 2>The way, the, the, he craft all these different kinds have been reported.</v>

82
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:24.080
Cause it was confusing. I always thought of flying SAS.

83
00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:26.800
What I heard boblazar talk about flying saucer. Right.

84
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.360
But if you look back in history,

85
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:32.480
people have always reported the weirdest shapes. Like none of them are alike.

86
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.640
You know, there, there are the saucers, but you got cigar shaped. You got,

87
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.640
you know, the top hat shapedhmm you,

88
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:41.230
you have orbs why maybe they're serving D ifferent purposes,

89
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.430
they're doing different things. Like we'd use different tools. And I,

90
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.350
I wanna be clear. The, the reason I know that memo is, is real,

91
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:49.910
is cuz I spent a lot of time with Dr. Eggar Mitchell,

92
00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:53.550
a sixth man to walk on the moon, last guy, film him before he died. Right.

93
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.150
That's how I know.

94
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:57.510
I don't want any journalists thinking I got it from anywhere else.

95
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.310
I know because of Dr. Mitchell. And he said the same thing,

96
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:04.740
maybe these things are performing different tasks, you know,

97
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.660
and that's right.

98
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.940
<v 0>What they seem, if you, if you think about what an alien is in terms of our,</v>

99
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.980
our, the sort of iconic image of an alien,

100
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.140
like the Steven Spielberg closing cows are the third time, third, uh,

101
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:16.974
kind alien.

102
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.250
They seem like what we'd assume a human would eventually

103
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:25.010
become. Right? And if these things are tiny,

104
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.090
human beings are smaller than they've ever been before.

105
00:05:27.091 --> 00:05:28.490
They're weaker than they've ever been before.

106
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.850
And there seems to be a trend in that direction.

107
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.850
And this trend seems to be amplified by our technological progression.

108
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.850
There are a lack of need for muscle strength and our lack of need for violence.

109
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.360
And we move being in a society to try to get away from all the things that we

110
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:49.080
think are a Bo about human beings and the terrible behaviors that we have.

111
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.200
If we one day do give birth to some sort of an

112
00:05:54.201 --> 00:05:58.600
artificial being like Marshall McCluen's, uh, quote,

113
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.760
we are the sex organs of the machine world. You know that one day we, okay,

114
00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:06.520
I'll buy this. Yeah. McCleon was brilliant. And that,

115
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.280
that quote has always been one of my favorites because, okay,

116
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:12.760
what are we doing when we are constantly technologically innovating,

117
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.110
we're constantly looking for faster cars, better computers, bigger screens,

118
00:06:17.111 --> 00:06:21.470
faster, more resolution, more pixels, more this, more that higher bandwidth, 5g,

119
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.830
10 G, right? What are we doing? We're moving into this in this.

120
00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:27.790
If you just follow it objectively, stand, stand back,

121
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.630
don't attach yourself or your civilization, your culture to it.

122
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:31.464
And look at what it is.

123
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.510
We're moving it a hundred percent towards technological innovation.

124
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.340
If you looked at this species from afar, and if you weren't a part of it,

125
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.020
you would say, well, what does this species do? Oh, they make things.

126
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.580
They make things better. Every year.

127
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.460
Beehive is the same thing that you see 10 years ago, you go by,

128
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.340
you see a beeh it's amazing. It's cool. But they're the same thing.

129
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.380
They figured out how to do it. They make a beehive, right? We don't do that.

130
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.860
We make better things. What would you do constantly?

131
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.130
<v 1>And at some point I think that technology is gonna fuse with us. Yes. And.</v>

132
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.730
<v 0>We're gonna become, it's already happening. Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:05.530
The Elon Musk talked about it on my podcast that we are sideboards.

134
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:07.090
You just carry it in your pocket. It's a phone.

135
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.930
It answers any question you want. You can talk to it.

136
00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:13.570
It'll give you the answers, the answers instantaneously, it navigates you.

137
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.450
It has all your phone numbers in it. It has all your contacts.

138
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.800
You can get ahold of people. People listen to you through it.

139
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.760
It's connecting us in ways. Even involuntarily, haptics, that kind of thing.

140
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:24.200
Yeah. It's also getting on your wrist.

141
00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:27.000
How many people have eyewatches apple watches, right. They put on.

142
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.960
<v 1>Their wrist. Right. And that's only because we can't integrate 'em yet.</v>

143
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:30.880
But if you know, that.

144
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.840
<v 0>Point has come a hundred percent. Yeah. I didn't joke about it last night,</v>

145
00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:36.200
but I have a bit about it. But I do about the,

146
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.480
the integration between humans and technology. That's.

147
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.390
<v 2>What would you do if you were a hyperintelligence right.</v>

148
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.590
Would you do the work yourself or would you create some cool things called like

149
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:47.030
humans to do it for you?

150
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:50.790
Would you create things that are cyberetic organisms to come in with machines

151
00:07:50.791 --> 00:07:54.230
and do it for you? If you were a hyperintelligence that has kind of changed,

152
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.790
like you've described, you'd probably create workers.

153
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.740
<v 0>Right? Well, that's a vast conspiracy theory. Isn't.</v>

154
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:00.900
<v 2>It? I' not talking about conspiracy.</v>

155
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.020
<v 0>But it is a kind of a conspiracy, right? I'm I'm asking you. Well, I, I mean,</v>

156
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.580
I don't think it's necessarily that, I mean, you could look at it that way,

157
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:09.980
but that is the way a conspiracy theorist would look at it.

158
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:11.060
The way I would look at it is like,

159
00:08:11.061 --> 00:08:14.380
there's obviously a progression going on a biological progression.

160
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.820
There's some sort of an integration with technology.

161
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.290
There's some sort of imperative this need for technological innovation. Mm-hmm,

162
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.250
&lt;affirmative&gt;, it's inescapable. Everyone has it. We,

163
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.370
and I think it's attached to materialism in some sort of a strange way,

164
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.770
because so many people work so hard to get new things and like, God,

165
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:33.610
that seems so illogical and preposterous and it makes people unhappy and

166
00:08:33.611 --> 00:08:36.210
depression's on the rise, but nobody seems to be able to stop it. Like,

167
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.290
why is that? Well,

168
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:42.280
maybe it's because we are the electronic caterpillars

169
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:45.200
that give birth to the butterfly. Maybe that's what we're doing.

170
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.880
That could very well be what our job is to do is to make some sort of a cocoon.

171
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:52.560
And we don't even know we're doing it while we're doing it.

172
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.240
Do you think a caterpillar is, well, Hey caterpillar, what are you you doing,

173
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.800
man? Just I'm doing my thing. It's my job. I have to make a cocoon.

174
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.760
Then I'm gonna become like a butterterfly.

175
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.200
<v 1>This could be a natural part of evolution. It could be right.</v>

176
00:09:02.201 --> 00:09:05.680
That we're just supposed to do this. Exactly. And make the jump to, uh,

177
00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:08.200
some sort of mechanized, right? Yeah.

178
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.920
<v 0>Nearological an arantan that is, uh, fishing with a spear.</v>

179
00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:18.270
No, they've figured out how to fish with Spears. There's uh,

180
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.430
there's umpriimatologists.

181
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.830
<v 1>Wait without somebody showing 'em how to fish. No, they've.</v>

182
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.110
<v 0>Imitated human beings doing it and now they do it, but they do it independently.</v>

183
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.230
They're not trainedangans they're wild rang. Look at that.

184
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.260
That's a wild rang. Okay. That's impressiveive 's impressive. Impressive. Well,

185
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:39.460
there's thesepriimatologists I guess you would call 'em primatologists.

186
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.240
That's a term.

187
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.940
That's a great biologists biologists that believe that monkeys and

188
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.860
chimps and some of the great apes are moving into the stone age that they've

189
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:51.180
currently entered the stone age.

190
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:56.050
Like they're not staying what they were a hundred thousand years or ago or

191
00:09:56.051 --> 00:09:57.170
500,000 years ago,

192
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.810
but they're actively using tools and they're experimenting with different,

193
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.890
different ways to use those tools. And then they're making tools out of stone.

194
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:08.490
They're making tools out of sticks and they're they're using them. Well,

195
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.090
this might just be what happens. This might just be what happens, right?

196
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.200
I mean, why else? Why are we why the fire? We work so hard. I mean, I, I was,

197
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.320
I was driving to LA this morning. Um, I had a doctor's appointment,

198
00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:25.200
so I was on the 4 0 5 at, uh, eight in the morning, like Jesus Christ. Like,

199
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:28.520
this is so crazy when you're in the 4 0 5 in LA at eight o'clock in the morning,

200
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.800
you see literally a million cars. Yeah. Red light.

201
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.680
And it's just everywhere you go. It's people. But, and also I'm in a Tesla.

202
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.710
So I have it on autopilot. So I'm there sitting, I'm listening to a podcast.

203
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.350
I B I barely have my hand on the wheel. I'm not touching.

204
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.710
This car's driving me along. I'm not even doing anything. I'm just,

205
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.190
I'm just hanging out. It's so much less strap by the way to do it that way.

206
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.630
Right. So it encourages you to, to innovate. Yeah.

207
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:55.830
It encourages you to embrace this new technology. I got this giant screen.

208
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.380
It's showing me the navigation you in front of me. Oh,

209
00:10:58.381 --> 00:11:01.700
I'll be there five minutes early. Excellent. And I'm listening to a podcast,

210
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.580
wirelessly. It's Bluetooth scream streaming from my phone.

211
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:06.660
And I pulled that podcast,

212
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.820
which came out today out of the sky and I'm listening to it.

213
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:12.780
And I'm all comfortable in my nice little car.

214
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:15.060
Just driving on my way to the doctor's office. This.

215
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.370
<v 1>Is irresistible stuff. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Different than your walk, man. Yeah.</v>

216
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:18.970
You know, back.

217
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:20.810
<v 0>In the day, it is irresistible. It.</v>

218
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.530
<v 1>Is irresistible. It's frighteningly irresistible. But is.</v>

219
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.210
<v 0>It frightening? I mean, if you were a monkey, right? If you were, um,</v>

220
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.890
an Australia epitheus would you go, man? I don't wanna be a person.

221
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.530
I live in a house. That's. I like just swinging around on trees. I like, uh,

222
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:38.720
running from Jaguars. This is life guys. Life is running crocodiles.

223
00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:39.554
It's not living in a.

224
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.720
<v 1>Suburban ommunity no, there's probably some that are like that.</v>

225
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.000
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think so. I think, I think when, when it comes,</v>

226
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:45.880
we're gonna embrace it.

227
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:48.440
We're gonna embrace it the same way you embrace cell phones,

228
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.680
the same way you embrace television. There's gonna be a few holdouts.

229
00:11:51.681 --> 00:11:53.680
I don't even know an email address, man. Those,

230
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.680
those there's a few and far between the good luck with that. face.

231
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.160
Go move to the woods, Ted. Kainski yeah, go live. I,

232
00:11:59.161 --> 00:12:02.040
I was just gonna throw tedsgain man there. Oh, Ted kainski was right.

233
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.720
This is something that I think about sometimes when I get really high that Ted

234
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.960
kainski was a part of the Harvard LSD studies.

235
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.510
This has been proven Ted kainski. They cooked his brain when he was at Harvard.

236
00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:16.030
And then when he went over to Berkeley and became a professor,

237
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.270
his goal was to make enough money so that he could implement this program and

238
00:12:20.271 --> 00:12:23.950
live in the woods and then write his manifesto and start killing people that

239
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:26.110
were involved in propagating technology.

240
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:30.110
<v 2>He was expunged from the Harvard, um, logs, by the way,</v>

241
00:12:30.111 --> 00:12:33.660
this is something my friend just called me about. So there's like this, uh,

242
00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:34.494
private library.

243
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.500
And they used to print people's names whenever they were part of a university.

244
00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:42.020
And he was one of a handful of people that were expunged from it.

245
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.020
I want to jump back to the one thing, Joe.

246
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.540
I wanna be very careful with that word, conspiracy theorist. What, what I was,

247
00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:52.500
what I was saying to you was we, we Terraform our earth, right? We,

248
00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:55.290
we tear and we change the environment. We do all this innovation.

249
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.290
What is stopping us from thinking that that's not being done?

250
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.570
I'm not saying is I'm saying what's stopping us from thinking that that's being

251
00:13:02.571 --> 00:13:05.770
done on a much bigger level on a cosmic level.

252
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.650
<v 0>You mean like aliens coming down, doing that to humans. Well, I'm.</v>

253
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.970
<v 2>I'm telling you that there is something here. That's, there's a fact, you know,</v>

254
00:13:11.971 --> 00:13:15.640
there's something, there are craft are here. They're not ours. They're here.

255
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.560
So the question is, what is that about?

256
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.960
And I'm just looking at what we do with what you're describing with technology

257
00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:22.270
and.

258
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:22.800
<v 0>Well, it's,</v>

259
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.720
I think it's much more likely that the same way we observe chimps and we observe

260
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.520
that they are now in the stone age that they're observing us.

261
00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.640
And that they're recognizing that there is a pattern that there is a,

262
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:36.030
there's a step that happen. I mean,

263
00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:39.750
Carl Sagan talked about the different levels of civilization and that you know

264
00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:43.550
that if we don't get past certain levels, we're never going to reach this.

265
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:44.190
I mean, we're.

266
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.030
<v 2>In type one civilization. We're gonna stay type zero.</v>

267
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.830
<v 0>Yeah. Well we're in this warring polluting. Yeah. Pillaging. We're awesome.</v>

268
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.350
Civilization. Humans are awesome. It's well, I mean,

269
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:56.700
we're awesome in a lot of ways, you know, but in that way we're not, but yeah,

270
00:13:56.701 --> 00:13:59.340
we're, we're we're children that have immense power. Yeah.

271
00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:00.174
That we didn't really,

272
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.220
the other thing is you're using the immense power that other people have

273
00:14:04.221 --> 00:14:05.380
created. Right? I mean,

274
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:08.020
even when you're driving a car and you're stomping on the gas, like, woo,

275
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.260
you didn't invent the engine. You didn't invent tires.

276
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:16.290
There's all these things that were in involved in the creation of this thing is

277
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:20.410
really outside of your grasp of understanding.

278
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.490
But yet you have the ability to use it like a person with a gun.

279
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.050
I'm just gonna bang, bang, bang people. You don't, you didn't invent a gun.

280
00:14:27.051 --> 00:14:27.750
So like you've,

281
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:32.250
you've without the intellect to craft and engineer and,

282
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.930
and, and manifest these creations,

283
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.200
you just have access to them because you have paper or you have Bitcoin,

284
00:14:38.201 --> 00:14:40.640
or you have mm-&lt;affirmative&gt;, whatever the you're using using a credit card.

285
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:44.360
Now you have almost no responsibility. You just,

286
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:49.360
you could just flippantly use these things, which is why we, you know,

287
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:52.000
we were very childlike in our actions. Cause we,

288
00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:54.640
we haven't had to earn the responsibility.

289
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.320
We haven't had to earn these things that we've been able to have.

290
00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.400
And you've only been able to have them because other people have innovated and

291
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:07.120
spent ungogodly amounts of time and effort and focus in the lab to create these

292
00:15:07.121 --> 00:15:10.400
things. And then they've all put them together. And then what is the,

293
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.870
what's the reason to put them together to profit? Well,

294
00:15:12.871 --> 00:15:14.790
what's the reason to profit. Well, why are you doing this?

295
00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:17.750
So you can buy more things. Well, what, what are we doing? What are we doing?

296
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.150
We're making better things. That's what we do. That's all we do. That's do.

297
00:15:21.151 --> 00:15:23.750
That's all we do is make better things. Yeah. Why the do we need oil?

298
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.510
Why do we need oil? Why can't we just burn wood and stay home?

299
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.790
Why can't we grow chickens and food in the backyard? Why can't we do it? Well,

300
00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:33.380
we can, we certainly can. People do do it.

301
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.940
But we decide to make that almost impossible.

302
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.540
Our preferred way of living is to stuff everyone into a very small area where no

303
00:15:40.541 --> 00:15:43.460
one grows anything other than weed. This is what LA is.

304
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.260
LA is 20 million people with hard surfaces as as many hard surfaces.

305
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:51.140
You can boy, if you've got an acre backyard in LA, holy,

306
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:53.970
it look at all that grain. This is amazing. Well, no,

307
00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:58.730
that's the earth coming through this weird sort of creation

308
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.210
that we've put on top of the earth. But the goal is to like New York city.

309
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.210
That's there's none of it, right? You just got,

310
00:16:04.211 --> 00:16:08.090
you've got central park and they just got human. You stacked up.

311
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.840
No one's growing anything. And then constant work everyone's up early, go,

312
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.400
go, go innovate progress. Make that money. So you can buy more things.

313
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.440
And every year, Hey apple,

314
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:23.440
where's this new phone as if your phone isn't good enough. Yeah.

315
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.640
&lt;laugh&gt; like your phone's taking pictures and videos and people are calling you

316
00:16:27.641 --> 00:16:30.400
and you got applications to tell you which way the wind's blowing.

317
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:31.640
It's not good enough.

318
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.550
<v 2>A blink of an eye link of an eye. It's all gone though that, you know,</v>

319
00:16:34.551 --> 00:16:38.230
like 10,000 years and the Hoover dam goes or whatever, you know, Mount Rushmore,

320
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.670
disintegrates. So it's amazing cuz we have created that and,

321
00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.590
and everything's trying to spring up through that. We keep it maintenance down,

322
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.870
but we're, we're a blink man, something hits, but.

323
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:50.950
<v 0>We don't think that way, you know, you think in terms of your own life, right?</v>

324
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.980
You think in terms of what you want and what you need right now,

325
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.180
you know what it's, we are in many ways,

326
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.180
this combination of this weird primitive ape-like thing with

327
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.700
the ability to calculate and manipulate our world and our environment that makes

328
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:11.820
us wholly unique on top of that with existential angst and, and, and fear.

329
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:15.090
So what do you do with that? With water to out with anti antidepressants,

330
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.050
give these people some that keeps ' moving mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; well,

331
00:17:18.051 --> 00:17:20.610
they're worried about the future. They're trying to figure out what reality is.

332
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:24.690
If there's you're on a convertible spaceship spending a thousand miles an hour,

333
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.530
hurling through infinity, there's no meaning to this thing. Just keep making,

334
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.330
keep making stuff. And then one day they're gonna be able to hit that switch.

335
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:38.800
Life will be born out of innovation and thinking and progress

336
00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:41.960
and technology, and more than likely,

337
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.880
it's probably gonna be what we're seeing that these things are that you're

338
00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:47.400
you're, you're observing mm-hmm.

339
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.040
<v 2>&lt;Affirmative&gt; I'm not observing them, but yeah. Well someone's observing.</v>

340
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.560
<v 0>Are, are you implying that they're us? I don't think they are us,</v>

341
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.960
but I think they are. What happens when things keep going?

342
00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.320
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's not us. Just like we are not monkeys, right?

343
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:05.240
I'm I'm not a Chimp. Oh, that'd be cool. They're from here is your idea.

344
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.510
No, no, no. That this is what happens all over the right. Yeah, totally.

345
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.350
This is what hap look, here's the thing. You know, I went to see Brian Cox's,

346
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:18.670
um, he has this amazing live show with Robin ins where they, they,

347
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.550
they, they have these L E D screens,

348
00:18:21.551 --> 00:18:26.350
these huge screens with this high resolution depictions of the cosmos and one of

349
00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:27.830
the most mind-blowing things.

350
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.500
He has this large scale image of the universe and it shows all the individual

351
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:35.661
galaxies of the universe.

352
00:18:35.661 --> 00:18:39.020
And it just keeps moving through all these galaxies in three dimensions.

353
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.980
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's incredible,

354
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.900
but what's stunning is the relative uniformity of it. Even at, you know,

355
00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.300
I mean, you're obviously looking at an incredib,

356
00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:52.570
small depiction of something that's immensely large,

357
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.690
like a galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars.

358
00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.490
You're seeing it as this little dot,

359
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:59.730
but this little dot that's flying through space,

360
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:05.330
surrounded by other little dartts with very similarly spaced distances between

361
00:19:05.331 --> 00:19:07.170
yeah. Homa. Yeah. So Mike,

362
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:11.840
if we see uniformity in that form in terms of like the distance between

363
00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.520
Galax, like so many galaxies is so it's so similar,

364
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.920
they might vary slightly and that slightly might be hundreds of millions of

365
00:19:17.921 --> 00:19:19.240
light years. Right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but, but,

366
00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.360
but there's so much uniformity.

367
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.880
Why would we not assume that that uniformity exists pretty much everywhere and

368
00:19:25.881 --> 00:19:28.200
that all these things that you're seeing that are so similar,

369
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.750
you do see binary stars. You do see single star systems like star,

370
00:19:32.751 --> 00:19:35.390
but there's also some, some speculation that earth and that,

371
00:19:35.391 --> 00:19:38.190
that our solar system was one time was a binary star system.
