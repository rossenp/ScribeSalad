00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, you live in Hawaii,</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:05.400
which is a really interesting place, right?

3
00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:09.200
Because there's a lot of non-native animals that have been introduced to Hawaii,

4
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:13.880
like pigs and a lot of weird birds and a lot of, lot of weird rodents,

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.160
some plants and all kinds of. We got a, we got a, um.

6
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.560
<v 1>The weird thing that we think is a Wallaby.</v>

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.710
I think so you guys are wallabies now. Yeah. How crazy is that? Right?

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.310
Australia? You don't see 'em but they're little kangaroos, right?

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.590
They're like little kangaroo. Yeah. We have wallabies on our, and it's like,

10
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:32.350
how the did you get here? &lt;laugh&gt; but they're not like crazy. They're like,

11
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:34.510
you're out. And you see it, like, like they're very mysterious.

12
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.430
Like they pop up here and there when people are hiking in the mountains. Yeah.

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.070
But it's like a Wallaby bro. Like how the hell? Wow.

14
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.540
I don't know how they travel. Maybe they, I mean,

15
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:46.820
Australia's and surfing and whatever. Just jump hot. I'm outta here. I think.

16
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.660
<v 0>Probably somebody you had it as a pet if I had to guess.</v>

17
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.020
<v 1>Yeah. I I'm sure. I'm sure. I,</v>

18
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.340
you hear of a bunch of illegal pets that people have in Hawaii.

19
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.060
It just mind blowing, you know? I'm like, what the? Like, I,

20
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.130
I heard stories of people having like, um, gorillas and. Oh, and booze.

21
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.890
I'm like, what? How yeah. Hell do. Yeah. This, I don't know if people, boo.

22
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.970
I never saw 'em. People could be booing, but I'm like,

23
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.650
I'm not gonna put it past that. I saw more crazier stuff.

24
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.091
<v 0>Well,</v>

25
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:16.330
it seems like they would survive in the jungle if they could get out there.

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.890
Yeah. I mean, they just eat plants. There's so much greenery in Hawaii,

27
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:23.880
depending on what an island, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What island did they see?

28
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:24.714
A gorilla?

29
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.520
<v 1>They, they were saying the island we live on, on a wild one. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.600
So I was like, but it wasn't a wild one. It was like a pet. Oh, a pet person.

31
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.320
Somebody kids, em, a pet. So I might, might snitching. And so like, yeah.

32
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.473
It's crazy.

33
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.040
<v 0>Well,</v>

34
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.360
I think they're trying to limit people's ability to own primates in America cuz

35
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.830
uh, you know about, I'm sure you heard about that story.

36
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:46.990
About the lady in Connecticut who uh,

37
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:50.910
kept a pet chimpanzee and then attacked her friend and tore her face off. No,

38
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:51.190
I did.

39
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.990
<v 1>Not. Yeah. Oh.</v>

40
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.230
<v 0>That's a crazy story because that's what this lady kind of had a relationship</v>

41
00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:57.870
with this Chimp. Wait.

42
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.790
<v 1>Wait, wait, what kind of relationship we.</v>

43
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.750
<v 0>Talking about? That's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about.</v>

44
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.100
Yeah. She was sleep, been in the bed with his Chimp, the Chimp drank wine and,

45
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.100
and, and took Xanax. She's feeding the Chimp Xanax and uh,

46
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.300
the lady's friend came over and the Chimp attacked the lady's friend.

47
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.300
Is it a guy? No. A woman, a woman friend.

48
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.820
I think the lady was probably blocking and the Chimp was like, all this.

49
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.420
And just tore her apart.

50
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.650
<v 1>I mean, I shouldn't be laughing, but that's, it's horrible. That's wild.</v>

51
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.530
<v 0>That's Wild's a big Chimp too. And they're smart. Like what.</v>

52
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.650
<v 1>Do, what? Don't you champs? Like we come, like they say,</v>

53
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.890
we evolution from those guys and they're like, I know some,

54
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.090
like you see what the,

55
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.610
the scientists are doing with these chimps or gorillas or whatever they do,

56
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:43.530
you know? And like, like these guys is smart.

57
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.600
Like you can and talk to 'em they talk back some of 'em know, sign language.

58
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.160
It's like, why are you trying to mess with that?

59
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.600
Have you not seen planet other a I'm sure there like, like three movies of it.

60
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:56.000
Like, come on guys. Let's relax.

61
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.960
<v 0>They could it's like someone in the future could do something like that.</v>

62
00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:04.120
Like take a Chimp and genetically engineer to make it almost as smart as a

63
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:06.320
person or as smart as a person. I.

64
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.320
<v 1>I wouldn't be surprised if someone's already doing.</v>

65
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.000
<v 0>It. There it is. He's eating her. Shoot him scream. The chimps owner.</v>

66
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.000
200 pounds. Yeah. He was a huge Chimp and he, he tore her face apart.

67
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.870
I think he bit her fingers off. Did that woman survive? Yes. She was torn apart.

68
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.030
Yes. I show you the picture. Yeah. You've seen, oh,

69
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.750
don't show me the pictures of the lady. Yeah. I have seen them. They're awful.

70
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.790
It's they're terrible. Yeah, because chimps,

71
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.790
chimps are different than other animals that they know what you like.

72
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:38.030
They know that you need your hands and they know that you like your balls.

73
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.380
They know that you need your feet. Those are one of the things that they attack.

74
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.380
They attack your face. They tear your face apart. They pull your eyes out.

75
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.900
They bite your fingers off. They tear your Dick off and they tear your feet off.

76
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.580
<v 1>I, I know. That's just nuts. I laughing. I'm just blown away.</v>

77
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.300
<v 0>It's up. Yeah. Cause they're smart.</v>

78
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.300
<v 1>They're super smart. Like, like, there's movies on this.</v>

79
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.690
And there's people is doing it. You know, like fight. There's gonna come a time.

80
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:05.810
They're saying like, you know, like modern warfare and stuff is like true.

81
00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.530
Like wifi and. We're gonna have wars and whatever.

82
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.970
And then the next thing is like, I hear robots and,

83
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.250
but what is it to do is just, you just start breeding,

84
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.810
crazy silver backs and champs and whatever. And then you make that like,

85
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.720
I don't know you a chip that makes them somewhat human.

86
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.160
They can talk and this and that. And you send them.

87
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.480
<v 0>Off to war, put some kind of helmet on them that has some interface,</v>

88
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.000
like some computer interface with the Chimp's brain.

89
00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.000
And you have some helmet where they could see what's going on.

90
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.280
Like they could see like infrared and yeah. Yeah.

91
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.510
Elon Musk says his startup Neurolink uh, they got us with this.

92
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.390
You gotta shut that. A blocker off son. You gotta just give in to the,

93
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.463
to the network.

94
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.190
&lt;laugh&gt; Elon Musk says his startup neurally has wired up a monkey to play video

95
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.150
games using its mind. Exactly. See he's he already.

96
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.910
<v 1>Head? He's already start to war. He's already head. He's already a,</v>

97
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.500
you watch iron man. Yeah. You watch iron Ironman played both sides too.

98
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:06.860
At one point, you know? Oh, I, Elon was in the iron man. One of 'em.

99
