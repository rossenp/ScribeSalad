00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, uh, first of all,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.910
congratulations on the recent ruling was a ninth district court of

3
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.040
appeals. Is that what it was?

4
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:15.240
It said that what you exposed with the warrantless

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.210
wiretapping was in fact illegal,

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.930
and there are many people that are calling for you to be pardoned now.

7
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.180
<v 1>Yeah, it's so much has happened. This ruling.</v>

8
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:30.380
This is actually not the first time. Um, the federal government has, uh,

9
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.990
or the appeals courts have struck down, uh,

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.530
some of the federal surveillance programs as unlawful. Um,

11
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:39.980
but this one is really important because it happened, uh, from an appeals court.

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.810
It wasn't from a single judge. It was from a panel of judges. Um,

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.760
and what they had ruled was that the NSA is bulk collection

14
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.190
of Americans' phone records, uh, was, uh, illegal. And this is the very first,

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.920
um, sort of mass surveillance program that I, and the journalists, um,

16
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.860
really the, the news was broken back in 2013.

17
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:07.790
So this is a huge victory for privacy rights. Uh,

18
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:12.680
what it means is there was this provision, uh, of the Patriot act like,

19
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.740
remember the Patriot act, remember like a zillion years ago,

20
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.700
everybody was looking at Patriot Patriot, your friend, Alex Jones. You know,

21
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.380
I think he was worried.

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.860
<v 0>It's a terrible name. That there's a real problem with that name,</v>

23
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.440
because if you're against the Patriot act, it's like against babies, I was like,

24
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.840
uh, like this is the probaby act, but meanwhile, probaby act,

25
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.000
they get to look through your email. You know what I mean?

26
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:39.530
It's like the word Patriot is attached to that in a very disingenuous way.

27
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:44.000
Like calling that the Patriot act is, is it's really creepy that they could do.

28
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.970
They should have like a number like bill a one, you know,

29
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:49.820
you know what I'm saying? So you can debate the merits of it.

30
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.530
It's just so much propaganda attached to that name. Like the Patriot act.

31
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.911
<v 1>One of the funny things,</v>

32
00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:59.060
because it should be a warning for anybody who's in like a, you know,

33
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:01.250
just anywhere in the country. And they hear on the news.

34
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:05.180
They're talking about like the save puppies, you know, act, uh,

35
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:07.550
there's actually one that's, uh, been,

36
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.350
they've been trying to push through recently,

37
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.000
which is basically outlawing meaningful encryption from the major internet

38
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.990
service providers. Like if Facebook or Google, for whatever reason,

39
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.460
got out of bed in the morning. And they actually wanted, uh, to protect your,

40
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.490
uh, the security of your communications, uh,

41
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.080
in a way that even they can't break, like right now, uh, Google and Facebook,

42
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:31.280
they do a great job,

43
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.360
keeping other people from spying on your communications.

44
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.030
But if Google wants to rifle through your inbox, right?

45
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:42.080
If Facebook wants to go through all your direct messages and give that to the

46
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:44.600
federal government, like you tap one button and boom,

47
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.080
they've got all of it happens every single day. Uh,

48
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.240
well companies like Facebook have recently realized this is a real problem

49
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:58.160
for them. Uh, because first off they get all these censorship demands, um,

50
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.530
that you've seen, uh, where like there's de platforming requests.

51
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.900
And if it happens in one country, right?

52
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:08.470
Like if the U S government is allowed to decide what can,

53
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:13.300
and can't be said by this person on this platform, uh, or, uh, the U S goes,

54
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:16.780
look, we got a court warrant. Uh, they said, uh, or a judge said,

55
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:17.920
we think this person's a criminal.

56
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.870
We want you to hand over everything you have on this person.

57
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.730
And they do it right. Facebook does this well guess who's next. Right?

58
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:27.310
The Russian government shows up at the door and the next day the Chinese

59
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.830
government shows up at the door the next day. Uh,

60
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.770
and if these companies don't play ball, uh,

61
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.400
they get shut down in that country that canola longer lo no longer operate.

62
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.560
And so the idea that a lot of them have, uh, that they've considered,

63
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:46.540
and this has actually become a bigger thing in the COVID a crisis where

64
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.600
we start talking about like contact tracing.

65
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.740
These companies want to know where everybody is at all the time.

66
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:52.840
So they can hand this over to medical authorities or whatever.

67
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.000
There's this idea called end-to-end encryption. Um, which, uh,

68
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.880
what it means is that when you send a message, you know,

69
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:03.670
when Billy sends a message to Bobby, Billy,

70
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:06.220
and Bobby both had the keys to unlock that message,

71
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.820
and it could be sent through Facebook. It could be sent through Google.

72
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:12.820
It could be posted, you know, on a bulletin board in the town square.

73
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.410
But without that key, which the people who run the bulletin board, right?

74
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.880
The people who own the Bolton board, Google, Facebook, they don't have that key.

75
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.020
Only the phones at the end, the laptops of the, and the people on those.

76
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:27.310
They're the only people who have the key.

77
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.230
So if somebody comes to Facebook and says, we want to see that information, uh,

78
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.850
Facebook hands over the encrypted message, right? And Facebook goes, well,

79
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.270
here you go. Here's our copy, but we can't read it. You can't either.

80
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.260
Now you've got to actually do some work on the government site and go get that

81
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:48.970
key yourself. And then you can read it right. But we can't read it. Uh,

82
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.770
Congress is trying to stop the basically proliferation of that basic

83
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.300
end-to-end encryption technology.

84
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.860
And they're calling it like the child online predator act or something like

85
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:03.730
that, where they say it's all about protecting, uh,

86
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.420
the posting of like child exploitation material here really,

87
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.010
really horrible stuff, but that's not actually what the law is about.

88
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.230
The laws about making it easier for spies and law enforcement to reach

89
00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:21.850
deeper and deeper into your life with a simple warrant stamped by any court.

90
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.240
And the funny thing is this never used to be, uh,

91
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.510
the way law enforcement worked in the United States. I mean,

92
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:31.570
when you hear about a warrant, um, what does that mean to you?

93
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:32.920
What can the cops get with a warrant?

94
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.780
<v 0>Well, usually I think it means that they can come in your house and search,</v>

95
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.020
right? Uh, the, the, the real issue with warrants.

96
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.940
And when it pertains to encryption,

97
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:47.730
like when you're talking about the child safety act or whatever,

98
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:52.260
they're calling it, anyone would say,

99
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:54.450
yes, we have to stop child predators.

100
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.330
But the problem with having ability to use something like that,

101
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:03.890
to stop child predators in my eyes, I start thinking, well,

102
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.600
if I really wanted to look into someone,

103
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.690
what I would do is I would send them some malware that would put child

104
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.580
pornography on their computer.

105
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.680
And then I would have all of the motive that I need to go and look

106
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:19.730
through everything. Like, say, if they're, if they were a political dissonant,

107
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:22.520
if they were doing something against the government,

108
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.200
and you were someone who was, uh, acting in bad faith, and you decided, okay,

109
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.650
we want to look into this guy, but we don't have a warrant. What,

110
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:33.860
what are the laws? What, what can we get away with it? Well,

111
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:38.090
we have the child endangerment act. And so w because of that,

112
00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:41.540
we're allowed to peer into anything, but we just have to have motive.

113
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.920
So we have to, well, what do we have motive? All you'd have to do is,

114
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.690
and we, we both know this.

115
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.130
It's very easy to put something illegal on someone's computer.

116
00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:55.970
If they're not paying attention, it's very easy to install.

117
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.970
Like you could send someone a text message that looks like, um,

118
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.390
a routing number for a package they're going to get, they click on that.

119
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.170
And then you, what does that, um, with the Israelis have a Pegasus.

120
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.800
<v 1>Right? You've read up on this. Yeah. So.</v>

121
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.120
<v 0>Well, it's, uh, it's from Brian, Fogel's new film, the dissident,</v>

122
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.950
which is a about Jamal [inaudible] murder and how the Saudis

123
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.390
use that to use. They actually tapped into Jeff Bezos's phone.

124
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.050
And that's where all of the, this is the suspicion is that,

125
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:29.330
that that's where all of those, uh,

126
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.540
national Enquirer photos came out and all of the attacks on him,

127
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.450
because they had access to his actual phone through this.

128
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.460
So someone could easily get into your stuff if you're not paying attention,

129
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.140
and then they could use, you know, whatever acts they've come up with,

130
00:07:45.141 --> 00:07:47.000
whatever it's the Patriot act or whatever act,

131
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.720
where they could just get into everything you're doing.

132
00:07:50.721 --> 00:07:54.470
Look at your WhatsApp messages, look at your, your Facebook messages.

133
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.800
It's real sneaky. And it's, it's dangerous. It's,

134
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.860
it's a dangerous precedent to set. Yeah. I mean.

135
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:02.980
<v 1>There there's a lot to this. Let me go into some of that in a little depth.</v>

136
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:06.340
So you mentioned the NSO group and their, their Pegasus malware set.

137
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:11.560
And this is very much a real thing. Like you're well-read guy. Um, this is like

138
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:18.040
this company, uh, the CEO's name I think is Shalev Leo, um, is,

139
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.890
uh, run in Israel. It was previously owned, uh,

140
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.850
actually by an American venture capital firm. I believe they've been, uh,

141
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:27.640
rebought out, but, um, it doesn't really matter.

142
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:32.650
Their entire business is preying on flaws,

143
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.820
in the critical infrastructure of all the software running on the most popular

144
00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:40.150
devices in the world. The number one target right, is the iPhone.

145
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:42.280
And this is because the iPhone, uh,

146
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.540
as secure as it is relative to a lot of other phones, uh, is a monoculture,

147
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.530
right? Like if you,

148
00:08:47.531 --> 00:08:51.610
if you have an iPhone and you get these little software update notifications all

149
00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:55.030
the time, they're like, Hey, please update to the most recent version of iOS.

150
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.010
And that's a fabulous thing. That's a wonderful thing for security. Um,

151
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.460
because the number one way that people's devices get screwed,

152
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:04.620
if it's not just through user error, right?

153
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:08.730
Like you entering your password somewhere, you shouldn't, it's like a fake site.

154
00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.430
Um, that looks like Gmail, but it's not actually Gmail.

155
00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.340
And you just gave the guy your password. Now he uses your password to login.

156
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.470
But to actually break into a device is that it's not patched, right.

157
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.260
Patch means getting these, uh, security updates, these little code updates,

158
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.600
uh, that fix holes that researchers found in the security device. Okay.

159
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.290
Well, uh,

160
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.130
Apple's really good about rolling these out all the time for everybody in the

161
00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:38.960
world. The problem is basically all of these different iPhones, right?

162
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:42.650
You got an iPhone six, you got an iPhone eight, you got an iPhone X,

163
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.980
he got an iPhone, you know, three, whatever. Uh,

164
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:50.900
these are all running a pretty narrow bay end of uh,

165
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.580
software versions. And so these guys go, if they want to target, for example,

166
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.720
Android phones like Google phones, like Samsung galaxy or something like that.

167
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.670
There's like a billion different phones made by a billion, different people. Uh,

168
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.300
half of them are completely out of date, but, uh,

169
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.210
what it means is it's not one version of software they're running.

170
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:12.380
It's like 10,000,

171
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:16.790
and this is actually bad for security on the individual level. Uh,

172
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.570
but it's good for security in a very unusual way,

173
00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:25.300
which is the guys who are developing the exploits, the guys like this NSO group,

174
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.010
we're trying to find ways to break into phones.

175
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.700
They now have to have like 50 different handsets running,

176
00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:34.130
50 different versions of software. They're all changing.

177
00:10:34.131 --> 00:10:35.210
They've got different hardware,

178
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:38.120
they've got different ship sets for the they've got different,

179
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.380
like all kinds of just technical variables that can screw up the way they

180
00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:46.280
attack. Uh, you were. And then when they find one,

181
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.300
it only works on like this Samsung galaxy line.

182
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.820
It doesn't work on like the Google pixel line,

183
00:10:52.821 --> 00:10:55.610
or it doesn't work on like a Nokia line or something like that.

184
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.170
Whereas they realize if they find a way to attack an iPhone,

185
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.710
which is actually, you know, this is difficult. This is really difficult stuff.

186
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.170
Now it works against basically every iPhone and who has,

187
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.080
I-phones all the rich people, right? All the important people,

188
00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:14.360
all the lawmakers, all the guys who are in there.

189
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.580
So they've made a business on basically attacking the iPhone and selling it

190
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:23.960
to every two bit thug, uh, who runs a police department in the world. You know,

191
00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:25.460
they sell this stuff to Saudi Arabia.

192
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:30.020
They sells this to Mexico and there's a group of researchers in Canada, uh,

193
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.670
working at a university called the citizen lab. Um, and, uh,

194
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.940
these guys are really like the best in the world at tracking what Anna's soul

195
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.830
group is doing. If you want to learn about this stuff,

196
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:44.180
the real stuff look up citizen lab. Yeah. The NSO group. Uh,

197
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:49.100
and what they have found, uh, is all the people who are being targeted,

198
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:53.860
um, by the NSO group, the classes of people, the countries that are using this.

199
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.821
And, you know,

200
00:11:54.821 --> 00:11:58.930
it's not like the local police department in Germany trying to bust up,

201
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.320
you know, a terrorism ring or something like that. Uh,

202
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:07.150
it's the Mexican government spying on the head of the Mexican opposition, uh,

203
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.050
or trying to look at human rights defenders who are investigating like student

204
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:15.370
disappearances or it's people like the friends and associates of Jamal

205
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:19.330
Khashoggi, uh, who was murdered by the Saudi government. Um,

206
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.370
or it's people like, uh,

207
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.660
dissidence in Bahrain and these like Petro states, the,

208
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:30.520
these bad actors nationally will pay literally tens of millions of dollars

209
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.810
each year,

210
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.620
just to have the ability to break into an iPhone for a certain number of plants,

211
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.380
because that's how these guys do what they sell their business plan. They go,

212
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:40.990
we'll let you break in any iPhone. Uh,

213
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.630
just by basically sending a text message to this phone.

214
00:12:43.631 --> 00:12:47.050
All you need to find is the phone number or a person who's running an iPhone,

215
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.860
and we will exploit something, uh, which will give you total.

216
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.750
<v 0>If that happens to someone. I'm sorry. But if that happens to someone,</v>

217
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.620
could they just get a new phone and does the exploit,

218
00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:03.540
is the exploit specific to their account? Well, or is the exploit on the,

219
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.040
the physical phone itself?

220
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.970
<v 1>The question or the answer to this as it really depends on the exploit,</v>

221
00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.650
like the easiest forms of exploit or rather the easier types of

222
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:17.280
exploits are way they send you a text message, right?

223
00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:21.180
And it'll be like an IMS EJ or something like that. And it's got a link in it.

224
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:23.760
That'll be like, oh gosh, terrible news. You know,

225
00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.880
your buddy's father just died. Um,

226
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.420
and we're making funeral arrangements. Are you going to be there?

227
00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.130
It's the day after tomorrow?

228
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:34.710
And when you click the link for the funeral arrangements,

229
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.360
it opens your web browser and the web browser on your phone is always the

230
00:13:39.361 --> 00:13:42.870
biggest, most complicated process in it, right? Uh,

231
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.120
there's a zillion lines of code and this,

232
00:13:45.121 --> 00:13:48.990
as opposed to an instant messenger where there's fewer lines of code in it. Um,

233
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:51.810
and they'll find one thing in that, uh,

234
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.980
where there's a flaw that lets them feed instructions, uh,

235
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.930
not just to the browser, uh,

236
00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:01.980
but basically escape the little sandbox that the browser supposed to plan.

237
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.380
That's supposed to be safe where it can't do anything too harmful.

238
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.610
It'll run out of this sandbox and it'll ransack your,

239
00:14:08.611 --> 00:14:11.820
your phone's like wired operating system. Uh,

240
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.450
the system image it'll like give them, uh,

241
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:20.010
privileges to do whatever they want on your phone as if they are you.

242
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.670
And then as if they have a higher level of privilege than you,

243
00:14:23.671 --> 00:14:27.870
they have system level privileges to change the phone's operation permanently.

244
00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:31.140
Right? And this is the problem is on the phone.

245
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.670
You can replace the phone, right? And they'll lose access to that.

246
00:14:35.671 --> 00:14:40.290
But if they've already used that to gain the passwords that you use to

247
00:14:40.291 --> 00:14:43.770
access, you know, your iCloud or whatever, when they have control of the phone,

248
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.720
they've already got your photo roll, right?

249
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:47.250
They've already got your contact list.

250
00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:49.740
They already have everything that you've ever put in that phone.

251
00:14:49.741 --> 00:14:52.730
They already have all your, they already have all your files.

252
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.100
They already have everything that's in your message history. Right?

253
00:14:55.101 --> 00:15:00.020
They can pull that out immediately. And now, now, because they have,

254
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.730
uh, you know, all your contacts and things like that,

255
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.860
they see that phone stop being active.

256
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.870
They know you've changed your phone number.

257
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.330
All they have to do is find the new phone number and then they can try to go

258
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:12.170
after you again, the benefit is, uh, with that old style of attack,

259
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.770
if you get that message and you don't click that link,

260
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.020
you're a somebody in a vulnerable class, right?

261
00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:20.840
You've had these kinds of attacks answering before it looks suspicious.

262
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.680
You don't know who this person is, the number isn't right. Something like that.

263
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.470
And you've saved that link. You don't click the link.

264
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:28.790
You don't do anything with that link,

265
00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:32.810
but you send it to a group like citizen lab. Uh,

266
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.970
they can basically use that link to basically use a, like a dummy phone,

267
00:15:37.971 --> 00:15:42.890
like a sort of a Trojan horse to go to the site that would attack your phone

268
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:43.520
and catch it.

269
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.030
And this is what the sort of a process that all of their research is based on.

270
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:51.740
There are other types of attacks that actually don't have these defenses against

271
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:53.300
them that are far more scary.

272
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:58.990
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

273
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.110
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

274
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.540
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

275
00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:08.230
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

276
00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.250
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

277
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:17.080
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
