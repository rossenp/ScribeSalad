1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>Do you mess around with VR at all? Yes.</v>

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 1>A little bit. I have a,</v>

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.200
I have an HTC vibe and that's been the most common use of VR.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.880
We have a vibe in the studio and the two games that come into mind the most are

5
00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:17.840
called super hot. I dunno if you've played that? No. And beatsabre.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.350
<v 0>I try to play, but my kids Don, this the VR thing. Yeah. They,</v>

7
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:26.550
they come in here and like, get outta here. They push me away and there's a lot.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.110
<v 1>There's, there's a lot of fun stuff. So I like so, so super hot is a fun one.</v>

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.470
It's a shooting game strategy game type of thing. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.390
so you're so the way super you, again, you're in VR.

11
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.740
So you're wearing this thing and it's a bunch of stick is trying to kill you.

12
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700
And they're running downstairs, running around corners, shooting at you,

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.780
trying to kill you, but time only moves when you move.

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.700
So if you hold still, you can look around and like,

15
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.420
see in the headset where people are and sort of evaluate like, okay, I can,

16
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.340
I can pick up this object and hurt somebody with it. This is.

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.210
<v 0>It right here. Yeah. This is the game. It's very crude looking the, yeah.</v>

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.010
<v 1>It's super basic graphics again. Stick figures, trying to kill you. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.090
But it's like a strategy game in that you sort of have to evaluate

20
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.050
where you're at and not look around too much.

21
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.970
And then as soon as you start to move and throw things,

22
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.250
everyone else is trying to kill you also. Huh?

23
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.000
And so you can sort of Dodge bullets as they come around because you don't move

24
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.520
when you see them flying through the air.

25
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.120
There's a lot of cool stuff to this game. So I got really into it.

26
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.560
I didn't get to this level, which is probably, yeah,

27
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.360
you gotta Dodge all these bullets flying at you turn around,

28
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.960
throw something at 'ems.

29
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.840
<v 0>A lot. There's a boxing game. Well, there's several boxing games, but VR. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.480
God that are really good. Wow. And they are, they give you,

31
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.470
you a workout because there's a guy in front of you and he's throwing punches

32
00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:49.030
and you're bobbing and weeding. Is they like full speed. You're punching at him.

33
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.230
Yeah. Yeah. And they look good. Like, it looks like, like,

34
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.151
like you're in the,

35
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:57.190
the ring and the guy's looking at you he's mean muy and throws,

36
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:00.350
punches your way. Wow. And when you get hit, you see a flash of white &lt;laugh&gt;.

37
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.870
That's.

38
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.470
<v 1>So good. Yeah. I wanna try that now.</v>

39
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.980
<v 0>It's really fun. But I think with the, with the haptic feedback suit,</v>

40
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:08.900
especially if you could put something, there it is right here.

41
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:10.420
This is the new one. This is the pre new one.

42
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.380
The creed video I was telling you about. Oh, see, based off of the rock.

43
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.220
<v 1>New Rocky movie. Oh, you can block. Yeah. Follow.</v>

44
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.900
<v 0>Up. Damaging regions, kinda exposed by.</v>

45
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.980
<v 1>Bro rock. You.</v>

46
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.500
<v 0>Could hear Rockys your chain in this, look at this that's so,</v>

47
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.250
but when you're doing it, like we, we did it out here in the hallway.

48
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.210
My feet were hurting cuz I was moving and shifting left and right.

49
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:35.370
And throwing punches and bouncing off my toes. Yeah. And after it was over,

50
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:37.330
I was like, dude, my feet are exhausted.

51
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.090
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. Wow. And you're doing the drills and everything. Yeah. Like.</v>

52
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.530
<v 0>More so than it would be if I was actually sparring,</v>

53
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.280
because if I was actually sparring, I don't think I would.

54
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.160
I don't think I would throw as many punches in such a quick succession. Yeah.

55
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.760
You'd be more worried about getting hit back and actually getting punched.

56
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.400
But when you're doing it, it's really interesting. Wow. Yeah.

57
00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.773
That's I gotta try.

58
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.560
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; is that Adrian and's book? There's also the, uh,</v>

59
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.920
is this in the V H HTC vibe too? This, yeah. This just came out for all of '.

60
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.600
Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. The other one, the other one's called beat saber.

61
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.520
And it's a, you can think of it as like guitar hero,

62
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.870
but you're holding like light saber as controls. Oh yeah. Love that.

63
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.870
<v 0>And they're going past you. I love.</v>

64
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.710
<v 1>That game and things are flying that you and you're hitting them. Yeah. That,</v>

65
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.870
that is a really well done game.

66
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.390
<v 0>There's a bunch of really well done once. There's a,</v>

67
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:30.630
there's a great one that you're in a castle and you have, uh,

68
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.830
like an old school bow and arrow. And then there's these almost like south park,

69
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:36.550
look at monsters coming towards.

70
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 1>Your way. Yeah. And they're like, it's still kind of car cartoony.</v>

71
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:42.180
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but like the graphics are crisp enough that you like,

72
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:44.820
feel like you're a cartoon character in a way. Yeah. It's it's.

73
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.900
<v 0>Pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's really cool. And you, you know,</v>

74
00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:51.580
like there's actual physics to the arrow, like when you shoot it,

75
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.700
like you have to lift your arm up to get the arc of the arrow, correct.

76
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.580
To hit it things. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.930
<v 1>Yeah. That's good. I, so I, I think about VR a lot,</v>

78
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:01.730
just because as a video maker,

79
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.010
you're making content for the platform that people view it on.

80
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.690
And we started to get this little creeping up of like 360 videos getting really

81
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:14.890
good and like interesting applications of, of 360 video.

82
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.930
And it's still kind of early and I don't really know if it's gonna take off or

83
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:23.920
it's if it's just this like medium stepping stone format to what might be a

84
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.760
more immersive thing or maybe just AR is gonna be way better. I don't,

85
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.200
I don't know yet, but I pay a lot of attention to it just cuz it's it's new.

86
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.000
That's.

87
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
<v 0>Interesting. Yeah. AR is fascinating as well. I mean we, we, we discussed,</v>

88
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.440
what was it? Magic leap. Is that what it was?

89
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.550
The Microsoft one &lt;affirmative&gt; no, that that's.

90
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.790
<v 1>The other one. Yeah. Hololen is Microsoft and then magic leap is its own thing.</v>

91
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.310
Yeah. I haven't tried either actually.

92
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.670
<v 0>Yet. And which one was the one where the ballerina was dancing in your hand?</v>

93
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.230
That's magic. Magic leap. Yeah.

94
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.350
But which one is that the one that people are saying is kind of vaporware.

95
00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.350
<v 1>Sort of, sort of, I mean, I would imagine that.</v>

96
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.300
<v 2>That screen on that phone would have some sort of similar I</v>

97
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.460
technology it's like light field technology.

98
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.180
<v 1>So I didn't even talk about that. Doing weird stuff with your eyes.</v>

99
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.300
This's weird. So this phone has a, what are they calling it?

100
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.010
I'm not, I'm not remember what they're calling it. Oh, is there,

101
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.440
I need wifi for it actually. Uh, it's got a, a 3d screen,

102
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.360
a glasses list, 3d here's the, um, Uh, and you,

103
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.480
you basically,

104
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.240
it has a 3d screen and you look at media on it and it's supposed to sort of pop

105
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.200
out that's the password at the.

106
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.680
<v 0>Top. Okay. Yeah. Uh, doesn't have to be lower case. There's a lower case. No,</v>

107
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.920
no.

108
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.870
<v 1>Doesn't which one is it? This, this.</v>

109
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.790
<v 0>One here. Um, T that.</v>

110
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.310
<v 1>One. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Uh, but basically it's supposed,</v>

111
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.590
it can look like that,

112
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.590
but you can't have things actually popping out above the screen.

113
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.040
So things on the screen will look 3d, but anything like outside of the screen,

114
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.680
won't, it's kind of hard to explain. Wow.

115
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.320
<v 0>And so this is for video games or for other things as well.</v>

116
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.960
<v 1>So at this point, what they're trying to do is have, uh, media,</v>

117
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.320
like photos and videos, pop, pop out, like pop out.

118
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.670
So not just games to they're gonna have games as well,

119
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.350
but they have shared with me a couple of like media files that are

120
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.670
like a good use of the 3d. And I'm,

121
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.470
I'm curious what you think of them because they're definitely like a stretch.

122
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.890
But.

123
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.310
<v 0>If I, so it's hologram me, hololog.</v>

124
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.470
<v 1>Holographic is the word they use, but it's,</v>

125
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.260
it's hard to explain and it's kind of trippy.

126
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.460
<v 0>Whoa, dude, this is weird. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

127
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.980
<v 1>And there's, there's different. Like,</v>

128
00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:49.540
so there's a movie trailer version of it where there's like things coming

129
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.900
towards you. And I think that's maybe the best use of it. I've seen, uh,

130
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.220
it's impossible to show on camera. I've tried many different times, many.

131
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.530
<v 0>This will never show up on camera. This is, but this is odd.</v>

132
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.610
<v 1>Yeah. They're an issue.</v>

133
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.250
Like people have to make stuff for this. Yes. So,

134
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.570
so any content you have to shoot four, four of you,

135
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.930
they call it four of you or they can take existing content and

136
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.440
convert it to four view, but that's a little less successful. Usually

137
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.320
&lt;laugh&gt; this is really strange, but the cameras on the back,

138
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:27.840
they have two cameras on the back and you can shoot four of you with the cameras

139
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:28.773
on the hydrogen.

140
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.480
<v 0>It's crazy. Well, what, what I'm looking at right now is, uh,</v>

141
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.640
topographic maps. Yeah. Ask you.

142
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.473
<v 1>About that too.</v>

143
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.510
<v 0>Wow. Made. So.</v>

144
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.750
<v 1>There's, it's, it's hard to tell again,</v>

145
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.990
like I try to separate things into buckets of this is something you're gonna use

146
00:07:45.991 --> 00:07:48.990
every day and love, or this is a total gimick that you'll never use again.

147
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:53.990
And I IME, I started with it in the bucket of this is kind of like a gimmick,

148
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:59.300
but they've put so much effort into making it good and

149
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:02.660
all these different conversion techniques. And what's great about what Danny's.

150
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.500
<v 3>Chosen to do is the.</v>

151
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.100
<v 1>Middle, let see if I can find a clip, but they've,</v>

152
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:10.180
they've been constantly changing the algorithms and adjusting it and updating it

153
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.980
to look better that it's starting to convince me that it might be

154
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.860
like worth paying attention to for more than just the first two seconds.

155
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.593
<v 0>This is amazing.</v>

156
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.650
<v 1>Do you think you would like use it all the time? No.</v>

157
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.010
<v 0>Never use it. No &lt;laugh&gt; but it's still amazing, but it's still pretty cool.</v>

158
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.090
Right? It's it's very cool.

159
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.090
But how much better is it than regular video?

160
00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.810
<v 1>That, that, and how long can you like look at it?</v>

161
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.880
Eyes start to tweak a little bit.

162
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.120
<v 0>Yeah. I'm I'm already going like, but it looks good.</v>

163
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.560
It definitely looks really good. It looks cool. It's kind of interesting. Yeah.

164
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.493
But.

165
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.453
<v 1>So you can take,</v>

166
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.080
you can take photos and videos with the camera on the phone that are in this 3d

167
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.120
and that's maybe the best use of it.

168
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.560
Cuz then you can see like what's actually in the room around you,

169
00:09:00.561 --> 00:09:02.840
the way it would show up in like a direct translation.

170
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.440
<v 0>And how much of an impact does it have on storage size?</v>

171
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.960
<v 1>Uh, not much. I mean,</v>

172
00:09:08.961 --> 00:09:12.240
there's still video files and there are like big 4k videos,

173
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:15.950
but they're not necessarily twice as big or anything like.

174
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:19.710
<v 0>That. It looks cool. But, but then here's regular video looks.</v>

175
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.150
<v 1>Pretty cool too. When you go into the view finder and you go from 2d to 3d,</v>

176
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.710
then you can take photos and videos of things wow.

177
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.470
In that format. So if you, whoa, this.

178
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.590
<v 0>Is weird, man.</v>

179
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.970
<v 1>Take a,</v>

180
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.620
if you take a capture and then look at it and you kind of like move the phone

181
00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:39.580
around a little bit, it's kind of like shimmery in a weird way,

182
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.380
but kind of 3d sort of.

183
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.963
<v 0>This is very.</v>

184
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.580
<v 1>Odd. It's very hard to explain. Yeah. You, you.</v>

185
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.420
<v 0>Would have to look at this through this thing.</v>

186
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.100
Like you would never be able to show this to someone in a video. Yeah, exactly.

187
00:09:51.101 --> 00:09:54.900
Exactly. Like I'm looking at these, uh, plastic cell little, uh,

188
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:59.850
figuring and as I move forward and backward, you really get a sense of 3d.

189
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.930
Yeah. That's actually pretty badass. So.

190
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.330
<v 1>I gotta figure out how to show it in the video of like you can't.</v>

191
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.650
I just have to describe it. I have to use my.

192
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:12.930
<v 0>Words. God, that's amazing. Yeah. And that's well, it's probably coming.</v>

193
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.063
That's probably coming.

194
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.970
It's probably gonna be something we're all gonna have to deal with.

195
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.160
<v 1>Yeah. I'm interested. Uh, if you ask red, they'll tell you, yeah,</v>

196
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.480
this is the future. Everything's gonna be like this. I'm like, uh, you got,

197
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.040
I think you have to say that at this point there much 3d movies.

198
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.960
<v 0>Were a big deal. Yeah. You get those stupid glasses.</v>

199
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.880
<v 1>And yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean that, so their claim is like, yes, this is what's,</v>

200
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.080
it's genuinely good. Like you can use it in portrait and landscape.

201
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:39.390
Glassesless 3d is you usually only one way or the other cuz of polarization.

202
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.870
So this is a lticicular technology. I don't know exactly how it works,

203
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.150
but you can use it in portrait or landscape.

204
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:50.750
You can play games with it and things will react in depth of space on,

205
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.030
in the game. Well.

206
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.750
<v 0>The first video that you show me is really interesting too,</v>

207
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:56.710
because it's essentially like a topographic map. Yeah. So.

208
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.340
<v 1>It's a like, so you're, you're paying attention to depth.</v>

209
00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.180
<v 0>Yeah. You're looking at the, the layers of the mountain and the hillside. Yeah.</v>

210
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:03.520
It's like.

211
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.460
<v 1>Ooh. So yeah. It's.</v>

212
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.100
<v 0>But this actually was kind of weirder,</v>

213
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.140
like seeing these little figurines and moving towards them in real life.

214
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.940
<v 1>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what I think is, uh,</v>

215
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.220
that's the best way to calibrate to your eye? Like what it's doing,

216
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.650
if you just look at like a video of it, you're like, all right, it looks 3d.

217
00:11:20.651 --> 00:11:23.450
Like it's coming at me and they had a couple, uh,

218
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.090
like a movie trailer type of thing where like, again,

219
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.970
like it was mostly shot for this format and things would like kind of go past

220
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.570
you and the speakers are also really good.

221
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:37.170
So they have this sort of a 3d conversion technique for audio as well,

222
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:41.520
where it's sort of goes behind you. But yeah. It's,

223
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.720
it's definitely interesting.

224
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.920
<v 0>Yeah. Um, did you mess around with Google glasses when they first came out?</v>

225
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.760
I did. Yeah. Yeah. What did you think? Okay, this is,

226
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.000
this is gonna be something.

227
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.800
<v 1>I guess I probably did. I, it was, uh,</v>

228
00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.240
glass was weird. It was ahead of its time, but also like, not really. Yeah.

229
00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:03.720
Like I, I, I had it. I was in college also. So it was like,

230
00:12:03.721 --> 00:12:05.800
I can't wear it to class or like walk around,

231
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.920
I guess I could walk around Hoboken with it.

232
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.200
But the whole idea of an augmented reality,

233
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.110
this little screen that I could just check the weather and then look back down

234
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:17.470
or check my texts and look back down and was like, oh, that could be cool.

235
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.390
But also if you look at someone wearing Google glass,

236
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.710
it's like that guy's wearing Google glass. Yeah. You can't,

237
00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:23.550
you can't get around it.

238
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.510
<v 0>Well, people would get angry at people for wearing it too.</v>

239
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.390
Cause I had a camera in.

240
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.190
<v 1>It filming me. What are you doing? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

241
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.950
So that was another thing is I tried, uh, I won't even say the name,

242
00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:35.780
but like another, like much newer version of that, where again, it was like a,

243
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.020
a small projection to a prism that would, you could see,

244
00:12:39.021 --> 00:12:42.500
but no one else could and it would fit into something that looked more like

245
00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:45.540
regular glasses. So it had a battery, it had everything,

246
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.580
but it didn't have a camera.

247
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.620
And you still had a screen that you could look up into the corner too. Hmm.

248
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.621
And I was like, well,

249
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:53.930
I wonder if I'll notice the difference between regular glasses and I it down.

250
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.330
And I like met the guys who were showing it to me in the lobby and immediately I

251
00:12:57.331 --> 00:12:59.290
was like that guy's wearing it. I can see it.

252
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.850
I could see the little light in his eye. Oh, I could see like the,

253
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.970
the extra thick glasses. So it was like, it's,

254
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.490
it's an interesting concept.

255
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.610
And I don't know where it goes from here,

256
00:13:10.611 --> 00:13:13.970
if it has to be glasses based or if we'll eventually have a,

257
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.400
some sort of a chip in our eye or what the deal is, what, what the next move is.

258
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.240
But it's a cool concept. Yeah. It's.

259
00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.080
<v 0>One of those things that sort of, it's kind of been flirting with.</v>

260
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.920
Like for the longest time people thought virtual reality was going to be,

261
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.400
I mean, there was virtual reality concepts 20 years ago. Yeah.

262
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.510
And people thought virtual reality was gonna be the future. And then it,

263
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.310
it took a long time for the hardware to.

264
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.750
<v 1>Catch up. I think augmented reality has a more promising, immediate future.</v>

265
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.790
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just because it's more useful. Yeah. Um,

266
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.270
but virtual reality has like the immersion factor going for it.

267
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.710
The problem is you have to make a, you have to make a whole world.

268
00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:59.460
So augmented reality is just like some layer on top of your current world.

269
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.860
So you get like a little screen or whatever,

270
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.580
or you look at one particular thing and it looks different from real life.

271
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.380
That's easier to build for virtual reality.

272
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.260
You have to build the whole world that you yeah. Step into.

273
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.180
And that's like a much, much, uh,

274
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:19.850
deep per layer of immersion, which is great to step into, but also hard to make.

275
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.050
So that's the difference. I think I'm more into AR at the moment.

276
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:24.850
<v 0>Well,</v>

277
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:29.410
I think AR in a sense of having all the functions of your phone in front of you

278
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:32.130
in the air, when you call upon them, you know? Yeah. Kinda.

279
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.440
<v 1>Like a movie. Yeah. Like a, like when someone in a movie or like Ironman,</v>

280
00:14:36.441 --> 00:14:39.480
even like they just like whoop out like a sheet of like buttons in front of them

281
00:14:39.481 --> 00:14:42.640
and like close it only they could see that like maybe that's the.

282
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.480
<v 0>Future and to have some hay sir type, you know, hopefully not demand. Yeah.</v>

283
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.080
Not sir. Terrible. SIR's not that good. It works for some things.
