00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, are you going to continue to do these things?</v>

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.940
Because it seems like you're obviously a target now.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.640
<v 1>Um, when I was asked this, uh, in my interviews this week,</v>

4
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.480
last week, the, the response that I,

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.740
that comes to my mom right away is of course, I'm going to continue doing it. I,

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.620
these people have threatened me before I've been attacked before.

7
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.400
I'm not going to be cowed. I'm going to continue. I won't be intimidated.

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.870
But with the, the brain entry that they gave me, it's like,

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.870
I can't continue doing it the same way as I do before.

10
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.180
And being naive to think that police would actually uphold the rule of

11
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:47.070
law. Um, they gave me a brain injury and like, I never had one before,

12
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:50.830
but I'm dealing with some cognitive and neurological issues,

13
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.690
memory issues, I have issues.

14
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.920
So I have upcoming physical neuro physical therapy as well as speech therapy.

15
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.910
So, um, as much as like on the surface,

16
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.340
I have improved a lot since the beating,

17
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.060
there are some long-term consequences that I'm going to have to work through.

18
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.260
And, um, you know,

19
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:15.120
I have to be honest,

20
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.930
I have certain fears and anxieties of being in Portland,

21
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.810
I've continued to receive threats, violent threats,

22
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:26.640
and they've been reported to police and just people promising to make sure next

23
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.090
time that I won't even be able to walk away that they will repeat what happened

24
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:31.560
to me when they see me on the streets.

25
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.840
<v 0>So like, have they caught the people that.</v>

26
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.260
<v 1>Did this to you? So it's been 10 days now,</v>

27
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.980
more than 10 days since my beating there have been no arrests.

28
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.800
I don't know where the police are in the investigation.

29
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.320
They haven't been keeping me informed. There.

30
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.140
<v 0>Was a photograph of someone they released.</v>

31
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.130
<v 1>Yeah. So the Portland police released photos of, uh,</v>

32
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.960
potential suspects and asking for help in identifying one was on mouse. Two,

33
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.210
two of them were mouse. And I forgot to say earlier that in addition to the,

34
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:06.390
the beating, they robbed me of my, my camera equipment. So that was my,

35
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.100
my evidence for that day. And I tried so hard to hold onto it. But, um,

36
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.173
I couldn't.

37
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.930
<v 0>What about you attending this with security? Have you thought about.</v>

38
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.200
<v 1>Yeah. So moving forward, once I feel well enough,</v>

39
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.140
and once I'm cleared by the doctors, um,

40
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.440
it may be worth it to cover these events,

41
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.450
but with professional security, um.

42
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.350
<v 0>Gorillas, big giant dudes, would they wear what?</v>

43
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.480
Like armor? Like what would you have? How far would you take this?

44
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.930
<v 1>I don't know. How far do you think I should take it?</v>

45
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.930
<v 0>I don't think you should go to these things anymore. Okay. I mean,</v>

46
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.460
it seems like you've been, I mean, it is part of your job.

47
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.390
You're a journalist,

48
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.230
but it seems like you've been singled out and targeted and it seems like they

49
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:02.260
don't have any problem justifying attacking you and assaulting you. Uh,

50
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.370
if I was going to go,

51
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.770
I'd bring the biggest baddest dudes that I could find and a bunch of them and

52
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.160
have them surround you and have them protect you. But.

53
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.770
<v 1>That tell you about America, that in 2019.</v>

54
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.890
<v 0>It's this one particular area and this one particular group and not even the</v>

55
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:24.460
group, I think it's the most ridiculous people in that group.

56
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.630
I don't think it's most.

57
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.840
I think most of these people that probably are a part of this really don't want

58
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:33.550
fascists and they really don't want some awful right ring

59
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.970
totalitarian regime running this country.

60
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.760
And in marginalized people of color,

61
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.690
gay people and immigrants and all those things that I support a hundred percent

62
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.310
I'm left wing. I mean,

63
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.670
I would be on their side ideologically about a lot of things.

64
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.080
It's the implementation of it that I have the biggest problem with it's as the

65
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:56.080
group mentality, it's the wearing the masks is the salts.

66
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.500
It's the not understanding the consequences of violence, all these things.

67
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.730
This is what I have a problem with the way the mayor allows us to take place,

68
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:07.180
the way handcuffs, the police. That that is what I have a problem with.

69
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.190
It's not that they don't want horrible people running the government and running

70
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:14.560
the world. I understand that. That makes sense.

71
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.530
<v 1>But you're not for the dismantling of the nation state, right?</v>

72
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.270
<v 0>Nope, no, no. I'm not.</v>

73
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.190
<v 1>Or the breakdown on democracy? No. Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.800
So these are the points that I'm trying to hit on.

75
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.200
<v 0>Those are the points that are hidden, right? These.</v>

76
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.760
<v 1>Are important things that make up the ideology of Antifa and the</v>

77
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.380
larger, uh,

78
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.850
those who are sympathetic because of the anti-fascist aspect of the anti

79
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:41.410
right-wing. They are ignorant of it. And I hope to become more aware of that.

80
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.960
<v 0>I think that's, what's important about your work that's,</v>

81
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:45.950
what's important about these discussions. That's,

82
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.310
it's important about people getting the word,

83
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:53.140
understanding what this really means, not what it seems on paper. It's like,

84
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.830
we're the anti Nazi movement. Well, who the could go against that?

85
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.640
Of course you're anti Nazi. That's know who everybody should be.

86
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.670
That's what it seems like. Well, we're, we're, anti-fascist good.

87
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.270
We don't want fascists. I think that's what Chris Cuomo was saying.

88
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.060
I think that's what Don lemon was saying. I think they're too busy.

89
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.800
I don't think they're really investigating this.

90
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:15.310
I don't think they're deep diving and understanding the ideology at its core,

91
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:16.300
the way you're describing it.

92
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.410
And whoever that professor was that you were discussing that is, uh,

93
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.070
somehow or another condoning violence. That,

94
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.780
that is ridiculous.

95
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.400
Anyone who considers themselves an intellectual who condones violence,

96
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.680
um, all this punch a Nazi stuff, you don't understand violence.

97
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.720
You don't know what you're talking about.

98
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.790
You don't understand the human condition because if you,

99
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.240
if you understood violence, it's the last thing you would ever be calling for.

100
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.190
<v 1>Can I talk about the, um, the next step of what's next for sure.</v>

101
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.320
So a lot of people listening and are frustrated and have expressed support are

102
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:58.220
asking, well, what can I do? I'm just one person. And this is the power.

103
00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:02.150
Now we live in a time where there's crowdfunding and, you know,

104
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:03.800
with all the points that we brought up earlier,

105
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.270
it seems to show a lot of evidence to suggest that

106
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.910
there is something seriously wrong in the upper echelons of policing

107
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.680
and governing in Portland. And that's what the legal fund is. So,

108
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.110
um, I'm working with Harmeet Dhillon. She represented James Demore. Um,

109
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.340
she's taking, uh,

110
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.840
neon as a first client for the non-profit that she started called. Um,

111
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.490
if you go to poo bleus lax, P U B L I U S L E x.com.

112
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.260
You'll see, um,

113
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.790
information for how you can donate in anything helps. And we're trying,

114
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.890
we, you know, lawsuits, if they happen against, um,

115
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.900
the city or mayor or police department costs a lot of money and takes a

116
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:52.310
lot of time, it takes, you know,

117
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:54.980
there's a lot of overhead costs in the amount of people, you know,

118
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.430
you have to take into do all the investing, um, to do your investigations.

119
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.470
So there's an opportunity for the public to get involved. Um, you know,

120
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:07.130
I don't want the story to pass just about Andy, you got beat up.

121
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.300
So what let's move on,

122
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:12.680
but rather there's systemic issues happening in Portland and there are

123
00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:14.750
implications for the rest of the country.

124
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.480
<v 0>W what do you think is going on with</v>

125
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.770
media that is supporting this attack on you?

126
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.810
Because I I've seen so many journalists dismiss

127
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.880
this as being, not a big deal. Why,

128
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.570
why do you think that anybody would look at something like that or someone's

129
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.290
being beaten publicly and not think it's a big deal.

130
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.880
What do you think is behind that?

131
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.280
<v 1>Extremist ideologies are very good at dehumanizing</v>

132
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.220
the opposition, and that's what Antifa does.

133
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.540
So there has been a lot of disinformation misinformation put out about me.

134
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.780
You know, I'm not, I'm not, they say, for example, I'm not really journalists.

135
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:04.580
I'm just a, far-right provocative. I'm somebody who's sympathetic to Nazis.

136
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.190
Um, and so when you put these ideas out that not only are lies,

137
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.510
but are meant to

138
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.060
remove one's humanity, they just become, you know,

139
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:18.440
like Andy's no longer Andy,

140
00:08:18.441 --> 00:08:23.360
Andy is the face of far-right ideology and it makes people

141
00:08:23.361 --> 00:08:25.730
feel comfortable with violence against that.

142
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:31.130
And it was so disheartening to see so many writers

143
00:08:31.131 --> 00:08:35.870
come out and say things like, you know, I don't really support what happened,

144
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:39.440
Andy, but he's done far worse. Or he was provocative in his writings.

145
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:43.130
Like he came and he got exactly what he was looking for.

146
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.320
What happened to me should happen to nobody, um,

147
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.260
much less a journalists, right? I'm like,

148
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.680
this is an America in a major American city. We're not, you know,

149
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:58.560
this is not in Afghanistan or Iraq where the state is weak.

150
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.350
We have a strong state, we have police force.

151
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:07.260
Why are the laws not being enforced? Why are citizens having to suffer? Why.

152
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.250
<v 0>Are there no arrests?</v>

153
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.140
<v 1>Why they no arrests?</v>

154
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.950
<v 0>It's really absurd. And it's obscene. Yeah.</v>

155
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:22.760
Um, when is the next one of these things supposed to take place.

156
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.330
<v 1>On the 17th of August is supposedly the next event.</v>

157
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:34.490
I think the proud boys have announced that they're encouraging all of

158
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:37.640
their members across the country to, to fly into Portland. And.

159
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.680
<v 0>It's always Portland.</v>
