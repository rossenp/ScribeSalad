00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. No, you guys talk. I'll get it. Okay.</v>

2
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:07.760
Jamie's gonna get the boo look at that. Jamie leaves the salon to get the booze.

3
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.520
Thank you, Jamie. Real, real pro get some ice tooth. Beautiful.

4
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.520
So lot of going on, man. Lot of going on. How about that? Colby?

5
00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:21.070
Covington fella. Huh? Bro. Dude, everybody better. Shut the up now.

6
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.670
He's for real he's for real anybody who didn't think he was for real,

7
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:27.510
after that Robby Lawler fight, you gotta go. Wow. Well, the.

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.870
<v 1>Problem is, is he talks so much, which I find hilarious.</v>

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.710
And it's you're tuning in to watch him lose. Yeah. Which is he's doing it right?

10
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.430
Cuz to in all honesty, we like him cuz we're balls deep in UFC and MMA.

11
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.140
Like my brother, who's not that big of a fan is like, this is all he does.

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.100
I'm like, I know you gotta understand though, what he's doing,

13
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:48.980
this guy is amazing.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.420
And HES gonna do it for five rounds or 25 minutes. He wears you. It's to me,

15
00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.340
it's fascinating. It is fascinating. But in the, the audio,

16
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.980
but it's not entertaining for general fan.

17
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.460
Typically he's not knocking dudes out. He's not a lot of submiss.

18
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.570
I see what you're saying. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So for the,

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.210
for the general fan, like, oh this guy talks all this, but he's doing it right?

20
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:10.930
Because he's talking all that. You're like, dude, I only see this guy get up.

21
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.610
Even John Jones posted, uh, you let everyone down, you know like, uh, uh,

22
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.250
Robbie Lawler, let everybody down. You know what I'm saying? Cuz he wants,

23
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.560
everybody wants Kobe to lose. Right? Kobe's doing Zach.

24
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.240
Everyone's playing into his game plan. I love.

25
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.920
<v 0>It. Well that's how Floyd Mayweather became.</v>

26
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.840
So rich Floyd way Mayweather did not become so rich because his fights are so

27
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.720
exciting. His fights in his early career were way more exciting.

28
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560
<v 1>He was a SAV early on. He could go put.</v>

29
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.560
<v 0>Himself at risk, but he broke his hands a bunch of times. Correct. And you know,</v>

30
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.270
and also realize like this is not the way to have a long career and walk out of

31
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.030
it with all your brains intact. Well think.

32
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.590
<v 1>Remember, think how good John Fitch was. Oh yeah. He was a monster. Sure.</v>

33
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.710
Nice guy. True professional beat. Some of the very best was tough to beat.

34
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.790
Didn't talk though. So no one really cared. So as soon as he had some issues,

35
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.671
remember he was like, Hey,

36
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:03.420
I don't like the way my face looks in that video game. UFC was like, cool.

37
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:06.580
You're cut. Like what the? I'm 20 and oh man. Yeah.

38
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.220
<v 0>I think they cut. 'em just because of, do you want, we have,</v>

39
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.580
we have left right here. Um, but either one of those is good.

40
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.340
This is all we have in this room. Yeah. We have a bunch of that. Um,

41
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.820
trace stuff. Where's that? Buffalo. Buffalo trace.

42
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.220
Do we have Buffalo trays in the back?

43
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.260
<v 1>I don't trust skinny bottles.</v>

44
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.690
<v 0>Yeah. That seems weird, right? Yeah. It's for.</v>

45
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.410
<v 1>Girls. Don't trust skinny girls. This girl whiskey.</v>

46
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.290
<v 0>Skinny bottles bro. Canadian whiskey and maple syrup.</v>

47
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.010
<v 1>Can't do maple I'm keto, bro. Are you really.</v>

48
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.430
<v 0>Straight keto?</v>

49
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.650
<v 1>Are you? When did that happen? I sent, I sent you and Brian a text. Your,</v>

50
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:41.050
your boy was up to 2 73, dude. You got.

51
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.640
<v 0>To 2 73. &lt;laugh&gt; well you eating road. Live duck.</v>

52
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.480
<v 1>Road, Doug road life. Cause when I, when I get into towns and there's all this,</v>

53
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:52.280
you know, if you're Nasry in Philly, wherever there's great food.

54
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.440
So I was just eating and drinking at night and no one said anything to me.

55
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.680
I hear you. No one said anything. No. And then I remember I went to Hawaii,

56
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.160
I went to Hawaii. I was looking at the other dads. I'm like,

57
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.160
these dads are in shape. I look like. And my girl's like, no, you look fine.

58
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.240
Everyone was lying, man. Now I got on the scale. It's not fine.

59
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.120
Your boy's been keto 14 days. I feel great. 14 days, 14 days strict. This.

60
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.560
<v 0>Is gonna knock you outta keto. Anyway though, this is whiskey.</v>

61
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.950
<v 1>There's no. And whiskey does not. Nope.</v>

62
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.310
<v 0>It's alcohol, but there's no sugar in it. But alcohol doesn't convert to cheers.</v>

63
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:23.550
My brother.

64
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.630
<v 1>Cheers brother. Good to.</v>

65
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.070
<v 0>See you, man. Good to see you too. Alcohol doesn't convert into sugar.</v>

66
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:28.391
<v 1>I don't think so.</v>

67
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:32.150
Especially whiskey cuz whiskey and vodka are safe on keto diet.

68
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.510
Oh woo. Yeah. It's it's two in the afternoon bro. Yeah.

69
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.020
Two in the afternoon. Don't fight alcoholic now babe drinking. I'm like a.

70
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.580
<v 0>Super Realite it's fun to uh, drink a little bit before a show, right? Ah,</v>

71
00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:45.500
nothing better, man.

72
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.900
<v 1>Take that. You started me on it. I'm like, I feel good up here.</v>

73
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.420
I'm messing around. Yeah. You get loose.

74
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.180
<v 0>Yeah. You don't wanna be tight. Definitely don't wanna be tight. No, you,</v>

75
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.180
you don't wanna drink your problem either. But the Kobe Covington thing is, um,

76
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.890
look what he did. If, if you,

77
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.810
if you wanna put it in perspective for a regular person,

78
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.010
Robby Lawler is one of the biggest savages to ever compete in a sport.

79
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.290
He's an animal and Kobe shut him down. He shut everything down.

80
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:14.130
He shut his entire game down and he did it with an unprecedented work rate.

81
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.170
He made, he was punching one punch every two seconds nuts,

82
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.240
which is nuts. I'm mean that is for,

83
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:26.000
to do that over five rounds against one of the greatest we

84
00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:30.600
weights of all time and Robbie Lauer and win every single round. Some 10,

85
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:31.040
eight rounds.

86
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.800
<v 1>I thought for sure, I was like, oh, this isn't even close.</v>

87
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.080
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, not even close.</v>

88
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.640
I mean Robbie occasionally would swing and connect and then Kobe would

89
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:41.070
immediately hit him three or four times more and then take him down or clinch

90
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.150
with him and beat him up. And it was amazing.

91
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.350
<v 1>Kobe. Strike's not terrible either. It's very pretty.</v>

92
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.190
<v 0>Good. It's very technical. And the, the volume, the volume is incredible.</v>

93
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.190
But here here's.

94
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.590
<v 1>My thing. If, if I'm fighting Colby, like if I'm a car Usman,</v>

95
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.470
if I'm fighting Kobe, I'm getting a guy like cam Hays.

96
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.220
If I see my opponent running with campaigns. Yeah.

97
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.300
I'm I'm reaching out to another ultra marathon or figuring it out.

98
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.363
<v 0>Well, Camaro.</v>

99
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.180
<v 1>Can't run. That's right. He can't do road work. His knees are.</v>

100
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.100
<v 0>Up still. Yes. Oh yeah. It's not getting any better. His knees are mangled,</v>

101
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.620
but he's doing something right. Well his cardios off the charts too,

102
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:18.580
but it's just, he does different things.

103
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.010
You can do a lot of different to work your car, swimming stuff. Sure. Swimming.

104
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.410
Um, you can do a lot of yeah. The, uh, assault, bike, um, you know, the,

105
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.530
um, that echo bike, that rogue makes that is as good as thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

106
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:34.364
Yeah. That.

107
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.210
<v 1>I feel like it's lying to me. I work out every morning on that thing.</v>

108
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.490
I've never been thicker.

109
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.770
<v 0>Yeah. But you're eating like an animal.</v>

110
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.080
<v 1>Still. It says I burn a thousand calories. You probably, I call 4,000 dude.</v>

111
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.680
I don't think so. Ma'am tell a think.

112
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.920
<v 0>Full of. I see those food truck diaries. You need to stop lying. &lt;laugh&gt; dude.</v>

113
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.600
No, these food truck diaries.

114
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.000
<v 1>You're going hard in those. I'm going hard.</v>

115
00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.720
And I'm the only one eating if you know.

116
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.960
<v 0>Yeah. Cause the other, the guest is talking. So tell me how you got started.</v>

117
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.280
&lt;laugh&gt; Lobster,

118
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.200
sandwiches and. Pizza nonstop.

119
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.000
<v 1>Yeah. No. Your two 70. Yeah. That's what I can't find.</v>

120
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.680
<v 0>It heavyweight right now, man. That's what happens.</v>

121
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.230
<v 1>Hard. But if I'm a tomorrow, obviously cardio's not a problem for him,</v>

122
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.310
but man Colby, I have you ever seen him tired ever?

123
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.630
<v 0>No. No. I mean he had that one loss in the OOC,</v>

124
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:29.310
but that was particularly because he came into the fight. Injured,

125
00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:32.150
took the fight on short notice, but he's,

126
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.500
he's got an amazing style that style of wrestling and striking and as

127
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.460
a person who's fascinated by tactics, right? Yeah.

128
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:43.860
Like his tactics are incredible because he's,

129
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.540
he's got great discipline to never,

130
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.260
he's never bites down his mouthpiece and throws as hard as he can.

131
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.020
Never everything is like a calculated, uh, the,

132
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.690
the output is all the same. It's just constant, constant bang, bang, bang, kick,

133
00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:00.210
bang, bang, bang, punch, bang.

134
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.610
<v 1>Bang, bang. He doesn't even really fire power shots. Like he's like, oh no,</v>

135
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:05.810
this is a marathon. Yeah. Like I'm gonna wear your.

136
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.810
<v 0>Out. Everything. It's just con it's all the same pace. It's all.</v>

137
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.490
He's just constantly hitting you constantly moving forward constant volume.

138
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.490
And it seemed like Robby was waiting for him to pause in front of him or.

139
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.280
<v 1>Get a little tired so he could fly shots off. And.</v>

140
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.960
<v 0>The Bob and weaving that Robbie was doing like, what was all that about?</v>

141
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.973
He had to be tired.

142
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.400
<v 1>I mean, I guess so doing all that Bob and weaving like, oh yeah. Tiresome.</v>

143
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.760
I was like, that's rough on the core.

144
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.920
<v 0>Yeah, man. That's rough on the core. Try Bob and weaving for a minute.</v>

145
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.560
If you're at home, just try doing this for a minute. Just a minute. Just.

146
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.280
<v 1>A minute. Real tired. And.</v>

147
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.440
<v 0>Robbie's just trying to avoid getting beat up. I,</v>

148
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.390
this punch is just is relentless. They.

149
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.350
<v 1>Never end. And what's funny too. About Colby is love. Hate him.</v>

150
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.350
Is he doubles down? Cuz he got on the mic and his line about Matt Hughes.

151
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.390
Oh my God. I was watching it. And I was, where was I? I was in oh Nashville.

152
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:57.590
I was watching the room with uh, Derek Poston, AAN, uh, Amad, my openers.

153
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.540
And uh, when he said that they were aware of uh, Matt Hughes and they go,

154
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.500
that's ridiculous. I'm like, that's fantastic. It's a, cuz it,

155
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.220
it is messed up. But that's his character man. Right? He's a heel.

156
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.620
And he just doubled down so hard. So hard.

157
00:08:13.621 --> 00:08:17.340
Cause Matt Hughes is really close with Robbie law and he said,

158
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.250
you think what he said for those that have what's fight, he goes,

159
00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.090
you would think Robby Lawler would take, uh, a lesson from his boy,

160
00:08:24.091 --> 00:08:26.690
Matt Hughes and get off the train tracks. When a train is coming,

161
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.210
he's just ball fair and love and more. Yeah.

162
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:36.130
<v 0>The most controversial ruthless that he could say. And.</v>

163
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.410
<v 1>Here's what else? So we're impressed by his tactics. Right. You know,</v>

164
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:41.560
what's even impressive as a former fighter.

165
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.680
It's stressful enough fighting another grown man where steel cage,

166
00:08:46.681 --> 00:08:49.600
especially when they're really good. It's stressful. Now.

167
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:53.760
Imagine talking all that. Yeah. And you gotta deal with the consequences.

168
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:58.240
People hate you. Yeah. And he's a good dude. Yeah. Talk to campaigns. Cool.

169
00:08:58.241 --> 00:08:58.480
He's a.

170
00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.440
<v 0>Different guy. Great guy.</v>

171
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.960
<v 1>Yeah. So he's a normal dude outside,</v>

172
00:09:01.961 --> 00:09:04.520
but he has to deal with all that pressure and still perform.

173
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:08.440
Then get on the mic. I wonder if he's ever just in bed, just like, yeah.

174
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.920
Let me tell you so something he's death threats getting real.

175
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.110
<v 0>Old. After that fight, he has a real shot at being a world champion.</v>

176
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.670
A real shot. I know he was already the interim world champion.

177
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.750
Those don't count. They do. After that fight, they don't count. No. And well,

178
00:09:20.751 --> 00:09:21.790
you know how you know, they don't count.

179
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.430
They stripped him and he didn't even lose.

180
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.430
<v 1>Yeah. It doesn't matter. How.</v>

181
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.790
<v 0>Does that make any, any sense? He,</v>

182
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:29.710
they stripped him because he didn't wanna fight again quickly after a five round

183
00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:30.270
war.

184
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.310
<v 1>With RDA and he needed surgery. Yeah.</v>

185
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.180
He's but also they don't count either because you're track doesn't you don't

186
00:09:36.181 --> 00:09:39.020
get, when you're a champ you're contract, you get bumped up to higher pay.

187
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.580
Interim champs don't get bumped up.

188
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.580
<v 0>Right. What was, what was the surgery for?</v>

189
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:47.900
<v 1>Um, I, it was something, uh, I feel like in his face. Oh, oh, like sinus? Yeah.</v>

190
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:48.510
Something.

191
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:53.020
<v 0>Major. Yeah. Yeah. Something like a deviated septum. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah,</v>

192
00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:57.090
it's a, he's a a, he's a phenomenal fighter. But.

193
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.370
<v 1>Now think about this. You take his style. He doesn't go backwards. Wrestling,</v>

194
00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:04.610
cardio Camaro, Husman. Doesn't go backwards. Wrestling. Cardio. Yeah.

195
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.730
The only thing I see,

196
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.890
I would imagine Camaro's gonna be a slight favorite because of his power. Yes.

197
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:14.850
The one kind of distinguishing kind of factors. Camaro has a lot more power,

198
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.360
right? Camaro. We can knock you out. Mom's a knockout artist, but Camaro.

199
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.280
<v 0>Can knock people out though.</v>

200
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:22.023
<v 1>It's not a straight.</v>

201
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.040
<v 0>Comedy does probably can knock people out too.</v>

202
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.760
But his approach is to throw everything at like 50, 60%. He.

203
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.920
<v 1>Was laying in some early, in that first round against Robbie.</v>

204
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.880
They were exchanging.

205
00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:34.360
If it would've connected could have been trouble for either guy, for either guy.

206
00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:34.600
They.

207
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.800
<v 0>He was getting Robbie's respect.</v>

208
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.310
And I think that was the strategy that you ha you kind of have to Wade through

209
00:10:39.311 --> 00:10:42.510
the fire with Robbie in the beginning. Cuz he's coming hard. You know,

210
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.190
he's coming hard. He's coming. He's coming hard. You.
