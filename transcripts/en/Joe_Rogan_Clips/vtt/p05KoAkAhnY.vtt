00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.020
<v 2>When we Ramadi, it was the worst place I'd ever been after I've gained.</v>

3
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:11.370
Stan went to Iraq, excuse me, Anbar province.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.620
Chris Kyle was there. That's when he got those.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.480
<v 0>And the people that people, many,</v>

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.050
many people don't even know this after that movie. What,

7
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.720
the events that happened in the movie, lone survivor. You.

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.780
<v 1>You went back. I was still in. Yeah. You went back,</v>

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.190
you did more tourists in the, in the last one we went on was in, uh,

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.330
an Ambar province in Ramadi, Iraq. I was there. Oh, 6 0 7.

11
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.620
I relieved or ripped out. It was what we say. Uh, Jocko's platoon,

12
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.790
which is Jocko, Chris, Kyle and those guys. And it was hell. I mean,

13
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:45.060
it was the last stand for all. It was like, when we was like, Hey, let's fight

14
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.580
the sleeping in our body armor. I mean, I went out there,

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.430
we took 18 men and 14 of them got wounded. I didn't lose,

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.890
I didn't lose one guy the day before we redeploying one of my,

17
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.720
I had to point men. They like, they,

18
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:03.810
they run the platoon out and we're doing operations. I'll never,

19
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.460
I remember Shellenberger uh, I miss you bro. And then another,

20
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:13.200
a firefighter named [inaudible] man, bro,

21
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:17.100
I miss you. He was walking outside the tent and around,

22
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.140
came over from outside and hit him in the ribs.

23
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.140
And he was sitting next to one of the walls or next to a dumpster.

24
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:23.910
And one of our buddies comes walking. I was like, what's wrong with you?

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.610
He's like, man, I think somebody hit me with a rock and hit getting shot.

26
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.930
The x-ray is awesome. It's literally his spine. And then you see the 7, 6,

27
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.080
2 round right in front of it. They can't pull it out. It's been a capsulated.

28
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.330
It just has to sit there and he's fine now.

29
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.460
But there was a gunfight going outside the wall and he'd come over and hit

30
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.280
him. So the day before we were coming back, he got hit.

31
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.260
And then the other ones Shellenberger I remember he, he, we got back and we,

32
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.970
they had separated us and he went to a different team.

33
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.720
Is SDBS I know you're familiar with, with our submersible system. Yeah.

34
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.860
And two months or so later, maybe it might've been a little bit of a more,

35
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:01.170
he died underneath an aircraft carrier doing a dive.

36
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.410
So the Mo the darkest place on the planet is underneath an aircraft carrier at

37
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:09.090
night. It's a modern Marvel, 6,000 people and air wing. It's a floating city.

38
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.010
If you it's, it's unbelievable how it even holds in water. Yeah.

39
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.890
And a lot of the training, all of our training is,

40
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:20.610
is twice as dangerous as real life. We make it that way on purpose.

41
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.940
That's why more seals die in combat or in training than they do in combat.

42
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.170
Usually when you see seals dying in combat is a bunch of us. I mean, we,

43
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.920
we get hit with us. It was 19 extortion. It was 31.

44
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.890
And it just kinda, it's just the way we are,

45
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.650
but coming out of Afghanistan and then go,

46
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:45.330
and then rolling into Iraq. I remember seeing Jocko and he was just,

47
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.750
he had his war face on. So he didn't talk to me. Chocolate wakes up with.

48
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.740
<v 0>His face on.</v>

49
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.400
<v 1>No, but I mean, imagine like, when there he's got permission to Jack you up,</v>

50
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.890
you know what I mean, Jocko, he's gonna Jack you up. Right?

51
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.470
Like he go out and raise an American flag out in the middle of the day,

52
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:02.410
just to start just to get some, get it going. He's a real deal.

53
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.620
So when we found out we were going out there, I was like, yeah.

54
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.520
But then in my head,

55
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.570
I was apprehensive because I had just had my kicked real bad and going back,

56
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:14.050
I mean, I had to go back out here in Texas, man, if you get your butt whipped,

57
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.010
you go back in for more, when you can heal it up, did you feel that way? Yeah.

58
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.400
I had to immediately, immediately, I mean,

59
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.520
look at the fraternity I'm in and they never,

60
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.720
they never looked down on me because we, we went through buds together.

61
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.000
Bud stands for basic underwater, demolition seal training.

62
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:32.950
But it also means if you take everything away from us,

63
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:37.000
we're still buds because we survive in hell. And, uh,

64
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.050
when we went back out there, matter of fact, the first gunfight I ever got in,

65
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.130
I remember taking a knee and kind of sitting there and going, wait,

66
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:48.640
what in the hell am I doing here? I mean, it hadn't even been a year.

67
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.280
I couldn't even, I could barely walk. Really.

68
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.920
That's a whole other story altogether. But, um, w w we, anyways,

69
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.510
we got out of there and I remember we got back to the bay.

70
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.480
I'll tell you the story. We got back to the base of my new guys walked up to me.

71
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.830
It was our first gunfight and were like, Hey, I'll share. I was like, Hey,

72
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.500
how you guys doing? You good. I know you got into it. You didn't,

73
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.070
when you were supposed to do well done. And, and they were like, well, you know,

74
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.040
I was freaking out when the gunfire started, but then I looked up and you were,

75
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.360
you were calm and cool.

76
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.570
And you look back at us and you look forward and you look back and kind of made

77
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.480
a call. And we got out of there. It was smooth. And I was like,

78
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:25.120
keep thinking that brother. Cause when I, when that gunfire started,

79
00:04:25.121 --> 00:04:29.170
I took that knee. I was like, what the hell? I mean, I was,

80
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.840
it was just like that first fight. Like when you start getting beaten up again,

81
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.170
and then you realize like, wait a minute, I'm a fighter. And then I was like,

82
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:38.020
okay, well, let's go. And then I stood up and made the call,

83
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.260
but there are in any situation you go into,

84
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:45.220
there's going to be that kind of hesitation. I hear people all the time. Like,

85
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.100
man, I've been training so long for this, but I still have the fear.

86
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.070
And I was like, well, that's different. That's anxiousness.

87
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.340
It runs off the same gland, fear and anxiousness off of your adrenals.

88
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.740
So in the beginning you have fear because you're not trained.

89
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.410
But then as you train, then it becomes anxious.

90
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:02.290
So when that first punches thrown, that first bullet flies, it's like, oh,

91
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.380
let's go. There's, it's a switch. It has to be that way.

92
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.140
We don't want to walk around and gauge the whole time.

93
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.010
There has to be a trigger.

94
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.930
<v 0>So you can't be calm. You can't just be calm about it. Whereas you, you,</v>

95
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.880
that uncomfortable feeling, right.

96
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.650
Whether it's a fight or what you've gone through, it's it's,

97
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.760
you can become.

98
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.480
<v 1>So the difference in the ring and in a gunfight is that you have to talk,</v>

99
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.180
like you're not talking to the dude. You're beaten up that, Hey dude,

100
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:31.570
watch his punt. So with us, when it goes down, you're gonna find, you're like,

101
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:35.740
okay, we need to move this way. And that's why we train like that in that fight,

102
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.320
you got to learn how to communicate. And that's what kind of slows you down.

103
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.750
And it's we do it so much.

104
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.410
So here's the difference between the seals and everybody else in our training,

105
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.600
kind of one of the things is, is in the beginning,

106
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:50.230
they wear us out all day for weeks on end and they tire us out, keep us up.

107
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.750
And then they start training us. Then you get your pistol.

108
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.100
So you're completely exhausted. And when you learn like that it's muscle memory.

109
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.370
So when we get engaged, our enemy will start attacking us. And then they'll,

110
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.570
they'll be like, oh, I'm wearing them down.

111
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.860
And then they think that's a good thing. It's not, it's actually a bad thing.

112
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.740
Cause that's when we start to come up and that's, that's,

113
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.050
that's the separation in our training as they've switched it.

114
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.470
<v 0>I think that that's a lesson that people can,</v>

115
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.010
that if you can apply that to your life,

116
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.050
that you're anything good that you're going to do is going to make you

117
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:27.620
uncomfortable. Anything difficult, all of it, whether even,

118
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.250
even like when you have a child like the birth of a child, it's uncomfortable.

119
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:35.270
It's a weird moment. Whether you try a new thing in life,

120
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.900
where you move to a new place where you, when you any,

121
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:43.850
any new business venture you end to enter into everything you do,

122
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:46.340
that's difficult is going to make you uncomfortable.

123
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.770
And that's the only way to get ahead. That's it?

124
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.660
But the most extreme version of it that we can all learn from is war.

125
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.220
The most extreme version of is when the consequences are your,

126
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.360
your existence, the, you don't, you don't exist anymore.

127
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.343
If you fail.

128
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.730
<v 1>It's only uncomfortable cause you haven't been in it. Everything's like that.</v>

129
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.280
Getting dressed in the morning and doing everything. I mean,

130
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.263
it's the same thing.

131
00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.080
Imagine you had the capability of being trained in any scenario.

132
00:07:18.081 --> 00:07:19.970
It's whether or not you want to get in, you want.

133
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.760
<v 0>All of them, everything makes you uncomfortable. That's no.</v>

134
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.400
<v 1>Yeah. Cause I don't look at it as uncomfortable. Right. But yeah.</v>

135
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.220
Exciting. The fear and everything like, oh, all right.

136
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.590
Somebody told you that you were supposed to,

137
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.070
my mother had breast cancer here reasonably bad. And uh,

138
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.660
she had to go get the surgery and matriarchal family.

139
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:47.900
So when mom's sick, Melanie has to take care of all that. I I'm kind of a,

140
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.020
when it comes to her or whatever, um, I'm just, uh, I'm weak,

141
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.550
but she recovered with me. So when I got her home, I was like, man,

142
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.960
check it out. Pain is pain. When we go down in the gym and I'll work out,

143
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.500
chefs as hard as I can. Then that night, the next day, I'm a two day guy.

144
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:05.810
So the pain feels like my chest is being ripped out.

145
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.500
I feel like sometimes I work out so hard and I bleed not puke that I'm being

146
00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:13.160
torn apart. I love it because I know right after I get done with that,

147
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:15.950
I'm going to be stronger because I don't get battle weekend.

148
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.290
I get battle-hardened period.

149
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.100
I've had the bones knocked out of me on the ground, just crying.

150
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.420
But I knew that that was just sharpening me. I was like, here's,

151
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:28.340
what's going to happen. We're going to go. I'm putting you under the knife.

152
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.200
You'll wake up the next morning and be sore.

153
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.490
And you're going to lay up for a week.

154
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.820
