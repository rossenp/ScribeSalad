00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.120
<v 3>I was nervous when people, when friends say I got a new show, you're like, oh,</v>

3
00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:07.954
I gotta watch this.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.760
Cause so many times you watch a friend show and it's not good.

5
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.840
Your show is good. It's a real solid sitcom. So thank you.

6
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.880
Thank and right outta the gate, it's solid, you know,

7
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.110
sitcoms take years to get their leg, at least a few episodes,

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.390
but right outta the gate, your show is very solid.

9
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.910
<v 1>I wish you knew how hard it was for me to text you to ask you to watch it.</v>

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.750
I text, I, I typed the text and I was like, oh, I can't.

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.830
Cause I know how honest you are. And, and then when I was like, I, I,

12
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.390
it took me months and I was like, but I gotta ask him. Cause I was like,

13
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.700
if Joe like it, then I feel like you, it was, it, it was a seal,

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.780
a solid foundation. And I was like, if I could just,

15
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.780
cuz I got already to watch it. He was like, he's really good. And I was like,

16
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.100
I just wanna see if Joe will watch it. And I know how busy you are. And I kept,

17
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.860
when I sent the text, I was like, oh my God, oh my God.

18
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.260
He's not gonna watch you now. And when I hit you back a and he was like,

19
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.020
I'm in the middle of your REIA. What are the?

20
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.300
That word you use you somewhere where, what, what birds don't have,

21
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.770
but they still fly. You was on vacation. Where was I? Somewhere? Rich people go,

22
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.810
birds don't have.

23
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.770
<v 0>Wings, but they still fly. What kinda riddle is this? &lt;laugh&gt; what the?</v>

24
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.330
It's called a crackhead. That's the song? Riddle don't have wings.

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.690
<v 1>They don't fly. I just that's what you. You was saying can't</v>

26
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.480
heavily place. I can't okay. I was on vacation. You was on vacation.

27
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.080
I think you said you was in the Meran I'm up the.

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.960
<v 0>Word. Oh, probably the Caribbean. Uh, it.</v>

29
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960
<v 1>Started with a M M mm. I don't know I was, I was so probably I don't.</v>

30
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.920
We was texting. So when and when you started to text me, like what you,

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.670
the jokes in the shots, you don't know how much air went outta my.

32
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.150
That day joke. &lt;laugh&gt;.

33
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.190
<v 0>It's a good show. I'm very happy. It's a good show. Very happy. It's rock solid.</v>

34
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.243
It really is.

35
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.550
<v 1>We worked out as something. Get it. It sure did.</v>

36
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.750
It was so hard with a comedy because to me,

37
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.310
comedy is so rehash and I feel like Hollywood is so outta ideal.

38
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.460
That's what we getting all these reboots that even with the pilot,

39
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.460
we went through that hand and toe to make sure you haven't heard it.

40
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.940
Original jokes, all original jokes. A lot of it is my standup.

41
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.140
And so that was another thing I was like, should I send you this? Oh,

42
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:19.020
his S opinion. And I asked you for your aunties opinion, you was like, oh pat,

43
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.340
I really don't want watch it because I don't like watching my friends. I said,

44
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:26.930
just watch the. You can't I've been shot. I've had gone real. I've been hit,

45
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.090
bought a freak thing. Give it to me, Joe, like hard Dick with no condom.

46
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.450
And so you, you text Beck and I, I immediately text him and say,

47
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.290
look what Joe Rogan said, I can't the N word. And I

48
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.880
Cause your podcast big. Oh, she said that he you.

49
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.720
But um, I immediately, you said.

50
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.560
<v 0>It in the past, on.</v>

51
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.640
<v 1>Here. Well, I, I text it. I said, look with Joe &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

52
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.600
I said, wake your black up, Joe RO like our show Joe.

53
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.720
<v 0>RO like our Joe. And like I said, it takes a while. Like when,</v>

54
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.240
when I did news radio, that was in the nineties,

55
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:10.960
it took like four or five episodes before the show really started finding

56
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.880
its way. Yeah. It takes a while.

57
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.200
<v 2>It does. It does. I like for, for, I, I first saw pat,</v>

58
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.590
like maybe I was a senior in high school.

59
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.030
I'm 26 now I was a senior in high school.

60
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.430
My dad had recorded her on this daytime talk show and he was like,

61
00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:29.110
you gotta watch Harry she's jewelry. She's yes. Harry jewelry, comic genius.

62
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.790
I remember that show. You were on that show. Yes. Yep. And she, she,

63
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.910
my dad was like, you gotta watch her. Like, she's hilarious.

64
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.310
Like you a lover you're lover her.

65
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.790
And so I sat down and watched and I just fell in love.

66
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.020
I like to do the type of comedy where it's like, you laugh over the pain,

67
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.780
you laugh over it, you laugh through it. And that's her life.

68
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.940
That's miss that's her brand. And so I was like, like whenever she gets a book,

69
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.740
I'm I'm gonna read that book. Like I'm gonna study it. That's gonna be my.

70
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.620
Then I got to college book came out. It was like $35. I couldn't afford it.

71
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.740
So I screenshotted. I was like, oh, I'm gonna come back.

72
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:00.210
And I'm gonna get this book in. I get some money,

73
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.570
never was able to get the book.

74
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.730
But I wrote this play called a NoMo that went to the public in New York.

75
00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:07.050
What's it called? Uh, it was called ain't NoMo. Uh,

76
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:09.970
and it was at the public theater and uh, Lee, Daniel saw it.

77
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.570
And after he saw it, he was like, Hey, uh,

78
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.410
we're trying to do a TV show for this, uh, comedian. Her name is miss pat,

79
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.210
but we don't really have a concept. Nobody really knows what they want to do.

80
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.520
So can you just read her book and see if you can come up with a concept for a

81
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:24.520
show? And I was just happy to get the book,

82
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.000
but I read it and I just felt in love.

83
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.440
And I immediately saw this sitcom in my head cuz I'm a,

84
00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:32.920
I'm a big fan of like old school sitcoms, like all in the family.

85
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.560
The Jefferson's good times with a live studio audience.

86
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.400
And I just felt like putting like her in this doll

87
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.110
of a sitcom and just burning all of it down hands.

88
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.910
<v 1>Son. &lt;laugh&gt;. You talking with your hands. God,</v>

89
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.670
Joe RO you can tell this how I talk.

90
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.550
<v 2>Express. I'm a homosexual. We talk with our hands.</v>

91
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 1>Is that what he's doing? Yeah, he hands that's what? I guess it's a, it's a,</v>

92
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.540
it's a mating call when it's a mating.

93
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.540
<v 2>Call Dick. It's.</v>

94
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.980
<v 1>Moving Dick. You listen, Dick &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

95
00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.300
<v 0>I'm learning so much today. Birds who fly with no wings.</v>

96
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.820
This is how you get Dick. Yes.

97
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.603
<v 1>He young.</v>

98
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.970
<v 0>For you to be 26 and to create a show is pretty amazing.</v>

99
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.290
<v 1>It was a ride. Just listen. When Lee first brought me,</v>

100
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:35.330
brought this kid to me and uh, I'm honest and I,

101
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.050
and I know Hollywood is full of and it's so hard to get people in the industry,

102
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.920
not to sound like a talking te everybody say the same thing. And I was just,

103
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.120
I have to break him down either. You be honest with me or I don't with you.

104
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.000
So when I met him and Lee was like, oh, I got this kid.

105
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:53.960
He fell outta heaven and da, da, da. And I'm like, okay, Lee.

106
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.680
And he told me I'm in, I'm in Utah. So performing, he said, get your on a plane.

107
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.080
You gotta go. See the players said last night. I said, uh,

108
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.200
I don't know if you know how this work, but I'm a comedian.

109
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.280
I don't get paid till tomorrow. And I ain't going, no,

110
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.920
God where I need my little pennies. Okay. So they put me on a plane.

111
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:14.000
I flew over to watch him and I pick up me. I deal with people with spirits,

112
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.270
your energy. I can just tell if you a, a good person.

113
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.430
I can tell when is gonna happen. And when I met him, I said he could do it.

114
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.990
And the first thing I did, I called him and I said,

115
00:06:24.991 --> 00:06:28.430
they're never gonna give you this job. He said, police say they gonna hire me.

116
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.590
I said, no, they're not. He said, why you say that? I said,

117
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:34.550
because you ain't never did. And they don't understand Hollywood. Want what?

118
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:38.260
Everybody else's want. Yeah. They don't want you, somebody else don't you.

119
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.860
Ain't bust your booty help. I mean, &lt;laugh&gt; that out? Take that.

120
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.380
<v 2>Out. That's right. Keep it there. Keep it in there. Hollywood don't want you.</v>

121
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.580
<v 1>I didn't know. I didn't mean to say that.</v>

122
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.500
<v 2>It's true. You did mean to say it. They said, you trying to get me. No,</v>

123
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.980
I'm trying to get you elevated.

124
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.450
<v 1>They, they don't want you, somebody else done you. It's true.</v>

125
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.210
And as soon now he got all kind interviews, but I sign him down and I said,

126
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.171
they you're gonna hear,

127
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:07.130
they're gonna take you to fancy dinners and try to blow your mind. I said,

128
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.810
if you listen to a real like me, we can do this. I said,

129
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:14.970
now I'm gonna be honest with you. Lee's busting his to get this job for you.

130
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.850
I said, but while Lee's busting his to get you this,

131
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.880
let me show you how to get this job. He said, what I gotta do. I said,

132
00:07:20.881 --> 00:07:22.960
let's write a pilot behind these back.

133
00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.640
And I started to tell him what the other two writers, one listened to me on.

134
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.480
And he listened. And we wrote that about eight days.

135
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.000
So when we finished it, I said, he put his name on it. I said, take your name.

136
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.953
&lt;laugh&gt;.

137
00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.230
<v 2>Which I was like, what? What?</v>

138
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.263
Cause?

139
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.910
<v 1>And lemme tell you why I'm a hood. I'm a hood. I mean, I'm, I, I,</v>

140
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.470
everything for me come from the knowledge that I got from streets. Okay.

141
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.390
You can never outsmart me because I'm Fu you might get spell a word. Right? But,

142
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.830
I got Google and two daughters with a college degree. So I get your,

143
00:07:58.831 --> 00:08:02.900
as on that too. So I told him, I said, take your name off it. He's like why?

144
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.100
I said, because if they don't like it, they're not gonna give you the job.

145
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.180
But if I tell 'em I did it, I'm the star of the show. They gonna, oh, miss pat,

146
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:13.260
throw that in trash. Can we gonna get you a writer? So what we did,

147
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.660
he took his name off for. I said, well, you, I said, one thing you,

148
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:18.140
ain't never gotta worry about me doing is stealing from you.

149
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.970
I I'm not that type of person. I said, I, what the? I look like stealing.

150
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.210
These people know, I can't spell all this correctly. &lt;laugh&gt;.

151
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.730
<v 2>That's exactly. And that's exactly what she did.</v>

152
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.130
She called Lee and she sent it to Lee and Lee car and said, who the wrote this?

153
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.810
And she said, she said, me. He said, no, you didn't. Cuz everything spelled.

154
00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:37.644
Right. &lt;laugh&gt;

155
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.600
that's what he said. And I said &lt;laugh&gt;.

156
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.120
<v 1>And that's when I said,</v>

157
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.680
me and Jordan wrote and you wanna hear something so crazy.

158
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.080
So this kid just graduated college. Right? And he, Lee was like,

159
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:56.600
just drop outta college. You gonna be in, I said, don't you drop outta college.

160
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.480
So I asked him, I said, do you have found a draft? He was like, no, he's PO.

161
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.000
He said, I don't have final a draft. I said, take my credit card,

162
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:03.880
take my debit card,

163
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.840
go buy you some grocery and buy final draft all why imagine had me

164
00:09:08.841 --> 00:09:12.080
interviewing, write Joe, me and him. I said, yep. Right. Right.

165
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:14.440
They got me another interview. Right. Right, right.

166
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:19.990
<v 2>Yeah. But like, what's funny though. Yo, is that like, she, she like,</v>

167
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.590
it was, it was something I was talking about this yesterday. I was like,

168
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:27.070
it takes a lot to earn Pat's trust in that sense, because she was literally,

169
00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:31.070
it was like, she was entrusting me with her comedy and her story. And so like,

170
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.510
it was funny where like, I,

171
00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.750
I would write a draft of something and I would send it,

172
00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:38.900
I in it over to her and she'll read it. She'd be like, why you got me cussing?

173
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.660
I said, &lt;laugh&gt; Cause that's how you talk.

174
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.340
She said, I don't mother talk like that. Take that out. &lt;laugh&gt; I said,

175
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.020
that's how you talk. And I was like, we have to do a new kind of sitcom.

176
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.940
I wanted to do something where it's like, you could just be yourself. Yeah.

177
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:55.380
You know? Cause you look at all those old shows,

178
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.130
you look at San and some with red Fox or even the richer pry show that he had

179
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:00.610
for like three seconds. And it's like,

180
00:10:00.611 --> 00:10:03.010
imagine if he was just allowed to be himself. Right, right.

181
00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:05.730
That show would've last forever. You know what I mean? San and son.

182
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:11.210
<v 0>Red Fox got as close as you can get on a network television show to be</v>

183
00:10:11.211 --> 00:10:11.510
in red.

184
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.090
<v 2>Fox. Yep. Exactly. That as you can get.</v>

185
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.480
<v 0>Exactly. But they don't do those anymore. They scared.</v>

186
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.360
<v 1>Scared. And when he came to me and he said, well, actually,</v>

187
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:23.120
after we wrote the pilot, they immediately gave him a job.

188
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.720
After we wrote the pilot, they was like, this kid can write. And I told him,

189
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.640
I said, see, I know the I'm talking about because Hollywood is so strict.

190
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.400
They scared to step outside the box. They're gonna give you the same old.

191
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.760
We need a black writer.

192
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.830
Well that black writer might not underst what the miss pat trying to do.

193
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:41.030
And I went through a few that did not understand what I was trying to do with

194
00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:46.030
him. We, we, I took him and I said, if you just listen, we can create something.

195
00:10:46.031 --> 00:10:48.910
Just listen to these stories. I just need you to put the in the right form.

196
00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.870
And he did. And he got the job. Watch.
