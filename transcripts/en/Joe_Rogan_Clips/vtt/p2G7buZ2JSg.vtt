1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. This is a, oh,</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.240
do we even introduce you properly? No.

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.410
Okay. That was Justin.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.690
I think we did introduce it to Mike Tyson.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.260
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen. No, these guys,</v>

6
00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:22.100
because I'm a Greenbrae and I got hurt. And you saw the show last night.

7
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:26.390
So I'm speaking at the shows cause a sturgeon is, well, let me back up.

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.250
I got blown up in March and I was in the hospital. Previous year.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.750
I'd come off of a deployment,

10
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.170
had like 11 months before the second one was a bit down in the,

11
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.670
down in the dumps, got divorced, had a dude die in the first trip.

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.340
So it was kind of like Lou was real rough to deal with.

13
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:47.270
And then it was listening to these dudes quite a bit and then led into the next

14
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:52.040
deployment. I was there month. Boom almost died, pretty hard. Um,

15
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.070
teammate saved me and, uh, we had blood on the ground. Like I got blood on,

16
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.490
on target. And then they made a hellacious movement to get me to the medivac,

17
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.880
long story short, I'm eating dinner in the hospital.

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.880
One of the first meals jamming out to these dudes. And I was like, mom,

19
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350
I want wanna, I want to meet Sturgill Simpson.

20
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.460
And then she tried to get ahold of them. So calm eventually did.

21
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.530
And he came, hung out for like two hours. Uh, I made,

22
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.320
uh, my friend now general Baudette wait,

23
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.620
like 15 minutes so that we could finish talking about what we were talking

24
00:01:24.621 --> 00:01:27.020
about, which when you're, when you're an enlisted dude,

25
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:31.130
you don't make generals Wade. But I was on a lot of ketamine sows. It was sweet.

26
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.040
But, uh, then, uh, Stargell had it,

27
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.880
had it on his own accord to like donate to the foundation.

28
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:42.410
So this little tour going on that coincides with the actual album release is

29
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.800
donating to the special forces foundation. So, um,

30
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:47.270
that helps gold star families,

31
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:51.560
which are the families that remained of the remainder of the friends that got

32
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:53.450
killed on this trip. Uh,

33
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.470
so there were four green Berets into EOD techs and uh,

34
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.720
so that money's going to them and that's, that's what I care about.

35
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.430
I don't like I'm alive.

36
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.850
I don't have any legs below my knees for those that can't,

37
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.250
I can't see my legs on the video anyway, but,

38
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.300
and I don't have my testicles either. So that's a different set of challenges,

39
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:18.380
but I don't care about getting taken care of other than the normal army

40
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:21.080
processes, but I want them to get taken care of from the foundation.

41
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.190
So I'm grateful to have these guys as friends now. They're awesome.

42
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.830
They're amazing musicians, but amazing people.

43
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.430
And then I'm grateful to be here and just to push that out.

44
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.740
So people that are coming to the shows,

45
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:38.120
all that money goes to the foundation and then people can go on the foundation's

46
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:43.100
website, which is special forces foundation.org. And, uh,

47
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.050
yeah, I appreciate it. That's awesome, man. That's really.

48
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.560
<v 2>Really, really cool. That's really cool that you're doing this. And um,</v>

49
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.610
and thank you for coming here and telling everybody is, you know, this is, um,

50
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.250
it's a great way to, it's a great way to help out and,

51
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.930
and your music, you know, to, to connect it to that.

52
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.430
I think that's, that's just a incredible thing. It's really cool. You know,

53
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:11.530
when you sending me the text messages telling me that you were going to the

54
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:16.320
hospital, you know, it's, it's very touching it's.

55
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.620
It was like, uh, yeah.

56
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.963
<v 3>Yeah, you were.</v>

57
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.130
<v 2>You know, you could tell you were seriously moved by this and you know,</v>

58
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:29.160
for someone like you truly understands the consequences of war,

59
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.040
like the physical consequences in a way that none of us will understand,

60
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.880
you know, it's, it's very, not just,

61
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.890
it's brave of you to talk about this, but it's also, it's so, so valuable,

62
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.210
so valuable for everybody that hasn't served to,

63
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:48.930
to understand what it really is. So thank you for that. Well.

64
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.590
<v 1>I always say I really like combat cause I was in a lot of it. Uh,</v>

65
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.440
relatively speaking, a bunch of guys have been in way more combat.

66
00:03:55.441 --> 00:03:57.930
Bunch of people treated more casualties. I'm a medic,

67
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.650
but I was in a fair amount, almost got killed on the first trip,

68
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:06.030
a good handful of times. And then, uh, so I just don't like the war aspect.

69
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:10.710
When you see your friends get killed and uh,

70
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.070
you're stuck in a hospital bed on top of all this stuff. That's, you know,

71
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.010
I didn't for a week. I blood for a week.

72
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.460
I've had tons of nights of excruciating pain.

73
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.760
That's the life of an amputee or they're guys that are worse than me.

74
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:26.730
So I'm just grateful for having what I have. And uh,

75
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.510
yeah, that's the beginning of it. Like,

76
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.360
especially on ketamine when you're going through all that.

77
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:36.150
And you're just like I was telling like the people that took the trash out in

78
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.220
the room, like, Hey, I'm grateful for it. Your brother like.

79
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.650
<v 4>Shred on brother. What.</v>

80
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.270
<v 2>Is, uh, what is ketamine like after a catastrophic injury like that?</v>

81
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.130
Does it relieve the pain? Does it just put you in another dimension?

82
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.840
<v 1>So ketamine is, uh, an MDs sucker. Yeah. Ketamine is, uh,</v>

83
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.070
an NBA antagonist and the brain. So essentially is a dissociative.

84
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:00.210
So the way that it feels,

85
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.490
because we learned this in class as a medic and everything,

86
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.430
but the way that it feels is kind of,

87
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.420
it takes your perspective. And it's like,

88
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.540
it always felt like a whirlwind when they, if I was getting a push of it,

89
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.340
but things it's like, you're starting to get your vision masked and, uh,

90
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.640
you're present. You're still there, but you're dipping into like subconscious,

91
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.480
cause you're still conscious because unconscious would mean that you're like you

92
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:28.680
pass out and you can not have a gag reflex depending on how unconscious you are.

93
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:32.250
So, uh, ketamine,

94
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.130
I would close my eyes and immediately tripped the most insane balls that you

95
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:40.530
could imagine and open them and it'd be back in the room and I'd be like,

96
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.680
what the? Whoa. And then a friend of mine, uh,

97
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.600
when I left my first rotation,

98
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.410
he was an air force CCT that got blown up in the same village.

99
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.300
I had a few casualties in, uh, he stepped in ID,

100
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.800
he's an above the knee, some missing fingers. But when he was ketamine,

101
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.190
when he was awake and looking around, he'd see the walls on fire.

102
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.520
And then there'd be like women like white pale skin in the corners,

103
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.460
peeling the skin off their back. And he was like, I was like, do that.

104
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.120
W like whatever, I don't know.

105
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.580
It must be like someone's psychology when they go in like set and setting type

106
00:06:15.581 --> 00:06:20.440
thing. But I was in it when I got a lot of ketamine. My legs were blown off.

107
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.480
I'm getting worked on, I'm telling dudes how to treat me.

108
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.040
I cut my own shirt off and then I get the ketamine and I'm like in and out.

109
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.370
And I see these visions back and forth. And like I was convinced,

110
00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:32.680
I was that are two distinct moments. I was like,

111
00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:36.040
I'm not going to make it and had that conversation. So,

112
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.340
and what's surreal about this right here is that you were talking to

113
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:49.870
him on this show and you guys talked about combat medics, and you were like, ah,

114
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.740
and I just sing in key. And I was like, right on there talking about me.

115
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.150
And then I got all kinds of jacked up,

116
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.190
makes you appreciate, makes you appreciate life.

117
00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.450
And I've gone through a huge development last year through depression.

118
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.760
And then this year after this blast of like being grateful and like

119
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:17.020
do an introspection and communicating and having empathy for other people and

120
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:18.400
being kind of a passionate human,

121
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.990
which general Mattis has told us a group of us on the way back from my first

122
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:24.310
trip. It's like,

123
00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:27.850
don't let this experience of war make you more hateful human being because

124
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:29.020
people haven't experienced it.

125
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.730
And let it allow yourself to go through post traumatic growth and become a

126
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:38.590
better human being and treat other people like you want to be treated and treat.

127
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.770
And I would add on to that, which came from Tim Ferris,

128
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.140
treat yourself the way you treat other people too.

129
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.010
<v 2>Not a side of madness that you ever hear in the press. Huh?</v>

130
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.050
I suppose not that thing that would be very valuable for people.

131
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:55.060
They know that he thinks that way. That's a,

132
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.500
it's a very powerful way to view this inevitable,

133
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.990
the inevitable consequences of it or.

134
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.120
<v 1>That that started scraping me off the bottom to focus on that</v>

135
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.640
after that trip. Yeah. Academy.

136
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.890
<v 2>Is a weird one because, um,</v>

137
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.070
a lot of people do it recreationally and apparently they,

138
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.720
they blast off and go into other dimensions and and they go into keyholes and I

139
00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:25.390
never did it. I never tried it. I knew a dude who died from it.

140
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.320
He was really into it. It's doing it a lot. W what happened?

141
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.770
I don't like an infection. He, I know he, um,

142
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.530
he probably was doing a bunch of other things as well,

143
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.730
but he was getting treated for ketamine for addiction.

144
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.290
And then he wound up tying.

145
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.520
<v 1>You can dose the at academy. Yeah. You couldn't, it doesn't kill you.</v>

146
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.800
You can give a kid 300 megs of it and they will trip

147
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.140
balls, but they are going to, they're not going to die.

148
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.350
It's like the opposite of all the other drugs.

149
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.330
<v 2>I think he was doing other too.</v>

150
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.180
I think the ketamine was just something he was treated for.

151
00:09:00.181 --> 00:09:04.530
I think he was doing a bunch of speed and stuff too, which, uh,

152
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.680
it's um, ketamine was originally like,

153
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:11.000
isn't it a cat tranquilizer or something like that. They give it to.

154
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:12.880
<v 0>My wife's best. Friend's a veterinarian.</v>

155
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.010
She definitely is like Jack and animals with ketamine on.

156
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.220
<v 1>It's. It's increasing now in like civilian hospitals,</v>

157
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.510
we started as like a veterinarian drug, which, I mean, it works great.

158
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.930
And you combine it with some other stuff. Do you know who John Lilly is?

159
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.320
<v 2>No. John John Lily was the scientist that he was a pioneer in interspecies</v>

160
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:34.070
communication.

161
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.490
He did all this work with dolphins and he was also a big acid freak.

162
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:38.990
And he would like to take,

163
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:41.600
he would take acid and try to communicate with dolphins.

164
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.600
He allegedly give dolphins acid. He was a part of his long program,

165
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.300
tried to get dolphins to talk to him. But, uh, one of the things he invented.

166
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.090
<v 4>It was not a movie about there is altered states.</v>

167
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.730
<v 2>Altered states based a lot on John Lilly.</v>

168
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.940
Cause he invented the sensor sensory deprivation.

169
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.440
<v 4>And give the dolphins acid the movie, because.</v>

170
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.980
<v 2>It just was loosely based on him because in the movie,</v>

171
00:10:03.981 --> 00:10:07.670
the guy experiments with a bunch of different types of sensory deprivation

172
00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:11.270
tanks. And everybody knew that this guy, he was a legitimate doctor,

173
00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:13.580
a brilliant guy, but he was also a ketamine freak.

174
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.920
And one thing he would do is like you would take intramuscular, ketamine,

175
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.730
and then get into the sensory deprivation tank. Oh yeah. That'd be,

176
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.040
that's a double whammy week. Yeah. A double whammy. So is that stuff,

177
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.910
um, difficult to get off of, or do you have to worry about that? Is there, uh,

178
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.460
like a withdrawal symptom? The.

179
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.750
<v 1>Issue would be with the pain.</v>

180
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.960
It's like when you have something that's controlling some sort of level of pain

181
00:10:38.961 --> 00:10:41.570
and then coming off of that, you usually wean off of it.

182
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.520
But then a physical addiction issue,

183
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.020
you know, I should know the answer to that definitively, but as, as a medic,

184
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.980
but, uh, I haven't heard of anything that words card to come off of. They.

185
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:57.290
<v 0>Had you on other stuff way harder to come off. Oh yeah.</v>

186
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:01.670
<v 1>I was on methadone and uh, stodgill friends,</v>

187
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:05.090
shooter and Duff McKagan came to the hospital and Duff was like,

188
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.150
methadone is worse than heroin. Like,

189
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.140
cause it was GNR guys were rocking it in the eighties, but that was like,

190
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.130
I mean, one night, one week I dropped down 20 MIGS instead of the 10.

191
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.620
And it was like being a junkie, like for nine hours,

192
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:20.420
I was just like rubbing my legs. Like, whoa.

193
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.480
Cause they're just lit up with nerve pain.

194
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.840
It feels like there's daggers in your leg or some sort of electrocution.

195
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.730
And you look like on a movie with like someone cracked out or something.

196
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:32.960
I was just like rubbing my.

197
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.460
<v 2>We used to see these guys who would come into the pool hall.</v>

198
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.220
When I used to play pool in white Plains, they would come in,

199
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.400
there was a methadone clinic down the street and they were all heroin,

200
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.440
heroin people. And uh, my friend,

201
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:48.590
Johnny B would call them methadone aliens because they would come in and they

202
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:51.710
all had like this like sort of like dull shuffle to them.

203
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:54.790
They were all slowed down and I can never understand it. It was like,

204
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.440
I was like, is this like a culturally, like, did someone agree?

205
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.820
Did we make some sort of agreement? Like this is okay, this is, it's got,

206
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.730
you know, it's got some, some stamp of approval.

207
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:09.310
So we're accepting that they have to get methadone every day,

208
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:12.100
but they can't get heroin anymore. Why don't we just give them heroin?

209
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:15.460
Like is how much different is the methadone? Is the methadone get them high.

210
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.530
<v 0>With synthesize. So it's easier to control, but does it get them high?</v>

211
00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:24.300
I didn't have any effect while no, it's just fighting off the physiology.

212
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.090
So it just fights the physiology. They're not getting it.

213
00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:29.580
You'll never get highlighted the first time you spike or like.

214
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.360
<v 1>Narcotic. Yeah. For like the other, the adverse effects. Why don't.</v>

215
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.050
<v 2>People have like the best effects with like ibogaine and things like that when</v>

216
00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:37.884
it comes to.

217
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.370
<v 0>For getting kicking opiates? Yeah. I mean, if you want to go through that,</v>

218
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.910
I would say, you know, that would probably be your best,

219
00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.600
but it for a quick solution, if that's what you mean, like the methadone.

220
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.360
<v 2>Is like, it is actually bad for you, isn't it? Yes.</v>

221
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.750
<v 1>It your S I didn't sleep. I didn't have deep sleep for four months.</v>

222
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.620
And I was, I'd go to get in bed at nine,

223
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.420
not fall asleep till three in the morning.

224
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.610
<v 2>That with everything too. Yeah.</v>

225
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.700
<v 1>It's a pretty year.</v>

226
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.770
<v 2>And how long did it take to get you off of the methadone?</v>

227
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.400
<v 1>I mean, once you're off of it,</v>

228
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.550
that their doctors are saying that it stays in your adipose tissue,

229
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.440
which is your fat for like two or three weeks,

230
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.090
because I'd have random nights when I was off of it and just get lit up with

231
00:13:24.091 --> 00:13:28.650
nerve pain. And like, I'm getting hit with a hammer on my toes. Um,

232
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:33.240
so probably four to probably like six weeks of weaning that.

233
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.360
And then I waited another drug, Erica.

234
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.800
<v 0>I mean, for you, it had to feel, I mean,</v>

235
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.970
cause you were there at Walter Reed the whole time. You had to feel frustrated.

236
00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:46.500
But for some, I like my first time I came to see you and it was only what,

237
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:51.060
what a month after the blast at most.

238
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.560
So he was still in a lot of more pain than I could even

239
00:13:55.561 --> 00:13:59.430
comprehend somebody being in, you know, from nerve pain for like how many,

240
00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.080
how many surgeries on each leg?

241
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.540
<v 1>Uh, it's close to 30 surgeries total. Which, yeah.</v>

242
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.860
<v 0>Is it stable as in your back to where they taking?</v>

243
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:17.010
I mean, you, you described just man, I was just like, how can anybody, you know,

244
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.590
and then he was still, as he said, the first time we met,

245
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:23.100
he was highest giraffe balls on academy. But like I was,

246
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:27.000
I was profoundly impressed by even then,

247
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:29.040
like how clear-headed and articulate.

248
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.530
And I was obviously this guy's obviously brilliant. You know what I mean?

249
00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:35.100
Like you can just through the fog and awareness of everything going on in the

250
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:38.300
room, despite the faint, the pain, he was trying to pretend like he wasn't in,

251
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.170
I just, and then that place was full of guys like him and every,

252
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.840
and then when I went back, it's like all new faces, you know, these people.

253
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.380
But then when I went back, the second time I went see him,

254
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:55.340
was there a couple of days. And it was like, just in a matter of short time,

255
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:58.790
it was leaps and bounds and you're using the gym on one leg,

256
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:02.240
like busting out 20 pull-ups and everything, you know, it was just kinda like,

257
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.450
there's gotta be something we can,

258
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.950
anything you can do to help in whatever way. And these guys,

259
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.400
since I've known him, I've never once ever heard him ask for anything.

260
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.600
His only concerns were like for the families of the guys that,

261
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.670
that didn't make it, you know?

262
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.540
So that's just like really where around an album release.

263
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.160
If I'm going to have a bunch of attention on me,

264
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:28.940
I thought it would be a good opportunity to put attention on what other people

265
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:32.900
can do to help these guys and their families. Because you know, the sacrifices,

266
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.380
especially sitting in these rooms and looking at these dudes, man, I can't even,

267
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:38.743
you can't.

268
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.660
<v 2>You know, what, what do you, what do you call that? Yeah,</v>

269
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.970
well, I want to help. So, uh, after the show, let's, uh,

270
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.620
figure out what we can do to jump in. I want to, I want to help. So, uh,

271
00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.700
help with the podcast help with some comedy shows maybe to just whatever we can

272
00:16:00.701 --> 00:16:05.620
do. I appreciate that. Um, you know, listen, I'm blown away by all this.

273
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.300
As much as I think all these people are listening and watching this is, um,

274
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.770
it's beautiful that you're doing this man. And I think that, you know, I mean,

275
00:16:14.771 --> 00:16:16.360
it's inspiring me to do something.

276
00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.240
I think it's probably inspiring a bunch of other people. And that's, that's,

277
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:21.460
that's those things that people talk about.

278
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:25.450
One thing that you might experience or hear in life that sort of changes your

279
00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:29.350
worldview and moves you in a better direction. Like this is,

280
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.850
this could be one of those things, you know?

281
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.390
<v 0>Well, you're a good man. Yeah. Well, I'm not anything, man. He's</v>

282
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:41.050
so I'm just a dude.

283
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.500
<v 2>Well, you're just an awesome dude. All you guys. It's cool.</v>

284
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.930
I'm very happy that you're bringing awareness to this.

285
00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.230
I'm really happy that you do on that. It makes me feel great.

286
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.370
<v 0>And it's, you know, like Justin said that the worst side of it is the,</v>

287
00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.030
the tragedy, I guess. Um, so it's not like, you know, right or left.

288
00:17:01.031 --> 00:17:02.650
It's just like, this is the reality of it.

289
00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:06.730
And people are making these sacrifices for you. And then when they come home,

290
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:08.920
what do we do for them? You know.

291
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.020
<v 2>It's a hard thought for people to accept that war is inevitable.</v>

292
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:16.570
So a hard thought,

293
00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.320
and it doesn't seem like it's inevitable because it's not inevitable in this

294
00:17:20.321 --> 00:17:21.370
room. I mean,

295
00:17:21.371 --> 00:17:24.940
if we were the last people on earth and there was a bunch of food and places to

296
00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:27.940
sleep, I think we'd probably not kill each other.

297
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.010
We probably wouldn't go to war. Right. It's like,

298
00:17:30.011 --> 00:17:33.700
what is the number where you go to war? Is it a million? Is it 2 million?

299
00:17:33.701 --> 00:17:36.970
Is it separated by oceans? Is it just mountains are boundaries.

300
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:42.100
But the fact that no one thinks that war can be solved. Like no,

301
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.940
no one that I know thinks that in our lifetime there'll be no war.

302
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.280
Then there's never been a period where it's someone on earth, that's human.

303
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.720
Hasn't been going to war with each other.

304
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.640
It's a horrible truth of being a person.

305
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.690
And nobody, nobody knows it the way you do.

306
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.890
So for you to come on and tell your story the way you just did.

307
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.230
I appreciate the out of that, man. And

308
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.410
I would just want people.

309
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.240
<v 1>If, if, if they hear that and that moves them, it's more of like a,</v>

310
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.480
I could just be a grateful on a regular basis for what? For anything. Yeah.

311
00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.090
I mean, Steven Pinker was on your show.

312
00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:28.370
I ended up FaceTiming with him as a result of all this,

313
00:18:28.371 --> 00:18:31.210
but like he has that book about basically the,

314
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:35.060
the enlightenment worked and we still have war.

315
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.250
And then there are people still fighting it. Uh,

316
00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:42.260
but overall the world is continuing to improve and like steadily getting

317
00:18:42.261 --> 00:18:46.010
better. And fewer people are dying from genocide and war, but it still exists.

318
00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:50.150
So I would want the respect for war. If someone is wanting to go to war,

319
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.860
you know, if someone is going to be a commander in chief and that's it,

320
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:58.910
that's a heavy thing to like toss back and forth is extremely,

321
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.560
it means that I may never have kids cause I don't have my balls. You know? Like,

322
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.660
like that there's sacrifice. Like I, I,

323
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:10.250
and I'm the one that lived and I didn't have any kids,

324
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:14.930
but like my friends have four girls. My other, my other friend has three kids.

325
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.230
So like when you're, if you're going to move the chess piece to war,

326
00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:20.990
then we need to understand the implications of what that means and try to do

327
00:19:20.991 --> 00:19:22.550
everything in political power,

328
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:27.530
in state strategy to avoid over war because.

329
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.170
<v 0>It's especially near peer.</v>

330
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.400
You mean that's Russia or Russia, nuclear.

331
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.670
<v 1>War would be the worst thing. You know, it's a mess world, war three, mutually.</v>

332
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.600
<v 2>Assured destruction.</v>

333
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.110
It was the strangest thing on earth that we all have enough weapons pointed at

334
00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:44.540
each other to literally nuke every man,

335
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:47.720
woman and child off the face of the earth, many times over.

336
00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.430
And that's what keeps us from using them.

337
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.330
But yet we still have them and we still have them pointed at each other.

338
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.520
I mean, remember when you were kids and we were worried about Russia,

339
00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.280
do you remember that? I'm older.

340
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.570
<v 0>Guys. And I'm worried about people walking into target with a suicide vest.</v>

341
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:10.280
Yeah. Yeah. When's that coming, right? Yeah. You could all of it

342
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.200
because Europe's been dealing with that for decades. You know,

343
00:20:15.201 --> 00:20:18.830
we really haven't tasted that yet. I on a,

344
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.100
on a widespread habitual scale.

345
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.080
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>
