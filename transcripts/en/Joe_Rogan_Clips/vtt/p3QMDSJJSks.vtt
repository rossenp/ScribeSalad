1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.590
<v 0>Your mother was Maggie in there.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 1>No, no, my mom wasn't a header. Really? No, she wasn't a head.</v>

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.713
Which back the end of that

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.670
Very few people.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240
<v 0>And.</v>

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.420
<v 1>Uncle. No,</v>

7
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.150
very few people I tell you. Maybe my grandmother cracked me once, but it was,

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
you know, just like, get your together. Not like trying to hurt me, you know,

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.210
just a little smack. I didn't get beat as a kid, but, uh,

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.160
I saw a lot of violence. I saw that seeing violence when you're a kid,

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.510
there's something about like, seeing someone you're close to,

12
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:44.130
who's an adult being beating up like a 10 or 11 year old.

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.660
You ever see that before? When you see, when you see something like that,

14
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.700
you ever see a grown adult beaten the out of a 10 or 11 year

15
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.220
old when you're a little kid. Yes.

16
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.860
That to me was that was like a defining moment when I was a

17
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.190
little kid.

18
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.870
<v 0>As a parent, or I only saw parents beat that.</v>

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.270
<v 1>Yeah. I saw someone beat somebody else's kid.</v>

20
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.720
It was up to watch.

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.910
<v 0>When I lived on 2 0 5 west 88th street, we can't.</v>

22
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.730
When I came from Cuba, we lived in New Jersey for them. My dad died.

23
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.720
We moved to 89th street. Then something happened at the building.

24
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.940
We ended up moving to 88th street and they had a kid.

25
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:31.920
I had a beef with every day and one day I finally got my together in

26
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:32.754
karate.

27
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.420
Like one day on my side kick started working and that right cross started

28
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:42.900
working. I learned how to use my block.

29
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:45.990
And I finally had this kid, his name was Rudy, the Haitian.

30
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.720
He was the only Haitian kid in the neighborhood. We lived on 88th street.

31
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.970
I him up this day.

32
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.950
And his father came down and held my arms and he made Rudy punch me.

33
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.710
And I'll never forget that my lip was bleeding.

34
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.500
And he took me upstairs and he knocked on my mother's door.

35
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.880
And my mother opened up the door in the half a angle over. And she goes,

36
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:09.120
what's the problem. She goes show with Coco, you know? And he goes,

37
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:11.640
next time your son hits my son. I'm going to hit him.

38
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.200
Then I'm gonna come up and hit you.

39
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.810
And my mom turned around and got a butcher knife and chased Rudy's fall up the

40
00:02:18.811 --> 00:02:22.920
stairs. Cops came and the lady next door said she didn't see a knife.

41
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.890
But at that point we would done in the building. Jeez,

42
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.830
that was one of the worst there.

43
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.290
When I moved to north Bergen,

44
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.960
I saw parents that you don't like

45
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.520
living here. A comedian, go eat, hang out with why can't you have the house,

46
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.220
how they talk to their parents. I can never talk to them. You know,

47
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.240
that's the first thing I noticed when I went to Jersey, there was,

48
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.760
there was certain kids that would take that dish and go,

49
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.470
I don't want a fish sandwich. If I ever did that in my house,

50
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.040
Joe Rogan, are you kidding me? My mom would take the dish,

51
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.410
throw it against the wall and say,

52
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.380
now you're not eat and go to bed like that type of.

53
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.700
But I also saw a parrot in the hallway one day.

54
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.250
And I was standing in the way you all, with his arms crossed,

55
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.280
talking to the teacher the way I'm talking to you and a kid standing right here

56
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.080
with glasses on and I'm walking towards him. Like, you know,

57
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.120
I went to the bathroom. I'm like a hall pass and I'm talking,

58
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.220
talking, talking, and in the middle of it,

59
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:37.960
the father just going bam and hitting them with a backhand kick

60
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.450
goes down, glasses broke and blood coming out of the nose. Oh,

61
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.030
he's telling them to get the up before I kill you. You dumb.

62
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.490
Oh, you said that to him. You dumb. I have seen that. Oh,

63
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.000
that kid was the devil though. I knew that kid. Well, the reason why that.

64
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.280
<v 1>Kid Kim was the devil probably cause his dad.</v>

65
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.550
<v 0>Beat him. And then there was another kid. When I went to Catholic school,</v>

66
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.930
Weedo for all the Ginzo the whole thing,

67
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.360
bro. He would come that the nicest guy in the world,

68
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.010
but the son was crazy. And every time he get there,

69
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.580
the nun would tell him about what he did and dog,

70
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.300
he would punch him the way

71
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.690
on Gaia was throwing punches and God steep bay.

72
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.400
I swear to my mother's grave. As he was crawling into the car,

73
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.120
like frown, pounding them 12 Jesus,

74
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.090
I got thrown out of that 11 attack.

75
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.870
So now are you looking at me saying Joey,

76
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.270
did they deserve it or whatever? Everybody, every parent had a different,

77
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.520
uh, you know, I watched a couple of weeks ago,

78
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:56.260
I was stoned to the gills and I was laughing about how people put people down on

79
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.850
and. And I was laughing about when Julius serving first,

80
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:04.690
when the ABA shut down, when the ABA first shut down, if they were,

81
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.940
I don't know, Joe, but if there was eight categories,

82
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.450
Julius Irving's led seven of them. Right?

83
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.980
And the ABA shut down and the Sixers picked up Julia serving.

84
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:17.830
They gave him $6 million, which can you imagine that?

85
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.770
What they give that guy yet? What they give LeBron?

86
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.960
LeBron is getting about 30 or 40,

87
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.250
but yet he got $6 million over two years or something was Julius.

88
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:29.020
And he was the biggest player in the world.

89
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:33.430
And now this guy's getting 1 54 for three is Jesus.

90
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.200
So Dr. Jay switched his number from 32 to six and now the NBA all

91
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:40.990
star game came. So all the critics were like,

92
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.630
he came home from the ABA. He's gonna get his kicked from the NBA,

93
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.170
all star game. What? Go look at those statistics.

94
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.360
He went off. He went off because of a white dude named pistol,

95
00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:56.950
Pete Maravich. That is,

96
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.550
he went to LSU and led the country in scoring a white dude and ended up becoming

97
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:02.480
a Boozer.

98
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:07.460
But that dude knew how to handle the ball because his father would beat him.

99
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.080
His father would make him sleep in the garage in the winter and beat him until

100
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.860
he learned how to play basketball because there was no losing in his house.

101
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:19.340
Do you understand me, Joe Rogan? There's no losers,

102
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.120
house sleeping in the garage. No dinner

103
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.030
pistol. Pete knew how to dribble jacket pistol.

104
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.550
Pete would take your deep pistol. Pete could eat.

105
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.390
Anybody could cover by the best black dude in the league could cover pistol

106
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:38.720
Pete. But if you watch that NBA, all star game pistol,

107
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.580
Pete is stopping chopping people and give them behind the back passes to Julius

108
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.200
serving. He even looks at a dude at one path. He's looking at Bob McAdoo.

109
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.260
I'm coming. As long as they just push the ball between his legs.

110
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.000
And he gives it to Julius serving Jew. Why? Because that kid's father stayed on

111
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.030
there's different thoughts of.

112
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.300
<v 1>Some people can handle that. Some people can't though, like some,</v>

113
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.190
some guys have broken, but I mean,

114
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:08.000
it's like how much pressure is too much pressure to create like a superstar like

115
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:12.350
that. I didn't tiger woods. Didn't his dad put a lot of pressure on him as well.

116
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.300
<v 0>Talk about that. The guy that died last week, but.</v>

117
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.030
<v 1>That's a different thing I can tell. Well, the tiger would show Jackson.</v>

118
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.160
<v 0>What the is different about that?</v>

119
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.140
He created three kids to change the on one kid that changed the world,

120
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.850
right? He beat him. He them in the.

121
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.390
Supposedly I don't know he did sexual assault.

122
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.700
<v 1>I gotta be really careful with the same things.</v>

123
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.220
<v 0>I'm sorry. Listen. It's to me two things, things come out.</v>

124
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:39.650
What are you going to do? Everybody's getting the blame for something.

125
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.340
You know what I'm saying?

126
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.780
<v 1>But this is something you really heard.</v>

127
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.770
<v 0>I have, I've heard sexual abuse allegations from his father, but,</v>

128
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.480
but I listened to what? Listen to what, what did he create? What did he do?

129
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:54.710
What did Joe Jackson do by making them not let them,

130
00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.960
uh, and, and let me tell you something.

131
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:59.900
The one kid could have gone to a college to play basketball.

132
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.320
The kids had talent as it was Gary Indiana.

133
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.390
They would go to Carrie and then no, it's like, hell, uh,

134
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.610
uh, Delaware. And then Gary Indiana, you know,

135
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.590
saying like, Gary's like crazy. He made these kids rehearse.

136
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.800
He pulled them out of Gary, took them up to Barry Gordy.

137
00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.340
You know, you think about this.

138
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.730
Some of them probably hate him for what he did.

139
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.480
You look back at those lessons that you got Joe Rogan.

140
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:36.170
How many people did you look at one day and go you mother.

141
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.630
But then two years later,

142
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.740
you look back and you look at the lesson you learned from the whole experience

143
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.190
and you actually have to go back and hug that person and go, Hey man,

144
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.210
thank you for that time. And made me better today,

145
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.480
because what you did made me a better person.

146
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.390
We're not going to agree with everything that happens along the way.

147
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.420
It's all right, but it's made us who the we are.

148
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:06.570
<v 1>That's an interesting thing because we grew up in a time where kids were just</v>

149
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:10.320
allowed to run around outside. Everybody ran around outside.

150
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.450
That was just normal. Right? When you were a little kid, you ran around outside.

151
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.700
Nobody just runs around outside.

152
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.570
I remember the first time I saw a grown lady hit, she hit,

153
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:25.650
my cousin were both around the same age.

154
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.250
I was probably six and she was five.

155
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.150
And this lady slipped on ice in front of her apartment building.

156
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.850
And she got up and my cousin just unfortunately happened to be standing right in

157
00:09:38.851 --> 00:09:42.510
front of her when she fell and she got up and she said, don't you laugh at me?

158
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:45.900
And she smacked her in the face. She wasn't laughing at her either.

159
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:50.610
Just she smashed her in the face, man. Like it was, she smacked her hard.

160
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:54.810
And I was like, oh my God was that? I mean, we were both little,

161
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:59.430
