00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.270
<v 1>Experience. It just shows like, wow, this is wild. It's a wild sport.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.510
It's pretty exciting. One of the rounds of the normal length, three minutes.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.330
<v 0>Five rounds of three minutes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, exactly. It's.</v>

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.170
<v 1>Very similar to more time.</v>

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.440
<v 0>Yes. But then the crazy part, which my fights,</v>

7
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.670
I fought in a traditional literally rules is that you have an injury tab

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.810
and century, meaning that let's say you knock me out, Joe. And then I,

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.770
I have the pull me out of my ring and my corner. They slap my face.

10
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:31.890
They bite my ear. They pull whatever they want to make me up.

11
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.430
They want me to hear ear, but that helps you wake you up. Really hurts.

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.263
<v 1>Now.</v>

13
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.520
<v 0>They done that. Not to me. I never used it, but.</v>

14
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.860
<v 1>We'll do that. We'll pull the hair. Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.960
You've seen them bite each other's ears go.

16
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.340
<v 0>Just like the mumble them.</v>

17
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.870
<v 1>She won the ear a little.</v>

18
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.490
<v 0>Bit. Really? It hurts. No.</v>

19
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.890
<v 1>Well, I'm sure it hurts, but I mean, what about ice?</v>

20
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.930
It seems like that'd be a better way to wake you everything.

21
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.420
<v 0>Because let's say you have two minutes to get revived.</v>

22
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.120
<v 1>Okay. So you get Kao and the fight.</v>

23
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.840
<v 0>Two minutes to get revived. Why isn't the fight over? I don't know.</v>

24
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:04.440
That's the traditional back 2000 years ago. They want to give it another chance,

25
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.930
but the WLC, thankfully.

26
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.800
<v 1>God, that is so crazy. Yeah. WLC is eliminating that.</v>

27
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.120
<v 0>No without, and I'm good with that.</v>

28
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.100
If we want guys to have a career out of lightweight, right?

29
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.490
It's better for the brain. Oh yeah. A lot better. Yeah, because I've seen,

30
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.760
I think only seen one time. Actually. It was two women, uh, with,

31
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.530
I think Cyrus wait, actually, uh, you get the only guy, um, you know,

32
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.980
you get knocked out. He went back to his corner, got revived and won the fight.

33
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.960
Yay. One went by decision.

34
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.810
<v 1>And all, no decision Cyrus Washington's corner threw in the towel.</v>

35
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.450
Why don't you do bald pony tail. So funny, man,

36
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
is there a girl out there that guys only who are bald with ponytails? Sadly.

37
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:43.860
Yeah.

38
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.880
<v 2>Come on. Sadly, somewhat flux the ball ponytail guy. If he's at work,</v>

39
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.060
what's his, what's his game money.

40
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.730
<v 1>Speaking of ball ponytail. Did you see what happened in the game?</v>

41
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:54.930
When LeBron's hair fell off?

42
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.570
<v 2>I, somebody showed me a photo, but I thought that looks so.</v>

43
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.730
<v 1>Real. It's real. It looked at the guy is a billionaire. He's a,</v>

44
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.970
a God amongst men. He's a giant,

45
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:10.020
super athlete with a really well shaped head. What the, man. Shave your head.

46
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.400
Shave your head. Pull.

47
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.380
<v 2>Up that picture. Cause I want to see the. He's got.</v>

48
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.490
<v 1>Some nonsense glued on his head. That's like not his hair. Look at that.</v>

49
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.840
Look at that. He's his hair moved up and someone had to tell him. So is there.

50
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.410
Oh, thanks bro. So you get the bandana back in place.

51
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.200
His hair moved. Wait, why does he got some glued on his head, bro?

52
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.120
The guy he's handsome. He's a superior physical specimen.

53
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.380
LeBron's hair falls.

54
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.213
<v 2>Out during games.</v>

55
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.500
<v 1>Full screen, full screen.</v>

56
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.390
<v 2>Disappearing. A any Davis is telling him, Hey dog, your hair's up.</v>

57
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.580
Your hair fell off dog. Oh, he did tell him, Hey.

58
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.780
<v 1>Oh, he's pointing to someone's up? What's your hair? He's laughing.</v>

59
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.660
Are they friends? Yeah. He's the only guy. So I was telling you,

60
00:02:57.661 --> 00:02:59.680
he's the only guy on the team that could probably tell that anybody else would

61
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:03.760
get traded immediately playing. It was was here. Oh. Oh.

62
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.450
At night last night he didn't have the headset on. Let me fix it up. Nice.

63
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.590
Oh God.

64
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.390
<v 2>He did have the headset on. No did not.</v>

65
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.130
<v 1>Last night, but that's nonsense. What's going on with his hair.</v>

66
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.020
<v 2>Hey, someone wants your hair. Yo dog.</v>

67
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.820
<v 1>He's laughing. Yo dog got to fix that. Just so weird. Like why would,</v>

68
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.770
why does he want to deal with that? You know what it is?

69
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.060
Cause he hasn't accepted it yet.

70
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.080
<v 2>Yeah. But also he's still young. He's 35, 35.</v>

71
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.940
But in his mind he's like, am I going to still be the young guy? You know,

72
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.340
but shave your it's like John Siena grew his hair out.

73
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.910
Now I saw him on a billboard and he has long hair and he always had like short

74
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.983
military cuts.

75
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.350
<v 1>Well, he's trying to be a family man.</v>

76
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.460
Now you were talking about the movies he's doing now.

77
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.140
<v 2>Like a kid's firefighter movie or some. Oh, come on, dude.</v>

78
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.830
<v 3>Just kind of, he always seemed to accept the fact that he was like, oh, um,</v>

79
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.990
this is that I'm a genius at this. All right. Well.

80
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.900
<v 1>Differently. Um, he would do, I mean,</v>

81
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:03.470
he was probably the most prolific big name guy of all time. And he,

82
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.570
he actually inspired Louis CK to do a new hour every year because that's what he

83
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:11.140
did. Carlin. George did a new hour every year.

84
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.640
And part of the reason.

85
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.520
<v 3>Why he did that was 175 nights a.</v>

86
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.370
<v 1>Year. That's crazy. But part of the reason, why is he owed a lot of money?</v>

87
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.130
Did he, uh, I don't know how that.

88
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.650
<v 3>In his book, last words he talks about.</v>

89
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:27.760
Like he bought a jet and sometimes he would get a jet. He in the seventies,

90
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:32.290
he was that huge. He bought a jet and he would sit on the runway in long island,

91
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.600
um, at a, at a, uh, LaGuardia. Yeah. And uh,

92
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.310
just do Coke in the plan. His book, last words is amazing.

93
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.040
They published it posthumously,

94
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:49.210
but he was working on it with Tony Hendra before he died. He was so awesome,

95
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:53.560
man. Like I think about them all the time. Anytime I jump on stage. Cause we,

96
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.310
every night after reboot, we get up on stage and work the crowd and stuff.

97
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.710
<v 1>Yes. Say hello to him once that was it. Yeah. I met him at the comedy store.</v>

98
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.460
It was very friendly, said hi to everybody said hi to the door guys. Hey said.

99
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.480
<v 3>Hi to me. Hey.</v>

100
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.830
<v 1>George. No, he didn't know who the I was. He had no idea just said hi. I said,</v>

101
00:05:11.831 --> 00:05:14.410
Hey man, how you doing? That's it? That was our thing.

102
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.220
<v 3>I have, uh, I, I mean, I worked with him a few times in the movies and stuff.</v>

103
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.690
He, one of my favorite memories of George Carlin is we go see him, um,

104
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.210
do a show, me and Chris rock. It was me and my wife,

105
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:27.970
Jen and Chris was married to his wife.

106
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.500
My at that point and George was playing at Caesars in Atlantic city.

107
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.640
And so he's like, I got seats for you guys up front and stuff. So, you know,

108
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:39.430
rock was like, had his role with the new,

109
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.170
he was like at the height of his game and.

110
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.850
And so we go see the show and Carlin had a bit where he, uh,

111
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.680
it was like people I could do without like guys named skip like that.

112
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.700
And one of them was, uh, people I could do without, uh, uh,

113
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.510
any man over the age of 12 who wears their baseball cap backwards.

114
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.490
So, you know, long before I met him, I'd always see that bit and be like, ah,

115
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.830
so the night we're at the show, he's up there doing it bit. And uh,

116
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.790
and you know, he's like a, another person I could do without Kevin.

117
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:16.970
You're exempt from this guy's over the age of 12,

118
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.690
whether a baseball cap backwards and rock,

119
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.040
like my eyes lit up and rocks next to me. And Rocco's he knows who you are,

120
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.420
even though like we'd work together on the movie. It was so an.

121
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.463
<v 1>Exempt though.</v>

122
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.130
<v 3>Uh, for the, for the show because I was there kind of snack.</v>

123
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.100
<v 4>But you know, if you've got a similar story coming up, coming out of Iran,</v>

124
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:39.980
for example, who's not a us ally or they love to go after a Maduro.

125
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.030
And I'm not saying he's a good guy,

126
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:43.480
but they go after Maduro because he's not a U S allies.

127
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.680
They could harp away on all the negative things about him,

128
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.230
but we're not having a conversation about Jamal Khashoggi.

129
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:52.130
We're not having a conversation about people being beheaded in the public square

130
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.230
for stuff like sorcery, Joe.

131
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.760
They kill people in Saudi Arabia for sorcery and witchcraft and drug smuggling

132
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.300
and apostasy. If you don't think God is real, and you say that in Saudi Arabia,

133
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.850
they could kill you. They could cut your head off in the public square.

134
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.050
And we had to like killing people.

135
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.240
<v 1>For sorcery. Really? Yes.</v>

136
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.610
<v 4>They're killing people for sorcery. It's great.</v>

137
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.640
<v 1>The Khashoggi thing is super disturbing because it seems like everybody's like,</v>

138
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:20.360
well, what are you going to do? Well, what are you gonna do? I know. I mean,

139
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.070
it would have been cleaner if they just made him have some sort of heart attack

140
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.190
or an accident or something along those lines possible.

141
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.840
<v 4>Deniability in any way, the way.</v>

142
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.280
<v 1>They did it, it's almost like this guy wanted them to do it a certain way.</v>

143
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:39.830
He wanted them to chop this guy up and put them in bags and deliver them out of

144
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:42.920
the country and suitcases and or whatever the they did.

145
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.440
However they got rid of them. You know, it's,

146
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.070
it's such a disturbing decision that they made. Yeah.

147
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.990
<v 4>And they know they're going to get away with it. And again,</v>

148
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:52.010
this is what happens, right?

149
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.800
<v 1>It's been over a year. They have, they absolutely have any, when was the murder?</v>

150
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.680
<v 4>How long ago I won last time I was on the podcast. We spoke about it.</v>

151
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:00.680
And last time I was on the podcast was a year ago. So it was over a year ago.

152
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.040
<v 1>And it's just whatever.</v>

153
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.660
<v 4>Again, if you dare our ally, that means, I mean, they really do.</v>

154
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.720
There's so much business that goes on between the U S and Saudi Arabia and the

155
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:14.510
weapons deals and everything that the argument Trump,

156
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.020
Trump actually made this argument in the white house sitting next to, you know,

157
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.590
the, the Saudi crown prince. He's like, they're, they're buying so many weapons.

158
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:23.210
It's so tremendous. The weapons they're buying.

159
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.790
And he holds up like the pictures of this from Raytheon.

160
00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:28.370
And this is what he's getting. This is from Boeing. This is what he's getting.

161
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.390
And it's like, oh my God. Imagine for a second. It's anybody like,

162
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.800
imagine it was a deal like that with Kim Jong-un. He's like, we're selling Kim.

163
00:08:36.801 --> 00:08:39.710
Jong-un these tremendous weapons, right. As today,

164
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.520
who I didn't see if Kim Jong-un.

165
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.350
<v 1>Young and threatened us today. I think they, I was waiting to show you this. Oh,</v>

166
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.070
you got here. Saudi Arabia is anti witchcraft unit breaks.

167
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.930
Another spell what the unit established in 2009 is charged with

168
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:58.590
apprehending sourcers and reversing the detrimental effects of their spells

169
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.030
in the Gulf country. Let me see the picture, scroll up for the picture.

170
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.600
Oh my God. That looks like Baghdad. Bob,

171
00:09:06.601 --> 00:09:10.590
you remember Baghdad Bob from, from the Iraq war where like,

172
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.350
when I rack was getting slaughtered, he was like, everything's great.

173
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.350
Iraq's kicking. Remember that? Yes, I do remember that.

174
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.740
It was like their ministry of propaganda guy. Yeah. Yeah.

175
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.170
It's like on my Chalabi, the guy who they want it to be the, uh,

176
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.610
when the severed head of a Wolf wrapped in woman's laundry turned up near the

177
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:30.020
city of how do you say that? I have no idea in Northern,

178
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.320
Northern Saudi Arabia this week,

179
00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:34.890
authorities knew they had another case of rich witchcraft on their hands,

180
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.520
a capital offense in the ultra conservative desert kingdom.

181
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.800
Is that really what it is? Is that conservative?

182
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.400
<v 5>It was what my body was responding to against malaria.</v>

183
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.210
The first time I lost 33 pounds in five days. And so I was vomiting,

184
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.600
red and green blood and bile. I lost most of my hearing.

185
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:53.790
My peripheral vision started disappearing.

186
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.900
I had some called Blackwater fever where my urine was literally as dark as that,

187
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:01.680
that black clock, um, take pictures of it. And I didn't,

188
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.550
I should probably should have it freaked me out. Uh, five days I didn't urinate.

189
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.700
And then when I finally did, if you Google, uh, Blackwater fever, one in four,

190
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.220
one in two people that get it, they die. You didn't urinate for how many?

191
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:18.570
Five days, five days I couldn't pee. Oh my, um, they were trying to, uh,

192
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.100
get IVs in me. My veins were collapsing. Oh, geez. Um, so that was,

193
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.780
that was pretty brutal. Um, but yeah, man. So, uh,

194
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.800
I'm getting my health better there. Cause I do want to fight again, if it can.

195
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.720
<v 1>How can you, if you have this stuff.</v>

196
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:38.160
<v 5>In your brain, um, I'm journaling my road to recovery.</v>

197
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.540
<v 1>But if they don't know what this parasite is, how are they treating it? Like,</v>

198
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:44.130
what are they, how are they going to get ahold of yourself?

199
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.430
<v 5>Hopefully they don't find anything. Cause it just got off those rounds of, uh,</v>

200
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:49.170
so they're testing me for Lyme disease.

201
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.790
They're testing me for all these kinds of parasites, amoebas, bacterias. You.

202
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.140
<v 1>Can combine disease in the Congo.</v>

203
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:55.980
<v 5>Well, I've,</v>

204
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.360
I've been camping out here and I've gotten like a bit by five or 10 ticks.

205
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:05.190
So, um, but yeah, there there's these wicked kind of ticks. Um,

206
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:09.330
my record is pulling five roaches out of my beard and one night Christ.

207
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.890
So there's tons of bugs there.

208
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:15.630
<v 1>Do you know, does they have, does Oklahoma have that Rocky mountain thing tick?</v>

209
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.490
Not nothing Northern learn lone star tick.

210
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.640
The one that gives you a meat allergy. Have you heard.

211
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.850
<v 5>I've I've been bit by that one. I don't think I have a meat allergy though.</v>

212
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:24.570
I hope not.

213
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.800
<v 1>Yeah. That's a crazy one. Um, what is it called? Uh, alpha gal,</v>

214
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.250
alpha galactose. It's uh, something that,

215
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.630
it's the reaction that this tick bite gives you.

216
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.340
It makes you allergic to this specific element in red meat. Wow. Yeah,

217
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:44.160
you can only eat fish and like, if you try to eat meat, you'll get really sick.

218
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.230
<v 5>That's crazy. That is crazy. But they're trying to figure it out why,</v>

219
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.720
and this is going to be crazy. Um,

220
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:57.280
why I'm 32 and I've had shingles five times. What? My first time I got malaria.

221
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.020
I don't know if you can see the white in my beard over here,

222
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.380
but I got white in my beard. The first time I had malaria.

223
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.430
The second time I had malaria, I had white come out, my beard down here.

224
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.570
So your body's just freaking out. Yeah. So then now I've got shingles, um,

225
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.480
five times. Um, and then this is gonna sound crazy, but I know I have to have a,

226
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.160
uh, this might be too much information,

227
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.690
but I know I have to have a bowel movement whenever my nose starts running. Hmm.

228
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.370
So literally whenever I have to go through my nose starts

229
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.060
running and running and running. How has that connected?

230
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.710
I don't know if that's what they're looking into.

231
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.980
<v 1>Did you ever see any of Stephen's Chagall? When he was very young,</v>

232
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.600
when he was teaching?

233
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.950
<v 6>I was totally fast. I mean, it's like, and it's really, it's weird like me,</v>

234
00:12:41.951 --> 00:12:46.300
right? Like act like, like serious actor, thoughtful actor. I'm like,

235
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.440
what did you, you know,

236
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.330
but I like above the law because I was into all that stuff when above the law

237
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.680
came out and there was the scene and above the line, he's in an Ikea auto,

238
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:58.053
you know,

239
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.110
geeky with the black thing and he's doing this things and I was re I was like,

240
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.290
oh my God. Like, like, this is so cool.

241
00:13:05.291 --> 00:13:08.170
Like when have you ever seen this in a movie? And, um,

242
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.450
and he was a big guy and he made it violent.

243
00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.080
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

244
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.250
It was very unusual sort of contribution to martial arts because men martial

245
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:18.010
arts movies, he made it realistic. Yeah.

246
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:20.050
I think it was one of the most realistic martial arts movies.

247
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.080
<v 6>Yeah. It was. And you know, when you look back on it, it,</v>

248
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.060
it there's things about it that don't date super well, of course, but.

249
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.830
<v 1>Undenying literally like literally.</v>

250
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.740
<v 6>What you just showed, the thing, the thing of the guy coming,</v>

251
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:37.570
it's that simple thing that thrust and the break and the thing is he also

252
00:13:37.571 --> 00:13:41.740
in the film, um, when the guys come at him and I see this,

253
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.380
it shows you how it burns your brain. There's a scene where there's in a,

254
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.030
like a bodega and the guy,

255
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.650
I think he smashes a bottle and he comes at him and he does like a move in

256
00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.730
Ikea. It's called like COTA guy sheets. Like he, um, it's like the wrist,

257
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.890
you know, it's like the wrist break flip over. And it was just like, oh my God,

258
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:03.520
like, he's doing, he's doing like, you know, nuanced,

259
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.490
Ikea moves in a big action movie. It was kind of cool.

260
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.830
<v 1>I think the first westerner to run a dojo in Japan. I mean,</v>

261
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:13.810
he was a legitimate Akido master. Yeah.

262
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.680
<v 6>And I think, but what's interesting is when I studied over there, he was,</v>

263
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.080
it was country. It was,

264
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.610
it was slightly controversial because I don't think he was,

265
00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.440
he'd broken away from like, like you Sheba, I Quito.

266
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:27.400
He was doing,

267
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.800
he was doing like the way that Gracie jiu-jitsu is not pure Japanese jujitsu.

268
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.950
He was doing something with, it was somehow,

269
00:14:35.951 --> 00:14:39.880
it was associated more with Osaka than Tokyo where the Homebrew dojo and I KIDO

270
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:44.830
is. And I, there was some controversy, there was, there was just, you know,

271
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.000
like the way things are with schools of thought. Hm. But, um, but yeah,

272
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.370
he had a certain legit kind of thing and it's really wild.

273
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.600
Cause people like Mike Ovitz,

274
00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:57.860
who was like the power agent of all of Hollywood in the eighties, you know,

275
00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:01.730
Mike got a black belt training with cigar. Like he was really serious.

276
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.090
[inaudible] um, I didn't know that.

277
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.560
<v 1>Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, it does. But he's a cautionary tale too though.</v>

278
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.640
I mean, not even Novus, I mean, a Seagal, you know,
