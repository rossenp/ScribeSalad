00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Why, why are they mad at you?</v>

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.840
Is it just the articles that you've written?

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.780
Because somebody told me that you had been accused of doxing people.

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.643
Is that true?

5
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.890
<v 1>Absolutely not true. So this is such an outrageous defamatory claims.</v>

6
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:19.560
So what happened was, uh, on may day at that riot,

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.860
there was one of the Antifa women, uh,

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.990
who charged into participate in the fight during the raw brawl and one of

9
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:30.600
the right-wing person. He was wearing a mouse.

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.050
I don't know who he was allegedly had, uh,

11
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.710
hit her on her head, near her head on her neck, somewhere like that.

12
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:38.544
She was knocked out.

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.950
I recognize this woman from her activism that day as the

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.260
person who, um,

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.040
sabotage the sound equipment when James Damore came to Portland state in

16
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.840
February of last year, that was an event that I was involved in organizing, uh,

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.070
Portland state university.

18
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.241
<v 0>Just explain to people,</v>

19
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.630
James DeMaurice is the author of the Google memo that was talking about women in

20
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.950
tech. That was wildly misrepresented.

21
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:08.760
What he had said, and people had claimed that he was this awful sexist.

22
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.500
Even the CEO of YouTube said that he enforced harmful gender stereotypes,

23
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.110
where while he was citing, um,

24
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.550
evolutionary psychology and the citing all these different studies on

25
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:25.020
why women gravitate towards particular fields and even a page and a half

26
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:26.640
encouraging, uh,

27
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.390
or strategy try strategies to encourage more women to get an attack.

28
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.920
But it was basically in response to things that Google had written about

29
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.420
dealing with the lack of women in tech. What, what is the problem here?

30
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.990
They were looking for very particular answer, which was sexism.

31
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.921
And he was saying, well,

32
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:48.210
it actually has more to do with the choices that women sort of naturally tend to

33
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:49.110
gravitate towards.

34
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.300
And he was saying that there was a way to possibly encourage women to

35
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.690
get into technology. And he devised these strategies to do so,

36
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:01.080
but it was wildly misrepresented. And he,

37
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:03.690
if you meet the guy and I've had him on the podcast,

38
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.680
he is a soft-spoken sweetheart of a guy is not,

39
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.750
not a massage is not a mean spirited person.

40
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.970
He was merely looking at the results of studies and he was looking at real raw

41
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.540
data.

42
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.490
And this real tendency that certain people have to gravitate

43
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:22.230
towards certain positions in life.

44
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.670
<v 1>Yeah. So there was so many misconceptions about gene somewhere, which is why,</v>

45
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.760
uh, the student group I was involved in was invited him to come.

46
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.340
But Anthony found the allies just could not take the other,

47
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.030
tried to shut down the event. They tried to get it canceled. Um, at that event,

48
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.340
this one woman, she, uh,

49
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.980
damaged the sound equipment as she was trying to shut it down,

50
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.130
she pulled all these quotes out and pushed the soundboard on the ground.

51
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.170
It broke. So I recognize her from that day, she was named in the media. Um,

52
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.710
and then on may day recognized her. So I named her, I said,

53
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.330
this is the name of the woman who was knocked out. I recognize her from, uh,

54
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.780
the James Damore event, uh, protests, where she had dominated equipment.

55
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.160
And Antifa had spun that around as me doxing her.

56
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.280
And that's not doxing.

57
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.650
Doxing is where you release people's personal details such as where they work,

58
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.320
where they live, their phone numbers with the,

59
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.520
so that people who identified her. I named her. Yes,

60
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.200
but she had been identified in the media before she was a big local activist.

61
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.790
<v 0>So that's basically it. Other than you writing these stories,</v>

62
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.470
criticizing their behavior.

63
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.930
What's disturbing to me beyond disturbing was legitimate journalists

64
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.060
that were making excuses for why you got beat

65
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.894
up.

66
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.220
And people saying things like play stupid games,

67
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.540
win stupid prizes. I saw stuff like that. That pick a better hobby.

68
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:57.130
I saw a guy right. That, you know, antifascists will rule. You know,

69
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.510
Portland's not your place.

70
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.730
I saw all this crazy from people with blue check marks that were saying that

71
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.850
this is what happens when you support fascism.

72
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.530
And I was so baffled by this. Like I read some of your stuff.

73
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.770
I haven't read all of it, admittedly, but I've read some of your stuff.

74
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.540
None of it came off as you supporting fascism, it came off as you,

75
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.790
maybe at the worst case scenario,

76
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:26.620
being a contrarian and not wanting to go with this sort of left

77
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:27.790
wing ideology.

78
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:32.720
That is so widespread throughout the Pacific Northwest. But I didn't,

79
00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:35.920
I didn't see any, I mean, first of all,

80
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.040
you're not a white guy. We should be explained to people.

81
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.500
You are Vietnamese and you know,

82
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.530
you're what they would consider a member of a protected class.

83
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:47.800
You're not just a minority. You're openly gay.

84
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.150
You mean your, your, uh, what, what do you consider yourself politically?

85
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.970
<v 1>I've been avoiding labels for a while. I think, um,</v>

86
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.140
it's interesting that the lot of the coverage on what happened to me always

87
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.510
qualified my, um,

88
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.330
who I am as like a conservative journalists.

89
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.700
<v 0>Well, the worst thing is the way they're labeled Colette.</v>

90
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.930
They said you work for far right. Newspaper magazine, Quilla,

91
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.370
which is not the case at all. That's not true.

92
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.360
<v 1>I think the subtle, I mean,</v>

93
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:26.380
the dog whistles that they're trying to say in there that this person deserved

94
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:30.040
it. And these are the same people who always talk about believes the victim.

95
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.020
They were the ones who jumped on to believe justice Molette. Um,

96
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.050
but, uh, I guess I was the wrong type of victim. Well, yeah.

97
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.130
<v 0>Exactly. Because even though you are you're,</v>

98
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.230
you seem like a very nice person and you aren't doing anything violent. You,

99
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.460
you were supporting the wrong thing or not supporting them, not supporting,

100
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.470
not just blindly supporting what Antifa is involved

101
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:59.900
with, which is what I mean. That is what fascism is. I mean,

102
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.360
if you can't even question some of the more heinous things that mean clearly

103
00:06:05.361 --> 00:06:08.060
heinous things, they're doing just macing people in the audience,

104
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.220
macing people in the crowd, just pointing it at people, yelling and screaming,

105
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:15.890
hitting each other with things. When you're wearing masks,

106
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.580
getting involved in these brawls. It's so stupid.

107
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.500
It's so stupid to watch.

108
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.720
It's like this is base human behavior and it's worst example.

109
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.880
And the fact that this dumb mayor thinks that this is a good idea to let this

110
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:34.760
play itself out. This is how people get shot.

111
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.840
This is how people die when you allow a certain amount of violence.

112
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:43.220
And when you condone or don't do anything with violence that you can't defend,

113
00:06:43.221 --> 00:06:44.810
like violence against a person like yourself.

114
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.910
I saw those guys hitting you in the back of the head,

115
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.790
throwing milkshakes at you where you're just trying to walk away.

116
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:50.840
You weren't doing anything.

117
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.610
<v 1>Yeah. You, you asked me at the beginning, how did I get the,</v>

118
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:58.430
the brain hemorrhage? So the video that's gone viral out there,

119
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.140
such as the second half of the beating.

120
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.230
I don't know if there's video the first half, hopefully, um,

121
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.060
there's drew CCTV or something,

122
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:08.630
but the first there are more hits to my face on my head.

123
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.960
And so when I went to the hospital, uh,

124
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.190
because of the nature of the contusions on my head, they did a CT scan in the,

125
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.120
um, in the ER and that confirmed the sub arachnoid hemorrhage.

126
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.340
<v 0>So what started it? What, what was the, why did you get hit?</v>

127
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.383
Okay.

128
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.850
<v 1>29Th of June. Okay. Uh, that would be 10, 11 days ago from now.</v>

129
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.120
And so there was that demonstration happening.

130
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:40.040
Antifa was rallying to oppose the far right. They claim of pose fascists.

131
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.040
I came, I was excited to use my new GoPro. I was a bit nervous. Um, speaking,

132
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.810
um, I going to the Vanna was nervous because I'd been targeted just, um,

133
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.060
two months earlier. Right. Uh,

134
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.960
I left my house with the helmet and got in my car.

135
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.180
Saw briefly you wear a helmet. I had a helmet.

136
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.160
I did have one, a reflection on myself, took it off,

137
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.270
decided I don't want anybody there to get them pressuring that I can't.

138
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.840
Cause they already accused me of being a Nazi in fall. Right.

139
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.890
And white supremacists.

140
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.140
I didn't want any of them to then perceive me by the fact that I came to the

141
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:20.810
helmet as possibly a combatant. So I left that at home.

142
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.730
<v 0>White supremacist. Is that.</v>

143
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.670
<v 1>Possible in their eyes? Yes. Hilarious.</v>

144
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.133
<v 0>And.</v>

145
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.710
<v 1>I mean, this goes to the bigger issue that I've taken issue with,</v>

146
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:35.300
how flippant people use these organizations of not just racist or being

147
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.440
Nazi or far. Right.

148
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:41.030
But it's like what part of what makes Antifa so dangerous is that they

149
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:45.110
feel that they are morally justified in their

150
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.730
brutality and they get actually a lot of morale

151
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.620
from progressive and left-wing media. So,

152
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.990
um, after talking about what the attacker would like to talk about,

153
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:02.970
how the actual militant, Antifa people is very small,

154
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.190
those who are going out and doing the violence,

155
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.170
the law group in those that I find more concerning actually

156
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.170
are the nonviolent interfere, Antifa, find those.

157
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.040
<v 0>More concerning.</v>

158
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.130
<v 1>Because they work to mainstream,</v>

159
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.850
Antifa tactics and ideas.

160
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.710
Like now doxing by Antifa is not even is kind of seen as

161
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.650
well. These people deserve it. Um,

162
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.210
like do people not realize like when your docs and your peoples,

163
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.910
you know, releasing your addresses happened to me,

164
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:38.880
your family's address out it,

165
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.860
it puts this constant state of fear in you, even when you're in your own home.

166
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.750
Like, I don't know if they realize that. Um, so the, the doxing,

167
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:50.100
and then of course, you know, the punch,

168
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:53.520
the Nazi meme was meant to be cute and funny. Um,

169
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.780
but when they label such a large segment of the population has not seeds, it's,

170
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.500
it's going after a lot of people who, um,

171
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.800
are innocent and law abiding such as myself. They're also.

172
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.290
<v 0>Calling Jewish people Nazis. It's insane.</v>

173
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:09.000
<v 1>And then now more recently, the,</v>

174
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:13.350
the milkshake and Luiseno says cute nonviolent form of political dissent.

175
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.940
As you saw on the video, after I was getting beaten, I was trying to get away.

176
00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:22.830
Then they were pelting all these liquids at my head and in my

177
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:26.040
face and not blinded me. I couldn't even see really which way to leave.

178
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.530
So to backtrack a little bit, sorry,

179
00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.880
I'm jumping all over the March who was writing the Hartford downtown

180
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.770
justify justifiers was attack. They were chanting. No hate, no fear.

181
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.120
This is irony of it.

182
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.480
I remember that very clearly the crowd was chanting that I was walking towards

183
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:43.590
the front of the demonstration,

184
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:47.850
thought I would get a wide angle shot on my golf GoPro before I could get there.

185
00:10:47.851 --> 00:10:52.380
Somebody batches me really hard in the back of the head and I've never been in a

186
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.510
fight. Um, Mr. Rogan.

187
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:57.480
So I didn't even realize what had happened to me.

188
00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.600
I was knocked for as soon as I caught my footing,

189
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.820
the punches kept coming from every direction. And all I could see was like,

190
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.320
um, people,

191
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.590
just some block with Mohs and most of them that were hitting me out on these

192
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.710
gloves that have the hardened knuckles.

193
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.960
I think it's like a slap gloves or.

194
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.890
<v 0>Tactical gloves.</v>

195
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.120
<v 1>And it was just endless. And I could see in the background, like, um,</v>

196
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.660
this was in front of the justice center. This is the other sad irony.

197
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.440
So in broad daylight,

198
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.150
in the hotter downtown steps,

199
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.050
away from the central police precinct from the Sheriff's office,

200
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:39.300
this beating happening, no police intervene at any point. I don't really see it.

201
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.520
I don't know. I, nobody came to my aid at any point before, during or after.

202
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.850
<v 0>So this happens out of nowhere. You get blindsided. The back of the head,</v>

203
00:11:47.851 --> 00:11:50.310
a bunch of people punch you mean how many times do you think you got hit.

204
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.620
<v 1>Maybe six or more?</v>

205
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.180
<v 0>The,</v>

206
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.560
the fact that people dismiss this as not being a big deal is really horrific to

207
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:03.580
me, the fact that the people that are in Antifa that are nonviolent folks,

208
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.220
which I think I'm glad you brought that up. Cause I was going to bring that up.

209
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.730
That it's the extreme of the extremists, right?

210
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:14.440
It's the people that think that there's a call for violence and this is a reason

211
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:17.590
to do it. And even someone like yourself, that is a nonviolent person.

212
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.520
I was just there as a journalist, that there is a justification for just,

213
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:24.100
just for whatever reason you want.

214
00:12:24.101 --> 00:12:25.810
Just go up to that person and start hitting them.

215
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.130
Even though they're not a threat,

216
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.080
even though they're not doing anything to harm anybody,

217
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.610
even though they're not putting anybody in danger, they're,

218
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.330
they're just being a journalist and you feel like you could justify hitting

219
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:36.070
them. It's really disgusting.
