1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>I'm a little high. Do you remember when, uh, do you remember when,</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.540
of course we don't. Did you see that missionary?

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:09.240
The Christian missionary went to that island in India.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.930
It's still a Satan island. He's like, no, I'm going to give the word of Jesus.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.150
<v 1>And Jesus loves you too. And he, and they're like.</v>

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.830
<v 0>Ha, and then killed him instantly. I think he got shot through the island.</v>

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.790
Is that what you said?

8
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.820
<v 1>So Sentinel island, north Sentinel island, they,</v>

9
00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:29.010
they left Africa 60,000 years ago and they been living on this island.

10
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:32.460
And what's interesting is I say guy, I tweeted it on my page.

11
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.760
There's a guy over and finish him off his fights.

12
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.240
Shout out to fights over powerful.

13
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.830
<v 0>I always root for over him. Now.</v>

14
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.933
<v 1>The whole back on that.</v>

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.400
<v 0>Man, 38 still doing it right there too. One more winning. He's the title shot.</v>

16
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.660
He's always that guy.

17
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.870
<v 1>Roster over it. Well, he's definitely in the hunt for it. I mean, look,</v>

18
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:54.360
when he fought steep, remember when he hurts deep. Yeah.

19
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.310
It's just as possible that he could have stopped.

20
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.130
<v 0>And then he thought he tapped on your number and they're like, Joe,</v>

21
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.130
let's bring that up. Well, maybe not there.

22
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.491
<v 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:05.850
that was when I decided not to interview people that have been killed or just

24
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.460
like, it's not fair that they have a false memory.

25
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:11.880
Like kosher just got knocked out by [inaudible] dude.

26
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:12.714
I wouldn't mind seeing him.

27
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.703
<v 0>Versus France.</v>

28
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.020
<v 1>Francis again. Are you crazy son? I don't want to see that again.</v>

29
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.240
I don't want to see anybody get hit like that again.

30
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.370
If I go through the rest of my days.

31
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.040
<v 0>What are we talking about? The Satan guy or the Satan.</v>

32
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.580
<v 1>Island. Oh, Sentinel. So here's, what's crazy.</v>

33
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.350
They used to be,

34
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.850
they used to be sort of uncontacted but they got contacted in the 18 hundreds by

35
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.550
this guy. Now this is a guy, uh,

36
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.900
on Twitter posted this amazing review of all this stuff is,

37
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.880
is his name is respectable law on, um, on,

38
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.910
on Twitter. So he posted this really long,

39
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.650
detailed history of what happened to these people and a guy named Maurice

40
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.790
vital V V Dow Portman. And this guy, uh,

41
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.510
apparently stayed on the island for a long time.

42
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.360
And people got sick because of these people being there,

43
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.510
they don't have any diarrhea or they have no, well, they have no immunity to,

44
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.270
but he measured their Dick sizes and he measured their balls.

45
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.790
Has he made them pose and all these weird ways, like it's really freaky,

46
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.610
but really, really interesting. He's like,

47
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.290
look at he's measuring the children and stuff like treated him like in weird

48
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:29.520
home office and stuff, but talked about them like in really weird sexual terms.

49
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.830
And this guy w w it was such a bad experience for those people that, uh,

50
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.650
they're the devil. And it was a bike a hundred years ago.

51
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.570
So when people go back, now, they immediately kill him. So because of this one,

52
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:45.300
Dick wad that landed there a hundred years ago,

53
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:46.860
they think of white people as evil.

54
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:51.360
So these two fishermen fell asleep and I want to say it was like 2006.

55
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.660
They fell asleep in their boat, drifted onto the island. They woke up to him.

56
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.890
They just hatchet him and arrowed them and killed them on the beach. They lived.

57
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:00.460
They don't around anymore. If you think about it as this one,

58
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.713
if you think about.

59
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.490
<v 2>It's really smart in a up way, because if they get coming to contact, one of us,</v>

60
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.150
the entire, their entire population could be wiped out because they don't have.

61
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.450
<v 1>I mean, but they're Satanists, right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,</v>

62
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.360
no, no, no, no, no, no. He just went there to convert them. I heard this one.

63
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.700
Good morning. No, no, no, no, not good morning.

64
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.670
America said the north Sentinel island preacher,

65
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:28.900
the last full day Satanist island. Here's the deal. Brendan St.

66
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.400
St. Satan is a Western concept. You just, they have no idea.

67
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:35.290
They just hate white people. Oh, genius there.

68
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.620
<v 2>What? They don't like foreign people who's watching. I don't know.</v>

69
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.370
<v 1>I think they had his name up there. They just didn't say white people.</v>

70
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.230
Cause that one dude came and everything up.

71
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.400
And then I see a white person kill him data. We don't even know their language.

72
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.590
So to say, they're Satan, this is crazy.

73
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.040
It's like saying that you understand what they're saying? That's the rumor.

74
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.990
How big is the, how big is that island? Translator size of Manhattan. Really?

75
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.430
No, they don't have a translator. Eddie.

76
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.720
They don't even have any contact at all. The outside world island guy was there.

77
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.860
It's illegal. That guy got killed and he paid illegally together.

78
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.500
What are they to leave and go to that? Fishermen got arrested.

79
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.210
So there was a cargo ship that ran a ground there many years ago, here,

80
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.130
there is a 1981, uh, and uh, the crew radioed for assistance.

81
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.260
And then they got 50 men with bows and arrows were showing up to try to get to

82
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.830
the boat and they helicoptered them away. God, the boat is still there.

83
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.180
So this is a crazy placement. Sounds like an awesome movie. So I know.

84
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:38.500
And then from that boat, from that boat, they started getting metal tools.

85
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480
Cause they didn't have metal before that.

86
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.500
So until the 19 was in 19 80, 81, I think. Yeah.

87
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.640
So now these, these people took pieces of metal and,

88
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.200
and cold forged them into weapons and like pounded them down with

89
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.020
rocks and, and created knives and stuff,

90
00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.610
these people are so old school. They're essentially living the same way.

91
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.920
People lived 60,000 years ago.

92
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.650
They'd been on this isolated island ever since then.

93
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.120
We should just fly over and drop a ton of I-phones everywhere. Just a.

94
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.390
They don't know how many of them there are anymore,

95
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:17.110
but they know their populations are declining. So at once at one point in time,

96
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:19.720
there was 150 plus documented.

97
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.980
And now they think it might be as low as 39 cause disease and stuff.

98
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.850
They don't have any, probably bored of each other. Stop, you know,

99
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.790
trying to get fish. You don't have time to raise your kid.

100
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.470
Which one are you talking about? Assemblies. Yeah,

101
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.260
they're their populations who left drastically dropping. There's no genetic.

102
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.930
<v 2>And there's no.</v>

103
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.100
<v 1>Genetic diversity either. I'm sure. Yeah. I mean 39 folks.</v>

104
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.650
39 folks is a small number. Yeah.

105
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.250
If they're really down to that few and uh, you know, they're real,

106
00:05:48.251 --> 00:05:50.350
real aggressive when anybody comes anywhere near them.

107
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.660
But the thing is now that we all know about it, I mean,

108
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.100
I'm a part of the problem too. Right?

109
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:56.290
We're all talking about this now that we all know about it.

110
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:58.730
More people are going to think about going there. I think a hundred.

111
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.580
<v 0>Percent hear that. And I say, leaving the United States 30%.</v>

112
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.150
<v 1>Where is that place? Where, where is it? Somewhere off of India.</v>

113
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.110
They have been gone. They have been gone. So it doesn't seem that remote.

114
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:12.080
If it's in the bay, it's pretty far away. It's far away. It's.

115
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.970
<v 0>Hard to literally it's illegal. It's.</v>

116
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.930
<v 1>Like in the middle of the ocean.</v>

117
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.700
<v 0>So homeboy who's doing God's work. I was like, no, I can do it. And even Ryan,</v>

118
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:23.120
his journal was like, man, I hope I don't die. If I do my parents,

119
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.480
don't be mad at me. I'm headed this island. What the were you thinking?

120
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.620
<v 1>Well, he's crazy. He's trying to convert people. He thinks people need Jesus.</v>

121
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.130
The same language. They don't have any idea. What he's saying. He's from oral.

122
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.940
<v 0>Roberts.</v>

123
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.400
<v 1>Graduated from oral Roberts university, right? Yeah. See there.</v>

124
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.770
That's where it is. [inaudible].

125
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.920
<v 0>Way out there. Four and a half stars out of five. So.</v>

126
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.753
<v 1>Let's go on then.</v>

127
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.290
<v 0>Oh. So if I go with it, the internet 3000 reviews.</v>

128
00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.450
<v 1>That's given it, all this review is defeated.</v>

129
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.240
<v 0>Go, go ahead. There you'll go ahead. And then there's a.</v>

130
00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:00.380
<v 1>Suite four seasons. They have great food. It's called human.</v>

131
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.010
It's going to eat you. Oh, so they,

132
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.030
they killed the guy and then they buried him right on the beach, man.

133
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.160
They just dragged his body out to the beach.

134
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.550
<v 0>And then the Indian government said, we're not gonna do anything about it.</v>

135
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.370
Did there. That's all they know. Well.

136
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.590
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, first of all, they,</v>

137
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.610
their law is you can't visit their island. That's their law.

138
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.290
So he was violating their law, him showing up with this book,

139
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:32.510
I would imagine Dade, they have laws against people visiting, especially whites,

140
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.100
man. That, that story that they tell about that one English guy that went there.

141
00:07:37.101 --> 00:07:37.940
That was a piece of.

142
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.350
<v 0>Up for.</v>

143
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.340
<v 1>Everybody. I hope that guy respectable law on Twitter, uh,</v>

144
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.550
understands how much I appreciate that.

145
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.910
<v 0>Cool. Yeah. So yes, there.</v>

146
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.630
<v 3>Were flourishing. You need to read Navy.</v>

147
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.780
<v 1>Seals, take them all out, take them all out.</v>

148
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.370
<v 0>[Inaudible] that'd be a cool video and massacre.</v>

149
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.930
<v 3>You never know. I mean, they might have some crazy booby traps.</v>

150
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.880
They might have some Vietcong for.

151
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:17.990
<v 1>Right. Beautiful victories. But a Starbucks franchise.</v>

152
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.700
Look at the first one with the locals.

153
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.390
<v 0>When here was my girlfriend for holiday, I loved it. She wasn't impressed.</v>

154
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.250
Very poor choice for a romantic getaway.

155
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.770
Great choice for anyone looking to rough it up a bit.

156
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.000
<v 1>Uh, so silly people are so funny. Well,</v>

157
00:08:35.001 --> 00:08:36.920
that island though is, um, there's gotta be.

158
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.753
<v 3>People going.</v>

159
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.540
<v 0>That's what I mean. No [inaudible] dumb.</v>

160
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.140
<v 1>Dan Bilzerian is going to be there next month with a bikini.</v>

161
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.550
It's going to just send a boatload of vape. Pens.

162
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.350
<v 3>Was taking a, India.</v>

163
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.470
<v 1>India, India. They.</v>

164
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.760
<v 2>Came from Africa though. 60,000 years ago. Fly drones over the Thailand.</v>

165
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.330
No closer to Thailand. Yeah. Okay. Pretty much.

166
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.060
<v 3>How do they know that? I, how,</v>

167
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.950
how would they figure that out if you're not allowed to go on the island,

168
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.980
but they've been around 60,000 years ago.

169
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.830
<v 2>It's a good question. I dunno. It's tractor. Well, it's like in Papa,</v>

170
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:18.540
new Guinea, those tribes have been isolated for, for 40,000 years. Yeah. Still.

171
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.810
Yeah, not anymore. But I mean, when Jared diamond went and studied them,

172
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:25.140
they'd been isolated for that long. They practice weird things too,

173
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:28.860
like widows strangling and all kinds of stuff with Australians and that one

174
00:09:28.861 --> 00:09:29.730
tribe where you,

175
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.740
where the young boys sock the Cox of the older men and take it in their

176
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.590
as well to become men. So they take in the sperm.

177
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.220
It's not just some weird started that. Exactly.

178
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.253
But if you don't have,

179
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.990
if you don't have somebody to can compete with those ideas,

180
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.120
then that gets passed down as religion.
