00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 2>We were just talking about, uh, Hagler before, um, the,</v>

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.430
the podcast started and how crazy it is that he's gone. It's

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.130
I just can't believe it. It's just like, I thought that guy, like he was,

5
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:20.820
so he was so disciplined when I was a kid.

6
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:24.810
I remember I talked about it in his Instagram posts that I made. They had some,

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.050
um, some profile of him when he was prepared.

8
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.320
I think he was preparing for a Mustapha ham show and he was running on the

9
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.154
beach. And it was.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.670
<v 1>I was asking you about coal. I mean, watching you and Tyson was on the podcast,</v>

11
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:35.881
right?

12
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.050
He's like he's running into snow screaming and I was trying to find it all week.

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.190
<v 0>Man. I wish I could find it. Do you know where it is?</v>

14
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.210
<v 1>I couldn't find no other looking forward to no one can find it. I mean,</v>

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.270
like top it in warranty each year, first, like threads about,

16
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.560
I heard her Brogan talk about,

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.070
I can't find it no way or that way to see that I'm not trying to find it.

18
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.590
<v 0>Some local news shows like I was, I was probably like 15 and,</v>

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.390
uh, I remember just watching it gone

20
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.010
cause he was in and he was doing sit-ups and push-ups and you know,

21
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.360
he was just so disciplined. Nobody was more conditioned than Hagler.

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.990
Nobody like he would just, when he fought Mugabi he just,

23
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.410
just kept the heat on them. Just kept a heat on all of a.

24
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.280
<v 1>Sudden that.</v>

25
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.820
<v 0>That fight was crazy and Mugabi was putting people to sleep.</v>

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.230
I remember I was working at this boxing gym and they were talking about Mugabi

27
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:29.730
like long before he fought Hagler,

28
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.010
but he fought this dude and gain brain damage. He like,

29
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.650
he knocked him out and he's like, the guy was never the same again. It's like,

30
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.380
there's certain guys that just have punching power.

31
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.350
That's just out of this world and Mugabi was one of them.

32
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.390
Do you remember Julian Jackson? Um.

33
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.313
<v 1>No, I don't think so.</v>

34
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.490
<v 0>Julian Jackson was another one. He had this, they called him the Hawk.</v>

35
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.470
He had this crazy punching power. I mean, he looked, he looked like a solid guy,

36
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.500
but for whatever reason, when that guy would touch people,

37
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.210
they would just stiffen up. Uh,

38
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.750
Julian Jackson is like one of the most ferocious power punchers ever in the

39
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:01.584
history of boxing.

40
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.350
<v 1>I love haggling. I watched them all week, which is weird. Right?</v>

41
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.010
Cause I'm watching Hagler for like by year, two years. I mean watching him,

42
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:12.120
but for some reason, um, I just felt that energy last week on fight week.

43
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.220
So from Sunday to, um, when I got to go to Vegas, I was just watching him,

44
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.050
watching him, watching him. Um,

45
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.020
I was posting on my Instagram even posted on my Instagram, um,

46
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.600
all week I was posted to him. And then, um,

47
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.810
just before I left to go to the apex, I was watching his fights.

48
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.500
Then I went to my room to have eyes on rest.

49
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.830
Then I got messaged out dead. As I read about you,

50
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:39.690
I just posted them like an hour ago. That's crazy. Crazy. Yeah. Well,

51
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.180
like I said, it's discipline in the way,

52
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.290
the way he worked and that's inspiration, inspiration to me, you know?

53
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.550
And uh, I watched a documentary that first fair to fights.

54
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.660
It didn't get paid no more than like say like $12,000 a week.

55
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.990
Could you do with no, like nobody want, nobody wants to fight him, you know?

56
00:02:57.991 --> 00:02:59.530
And just, I took.

57
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.430
<v 0>Inspiration from that. You know what else I love he got on top and he's like,</v>

58
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.210
I'm done try to get a rematch missionary Leonard sugary Leonard said no.

59
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:11.360
And he's like, [inaudible] when I watched it,

60
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.590
it was a split decision. Right? I think it was. And so he just said, good,

61
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.630
I'm done. That's it out on top.

62
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.070
