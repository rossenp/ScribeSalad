1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah, you're in a jujitsu. I remember that.</v>

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.430
I remember I ran into at the UFC. It was a couple of years ago. And you were,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.250
you were like really energy jujitsu. Like you train hard.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.260
<v 1>I was super, super into it until COVID hit. And then when COVID hit,</v>

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.750
I just, I got really,

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:23.370
really nervous because I have asthma and autoimmune. So,

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.980
um, I just, I,

8
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.940
I got really nervous about training so close with anybody that I took a break

9
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:33.930
from it, but I'm, I'm anxious to get back. I want, I can't wait to train.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.890
<v 0>It's a good humbler. That's a good thing to keep you balanced. No.</v>

11
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.080
<v 1>The best thing I found for, I mean, outside of meditation, for me,</v>

12
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.760
it's two totally different things, but.

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.870
<v 0>It's kind of different, but not that yeah, you're right. Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.410
This jiu-jitsu people are some of the comms people I've ever met in my life.

15
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.430
They're all chill.

16
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.880
<v 1>Totally. Especially when they get into like flow rolling,</v>

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.600
like that is meditative. That is meditation. So.

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.000
<v 0>I think even the hard sparring is meditated because you're forced to think only</v>

19
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.790
of that thing. And when you think about that thing,

20
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.630
only it acts as like a cleansing. It blows all that.

21
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.650
And also it's so hard to do that. Regular stuff seems easy. Yeah.

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.080
Like regular life seems easier, easy.

23
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.100
Some pitches on top of you trying to call her truck.

24
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.980
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But it's also like really empowering when you're color choking.</v>

25
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.230
Like when your mouth, when you're mounting on someone and you're just, yeah.

26
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.850
It's, it's empowering. Yeah.

27
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.790
<v 0>Yeah. When you, do you remember the first time you tapped somebody out?</v>

28
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.630
<v 1>Actually don't, that's.</v>

29
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.490
<v 0>Good. That means you probably tapped a bunch of people out.</v>

30
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.800
<v 1>Um, I, I I've tapped out a few people in my job.</v>

31
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.800
What's really wild is like, when you surpass yourself, like you think,

32
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.960
I don't know. I just, I never thought that I'd get a blue belt.

33
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.000
Like I just never thought that I'd be a belt in anything I'm a singer, like,

34
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.980
and then hard work pays off. And it's just really cool when,

35
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.260
when you get to prove yourself wrong.

36
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.730
<v 0>Well, if you get to a blue belt,</v>

37
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.880
you're at purple belt and if you get to purple belt, you can get the black belt.

38
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.390
That's all it is. It's just, just keep, where are you training?

39
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.670
<v 1>So I was training out of unbreakable. Yeah. And west Hollywood,</v>

40
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.640
great gym. I love that gym so much.

41
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.120
<v 0>Famous people can go there too. It's like for whatever reason, Snoop goes there,</v>

42
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.760
Wiz Khalifa goes there, Stallone goes there.

43
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.613
<v 1>So, um,</v>

44
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.090
the reason why it's so chill is they have like a no like

45
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.590
cameras policy. It's kind of like the Soho house of, they call it.

46
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.310
And a lot of athletes go in and train there too. But, um,

47
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.900
but it's private and it's super chill. I used to train there and then I, yeah.

48
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.920
Um, then I started training at my apartment building that I was living in.

49
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.980
I got a house, so I just will train there.

50
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.810
<v 0>So do you, um, have you gone to like other jiu-jitsu schools?</v>

51
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.220
Like if you're on the road, have you ever done that? I have.

52
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.970
I've gone to random places throughout the country.

54
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.080
Um, but I couldn't tell you the name.

55
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:19.810
And there were also a lot of people in there. Right.

56
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.110
<v 0>Um, limited to the amount of people or just a small amount of people that didn't</v>

57
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:23.740
train with.

58
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.690
<v 1>Yeah. Um, or, or just my trainer, you know, it's hard for me. I, not,</v>

59
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:33.640
a lot of people wanted to let me train with other people and like,

60
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.190
uh, like, uh, outside of a private.

61
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.830
<v 0>Lesson, did they worry about like people hurting.</v>

62
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.660
<v 1>They were worried about people.</v>

63
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.630
<v 0>Being like, and then you Sue the out of them. Right.</v>

64
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.410
<v 1>Or, or just not being able to walk on stage.</v>

65
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.740
<v 0>Right now, somebody heel hooks here and then, sorry, everybody.</v>

66
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:54.970
I lost my ACL.

67
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.470
<v 1>I have worn boots on stage too. So I'm,</v>

68
00:04:00.471 --> 00:04:03.010
I'm a very clumsy person and.

69
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.000
<v 0>You've worn doubts, like broken foot boots. Is that what you mean? Yeah, really?</v>

70
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:07.834
What happened to your foot?

71
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.950
<v 1>So I broke my ankle and she thousand 12, I think,</v>

72
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.120
or 2013.

73
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.490
And then I broke my foot in 2018 and

74
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.450
I still had to tour with a broken foot. Yeah. I just be dazzled.

75
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.130
<v 0>It you'd be dazzled your boots.</v>

76
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.530
<v 1>And I did it myself, like in the dressing, in my hotel room in Ireland,</v>

77
00:04:29.531 --> 00:04:33.340
like the cheapest, like old jewels and hot glue.
