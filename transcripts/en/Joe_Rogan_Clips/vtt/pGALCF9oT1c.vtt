00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's such a, an, an interesting time capsule.</v>

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.120
When you look at these films, when you look at something like,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.040
like nosferrato from 1922,

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.560
and then you look at what we're doing today with CGI in a lot of ways. I mean,

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.560
I'm not a fan of CGI. I'm not a fan of it in terms of, uh,

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.270
like for monsters, Mon, it just seems, everything seems fake.

7
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:28.230
There's the suspension of disbelief is higher than if I'm like what you did with

8
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.190
American war Wolf in London. What, one of,

9
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:32.950
one of the more brilliant things about it was the special effects and the makeup

10
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.710
were fantastic, but there were these really quick scenes. It was like,

11
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.300
you saw it for a second and it was burned into your eyes then,

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.260
and then it vanished.

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.060
<v 1>Yeah. Well, what John Landus said to me is that I'm,</v>

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.260
I'm never gonna really show the warwol for more than a couple seconds. Mm.

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.900
And I hardly even wanna show it then, you know? Right.

16
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.300
And what was great about warwol working on that film with John Landis was he,

17
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.380
you know, said, you're the expert. I want a fourlegged hound from hell.

18
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.970
I wanted to make a BIED Warwolf, you know, we argued about it.

19
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.170
And it was basically, you know, he wins he's the director, you know,

20
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.250
but he says, fourlegg at homeund from hell, make it. And I did. I mean,

21
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.650
the first sculpture was what the final thing became same with everything in it,

22
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:14.690
the Nazi demons, all that stuff. Mm. You know, cut to, you know,

23
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:17.850
like when I did the Wolf, man, I mean, I did thousands of designs and,

24
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.130
and you know, all these producers are going, well,

25
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.520
maybe if you do one between this and that, a and do one between this and that.

26
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.360
And or maybe this PO should be over here, you know,

27
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.760
and that kind of stuff just is so soul sucking, you know? Yeah.

28
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.360
And it's one of the reasons I retired, you know, I just, and, but to this day,

29
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.320
I mean, like on the, on the cover of my, my book is, uh, the sculpture from, uh,

30
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:41.040
of the, one of the Nazi demons from American Warwolf and,

31
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.480
and a number of people said, this is like,

32
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.270
like one of the greatest designs ever, you know, and this kinda stuff. And it's,

33
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.310
uh, people who are production designers and stuff,

34
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.830
and it was it's pure Rick B baker without interference. Right. You know, and,

35
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.990
and that's what I thought the industry would be, you know? Right.

36
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.030
Which it isn't &lt;laugh&gt; for the most part, you know? Well.

37
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.190
<v 0>It's just, everybody wants to, it's the same with comedy.</v>

38
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.300
It's the same with it's seems like it's the same with everything.

39
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:07.140
Everybody wants to put their greasy little fingerprints on it and, and say,

40
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.780
that's the reason why his nose is like, that was me. Yeah. I,

41
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.700
I told Rick B bakerker, you don't know what you're doing. Yeah.

42
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:13.300
You gotta make the nose wider. Yeah, no.

43
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.820
<v 1>I know. Yeah. That's uh, and it's, you know, it's watered,</v>

44
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.100
watered down the designs. Yeah. Like I said, it's soul sucking. I mean, if,

45
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:22.620
and when, you know, you know, sculptures take a long time and, you know,

46
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.410
we sculpted every pour and every wrinkle and everything, you know,

47
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.010
I have like magnifying glasses I wear when I'm doing this. And after you spend,

48
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.690
you know, hours and, and sleepless nights doing it,

49
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:34.170
and then some guy who doesn't know, he's talking about comes in and says, well,

50
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:36.290
you know, why don't you do this? You know, it's.

51
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.490
<v 0>Well, they're disturbing your artistic vision. It's just, it's its, I mean,</v>

52
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:43.530
when someone contributes money and they're the ones who get to decide whether

53
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:45.680
things get made or not, maybe, you know, just,

54
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.880
they think they're artistic as well. Yeah. It becomes.

55
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.480
<v 1>A disaster. And it's the thing, you know, I mean,</v>

56
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.680
when you see a movie or a TV show, another there's 47 producers on yeah.

57
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:55.514
You know, it used to be,

58
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.080
they were show people mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and there was a guy that, you know,

59
00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:02.680
for example, on gremlins too, Mike fannell, who was the producer, the, uh,

60
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.640
who came from Roger Corman, uh, school of filmmaking, you know?

61
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.440
So he really checks every penny mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

62
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.680
but he was a guy I could go to and he'd go what? He,

63
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.080
he would look at everything. He'd go, why is it, why is this,

64
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.870
why are you buying this? And you'd explain it to him and he'd go, okay,

65
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:19.610
that makes sense.

66
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.870
And there'd be a person you could talk to and you could get an answer from it.

67
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.710
Now there's like I said, 47 producers and nobody will commit to anything,

68
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.630
you know? And it's, it drove me crazy. And you know, I mean, I, I,

69
00:03:32.631 --> 00:03:36.230
it was, I, I did make it because I loved it. And I, I was,

70
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.780
I feel so fortunate that my hobby in my profession and he did well and got

71
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:44.060
awards for it and stuff and for something I would do for free, you know,

72
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.940
but it got to the point where I, I,

73
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.180
I was just becoming a bitter old man because of all this. And I just said, yeah,

74
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.140
I have to retire. And I wanna make things for myself while I still can,

75
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.700
you know, I'm almost 69 years old and, you know,

76
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.250
having trouble with joints and vision and all kinds of stuff,

77
00:04:01.251 --> 00:04:01.771
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, and,

78
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:05.970
and I I'd be off if I was working on some movie for some producer that

79
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.970
didn't know what he was talking about and, and screwed up my work, you know?

80
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.010
So it mess with your head. Yeah. So it's time to just, you know,

81
00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:15.570
make my own thing and I'm, I'm loving it, you know what, and.

82
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.250
<v 0>When you look back, like what was the first thing that you did where you like,</v>

83
00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:20.320
okay, that was a good.

84
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.040
<v 1>One. Well, you know, it's funny once you do something and you look at it,</v>

85
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.760
you see all the things that are wrong with it, you know? And, and I always say,

86
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:29.680
I wish I could see the film before I make this stuff,

87
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:32.440
because so many times the thing that's supposed to be the most important thing

88
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.600
isn't and something that you like threw together is all of a sudden the most

89
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:39.480
important thing. Mm. You know, I mean, I, I mean,

90
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.630
American Marvel was probably the one where, uh, I mean,

91
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.670
that's one that really put me on the map. I mean,

92
00:04:46.671 --> 00:04:51.470
a lot of people say king Kong was, but, um, uh, American war, you know, I,

93
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.550
I looked at it and I thought, well, that's pretty cool, you know,

94
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:56.990
but I also went, God, I wish we did this. And I wish I do. You know,

95
00:04:56.991 --> 00:04:58.150
I didn't do that. You know?

96
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:00.990
And I see so many things that I would do differently now. Yeah.

97
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.940
That movie's a masterpiece. Uh, it, it's a great film and it's a great film.

98
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.820
I mean, and I, my second film was schlock, which was John Landis's first film.

99
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.900
Ah, uh, I was 20 and he was 21. And I had,

100
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.340
again,

101
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.860
I think I had six weeks and I think I had a thousand dollars again to make John

102
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.180
play the schlockros.

103
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:22.650
I don't know if you've ever seen schlock ever saw that's that's another one you

104
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:27.250
gotta watch. &lt;laugh&gt; uh, low budget, you know, movie shot by a kid, basically,

105
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.130
you know, um, with a, you know, and he, like I said, he played this.

106
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.370
It was based. Have you ever seenrog yes. Joan Crawford. Yes. Yeah. Yes.

107
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.930
He sawrog. And couldn't believe that they made this movie.

108
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.800
So he was making like a joke, a joke version of schlock. He, you know, um, uh,

109
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.280
uh, and, uh, he wanted to play this eight man character and it's like, well,

110
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.800
okay. You know, but you're gonna be the director too. So, you know,

111
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:53.760
he had to be on set at six in the morning,

112
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.960
whether schlock worked or not all made up, you know,

113
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.680
know mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it was shot in three weeks.

114
00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.160
And John and I were going on two hour sleep a night, you know, he,

115
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.880
I would make him up. We were out in AUR, uh, at,

116
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.600
at where it used to be an Oakwood school where John went for a while and think

117
00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:11.320
it was thrown out of, uh,

118
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.480
and we lived and worked in this like screen in patio, uh,

119
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.910
that was left over in this dilapidinated building.

120
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.510
And I was making up John on a bar stool,

121
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.510
and eventually he was like falling asleep and doing those, you know, that thing,

122
00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.870
you know, and I'd have to grab him, but he, for some reason,

123
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.310
they were doing the dailies at, at MGM.

124
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.510
So we would have to go from a after 12 hour day of filming and, you know,

125
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.460
hour moving the makeup, we'd get in the car, drive MGM,

126
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:41.100
look at the previous days, dailies drive back sleep for two hours, get up,

127
00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:44.220
start again, you know, oh my God. And it was during a heat wave and aura.

128
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.740
And the first day John, uh, uh, had the suit on all day and I was like,

129
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.460
calming it and brushing it. And the hair was just falling out in handfuls.

130
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:55.420
And I went, oh my God. Then my, my second film in my careers over. And,

131
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.690
and I would stay up all night with a hair drive trying to dry the suit out so I

132
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.930
could gloomer hair on it. You oh. Uh, but it it's,

133
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.410
it's actually kind of a cool makeup in, in, in, in kind of a fun character,

134
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.730
you know, and John had already written American WWOL and he said,

135
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.770
my next film's gonna be American. W he wrote that by the time he was 21,

136
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.050
he was 20 when he wrote it. Wow. Yeah. And he goes, it's gonna be my next film.

137
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.000
And he said, I want to do it, try ation in a way that never been done before.

138
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:24.320
It doesn't make sense to me that a man changing in his body,

139
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:28.960
going through this metamorphosis would sit in a chair like aloncheney junior and

140
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:32.280
be still until he finished changing. He goes, I think it would be painful.

141
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.680
And I want him to be able to move and I wanna show the pain and you know,

142
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:41.270
how would you do that? And I go, I have no idea, but I would love to, you know,

143
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.110
cuz we both love those transformation scenes, you know.

144
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.550
<v 0>Pull that transformation scene up. The,</v>

145
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.630
the initial transformation scene is so awesome. Cuz I,

146
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.030
I remember seeing it in the theater. What year was.

147
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.830
<v 1>This? 1981. I think.</v>

148
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.510
<v 0>I was okay. So I was 14 years old.</v>

149
00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.900
I was in high school and I remember seeing this in was movie theater and this

150
00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:04.180
was another one that sort of cemented the idea that, uh, I wanted to be a,

151
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.380
a makeup artist when he pulls all his clothes off and he is burning up and then

152
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:11.100
he looks at his hand, uh, and his hand starts stretching out.

153
00:08:11.101 --> 00:08:15.220
Like that was incredible. Well, this was just such a different wearwol too.

154
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.020
Like everything about it was different. Yeah.

155
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.730
<v 1>Well again, and, and I credit John for that and he also said, you know,</v>

156
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:23.450
I wanna do it in a brightly lit room. It's not gonna have horror film lighting.

157
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.610
It's gonna be real. You know, how did you do this? How did you do the hand?

158
00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:30.050
It's uh, we called it a changeo hand. It was actually a fake hand.

159
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.730
We storyboarded the whole sequence and that's a different fake hand there.

160
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:35.610
That's a second one. Right. And that's another one there.

161
00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:37.810
It's got syringes in it that we pump.

162
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.280
Now he's wearing an appliance hand that matches let see. Um,

163
00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:44.640
and we story about the whole sequence. And as you saw him,

164
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:47.720
when David first took off his clothes, he's not very hairy. Right. And I said,

165
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.920
for me to glue a little bit of hair on,

166
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.800
and then we do him a little hairrier and a little hairrier it,

167
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.280
it's better for us to work in reverse.

168
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.720
Let me do 'em in the hairt first and now pull hair off and trim it. Oh,

169
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.480
interesting. Yeah, but we boarded the whole thing out. So,

170
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.800
and this hair growing was reverse. Uh, I,

171
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.200
I punched hair through rubber and then pulled it through and we reverse printed

172
00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:09.400
it. So it looked like it was, oh,

173
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.520
this is a whole fake back again with things coming out of it. That's a good,

174
00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:13.080
so you punched.

175
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.190
<v 0>Hair through over and pulled it through. Yeah. Like this and then reversed it.</v>

176
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:19.350
So then it grows out like that. Oh, oh wow. Um.

177
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.043
<v 1>But what I,</v>

178
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.990
we thought what would be the most impactful thing would be for his face to

179
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.990
change last, but what I don't like about the transformation, like here,

180
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.350
the Wolf has a big, main of hair, so he's got this big,

181
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.790
hairy neck that I don't like. Yeah. You know, and it's, you know, uh,

182
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.660
and that's David doesn't have lenses and his eyes were just there,

183
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.980
red from that was a 10 day really of.

184
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.940
<v 0>Makeup. Uh, so just exhausted and with makeup on. Yeah.</v>

185
00:09:43.941 --> 00:09:47.220
This was incredible meant. That's crazy that he doesn't have any eyes.

186
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.820
He doesn't have anything in his eyes. Yeah. That's just his eyes. Yeah. Holy.

187
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.540
<v 1>Um, but yeah, this is the first stage change ahead. So this is a,</v>

188
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.370
a rubber head that had mechanisms that push it out, you know? Uh,

189
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.810
and this is a second stage change ahead. Uh, it just stretches out like that.

190
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:05.850
And the thing that was interesting, cuz I mean, I, I was 30 when I did this.

191
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.410
It was at a time when there weren't people that did this kind of work. Uh,

192
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.690
there just a few in Hollywood, you know,

193
00:10:11.691 --> 00:10:15.530
like John Chambers who did plent of the apes. But for me to find a crew,

194
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.840
I hired kids that sent me fan mail &lt;laugh&gt; I was a kid,

195
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.080
a kid from Texas that sent me fan mail, another kid from Connecticut.

196
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.200
And they were like 18. Wow. I mean,

197
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:28.240
I had a crew of like basically 18 year olds and me, it was like,

198
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.240
I think six of us, uh, who did this film, you know, 30, however many years ago.

199
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:36.480
I'm not good at math. Um, and still looks pretty decent, you know.

200
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.270
<v 0>Awesome. &lt;laugh&gt; not just pretty decent. I mean,</v>

201
00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:40.550
there's a reason why I have the American,

202
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.390
wearol the pat McGee version of it sitting there in the front. Yeah.

203
00:10:43.391 --> 00:10:46.190
But now I have to call pat and tell 'em the legs are off. &lt;laugh&gt; what's wrong.

204
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.470
<v 1>With the legs. They're too stretched out in too long. It, uh, you know,</v>

205
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.031
we actually,

206
00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:52.270
that was the problem cuz I didn't know how I was gonna make this four-legged

207
00:10:52.271 --> 00:10:56.990
Wolf work. Yeah. And uh, thought, well, I'll figure out something and it,

208
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.580
and it came to me one night. I thought, I remember as a kid, uh,

209
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.260
you ever do that wheelbarrow race thing where somebody holds your feet and

210
00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:05.020
you're walking on your hands, you know, I thought mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; well,

211
00:11:05.021 --> 00:11:08.140
if we do something like that and have like puppetetered legs in the back mm-hmm

212
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.420
&lt;affirmative&gt; so if the reality is, if you really see the,

213
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.980
the full Wolf there's feet sticking out of his, he's got uh,

214
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.180
two legs sticking out. But we had,

215
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.610
'em like on a platform with wheel and the back legs were puppeteiered with

216
00:11:19.611 --> 00:11:21.890
little rods, you know? So you never, you know,

217
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:24.610
the back and the back legs come in. That's when you cut, you know,

218
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:25.603
&lt;laugh&gt; right, right, right.

219
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:29.050
And a lot of the stuff like inpicly circus and the big bus crash and stuff. Yes.

220
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.610
That's me a wheelchair with a, with a head with John pushed me down the street.

221
00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:33.843
Wow. Just.

222
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.210
<v 0>You know, that was a great scene. God, that was a great scene. Yeah. Oh,</v>

223
00:11:37.211 --> 00:11:40.000
and wwolf comes of the, the, the, the porn theater.

224
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:40.920
<v 1>Porn theater. Yeah.</v>

225
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:41.760
<v 0>Which the fights.</v>

226
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.200
<v 1>The guy in the head that script, I think was the only script that, uh,</v>

227
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.560
I've worked on in my entire career,

228
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:49.760
that the script that I read was basically the script we made.

229
00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.640
The only difference was when John wrote the script originally, uh,

230
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.240
that Aero cinema, uh, in, in piccadly circus was a cartoon cinema.

231
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.520
Oh. And in the original script, it was a cartoon cinema. But when we got there,

232
00:12:01.521 --> 00:12:05.680
it was a porno cinema. So he changed that scene, you know, to a porno cinema.

233
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.750
Other than that,

234
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.800
it's the SA the script is basically verbatim what he wrote as a 20 year old and

235
00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:13.510
his use of music and everything was groundbreaking at the time.

236
00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:15.830
People didn't do like the way he did, you know, and.

237
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.670
<v 0>His friend that kept returning Jack more RO more and more rotten every</v>

238
00:12:20.671 --> 00:12:23.670
time. Like that was a genius idea as well. Yeah.

239
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:27.150
Like that Jack had explained to him like, Hey man, you gotta kill yourself.

240
00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:29.230
You're warol if you're gonna kill a bunch of people. Yeah.

241
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.230
Like it was so everything about it was so unique, it was a,

242
00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:37.100
it completely Ely flipped the whole idea of what a Wherewolf movie was on its

243
00:12:37.101 --> 00:12:37.980
head. Yeah. And.

244
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.420
<v 1>And, and it worked, you know, and, and Griffin who, who played Jack,</v>

245
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.580
when I first made him up in that makeup, uh, he,

246
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.020
as I was putting the stuff on, you know, in the makeup chair,

247
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.380
he's kinda like getting more and more sad and like sinking down in the chair

248
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.090
and, and it's like, what's wrong, Griffin is something wrong. And he goes,

249
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.810
look at me, you know? And I go, yeah. And he goes, uh, look at me,

250
00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:03.090
this is my big break. And I, I mean, I, you, my throats torn out and I mean,

251
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:06.570
nobody's gonna look at me, you know? And it's like, did you read the script?

252
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.970
Yeah. Didn't it say your throat was torn out. Yeah. He goes, but I DIDNT,

253
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.850
I didn't think it would look like this. And he go, I did &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

254
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.720
's what John thought it should. He was bummed out. Well, he was at first,

255
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:20.760
you know, um, cuz it is it's disturbing to see, you know, but it's a great role.

256
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.560
Yeah. No. And he was brilliant and he, he was terrific to work with, you know,

257
00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.560
but the initial shock of seeing himself torn up right.

258
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.640
Was it was hard for him to take, you know, this's so realistic. Yeah. But,

259
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.040
but he, you know, I thought, okay, I gotta call John was in England. Um,

260
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:38.190
he scouting locations. And uh, so I said, you know, you gotta talk to Griffin,

261
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.230
he's, you know, kind of upset about what he looks like, you know? And &lt;laugh&gt;,

262
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.030
uh, but you know, I took that opportunity, uh,

263
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:47.870
being the sensitive guy that I am to tell him that the third part of his

264
00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.150
transformation was he, it was actually gonna be a puppet.

265
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.350
It wasn't gonna really gonna be him because he was supposed to become,

266
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.700
be basically talking skeleton. Right. You know,

267
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.420
and the makeup process is an additive process and, and, you know,

268
00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.980
he would have to be a huge skull to look right. You know,

269
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.540
and he wasn't too happy about that either, but I said,

270
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.220
but I want you to operate the mouth because you're doing the lips sink,

271
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.380
you know, you're, you're doing the voice and you, you know,

272
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.490
so he operated a puppet, but he, he turned out to be a great guy, you know, and,

273
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:21.010
and, and he, I thought he was brilliant in the film and, and you know,

274
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.670
the whole film.

275
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.210
<v 0>You know, the film's amazing. And it's funny too. That's one,</v>

276
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.730
one of the things that's interesting about the film, it's like, it's silly,

277
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.610
but horrific like the violence and the, the, the,

278
00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:35.010
the explosive scenes of the warol ripping people apart.

279
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.080
But then some of it is hilarious.

280
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.080
<v 1>Well, that whole sequence in the porno theater with all the dead people,</v>

281
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.200
bloody pipe, I mean, when we were, when we were filming it, I was kind of going,

282
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:47.560
is this funny? &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, is this gonna work was.

283
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.400
<v 0>Funny. Yeah. It was a welcome sort of comic relief from the,</v>

284
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.720
the graphic horror of the, the wwolf tearing people apart. Yeah.

285
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:57.160
<v 1>Yeah. And, you know, it's,</v>

286
00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.240
I think it's a brilliant film and it's a brilliant film and it changed my life.

287
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.840
I mean, I got my first Oscar for that film, you know, and, and, uh, I mean,

288
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.520
so fortunate to me that, that John came into my life and this,

289
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.070
this happened because of Don post studios that I talked about, uh, or I,

290
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:15.150
they made the Halloween masks. Um,

291
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:20.150
John was a male boy at Fox, uh, for a while.

292
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.230
And he knew John Chambers, he would deliver mail to the John Chambers.

293
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:25.270
He did the planet of the AVEs makeup.

294
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.230
And he talked to John Chambers at first about doing schlock. And John said,

295
00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:32.220
well, I need, you know, $250,000 in the budget of the whole film,

296
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.940
I think was $30,000. You know? So, uh,

297
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.140
I think he just basically didn't wanna deal with this hyperactive kid, you know?

298
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.100
And so he sent him to Don post studios and Don post, uh, you know, said, well,

299
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.180
same thing. And they didn't really want to deal with his kid. And, and they had,

300
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.290
it would be way too much money, you know? Right. But they said,

301
00:15:52.291 --> 00:15:54.050
there's a kid who comes in here and buys materials.

302
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:57.410
I used to go there to buy materials because in those days now there' are stores

303
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:59.130
that sell all the supplies that you need. Right.

304
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.770
That I used to have to drive all over California to get what I need and some

305
00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:06.210
stuff they would only sell you in a 55 gallon drum, which I couldn't afford,

306
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.930
you know, like polyurethan polyurethane foam,

307
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:13.120
which is a two part foam that foams up, uh, chemically reaction, foams it up,

308
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:18.000
makes sign, had gas when it foams, which nobody told me &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

309
00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:21.000
but Don post would, you know, pour him in a, can you go, here you go, kid.

310
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.840
You know? And first time I used it in my bedroom, I, I practically died.

311
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.120
&lt;laugh&gt; really, yeah. And I have a real strong, I, it,

312
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.080
I have a very strong allergic reaction to it now when it, um, because of that.

313
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.590
Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I mean, my throat closed up. I could hardly breathe and whoa,

314
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.110
and I didn't know what was going on. And I found out what it was,

315
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.990
but Don can sci Jesus. Yeah. But because of that, because I left that,

316
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:44.470
that's the only time in my life. I actually had a business card, you know,

317
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.870
and John says, you know, it said Rick B baker monster maker,

318
00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:48.710
but I think it said, Rick B baker makeup artist, you know,

319
00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:51.390
but I gave a card and some pictures to Don post.

320
00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.180
And when they were trying to get rid of this kid who wanted a funky gorilla suit

321
00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:57.340
thing, you know, they said, well, this guy's made some gorilla suits.

322
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.460
Why don't you talk to him? Oh. And John lived in Westwood, uh,

323
00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:04.060
near the cemetery there, the veteran cemetery. And he had drove out to covinna.

324
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.660
And again, I was still pretty shy at that point in my bedroom at that point was,

325
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.660
you know, I had,

326
00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.460
I slept on a convertible sofa cuz I had gotten enough money to buy one.

327
00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:16.330
And so I could fold it up and have more floor space to work,

328
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.970
but my masks and my had work tables everywhere, you know? And,

329
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.170
and John is very loud and, and, and, and, uh, hyperactive and,

330
00:17:25.171 --> 00:17:28.250
and he was coming in and he was flipping out over the stuff that I made,

331
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.370
you know, and like touching it and stuff. And I'm going, oh, you know,

332
00:17:31.371 --> 00:17:35.560
it's like this, guy's in my room. He's touching my, and it is really scaring me,

333
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:40.120
you know, but I mean, thank God. I mean, American WOL, you know,

334
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.480
put me on the map. And I mean, I, I,

335
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.520
I did coming to America and my introduction to, to Eddie Murphy was, you know,

336
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.560
and I did a lot of films with Eddie and because of John,

337
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.160
I actually met my wife Sylvia on, on a John Landis film, um,

338
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:59.400
where he had me play a, um, originally it was a, uh, Jesus freak.

339
00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.640
It was a film called into the night and it was all filmed at night. And we,

340
00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.080
and met my wife on Hollywood Boulevard in front of Frederick's the Hollywood,

341
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.750
uh, in the middle of the night and turned out I,

342
00:18:09.751 --> 00:18:11.070
they changed it to a dope dealer.

343
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.350
I was playing a dope dealer and Sylvia was the hair stylist on the film.

344
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.510
And John came in and says, I want you to be in the movie.

345
00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.910
I want you to play the part you were born to play a. You know,

346
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.430
so my wife was a in the background, you know, uh, and there's a picture of us.

347
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.830
It's in, in the book actually on the night we met in front of Fred's,

348
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:31.140
Holly would, uh, oh, that's cool. And you know,

349
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:35.900
now we have two amazing children and, and, uh, and, and a great life. And,

350
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.780
you know, I owe John.

351
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:41.020
<v 0>A lot. Well, you and John made magic. He really did. I mean, that,</v>

352
00:18:41.021 --> 00:18:43.300
that movie was so good. You know, and as we said,

353
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.540
one of the things about that film is it's,

354
00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.020
it was so strategic in its use of the Warwolf. Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know,

355
00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:51.930
that you, you really, when you got a chance to see it,

356
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:53.930
like one of my favorite scenes was when the guy,

357
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:56.210
the businessman is in the subway, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

358
00:18:56.211 --> 00:18:58.610
and he's running away from the WOL and you know, it's chasing him,

359
00:18:58.611 --> 00:18:59.530
but you don't see it. Mm.

360
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.650
And you don't see it until he's stumbling on the escalator.

361
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:03.930
And then you see it at the bottom of the escalator, just for a second, second,

362
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:06.810
just walking into the frame, just walking into the frame. And you're like. Yeah.

363
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.490
And they cut.

364
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.970
<v 1>Right before he see his feet sticking out his with the,</v>

365
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.760
that was the thing with the design of the world as well.

366
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:16.280
Cuz because John said he wasn't gonna show it. I normally you would,

367
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.840
when you do something, that's gonna be an animattronic charact.

368
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.040
You kind of sculpted in a neutral position and you let the mechanism, uh,

369
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:26.400
make the expressions. But uh,

370
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.360
from my experience in other films,

371
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.910
the editor doesn't necessarily choose moment where you think it's the best

372
00:19:31.911 --> 00:19:35.190
expression, you know? Mm. And I thought if it's only gonna be on for a second,

373
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.270
I want it to be scary looking.

374
00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:42.230
So I sculpted in a scary expression on it, which I normally wouldn't do.

375
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.430
Uh, I just, so there was no way that it wasn't gonna look scary when we saw it.

376
00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:46.920
Right, right.

377
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.390
<v 0>Right. Snarling. Yeah.</v>

378
00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:58.220
<v 2>I.</v>
