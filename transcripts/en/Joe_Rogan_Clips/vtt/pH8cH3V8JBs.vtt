00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.090
<v 0>I don't know acting. I'm sorry, man. You're there 16 hour days.</v>

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.470
And I don't think that's as satisfying, no matter who you are.

3
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.250
And also it's so fake that puts on a little act,

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.500
but also the trap is having a persona.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.190
I showed up in New York and I decided to start wearing Kangol hats backwards.

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.480
They look good on me.

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.370
I decided I'm going to be a good looking at them because I saw some actor it's

8
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:32.300
too busy for Dora Noah. Barets. This is the masters.

9
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.410
If you wear a Baret, I'm going to throw in a French braid,

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.670
throwing you in a flying headlock Brock Lesnar.

11
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:40.820
<v 2>If you have a bra and a cigarette holder, like hunter S Thompson.</v>

12
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.110
Now I kind of like you,

13
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:45.890
if you're a dandy and you have an ear trumpet and a cigarette holder. Now,

14
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:50.160
I like you. I have a hard time with dudes who wear vests me too. I do want,

15
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.130
I do want to dress like, like a, like a Cuban gentlemen at the end of the day,

16
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.060
I want to wear linen suits and I want to smoke fine cigars.

17
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.800
There is the aura pipe. There is part of me. I like to smoke cigars. Never,

18
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.550
ever, ever. So what's stopping you. I don't know, just a store down the street.

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.150
I just saw that she got some cigarettes. This is a joint, bro. Oh, Jesus.

20
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.090
A blunt. Yeah, I like that.

21
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.150
<v 0>Yeah. It's tobacco on the outside. Really?</v>

22
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.210
It was the that crashed the Tesla stock brought it down.

23
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.430
So it kind of hurt my lungs, man. Is it mostly weed? Oh yeah, the insides. We'd

24
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.930
get a little,

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.490
little head rush from the tobacco and then they get a little.

26
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.863
<v 1>Glue.</v>

27
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.780
<v 0>Little life.</v>

28
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm such a lightweight life inside of the brain because of the marijuana.

29
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.490
If we only had some wine, perfect pink breakouts and fine whiskey.

30
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.880
I don't have any glasses and we'll be all right.

31
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.880
Or we could just drink out of the glass. Like gentlemen,

32
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.850
I got to the bottle of mean, yeah, we have cups. You have to get out of here.

33
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.560
No. Alright. I never have to

34
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.880
keep talking about, oh, sorry. I'm here. Um,
