WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, Duncan,</v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:08.200
you now have a successful Netflix show number two in the country on IMDB.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.000
<v 1>It on rotten tomatoes, whatever it's. Yeah, well,</v>

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.240
I same thing and I don't know what that means necessarily, but yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.200
It's true. I can't believe it. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.200
<v 0>Is, is IMDB even TV shows it's internet movie database.</v>

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.110
<v 1>Is it it's I'm not sure what it is. I, I it's like imubb's odd, but yeah,</v>

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.990
the show you a successful show, I guess right now it seems like people like it.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.670
It is so.

10
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.310
<v 0>Weird, dude. Your show is so weird. Yeah, man. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. It's so dunking.</v>

11
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:36.310
It's the most dunking thing you've ever done? Yes.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.830
<v 1>It is. It really is great. I got lucky that they let me do that too. You know,</v>

13
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.220
that's cuz they let it's cuz Netflix, you know,

14
00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:43.620
tell people the name of it real quick. Uh,

15
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.900
it's called the midnight gospel and um, you know,

16
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.980
I've watched some of your episodes where you're talking about the way things are

17
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.420
changing cuz a podcast or streaming or whatever.

18
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.420
And I think like the fact that the show exists is a Testament to that that

19
00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:59.220
change because you know,

20
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.810
a subscription based service versus like, uh,

21
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.770
any other old TV, they've got a lot more creative freedom and they, they,

22
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:10.890
they could take bigger risks right. Than, you know,

23
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.850
coming into a look at that. &lt;laugh&gt;'s.

24
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.290
<v 0>So crazy. &lt;laugh&gt; look at the keyboard with the witch hat. Oh my God.</v>

25
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:21.410
That's so crazy. That's so dunking. Yeah. And.

26
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.080
<v 1>And yeah, and it's like Pendleton ward who made adventure time.</v>

27
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.960
He L he listens to my podcast and he just, I don't know,

28
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:33.360
we had a really great collaboration and he that's a lot of Pendleton and it's a

29
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:38.040
lot of like 150 other people at tipmount studios. Uh,

30
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.840
like Jesse Monahan, like just these brilliant people,

31
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.110
like Mayfield or like who, just one of the also by the way,

32
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.470
a non-equier or is when we were making it at tent miles.

33
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:54.230
One of the really weird things was walking by an animator and they're watching

34
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.870
your podcast while they animate the midnight gospel. You know,

35
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.750
it's one of those weird, and it's not like a dejavu, but it's like,

36
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.700
that's my friend, but that's, you know,

37
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:07.420
that that's just so many odd moments like that, but yeah,

38
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:10.660
that's not just that's whenever you see any animated thing,

39
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:15.220
you're looking at a squadron of brilliant eccentric

40
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.160
artists here.

41
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.180
<v 0>Or Asian slaves. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.500
<v 1>A lot of people don't know that they send it overseas and we,</v>

43
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:24.010
they didn't send ours out. They let us do it in house. That's.

44
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.850
<v 0>So nice to know. You're not supporting Asian slavery. Is it really.</v>

45
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.983
<v 1>Slaves?</v>

46
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.010
<v 0>I don't know if it's slaves, but I mean,</v>

47
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.890
if you're working for 5 cents an hour and you, you live there, you know,

48
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:36.610
there there's people that live in bunks. If you you've seen those,

49
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.130
those setups where they have for some of the cell phone factories or they have

50
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.160
bunk beds. Oh yeah. And, these people just live in these dorm. Yeah. You know,

51
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:47.240
the Foxcon thing with the Netar on the building,

52
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.920
I keep people from jumping off like, yeah. They they're BA I mean,

53
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.754
they're not slave.

54
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.760
<v 1>Slaves is Foxcon Chinese. Yes. It's actually a very good company,</v>

55
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.160
the best company ever. And I'm just saying that like, oh,

56
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.720
some people think I'm a Chinese shell or something. I got this side of.

57
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.900
<v 0>Press.</v>

58
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.840
How long before someone gets one of those animation things tattooed all over

59
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:05.440
their body, it's gonna happen for sure.

60
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.520
Someone's gonna do their whole back with that DJ. I know, man.

61
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.520
I know heard that picture again. That actually would look pretty dope if you,

62
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.480
uh, if you do get that done, shout me out on the Instagram. Woo. I'll find it.

63
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.350
Thank you.

64
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.390
<v 1>Yeah. Somebody tweeted it at me that my biggest decision at 2020 is gonna be,</v>

65
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:25.710
when do I get a tattoo of Clancy on my body? &lt;laugh&gt; which is pretty awesome.

66
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.030
That's Clancy. The one with the hat. That's Clancy. Yeah.

67
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.190
That looks like a Clancy. That's a Clancy for sure. Yeah.

68
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.150
<v 0>That's hilarious, dude. That's a, that someone is getting that for sure. Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 1>I, I, I mean, it's, it's the R these,</v>

70
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.740
these are the folks who worked on this, man. We're talking like, these are like,

71
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.900
that's the fan art already. Some of the fan art is just amazing.

72
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.140
This is fan art already. That's fan art. Yeah. That's fan art. Oh.

73
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.420
People have been drawing. Clncing all these different ways. It's so cool. Man.

74
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.860
<v 0>Could have that one above it to the left. Jamie. This one. Yeah.</v>

75
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.010
That's from the show that looks like it could be a back tattoo.

76
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.490
<v 1>Yeah, that would be awesome.</v>

77
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.850
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; just a giant back tattoo of Clancy. I mean, when like.</v>

78
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.290
<v 1>Doing animation and you know, I'll never be able to look even if a, if, if a,</v>

79
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.450
if an animated series, if I don't like it,

80
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:19.810
if the plot's weird to me or whatever, I'll never be able to be like, whatever,

81
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.270
man,

82
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:25.240
when you realize how much and how many people go into like have to do

83
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.120
just one frame,

84
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.080
how much time goes into just a milliseconds and how many people are sitting in

85
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:34.640
these rooms that are lit specifically. So you see all the colors,

86
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.400
having like real deep conversations and, and debates over like,

87
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.510
you know what, or they should make a pizza cutter in the show. Like how, like,

88
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.150
what should the shade of gray be for this one specific area?

89
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.830
So much thought goes into that. And that's part of making one of these things.

90
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.231
It's,

91
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:57.190
it's called the dailies where you'll sit and you'll watch tiny,

92
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.180
tiny little bits of the show. And like, you have to S every single frame,

93
00:05:02.181 --> 00:05:04.900
you have to look for continuity problems. And like,

94
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.340
you gotta catch all these little things that I, you know, I'm not an animator,

95
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:09.861
obviously.

96
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:13.420
So I'd be sitting there in like Pendleton or Mike Mayfield would be like,

97
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.980
can you go back two frames? It looks to me like, there's a, these like,

98
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:22.170
have an animator language. You know, they're like, looks to me like a, uh,

99
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.610
there's some kind of warble on the 28th, uh, pixel there. And you're like,

100
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:31.410
what the? Whoa. And they CA they have the eye to catch, like the tiniest,

101
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.450
tiniest, like tiniest thing that's off. And you have to cuz otherwise, you know,

102
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:38.370
once it's up there, it's up there. Jesus,

103
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.160
I know it's ma it's ma it's literal magic. It's like 10 mouse studios you did.

104
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:44.600
That is like, you know,

105
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.480
I would go in there so stoned and I would just start getting that feeling of

106
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:51.880
like, this is a temple. I don't think this is even a,

107
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.240
you could call this a studio as much as it's a temple. I mean, why,

108
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.520
why wouldn't you call it a temple? And then you see all these people, you know,

109
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.200
focusing their life, energy on essentially like bringing a thing to life.

110
00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:07.280
Like Clancy is alive. Now that's a living being in some,

111
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.160
in this universe who lives, you know, in that medium of animation, that's.

112
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.440
<v 0>A good way to put it. Right. Yeah. It almost seems like that. Right.</v>

113
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.270
That's why people get so upset that if you change a character's behavior,

114
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.750
like what are you doing? Yeah. You have this thing gave birth to this thing.

115
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.270
<v 1>Yeah. That's right. You. And that,</v>

116
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.310
that is also why you need a huge team of people who love, love the characters.

117
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.430
So, because it's easy,

118
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.790
like there would be times I would suggest a thing that would make Clancy seem

119
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.190
like too mean.

120
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.220
Cuz these not mean you don't like the moment a character seems like that. No.

121
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.860
Like it loses all like ability people are like, what a? You know, Nancy, he's.

122
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.820
<v 0>Alive to you. You're like, he's, he's not, meanran's not mean he is alive.</v>

123
00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:50.500
You're like, it's like, you're talking about your, your brother or something.

124
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.180
<v 1>He's like my little brother. I think of him as my little brother. Yeah. He.</v>

125
00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.250
<v 0>Represents you in a weird way. There's something about what they captured. Go,</v>

126
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.210
go to that image again. Well, I got, just give me around.

127
00:07:03.211 --> 00:07:06.090
Don't gimme the one with his head in a vagina. &lt;laugh&gt; give it's.

128
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.003
<v 1>Actually.</v>

129
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.120
<v 0>With him.</v>

130
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.050
There's something about one of the first couple of images that you pulled up.

131
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.890
They, they look like you. Yeah man.

132
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.080
And I don't mean they look like you &lt;affirmative&gt; I mean like yeah.

133
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.800
Duncan's thoughts. That's a dunkcan thought. Yeah. You know what I mean?

134
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.200
Like he looks like a fake guy that you would create.

135
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.560
Like it kind of perfectly fits.

136
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.520
<v 1>I, I don't, I, that, that is another, the magical aspects of animation. Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.790
Which is, I don't know how they do that. Like the, the, the spoiler spoil you.

138
00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:40.950
Haven't seen it. Put your fingers in your ears. Spoiler.

139
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:43.910
I'm sorry if this is a spoiler. Uh, the last, well,

140
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:44.750
it's not too much of a sport.

141
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:49.750
The last episode is the podcast I did with my mom when she was about

142
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:54.590
three, three weeks away from passing on. And uh, you know,

143
00:07:54.591 --> 00:07:58.470
they never met my mom and, but they did the exact same thing with her.

144
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.900
&lt;affirmative&gt; so suddenly I'm watching, you know, her like, and not her,

145
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.820
like I'm looking at a VI, a, a video of her,

146
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.220
but looking at her like her, like they got her spirit in there somehow.

147
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.620
And that was one that, that is just a Testament to the me,

148
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.620
to the medium of animation. Cuz they that's one of the things it can do,

149
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.130
you know, it can grab a spirit and hold it inside the art.

150
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.690
And like that spirit is alive somehow, somehow. Right.

151
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.410
<v 0>Yeah. I agree with you in some weird way. It's like,</v>

152
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.570
I wouldn't agree with you in a technical sense, but in a sense of like,

153
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.050
well it is affecting the things it comes in contact with at least through a one

154
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.120
way dimension, right? Yeah. Like the, the things it's a as hit people,

155
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.360
the animation, it seems like it's a living thing. I know it's not, I,

156
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.480
I'm not stupid. I'm not that stupid. Yeah. I'm a little stupid,

157
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.560
but it seems like you.

158
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:52.440
<v 1>Well, it's not biologically alive for.</v>

159
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.720
<v 0>Sure. It's, it's sort of like there's, there's an art to doing that.</v>

160
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.480
That we maybe don't know cuz we're not. I mean, I,

161
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.160
I used to draw a little, but I, I'm not really good. You know what I mean?

162
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:06.120
Like a really good artist.

163
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.280
There's something that they can do where they just can kind of capture you

164
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.990
in like a little symbol, like thing,

165
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.030
a little character they CA but they capture you in there somehow.

166
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.750
<v 1>Yeah man. That's, you know, Pendleton, like when you he'll you,</v>

167
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.230
when you watch him draw it's would be easy to think, man,

168
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.190
I could totally do that. &lt;laugh&gt; cause I'd watch him, you know, he would,

169
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.190
I just, you know, we would, he would just draw and you watch these beautiful,

170
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.820
these drawings that are just Pendleton, there's his art, you know? And like,

171
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.260
then I would see that and be like, ah,

172
00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:42.260
maybe I'll try to draw a little penleton war. And then it's like, what the hand?

173
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.293
I can't do it.

174
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.820
Cause it's so SIM like on one level it looks so what's so powerful about it is

175
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:51.700
how simple it is. It's very similar to standup. Uh,

176
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.940
the way Pendleton is treating, working on the show,

177
00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:59.930
which is one cool things about him is like his ability to cut the fat and get

178
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.770
right to the like simple point.

179
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.170
That's where the power is when you're drawing something or telling a story or

180
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:11.490
whatever. The more complexity that gets added to it, not to say the show,

181
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:14.570
it doesn't have like chaos and wild psychedelic stuff.

182
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:19.320
But any decision we made ended up like any decision you made

183
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:22.160
creatively in anything it's like, what am I trying to say?

184
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.160
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, what is, what is the,

185
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.880
the artery that is running through this that I'm trying to express and then,

186
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.480
uh, getting as close to that as you can, uh, and then,

187
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.080
and putting it out there without put, cuz otherwise you, it,

188
00:10:35.081 --> 00:10:38.230
the whole thing gets blur to buy all the, um,

189
00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.430
I guess you could say like extra bells and whistles,

190
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:43.190
you might wanna attach to it. Mm. You know?

191
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:45.190
Mm that's something you taught me too with standup man.

192
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:50.110
Like how important it is to just like cut, just trim the fat trim,

193
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.550
the fat. Mm. And that's a sad thing to do with comedy.

194
00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:58.100
When you think you got a nice eight minute bit &lt;laugh&gt; that's like a two minute

195
00:10:58.270 --> 00:10:59.420
maybe, but you.

196
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.700
<v 0>You know, instead of youve got stretched out too wide. Yeah. But the,</v>

197
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.220
the two minutes would be great though. That's the thing you, you just have to,

198
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:09.980
you have to understand that you're growing attached to, you know,

199
00:11:09.981 --> 00:11:12.700
it's the writer's expression. Kill your babies. Yeah.

200
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.100
It's very difficult to kill your babies when you create something that's you can

201
00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:18.650
get attached to it. There's a lot, its that I left on the table,

202
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.250
left on the cutting room floor. I was like, this has to be chopped up.

203
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.890
It just is too wordy. I'm too verbose. It's too. This it's too.

204
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:28.050
That it's too long. Why do I think so much about this?

205
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.250
Why I I'm not showing a real reason why I'm so connected to this.

206
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.730
So I just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop. It's hard. Yeah.

207
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:36.770
But it almost always works better.

208
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.680
<v 1>Always have almost, always, always, almost, always. Almost always.</v>

209
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.440
If it doesn't, it's not whatever your idea was. Probably wasn't that good?

210
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:44.140
Like sometimes.

211
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.960
<v 0>You need a setup though. Sometimes the setup isn't funny.</v>

212
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.760
Like there's guys that it's not my style,

213
00:11:48.761 --> 00:11:52.840
but there's guys that'll tell like perbilia is greatd it tells stories,

214
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.880
you know like there's and you're you're enenttrapped in the narrative of the

215
00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.640
story you're capturing this. It's a very different thing.

216
00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.440
It's equally entertaining. It's equally funny.

217
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.880
Like when it gets to the punchline,

218
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.160
but there's a difference between that and say like Burr, right?

219
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.840
Burr is hitting you with punchline and this guy,

220
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:13.790
guy with a thing and BA BA yeah.

221
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.470
And he's another guy that like your friends drawing,

222
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:20.430
like you would hear ber talk and you go, well, I can talk too.

223
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.870
Seems like he's just talking. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

224
00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.390
You don't realize this is like an, a masterpiece of,

225
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:31.030
of syllables and pauses and the right amount of outrage and

226
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:34.980
segueing it in and hitting you with this at the end and yeah.

227
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.300
All these things that have put it together that make a great bill bur a bit.

228
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:43.380
It's like, if you don't know, it's hard to draw what he's drawn.

229
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.500
Yeah. It's hard. It seems like it's simple lines, but go,

230
00:12:46.501 --> 00:12:50.900
go to that picture again. Like the, everything is beautiful about it.

231
00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:52.300
Like look at the perspective.

232
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.650
It's like the kids perfectly sandwiched in the front,

233
00:12:56.651 --> 00:13:01.130
there's the dog and the triangle in the world. It's like, that's not just,

234
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.810
it's simple in the sense that it's just not like, it looks like a real person.

235
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.651
Yeah. You know,

236
00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:10.010
like we look at drawing sometimes like as the realistic ones or the really good

237
00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:13.050
ones. Like we have cameras now. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

238
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:17.000
Just this to me sometimes is more interesting. It's like you're drawing some.

239
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.080
That's definitely not real.

240
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.320
<v 1>Yeah. Well that, you know what, that's not that.</v>

241
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:22.920
So when we were coming up with that, that we had to come up with a character.

242
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.480
Yeah. And so what's really fascinating about it is, you know,

243
00:13:26.481 --> 00:13:30.840
this character goes into a multiverse simulator and chooses a new avatar for

244
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.880
every place that he goes. So it's like, he, he,

245
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.430
so you have that take that character and put it in a completely

246
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:43.150
different drawing that is that character and still maintain the body

247
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.230
language that you're maintaining in that character to produce continuity.

248
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.310
That's one of the challenges of the show is like,

249
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:54.470
and also the conversations you end up having just to come up with like, um,

250
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:59.500
the, you know, the CA his hat or his what's he gonna wear, like, for example,

251
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.500
here's how cool pen is and how much he loves. Like people who love adventure.

252
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.900
Time is one of the things he was saying is, you know,

253
00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:11.500
people are probably gonna want to Coplay Clancy at ComicCon stuff

254
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.850
and, and he doesn't have any, he doesn't have anything to carry thing.

255
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.050
He doesn't have pockets. So if people are cosplaying him,

256
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.170
they're not gonna have anywhere. They could put their stuff. So &lt;laugh&gt;,

257
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.850
we should, let's give him like a, a bag.

258
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.010
And so that's little Clancy ended up with his cool bag that he carries around.

259
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.023
Oh yeah.

260
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.250
<v 0>My God. For the causeplay yeah.</v>

261
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.560
<v 1>Man, for the, for the people respect to the streets. Exactly.</v>

262
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:46.520
<v 2>I.</v>
