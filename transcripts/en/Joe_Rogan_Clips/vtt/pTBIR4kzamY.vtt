00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What kind of steroids were dudes doing back then?</v>

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.940
<v 1>Uh, I mean, basic, you know, you got, you know,</v>

3
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:14.930
your tests, uh, D ball, uh,

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.980
it's just basic stuff, you know? And back then, you know,

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.910
because the da come in, uh, and you know,

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.250
what was trying to find out what we all doing. They, they,

7
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:30.080
they may able to do it legally. So I'll, you know,

8
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:34.640
you have to go to the doctor and get all these prescriptions and you would get

9
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:35.210
prescriptions.

10
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.110
<v 0>For steroids. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.600
What kind of steroids would they give you a prescription for? Yeah.

12
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.820
<v 1>Any kind of test you need it. They would get growth hormone.</v>

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.130
They give prescription codes. Once the da came in, they was like,

14
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.040
what are y'all doing? What are y'all taking?

15
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.540
<v 0>Like the DEA shouldn't you be out there catching people, selling meth.</v>

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.700
Why are you going after bodybuilders? Who were also cops? Cause they had kids.

17
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.150
<v 1>Out there where they were taking it and committing suicide.</v>

18
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.440
Oh see, I didn't know what that was when I was a kid.

19
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060
<v 0>They were committing suicide because they were getting depressed from the</v>

20
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.100
steroids or coming off of it, coming off of.

21
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.310
<v 1>It. Yeah. So they trying to figure out, you know,</v>

22
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.220
what are y'all doing on what w

23
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.290
we, we, we, we gotta get y'all off this stuff.

24
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.730
<v 0>And so that's when you got a doctor that was willing to prescribe everything.</v>

25
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.000
So this was this while you're doing Mr. Olympia. Yeah.

26
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.030
So all that stuff was above board was all legal.

27
00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.920
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Everything was legal back then.</v>

28
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.870
<v 0>And what is, is that the case now?</v>

29
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.490
<v 1>I, I, you know what, that was just when the heat was on, you know, I don't know.</v>

30
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.690
I don't, I don't think they got the heat on the, hit on the guys down like that.

31
00:01:53.691 --> 00:01:54.410
Now.

32
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.370
<v 0>DEA will come to you and you just say, Hey, here's my prescriptions. Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.900
And there we go. All right. Yeah.

34
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.180
<v 1>One time you didn't, if you didn't have prescription, they took your stuff.</v>

35
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.463
Really? Yeah.

36
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.230
<v 0>So they find whatever you had take it from you. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.330
<v 1>Hmm, yup. How did they know where it was? You told them. Oh, okay.</v>

38
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.550
Because otherwise they put you in jail. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't search your house,

39
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.020
you know, get a search warrant, but I got this and this and that.

40
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.900
<v 0>You would have to take something to be as big as you were when you were at your</v>

41
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.200
peak. It's not really possible to be big.

42
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.020
<v 1>Now without it. No, no,</v>

43
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.610
you can't get that B [inaudible] nothing got to have to it's

44
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:42.110
genetics. Yes.

45
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.240
Look at the baseball players that have taken stuff and look at us.

46
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.770
Yeah. You know, they didn't, they can't get that big. They not gifted for it.

47
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.610
Well, they wouldn't.

48
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.600
<v 0>Try either. Right. They weren't trying to get that big it guys like can say go,</v>

49
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.770
he got pretty big.

50
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.250
<v 1>They couldn't get that big because they, it to really.</v>

51
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 0>So it's a small percentage of the population that would get that bit. Yeah,</v>

52
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.233
exactly.

53
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.720
<v 1>Yeah. And probably like 1% that could get as big as I got.</v>

54
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.850
And I was the only guy, nobody, uh, duplicated that sense.

55
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.770
And you be in that condition and be healthy right now.

56
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.190
I don't have any health problem. Besides the, you know, the back, the injuries,

57
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.080
the injuries. Yeah. My, my living, my kidneys and my heart. It's all good.

58
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.710
Did.

59
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.600
<v 0>You, while you were doing things, did you get, uh, frequent blood tests?</v>

60
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.050
Every.

61
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.240
<v 1>Every three to four months.</v>

62
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 0>And the doctor would go over it and make sure everything was fine.</v>

63
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.370
Everything was always, everything's always good.

64
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.210
That seems to be the big misconception about steroids is that people think

65
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:45.860
steroids.

66
00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.240
<v 1>Thank you. Taking like tons of stuff.</v>

67
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.420
I wouldn't taking tons of stuff.

68
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.390
I probably wouldn't take no more than what those baseball players were taking.

69
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.650
Um.

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.810
<v 0>Just working out more and working out.</v>

71
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.850
<v 1>Lifting more and gifted genetically for it. Right.</v>

72
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:03.360
Dorian.

73
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.000
<v 0>Yates said basically the same thing. Yeah. It wasn't,</v>

74
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.900
it wasn't that he was taking a lot compared to a lot of, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

75
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.940
<v 1>People think I was taking massive amounts of stuff that if I'd been taking</v>

76
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:17.640
massive mounts and stuff, I wouldn't think I'd still be here.

77
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.390
I don't think I'd be as healthy as I am now. Right. Wow. You know,

78
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.880
besides my back surgery, neck surgery, I'm all good. And like I said,

79
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:31.410
my liver, my kidneys and heart and everything still hold up real good.

80
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.340
<v 0>When you would, uh, get off for that three month period,</v>

81
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.810
would you cycle off of everything?

82
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.320
<v 1>Cold Turkey, cold Turkey. Yeah. Really cold Turkey.</v>

83
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.090
I didn't take anything or nothing.

84
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.220
<v 0>And what did you feel like over those three? Normal.</v>

85
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.820
<v 1>Really? No. Didn't bother me a bit. So you just.</v>

86
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.890
<v 0>You got this great genetics man.</v>

87
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.500
<v 1>Craziest ever. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.440
<v 0>I mean, obviously there's no way you could take all.</v>

89
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.300
<v 1>You know, Turkey. I stopped everything one day. Uh, I be taking, you know,</v>

90
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:03.690
a bunch of stuff next day. Nothing. And your body would just feel normal.

91
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.900
Body felt normal. It didn't bother me a bit. That's so crazy.

92
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:10.890
I didn't get depressed or nothing, you know? Yeah. It felt normal.

93
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.200
That's just another, yeah. I still was strong. Wow. I can still, you know,

94
00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.610
squat, you know, I could squat, you know, seven, 800 naturally.

95
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.280
Wow. So you.

96
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.040
<v 0>Basically kept a lot of your games. Yup.</v>

97
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.360
<v 1>Yup. My was still 300. I'm still 300 pounds, you know,</v>

98
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.760
without taking all that stuff.

99
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.800
<v 0>And so then after three months,</v>

100
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.830
then you would slowly ramp by slowly ran back up. Yeah.

101
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.930
And all this under doctor supervision.

102
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.350
<v 1>All is under doctor supervision and all, all,</v>

103
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.100
all the while I'm getting my blood work done every three to four months.

104
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.880
<v 0>So a lot of guys after they're done competing,</v>

105
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:54.150
then they have to get on testosterone replacement therapy because the endocrine

106
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.130
systems kind of messed up. Did you have to do as well? Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.820
Yeah. It seems like that's just a part of the sport.

108
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.370
<v 1>Right? Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:05.960
<v 0>It's interesting though,</v>

110
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.260
because like for the longest time these guys were doing these ads and magazines

111
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.460
and they were attributing everything to some supplement that they were selling

112
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.530
or some creatine or some this or all that stuff. It does.

113
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.260
It helps you out a little bit, but it's not going to get you. It's not.

114
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.050
<v 1>Going to get you to 330 pounds with 3% body fat.</v>

115
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.530
<v 0>No, it's definitely not going to do that.</v>

116
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.470
You were allowed to talk about why you were competing.

117
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.450
<v 1>Uh, yeah. I mean, come up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

118
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.420
I talked about it. I didn't, uh, have no reason to hide it.

119
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.283
People.

120
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.450
<v 0>No. When you got that. Yeah.</v>

121
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.320
But it seemed like there was an era where bodybuilding kind of tried to pretend

122
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.370
that they weren't taking them.

123
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.130
<v 1>Because all those people committing suicide and kids</v>

124
00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.960
taking all that stuff and doing it the wrong way, you know,

125
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.440
not having it prescribed and all this kind of stuff.

126
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.840
<v 0>Also the more is black market, the bad.</v>

127
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.790
<v 1>Stuff, you know? Right. Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.270
<v 0>But there were some guys that would just say, well,</v>

129
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.680
the way to win is to take away more than everybody else and see what your body

130
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.340
can tolerate.

131
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.490
<v 1>Yeah. The more you take the better you're going to be.</v>

132
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.640
<v 0>I knew a guy like that and he wound up having a heart attack.</v>

133
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.620
We used to call them garden hoses.

134
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.710
Cause his arms looked like garden hoses for veins.

135
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.220
He had just these giant veins all over his arms deem makes sense.

136
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.110
But he was just on everything.

137
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.280
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But he didn't make it to 30. Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.850
He died before he was 30. Some people. Yeah. They do it the wrong way.

139
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.360
I didn't start taking anything till I was 30. Yeah.

140
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.723
Remember I was,

141
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.520
I was a drug-free for a long time and I did everything naturally for a

142
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:57.580
long, long time because I was next to gifted. Right.

143
00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.080
<v 0>Yeah. What inspired you?</v>

144
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.660
What made you decide when you were 30 that you had to do something?

145
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.630
I got tired of getting my kicked.

146
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.060
<v 1>In competitions. Yeah. The highest I would place for like third or something,</v>

147
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.690
you know, after a while, you know, you competitive and,

148
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.020
you see the other, guy's got a competitive advantage on you.

149
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.840
So let's make this thing equal.

150
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.740
<v 0>Does this something somebody suggested to you? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

151
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.290
So people in the gym like, Hey Ronnie.

152
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.040
<v 1>No one of the competitors suggested that to me,</v>

153
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.570
a guy by the name of flex Wheeler, best friend in the world,

154
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.580
that guy was huge. Huge. He taught me everything. I know.

155
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.840
Did he really? Yeah. He, uh,

156
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.540
also got me the best nutritionist ever.

157
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.980
That's how I won first Olympia.

158
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.910
<v 0>So is that how most guys find out about steroids from other guys who are</v>

159
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:00.744
competing?

160
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:01.940
<v 1>If you were smart,</v>

161
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.230
that's the way you would do somebody that's somebody that I know. Yeah,

162
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.950
yeah. What they're doing and somebody that's successful at it. My

163
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.250
dumb trainer that think they know. Right. You know,

164
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.180
you know, flex has worn, you know, major contests.

165
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.090
And what was the real experience bodybuilder at the time? You know,

166
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:30.440
I'm, I'm new, still new to the sport. I didn't get into it until I was 24.

167
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.760
I think he started probably when he was like 16, 17, somewhere in there.

168
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.870
I never did that kind of stuff. Cause we didn't have it where I was from.

169
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.200
<v 0>How much of a night and day difference was it once you started taking stuff?</v>

170
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.510
<v 1>Uh, as far as the, uh, condition the night and day.</v>

171
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.620
<v 0>Night and day in your ability to work, to put in work? No. No.</v>

172
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.290
<v 1>The only thing changed was conditioning. What do you mean by strength?</v>

173
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.360
Didn't go up there much.
