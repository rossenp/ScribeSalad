00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. And that podcast that you did with Jocko,</v>

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:08.340
when I was listening to me, it changed my whole day.

3
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:12.210
It changed like how I was going to look at my day. I was, you know,

4
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:15.780
instead of like looking at my day, like up it's a normal day, I was thinking,

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.420
God, I'm lucky. God, I'm lucky.

6
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:23.100
And God imagine experiencing what you, and how old were you at the time?

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.620
I was 21, 21 years old.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.630
And experiencing what you experienced in that insane firefight being locked

9
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:34.950
down. And I mean, how many guys did you wind up engaging with?

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.690
<v 1>I, I don't know. I, you know, I don't know. I mean,</v>

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.350
everyone that I got an opportunity with. Right. And it just, you know,

12
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:46.490
it was just, uh, you know, it was so chaotic. I mean, I, you know, I still,

13
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.480
I look, I think about all the time, obviously. Um,

14
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.400
it's something I could have never experienced. I mean,

15
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:54.890
I trained for war every single day when I was in the Marine Corps. I mean,

16
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:55.701
it was what it was,

17
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.700
what my job was and I still could have never imagined that day,

18
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.340
the way it was or anything to turn out. I could've never pictured it.

19
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:05.330
I could've never, and, and I think every day it goes by,

20
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:06.650
I think there's a reckoning of it, right.

21
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:11.480
The way that I seen it that day is not the way I see it today. And, um,

22
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.320
I think that comes with, you know, just, just sharpening and just your body,

23
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.220
you know, you change and you, you see different things in perspective, but yeah,

24
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.990
I mean, you know, I, I, I, you know, that day,

25
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.560
I mean, it's still, I mean, it still is just, you know, just,

26
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.990
it just, there's so many lessons that come from that day that, that, you know,

27
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.810
I look at people complaining about stuff here in America and it's like,

28
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.640
you know, I seen him one day, the best of humans, the worst of humans

29
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.380
and everybody, nobody thought they were wrong

30
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.020
and it's possible, you know, it's just, it's just one of those deals of, of,

31
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.650
you know, that, that day was just.

32
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.000
<v 0>That's an important point. What you just said, nobody thought they were wrong.</v>

33
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.863
Not them.

34
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.960
<v 1>Yeah. You know, I, I, and it changed me that day.</v>

35
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:03.980
Like I walked in there that day and I was the guy who was cocky,

36
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:08.300
who would tell you, you know, I loved fighting. Do you know what I mean?

37
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:12.110
Like I, like, I just want to go fight. Like, you know, but every,

38
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:14.870
every fight I had before that it was like, you know,

39
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:19.100
I always had airplanes or a helicopter sitting, sitting around. I always had,

40
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.770
you know, it, it was like, I'm going to go in there and start the fight.

41
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:25.490
And then I'm going to call in all this other, this other stuff to, to, to win.

42
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:30.020
Right. And, um, that day it wasn't there. And, and,

43
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.850
and literally I walked out of there. And am I,

44
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.780
I just think about all the time today.

45
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:39.470
I just think about all the time of how many generations,

46
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.060
just that day were changed. How many generations of,

47
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.830
of people's lives were changed? You know,

48
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.600
all my teammates died.

49
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.180
So don't ever have kids that generations stopped their families forever.

50
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.660
So many lives were changed that day by that, that, that piece. And guess what?

51
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.080
And everybody in America had no clue it was going on. Like right now,

52
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.030
there are us troops.

53
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.180
Somebody's wondering if they're going to be able to come home and see their

54
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.820
family again, that's reality.

55
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.080
Whether you want to ignore it or not like that's reality.

56
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.310
And that was me September 8th, 2009.

57
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.630
And it was just, um, gosh, it was a chaotic day.

58
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.000
<v 0>It's amazing how you could have, uh,</v>

59
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.830
thousands of days in your life in one day changes the way you look at

60
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:35.664
everything.

61
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.240
<v 1>One day changes the way you look at everything. And, you know,</v>

62
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.390
and like the further I go on, I, I look at it different. You know,

63
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:45.690
I always talk about this story of, um,

64
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.050
you know, whenever this guy came up behind me and I ended up,

65
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.900
I ended up killing him with a rock. And

66
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.160
I always remember just like, I remember it. Like, I see it every night.

67
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:01.890
Like I remember like I just see his face and I got just,

68
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.990
cause there was a point, there was a point that I,

69
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.790
I feel like that anybody that when they, whether they're injured or anything,

70
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:12.750
like they realize they're defeated. Like they like it. Like, I don't know.

71
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.150
I just think there's a point when you look at somebody and they know they're

72
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:18.870
going to die and I'll never forget that. And I, you know,

73
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:23.160
now I look at it and I see it and how we thanked it. Like

74
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.310
this guy is a son to somebody, his mother and father are gonna miss him.

75
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.270
This guy, Hey, he believes in his cause as much as I do,

76
00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.040
he doesn't believe he's wrong. This guy,

77
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.160
this guy, he,

78
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.200
he could've had a wife or kids that are never going to see their father again,

79
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.810
just like, you know, my dad,

80
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.700
might've never seen me again if it was switched and really, I don't even know.

81
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.400
I don't hate him. I don't even know this guy.

82
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.850
We're just here at this place right now,

83
00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:06.590
because we were born in two different countries.

84
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.090
<v 0>When you add a weapons where you out of, out of ammo.</v>

85
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.920
<v 1>So my, no, he had came up and he started choking me. Uh, my,</v>

86
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:20.220
I had shot him once before and he, I was trying to pick my buddy, Donna Lee, my,

87
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.140
my, one of my closest Afghans daughter, Lee had been shot. He, he got killed.

88
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.470
He had been killed and I came around this terrorist to get him and I was on my

89
00:05:27.471 --> 00:05:30.710
knee and this guy came up behind me. And um,

90
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.560
so he didn't have a weapon either. He was, he did, he,

91
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.230
he had a weapon and I ended up shooting him from the ground.

92
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.870
And I thought he was dead when he fell on the ground.

93
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.050
And I kind of moved down and got down with Donna Lee. Cause we,

94
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.900
I was still getting shot at, from this machine gun up on this hill.

95
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.230
And I was trying to make myself small as I could. And um,

96
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.140
this guy ends up coming up with choking me. Like I thought he was,

97
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.890
I thought he was dead and he ends up choking me out.

98
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.480
He starts trying to choke me out and eventually led up a little bit and I ended

99
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:02.180
up getting around him and I just got,

100
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.540
we were fighting back and forth and I can remember all I was thinking about was

101
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:08.450
like, don't let his legs get on me. Like, you know, these guys, their legs are,

102
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.970
I mean, they've been crawling up mountains their whole life. And he was, uh,

103
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.920
he was a pretty big dude. And um,

104
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.510
I just remember getting on top of him finally got on top of him and I ended up,

105
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.830
I was rolling on top of him. He didn't have all the gear on I did. And um,

106
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.530
I ended up, I remember getting on top of him, like,

107
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.620
like I was straddling him and I'm just reaching up,

108
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:32.030
trying to grab for anything I can and I'm holding him and I'm holding him down

109
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:35.120
with my throat, with my forearm and I'm just grabbing anything I can.

110
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.481
And finally,

111
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:38.880
I ended up grabbing a rock and I just started beating this dude space in and I

112
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.030
just started beating and beaten and beaten. And I remember,

113
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.900
I remember just like finally, like after hitting him, you know, I don't know,

114
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.290
three or four times four or five times, whatever. I remember him,

115
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:51.860
like finally just kind of looking at me and like, just it's it's like,

116
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:53.540
he's like just, I'm just looking at him in the eyes,

117
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:57.740
like obviously closer than me to you right now. And you just see all the,

118
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:03.080
you can tell, like he knows where this is going. And I always think about that,

119
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:06.830
you know, um, obviously I would kill him a million times over again. Right. He,

120
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:09.620
he was the enemy. Like I don't feel bad about that part of it,

121
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.620
but I just think about like, in that moment,

122
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.060
if I can find a way to relate to him in that moment, uh, man,

123
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:20.990
I'm taking his life.

124
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.980
We all in America can find a way to connect with each other.

125
00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:27.320
If we don't connect with each other. Cause we choose not to,

126
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.480
I don't care what your differences are. Like.

127
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.450
Don't like find a reason to why we can get along,

128
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:39.320
not why we should not get along. And, and I, I always think about that moment,

129
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:44.200
you know, of this guy and you know, he obviously ended up dying and, and,

130
00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:47.270
and it, what it showed me was is that no,

131
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.400
cause that you have that's built on hate, will survive.

132
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.680
I didn't hate this guy. I didn't even know him,

133
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.780
but I was willing to take his life because of what I

134
00:07:59.781 --> 00:08:03.710
loved. And that's what,

135
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.060
that's what we have to build our lives. And our foundation on is not,

136
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.730
not being angry and hating each other,

137
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.630
but because we love the cause that we believe in so much.

138
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.543
Does that make sense?

139
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.640
<v 0>It does make sense. I understand what you're saying,</v>

140
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.290
the way they look at it and Afghanistan, this, uh, so it's,

141
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.350
is it Al-Qaeda or the Taliban?

142
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.850
<v 1>So Elkhart is, uh, mainly in Arcata was in Iraq.</v>

143
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

144
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.980
So I'll kinda is the issue that's in a wreck and the Taliban in Afghanistan,

145
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:39.940
Afghanistan and the Taliban. What are they trying to do?

146
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:41.380
Are they trying to run a religious calendar?

147
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.300
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, they just want, they, you know,</v>

148
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.480
they wanna run it the way that they want to. Right. Like they want to,

149
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.260
they don't want, they don't believe in, you know, women being educated. They,

150
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.470
I mean, they don't believe in any like, like they don't believe in, you know,

151
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:56.370
they go back to that, their beliefs of, you know,

152
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.020
it's driven by religion of, of all that control they want the, they want to.

153
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.340
<v 0>And how much support did they have from the general population?</v>

154
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:09.530
<v 1>I mean, I think it not, not necessarily the support,</v>

155
00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:12.650
but because I think that it's not necessarily support,

156
00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:14.030
it's the power that they have. Right.

157
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.320
Like they come in and they lead with a heavy hand. Right. I mean, there's these,

158
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.210
they don't, these, these, these, the locals run the place,

159
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.870
but the Taliban is kind of like, look at it like a gang, right.

160
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:31.700
Like kind of like a, like, like a, a mob or, or, or, or like,

161
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.710
um, the Taliban is kinda like, um, the cartel. Right.

162
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.440
Um, and so that's,

163
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.190
that's where they come from and they try to lead with violence and same thing

164
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:45.230
that you would, you know, you would see with the cartel,

165
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.080
Taliban's kind of like an over a big cartel.

166
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:52.760
<v 0>And so the general, the population, they would like that to not be the case.</v>

167
00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.080
I mean, they want us as a system of democracy, similar to what we have.

168
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.370
<v 1>I mean, I don't know what they want that,</v>

169
00:09:58.371 --> 00:10:01.070
but I didn't want something better than of course, like, I mean,

170
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:05.810
I think they all see that they live in shitholes. Right. They all see, you know,

171
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:09.650
I think that they, they, they know what could get, you know,

172
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:13.520
how it could be better and how life could be better. You know? Um,

173
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.880
the cool thing about America is, is that we know what freedom is.

174
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.880
And I promise you this, like, you want to have all the differences stop.

175
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.690
If anybody ever invaded us. I mean, people don't want to give anything up.

176
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:24.710
So they would all start fight.

177
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.450
Everybody would get on the same page and start fighting.

178
00:10:26.451 --> 00:10:28.010
If anybody tried to come to America,

179
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.570
because nobody would want to give up their stuff.

180
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.180
<v 0>Well, post nine 11. Do you remember that? Whether it was a,</v>

181
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:34.590
you were a younger guy, how old were you at nine 11?

182
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.650
<v 1>I was in the eighth grade and I always say,</v>

183
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.670
I would never wish for another nine 11, but I would give anything for a nine,

184
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:44.930
12. I would give anything for a 900. Well.

185
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:49.710
<v 0>It was crazy. Like people were friendly. People were,</v>

186
00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:54.470
were letting people in and traffic people that like American

187
00:10:54.471 --> 00:10:55.304
flags were everywhere.

188
00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.290
<v 1>Everywhere, everywhere. People were proud of America. Like it was, it was crazy.</v>

189
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.860
It was crazy. Like how on in sync, everybody was.

190
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.270
<v 0>It's hard for people who weren't there on those days to understand the mood of</v>

191
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:13.100
the country. It was a different world. Like we, people were patriotic.

192
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.510
Like everybody was.

193
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.970
<v 1>It. I don't necessarily remember what it was like before the day of nine 11.</v>

194
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:24.290
So I don't, I don't have much perspective on that, but I do remember nine, 12.

195
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:28.790
I remember. I mean, everybody was proud to be Americans. I mean, I mean,

196
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.570
it was, everybody was, everybody was proud of our country and who we are,

197
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.800
which had turned it, it was. And, and in that, the way it goes though,

198
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:40.160
like when something tragic happens, like, isn't that the way it goes, like,

199
00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.600
like we, we refocus on what really matters. Like all these differences go away.

200
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.580
Yeah. But we come back to what matters.

201
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.770
<v 0>That's something that a lot of people who experienced war have said that</v>

202
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.780
this is where they felt the connected because their life was literally in

203
00:11:55.781 --> 00:12:00.370
danger. And because they knew because they had lost loved ones to this thing,

204
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:03.910
they had lost brothers to this thing that this was real.

205
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.500
And that to this day,

206
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:08.950
that is the most exciting and happiest time of their life because they were so

207
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:13.690
connected. Sebastian younger wrote about this in a movie, the book tribe. Yeah.

208
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.850
If you read it, I haven't read it. It's very good.

209
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:19.960
And it probably would speak to a lot of the exact same things that you say.

210
00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.960
<v 1>But, you know, like, I, I, I find the same thing,</v>

211
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.660
not the same thing, obviously, because my life's not in danger.

212
00:12:27.661 --> 00:12:30.360
And I hope that I never have to go a day where my life's in danger again.

213
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.040
And I find the same appreciation back here in a country that,

214
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.670
that I love. I can, you know, I,

215
00:12:40.671 --> 00:12:43.680
I narrowed it down cause I had to come up with a reason of like, why, you know,

216
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.650
it's hard to sit here and watch the valleys that you fought for.

217
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:49.770
And then the government going, give those valleys back to the Taliban. You know,

218
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.520
there's this one video me and my buddy were, were laughing about the other day,

219
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.860
um, a base that, that he had been on. And he shows me this video and it's like,

220
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.510
literally the treadmills that were in the gym,

221
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.420
there it's a Taliban guy running on our treadmills. Right.

222
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:08.280
Like they left it there and we're just like, whoa. You know? And, and,

223
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.340
and I always think about, you know,

224
00:13:11.341 --> 00:13:13.470
cause if you get down in the weeds of it and you start really getting,

225
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.390
you'll get upset about, you know, that valley did, I really did.

226
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.170
Did, did my teammate sacrifice really change your life?

227
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.960
Like if they hadn't a sacrifice that day, would, would your life be changed?

228
00:13:24.961 --> 00:13:29.630
Like, cause that's what we're fighting for as America. And so I just,

229
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.670
I always looked at it like this and I came to peace with it of, you know,

230
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:35.300
all we were trying to do anywhere. We went when,

231
00:13:35.301 --> 00:13:37.650
when I served and I wore the nation's cloth, like I got the,

232
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:41.310
I got the best opportunity when people thank me for my service. I'm like,

233
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.630
don't don't thank me. Like, I appreciate you letting me represent America,

234
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.060
be the away team for the United States of America.

235
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:52.380
Like I got to wear the nation's cloth in so many countries. Um,

236
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.570
but I always,

237
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.590
I justify it as all we tried to do,

238
00:13:58.591 --> 00:14:02.450
no matter whether we were passing out soccer balls to kids or we were going in

239
00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:06.510
and providing security for a whale, or we were taking out an enemy combatant,

240
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.450
all we were trying to do was make that part of the world that we were in a

241
00:14:09.451 --> 00:14:12.000
better place. That's all we were trying to do.

242
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.520
We're trying to leave it better than we found it that moment.

243
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:20.400
And if we take that same concept and we apply it here and we all go

244
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:23.340
over and do it for the person on the left and the right of us.

245
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:28.590
And if we use that same concept, you can apply it here in America every day,

246
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.390
every single day, you can make this world just a little bit better.

247
00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:34.740
There's.

248
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.980
<v 0>A lot of people in this country that don't think we should be nation building in</v>

249
00:14:37.981 --> 00:14:42.600
other countries. And, um, including people like Tulsi,

250
00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:46.950
Gobert who served, but then you got people like Dan Crenshaw,

251
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.030
who I've had on the podcast who w his perspective,

252
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.680
you have to go over there like that.

253
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:59.270
You can't allow these groups to get more powerful and gain more control.

254
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.130
You just can't.

255
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.540
<v 1>You can't, you can't. And if not us then who, and,</v>

256
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.660
and the thing is, is America is a beacon of hope across the world.

257
00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.420
America is a beacon of hope. And,

258
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.980
and you can notice when America's

259
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.650
strong, everybody hates us when America is weak,

260
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.460
the world suffers. And I'm not saying we need to go in and,

261
00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:29.020
and fight everybody's battle, obviously, right? Like, but on the backside of it,

262
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.190
you know, we're not necessarily going in and fighting for other countries,

263
00:15:33.191 --> 00:15:37.750
but we do have an obligation to go and help people.

264
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.410
Like you take Syria when they are gassing,

265
00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.130
when they are gassing kids and women,

266
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.210
if nobody else is gonna go send rockets in there,

267
00:15:51.211 --> 00:15:54.610
if nobody else is going to go hold somebody accountable for it, I'm there.

268
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.620
There's nobody that's serving. That's wearing the uniform that it's not gladly

269
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.280
doing that and going to go hold them accountable for it.

270
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.990
It has nothing to do with anything other than good and evil.

271
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.720
And if we don't go fight the evil, then who's going to do it. Who's gonna do it.

272
00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:17.190
And we don't want the eval to get bigger. You don't want the able to get bigger.

273
00:16:17.191 --> 00:16:21.150
You don't want the evil to, to, to progress. And you don't want the evil to,

274
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.450
to thank that. They can. I mean, imagine you see what they're doing right now.

275
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:24.631
And,

276
00:16:24.631 --> 00:16:29.460
and I think the world knows that that America will come and show up and you see

277
00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:30.750
how, how they're still going.

278
00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:33.030
Imagine if they didn't have to worry about us doing it,

279
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.000
imagine what they would look like.

280
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.390
<v 0>Uh, you know,</v>

281
00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.620
and I think you can imagine a better than most that's part of the problem is

282
00:16:43.621 --> 00:16:45.960
that, you know, when you're in Calabasas,

283
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:51.030
no going to the mall, you know, getting yourself a smoothie,

284
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.400
doesn't seem real, you know,

285
00:16:53.401 --> 00:16:57.930
and you can have all these opinions about what we should be doing, you know,

286
00:16:57.931 --> 00:17:01.560
and that we need to stop these warmongers. We need to stop this and stop that.

287
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.500
And, uh, I've,

288
00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:07.530
I've had those opinions myself in the past and gone back and forth.

289
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:11.730
And the only thing that's changed my mind is I listen to people that actually

290
00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.910
know. I think it's one of the most important things you could ever do.

291
00:17:14.911 --> 00:17:18.270
And don't try to form an opinion if you don't really have any facts and real or

292
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.820
any real understanding. And I've done that in the past too,

293
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.350
I've made those mistakes.

294
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.560
<v 1>Well, I can tell you this, like, you know, you look at nine 11,</v>

295
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.620
thousands of people died and they,

296
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.820
none of them volunteered to give their country for their life that day.

297
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.770
Except obviously the first responders,

298
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:43.130
you look since nine 11 besides a couple of tax it's been in America,

299
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.320
but you look since nine 11,

300
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:48.170
everybody that's given their life overseas has volunteered to do that.

301
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.930
They volunteered to go fight the evil and for us to go over there

302
00:17:54.931 --> 00:17:58.500
and do that and keep it off the country to keep it out of our country,

303
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:00.240
to keep it to where, you know,

304
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.490
our kids and our families and our mothers and fathers. And,

305
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.310
and don't have to worry about this. I mean, obviously,

306
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.590
obviously it could happen anywhere, but,

307
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.430
but I can't think that us being over there and giving them a place to fight us

308
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:19.860
has not helped this country keep from being attacked

309
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.680
multiple times. If we had not gone over there.

310
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:26.240
<v 0>That's a hard pill for people to swallow. Right. They,</v>

311
00:18:26.241 --> 00:18:27.380
they don't want to think that,

312
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:30.920
but they want to think the reason why they would attack us is because we're

313
00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:31.400
over.

314
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.570
<v 1>Yeah. Well, you know what I mean? W w why did we get attacked on nine 11?</v>

315
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.620
It's a good question. You know, like, uh,

316
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.060
these people hate us just because they hate us. Like they, they, it's not,

317
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.230
it's not about, you know, I, I, there was that one worker that, that said that,

318
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.750
oh, we should go over there and get them more jobs and more opportunities. Now,

319
00:18:50.751 --> 00:18:53.780
these people don't care. Like these people have,

320
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.710
they wake up every day and try to think of a way to kill us. Like,

321
00:18:57.711 --> 00:19:01.460
there's no negotiating with these people. These people are evil.

322
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:06.560
These people will do nasty things to human beings that, that, no,

323
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.330
you couldn't even imagine. You couldn't make a video game about, I mean, you,

324
00:19:10.331 --> 00:19:14.090
you look at, you look at some of this ISIS stuff of what they're doing. I mean,

325
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.150
putting somebody in a cage and burning them,

326
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.130
you want to be empathetic to that. Throwing people,

327
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.210
because because of their sexual preference off the top,

328
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.360
tying their hands and legs together and throw them off the top of a building.

329
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.590
These are the type of people that this is the type of evil like

330
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.690
that th that we're going after. And if we don't do it,

331
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.330
who's going to do it right. Who's going to do it.

332
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.770
<v 0>Do you think it's possible that this all could be resolved someday then</v>

333
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:51.290
maybe if it's not our children, our children's children,

334
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.440
do you think it's possible? Nope. That's that everybody says that there's,

335
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.630
that's one of the most disheartening things about any kind of conflict.

336
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.250
<v 1>But I mean, if you look at any of the books that came before us,</v>

337
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.380
this is, this is what you get. This is,

338
00:20:09.381 --> 00:20:13.160
this is just part of any, at any point in time,

339
00:20:13.161 --> 00:20:17.690
there's there's conflict going on. It will never be resolved.

340
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.650
It will never be resolved. It will never be resolved.

341
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.530
So it's main, it's like a maintenance program.

342
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.460
<v 0>That's hard for people to swallow, right?</v>

343
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.660
Cause people want to think that the reason why it'll never be resolved because

344
00:20:34.661 --> 00:20:37.720
the military industrial complex wants to keep us at war.

345
00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:39.310
And this is just a big money grab.

346
00:20:39.311 --> 00:20:42.580
And that's all they're trying to do is the reason why they have us over there is

347
00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.550
they're sending people over there to die so they can make money.

348
00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:48.490
This is this how people love to look at it.

349
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:49.900
<v 1>I mean, everybody wants to,</v>

350
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:53.620
I think it's just because everybody wants to find a reason. Do you know,

351
00:20:53.621 --> 00:20:57.100
everybody wants to, everybody wants a, um,

352
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.020
a reason that they can touch feel and Blaine, like they want something to blame,

353
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.800
right? And they,

354
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:07.923
you know,

355
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.940
there's nothing to blame except the people who are doing this and it

356
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:16.840
exists. And it's real. And these are real people. And you know what?

357
00:21:16.841 --> 00:21:19.840
We're just so lucky that we have an all volunteer military with some of the

358
00:21:19.841 --> 00:21:21.970
greatest people that's ever walked the face of the planet,

359
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.720
who are willing to go do this, who willing to do it on,

360
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:29.200
on mining your behalf? I mean, how cool is that?

361
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.770
<v 0>It's pretty wild when you think about it, right?</v>

362
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.610
Cause it it's a complete volunteer army volunteer,

363
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:38.110
complete volunteer military.

364
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.393
<v 1>These people</v>

365
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.070
are willing to raise their right hand to a piece of paper,

366
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.660
to an idea of democracy, go over a,

367
00:21:49.661 --> 00:21:54.160
put their whole life on hold, their wives sacrifice. I mean,

368
00:21:54.161 --> 00:21:57.760
you take military spouses and,

369
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:02.980
and they sacrifice. If not more than, than the people, you know, then, then,

370
00:22:02.981 --> 00:22:05.740
then, then the veterans and the service members. And they're,

371
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:10.660
they're willing to go over and fight for mining your freedom.

372
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.190
They've never met us, but they're willing to give their lives for it. Like,

373
00:22:15.191 --> 00:22:17.950
think about this. I like, I challenged people who are,

374
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.380
who are listening to this, like, what are,

375
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.350
can you name one thing right now that you're willing to give your life for?

376
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.780
I think about that. What would you give your life for right now? Like, like,

377
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.120
like somebody pulled a gun out, you know, you're going to die.

378
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:35.590
What would you give your life for? I mean,

379
00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:37.780
these people are willing to go do it on the idea of democracy,

380
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:41.890
on the idea of me and you on the idea of, of good.

381
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:48.550
It's incredible. It is incredible. You.

382
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.480
<v 0>When you signed up, how old were you? 17. You were 17. Wow.</v>

383
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.200
<v 1>Had my 18th birthday in bootcamp. No. Yeah. Wow.</v>

384
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.150
<v 0>So you can do that. I didn't know. I didn't know you.</v>

385
00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:00.920
I thought you had to be 18. No.

386
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.730
<v 1>Nah. I graduated high school at 17 and my dad signed for me. W.</v>

387
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:07.040
<v 0>Oh. Someone can sign for you. Wow.</v>

388
00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.720
And did you have any other aspirations or was that something that you knew you

389
00:23:11.721 --> 00:23:12.554
were going to do?

390
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.360
<v 1>No. I like honestly, a Marine recruiter.</v>

391
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.230
Chad told me I'd never make it as a Marine. And so like, yeah,

392
00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.100
like I was a lucky.

393
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:19.933
<v 2>Position.</v>

394
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.080
<v 1>Well, yucky, Toby. I was, I could think my lunch room. Like, I,</v>

395
00:23:24.081 --> 00:23:25.610
I don't have any cool stories. Like, oh,

396
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:28.040
I woke up and knew I was going to be a Marine. Like, you know, I,

397
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.220
I was walking through the lunchroom and this Marine recruiter was there.

398
00:23:31.221 --> 00:23:34.070
I started asking him a lot of smart, like smart Alec questions and just,

399
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.700
you know, being a typical high school student. And he's like, look,

400
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:41.510
you're wasting my time. You'd never make it as a Marine. And uh, you know, look,

401
00:23:41.511 --> 00:23:44.930
I, I was up for the challenge. So I, I signed up that. So him,

402
00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.680
that was what really sturdy. Yeah. That was it. Wow.

403
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.570
I didn't even really know what the Marine Corps was before that. Yeah. True.

404
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.170
Well, what did you think you were signing up for? You know,

405
00:23:56.171 --> 00:24:00.550
I just told him I wanted to go fight. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. Holy smokes.

406
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.650
You know, but you think about that. Like our whole life is built off decisions.

407
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.240
You know, our decisions are control where we are today,

408
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:14.050
where we're where we deserve to be,

409
00:24:14.051 --> 00:24:18.160
because we made the decisions up to this point. Like,

410
00:24:18.161 --> 00:24:20.350
and that's a hard pill to swallow too. Yeah.

411
00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:22.900
<v 0>It's variable. Right? There's, there's some things that are out of your control.</v>

412
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.720
<v 1>There are, but, but a lot of it, yeah. A lot of it,</v>

413
00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:29.560
you can't control situations and circumstances,

414
00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.970
but you can control how you, you take it, you can control your response,

415
00:24:33.971 --> 00:24:35.050
you can control your response.

416
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.810
<v 0>Growing up like that. I mean,</v>

417
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.580
you were growing up in combat when you're growing up at 18 years old. I mean,

418
00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:46.600
I was a baby when I was 18. Yeah. You're growing up in combat.

419
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.860
<v 1>I did it. Yeah. I guess if you look at it like that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

420
00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.720
And you are.

421
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.130
<v 0>Here now 10 years after what we were talking about.</v>

422
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.540
Yeah. And you said it still keeps you up.

423
00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.650
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I wake up, do you know, a couple,</v>

424
00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.150
a couple of nights a month and just, you know, an anxiety attack throwing up.

425
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.050
Um, I was actually speaking last week. I was on the road. It's the first time,

426
00:25:14.051 --> 00:25:15.730
you know, I always like, I'm always nervous.

427
00:25:15.731 --> 00:25:18.460
Like if in the middle of the night my daughter gets scared or she, you know,

428
00:25:18.461 --> 00:25:21.460
she comes down and gets in my bed. Like I'm always, really like,

429
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.550
nervous about that because like, I don't, I would like, I can,

430
00:25:24.551 --> 00:25:28.150
it was so I was so nervous about it because I was just, gosh,

431
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:31.150
I never want them to see me in that, in that, that state. Right.

432
00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:34.240
And the other day we were on the road. Oh,

433
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.480
speaking out in North Carolina and, um,

434
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:42.040
she's obviously we were in a hotel, so she was staying with me and I don't know,

435
00:25:42.041 --> 00:25:44.230
I didn't, I didn't feel good that night. So what I did is I put a,

436
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.090
I put a pillow between us and, uh, gosh, I had, I had one,

437
00:25:49.091 --> 00:25:52.990
I knocked my tooth off. I knocked my veneer off. Like it was so terrible.

438
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.010
And uh,

439
00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:57.520
she just looked at me she's three and she just looked at me and she said,

440
00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.830
it's okay, daddy. You're not, you're not a bad dad.

441
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.070
<v 3>Wow. And had three.</v>

442
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:07.960
<v 1>And I was like, gosh, do you know? But yeah.</v>

443
00:26:07.961 --> 00:26:11.560
I mean, you know, you still, I mean, this is that's, that's why you look at it.

444
00:26:11.561 --> 00:26:13.950
And I see these people who play these video games and they,

445
00:26:13.951 --> 00:26:16.930
they get nothing from like, there's no emotional attachment to it.

446
00:26:16.931 --> 00:26:20.680
And it's like, this stuff's real.

447
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:25.810
Like there's nobody who I would go out on a limb and say, there's

448
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:30.910
nobody who sees this stuff. And they don't,

449
00:26:30.911 --> 00:26:35.440
you don't come back and deal with it. Like it's, it's a normal process to,

450
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:40.300
to being part of not normal situations.
