00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:03.603
<v 2>How's Brooklyn.</v>

3
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 1>It's grim. It's grim right now. It's,</v>

4
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.400
I've lived in New York for the majority of my life. I love New York city.

5
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.320
And this is by far the grimmest I have ever seen it really.

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.393
I mean this winter,

7
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.470
because it's everything that the entire higher country is facing,

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.790
but it's the worst for COVID. It's also extremely cold.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.710
Um, a lot of city services seem to have been impaired in one way or another.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.230
<v 2>The streets are covered in garbage and ice and dog.</v>

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.750
And you can't pretty much the only thing that I can do to maintain my sanity

12
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.460
run, but everything, including the outdoor running track is covered in ice and.

13
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.420
And so it's just this dystopian,

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.140
frozen pandemic landscape where every, um,

15
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.820
local business that I loved is closing down. It's a dark time.

16
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.220
<v 0>Yeah. Um, I hear that about Los Angeles. I saw a lot of it,</v>

17
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.170
but I go got out early.

18
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.730
I saw the riding on the wall and I was looking to move in. May I just, once the,

19
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:10.250
once the lockdown got extended, once they're like,

20
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.570
we're just gonna lock down for two weeks to flatten the curve. I was like,

21
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:14.404
that makes sense.

22
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.010
And then here we are in April all the way through April here we are in may.

23
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.650
<v 2>And then I'm like, oh, they're never gonna let us out of this. I was like,</v>

24
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:24.520
and then the crime started happening and the, you know, it started,

25
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.760
it started getting dark and I was like, oh, we gotta get the outta here.

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.680
Homeless. The homeless thing was like flowers, blooming out of rocks,

27
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.960
outta cracks in the concretes, like more tense, tenses, tense, tense, tense,

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.440
tense, like Los Angeles filled with. Tenset like, you can't believe it.

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.070
Like when I tell people about it and then they go there, they're like, oh,

30
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.790
I thought you were exaggerating. Like, no, I was understating.

31
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.550
Like Los Angeles is overwhelmed with tents. It's crazy.

32
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.950
Like, you can't believe that on LaBrea.

33
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.710
They just allow people to set up tents everywhere. It's nuts. Well.

34
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.750
<v 1>Yeah. What are people going to do? That's.</v>

35
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.830
<v 0>The question? What are people gonna do? Yeah. What,</v>

36
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.340
where are you gonna put 'em do you have hospitals available for,

37
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.860
and a lot of those, the problem is a lot of those shelters,

38
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.220
they won't let 'em do drugs.

39
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.620
<v 2>Yeah. And a lot of these people,</v>

40
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:17.620
like I would rather rather be in a tent outside by the beach than be under your

41
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:20.460
thumb because Los Angeles doesn't get cold. You know?

42
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.370
I mean a cold day is 50, you know, it's a big deal. Right.

43
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.010
Just sleeping bag. You're outside. It's nice.

44
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.610
<v 1>Yeah. It's really emphasized a lot of these economic divides, you know,</v>

45
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.850
because everyone in New York just orders everything on Amazon.

46
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.310
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.330
So every apartment building and every nice part of New York receives a daily

48
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:45.120
shipment of every tenants stuff from Amazon a and then there's like a

49
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.800
secondary economy of people just going into all of the buildings and stealing

50
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:49.680
all of the packages.

51
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.480
<v 0>Yeah. I've seen a lot of that. Yeah. I've seen a lot of ring videos. Doorbell,</v>

52
00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:56.920
camera videos of people stealing.

53
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 1>Oh yeah. It's almost comical. I mean,</v>

54
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.320
I had one where I was loading my car with bags at

55
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.100
two in the morning,

56
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.400
on a Tuesday and in the lobby of my building for maybe

57
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.560
15 minutes, somebody just as soon as I walk around the corner,

58
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.240
someone goes and scoops everything up.

59
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:21.070
<v 2>Yeah. It's, it's a, it's a wild time and I hope we're coming out of it.</v>

60
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.190
I mean, right when I came to Austin, this is the first time I've, you know,

61
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:27.070
been on an airplane since the beginning of the pandemic.

62
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.430
You're the first person I've spoken to without a mask. No, really.

63
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.990
<v 0>The first face I seen, did you feel weird coming in here? &lt;laugh&gt; but you,</v>

64
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.230
you knew everyone was tested. No, no. Yeah.

65
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.070
<v 1>No, I felt fine.</v>

66
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:42.020
I felt I've just been very careful and because it's also cold in

67
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.660
New York, it just promotes this prison cell,

68
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.540
like lifestyle where I'm just sitting in my apartment reading and doing pushups

69
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.500
all day. Oh.

70
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.060
<v 0>God. Yeah. Oh yeah. The dog thing is like, uh,</v>

71
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.420
so people just don't clean up anymore. They just gave up, you know?

72
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.020
<v 1>Yeah. It is. It's its,</v>

73
00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:01.970
there's this kind of tumble in character where things just start

74
00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:06.010
to accumulate and then no one shovels the streets and then it gets easier.

75
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.450
It probably is harder to pick it up because there's just like mounting layers of

76
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:14.530
garbage everywhere. And it just starts to look increasingly disgusting. I mean,

77
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:15.770
maybe we will, we'll just, uh,

78
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.290
get out of this in a couple weeks and everything will be, oh yeah.

79
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.400
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; the problem that I don't think the people that shut everything down for</v>

80
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.200
a year ever take into consideration is that people don't have the resources to

81
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.840
bounce back things don't bounce back on their own. Right. Peop if you,

82
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.960
you wanna start a business, it takes money.

83
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.960
<v 2>Like it takes quite a bit of money to get a lease, to put the stock,</v>

84
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.230
the shelves to hire employee. And when you've been out of business for a year,

85
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:46.630
you don't have any money. So you've probably used up all savings.

86
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:50.470
If you had any savings, try getting a loan when you don't have anything.

87
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.350
There's there's really,

88
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.030
there's no real logical path forward for a lot of these businesses in Los

89
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:00.430
Angeles, 75% of the restaurants are gone.

90
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.860
<v 1>Oh yeah. I'm so worried about the restaurants in New York. Yeah. It's terrible.</v>

91
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.500
It doesn't seem like it's even talked about sufficiently. No,

92
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.780
because in New York, in the winter time, I mean, they're really trying,

93
00:05:09.781 --> 00:05:11.300
they're doing things that I,

94
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:16.220
would've never like truly extraordinary things like making these little heated

95
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.500
space gazebos that are covered in Mylar on the inside and they're. Yeah.

96
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.810
And you know, ultimately most people don't even really want to do that.

97
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.410
So then there's this weird conflict of,

98
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.610
is it moral to support these businesses because you want them to stay

99
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.490
in business or are you feeding into a system where people are subjecting

100
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:37.410
themselves to unsafe working conditions?

101
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.410
And is it actually imoral to go to restaurants? And of course,

102
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:43.120
people endlessly argue about that. It, um.

103
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.640
<v 0>Well, per personal choices are not imoral right.</v>

104
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.480
So if the people decide that they're willing to work there and they're masked up

105
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.440
and they feel safe working there isn't that better than not having a choice

106
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.293
to work there.

107
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.680
<v 1>I guess the idea is that it, instead of people going on unemployment,</v>

108
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.800
they are feel pressured to put themselves at risk, right. When they.

109
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.880
<v 0>Really should be, uh, at home,</v>

110
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.840
not potentially spreading coronavirus and ideally receiving some sort of

111
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.440
government assistance. Well,

112
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.430
all it's also like when does the government assistance run out?

113
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:20.830
Cuz it has run out for a lot of people.

114
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.710
There is no more unemployment for a lot of folks.

115
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.350
<v 2>And then on top of that,</v>

116
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.470
the way everything's been mismanaged is so terrible in so many ways.

117
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.590
Like why is it okay to be at target on top of people?

118
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.750
Why is it okay to be at Walgreens on top of people,

119
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.940
but it's not okay to have these mom pop stores open or retail.

120
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.140
<v 1>Stores. Oh yeah. Or, you know, like I said,</v>

121
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.860
I haven't been on an airplane until I came to see you. But I,

122
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:47.100
of course I see all these stories in the news that are like,

123
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.900
this guy went on an airplane and he took off his mask and they had to do an

124
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:54.060
emergency landing and they kicked him off the plane and everyone cheered.

125
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.050
And if you haven't been on a plane, you just kind of read that like, oh yeah.

126
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.570
Wow. That guy sounds like quite an. Good that they kicked him off the plane.

127
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.450
But then on the plane, I, then it, I hadn't even considered this.

128
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.250
<v 2>Like what, what is done with snacks? What are the snack provisions?</v>

129
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.890
Are there no more peanuts? Is there no water? And if it is served,

130
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.930
then everyone has to take off their masks.

131
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.080
So this is all just sort of like security theater,

132
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:24.400
because they still serve food and everyone unmasks simultaneously to eat.

133
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.440
So there's a period of at least 15 minutes where everyone on the plane is

134
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.360
unmasked by the doing of the actual airline.

135
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.560
<v 0>Yeah. It's nonsense. It's full nonsense across.</v>

136
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.150
<v 1>The board. Well, I think people just don't know what to do. It's it's, you know,</v>

137
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.390
they're aware that all these things are contradictory.

138
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.710
Everyone is trying to do their best. They're confused.

139
00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:47.790
They don't understand it even to this day. Um.

140
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.350
<v 0>People are trying not to be an. You know, when you wear a mask,</v>

141
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.070
which you're basically saying is I'm not an, you know, I'm,

142
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.900
I'm gonna go around and I want you to feel like I care and want, you know,

143
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.580
I want you to feel all right, so I'm gonna wear a mask, but it's not. I mean,

144
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.940
maybe it's protecting somewhat. It's not, certainly not a hundred percent safe.

145
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:14.020
You know? Like it's protecting you against droplets, someone sneezes, but.

146
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.180
<v 1>You're breathing. Oh yeah. The masking is definitely good.</v>

147
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.050
I think that's pretty well established. But um,

148
00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.730
I guess what I don't understand is the hypocrisy,

149
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:24.690
like if we have established that masking is good,

150
00:08:24.691 --> 00:08:29.210
then we also have to not have snacks on the flight or water

151
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.250
or water. But yeah. So then what do.

152
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.290
<v 0>You do? You're on top of each other,</v>

153
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.210
you're sitting three people next to each other. I mean,

154
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.930
it's like literally the opposite of social distancing. It's incredibly intimate.

155
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.280
You don't even know these people. You're touching elbows with &lt;affirmative&gt;.

156
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:40.920
Yeah.

157
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.000
<v 1>It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, and this is why when it started,</v>

158
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.680
I was one of these people that, you know, I was thinking why, you know,

159
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.600
I work in media, I know the way the media blows everything out of proportion.

160
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.800
I remember swine flu.

161
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.400
I know that they sell newspapers by making everyone terrified.

162
00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.840
This can't possibly be as bad as people think it is.

163
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.960
And I was sort of in COVID denial.

164
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.080
<v 2>And I was also in the middle of filming the third season of my TV show.</v>

165
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.840
So I was just sort of seduced by the momentum of production and didn't want it

166
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.800
to end. And uh, and people were saying, you know,

167
00:09:12.801 --> 00:09:16.510
I don't think we can anymore. I think we have to stop. And I thought,

168
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.310
what is the world going to shut down? Yeah, I remember that is the,

169
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:26.030
like, this is unprecedented. Yeah. The, the world isn't going to shut down.

170
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.590
We're not going to be kept in our apartments.

171
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.790
It's just not conceivable that such a thing could happen. Cut to.

172
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.620
