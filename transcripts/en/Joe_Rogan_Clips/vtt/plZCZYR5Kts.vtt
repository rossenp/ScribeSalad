00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 2>Do you want to talk about that thing that you might be doing? Yeah, let's do.</v>

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.360
<v 1>It. We've got to push.</v>

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.390
<v 0>This microphone in front of you. You just get you, there you go. Like that.</v>

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.090
So tell me what this, what is this announcement what's going on?

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.590
<v 1>So I just signed a big contract, bro. I'm coming back to fighting. Oh yeah.</v>

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.220
And the great words of TJ Dillashaw. Daddy's home,

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.830
but I'm not coming back to MMA, man. Uh,

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.590
I know that I've been seeing a lot of people's comment and they're kind of

10
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:32.010
hoping that I am. Um, I'm coming back to boxing, man.

11
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.060
I want to try something different.

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.140
<v 0>Now you come back to regular boxing. Are you going to do bare knuckle boxing?</v>

13
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.860
<v 1>I think we're going to throw some bare knuckle in there, bro. Just mix it up.</v>

14
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.790
Get real crazy.

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.770
<v 0>No, I've seen you. You're working out a lot. You hitting a lot of meds. Like,</v>

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.240
were you doing that before? Or did you just have this? Did they contact you?

17
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:52.350
Like how did this come about?

18
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.461
<v 1>So we've, I mean,</v>

19
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.400
this is actually something that's kind of been in the works for probably a year

20
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.540
now. Um, you know, it's just for me, look,

21
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:03.180
I just turned 36 in may and we were just talking about still having that,

22
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.790
that desire. Like when I, when I left the UFC,

23
00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:09.840
I was just about to have my first baby. Um, you know, we had,

24
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.870
I had a lot on my plate. There was obviously I had just lost,

25
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.640
but even going into that fight,

26
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.230
I had started a company,

27
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.560
was working on a few other companies and there was a lot that I was more excited

28
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.010
about than competing at the time. And I mean,

29
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:29.370
obviously we know that this sport is so brutal. Like you,

30
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.820
if you don't have a a hundred percent mindset into it, you're going to get up.

31
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.580
You know? And it's, for me, it was like, look, dude,

32
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.750
I'm going to take some time off. Um, I'm going to, or just, or just end it here.

33
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.840
I have other things going on and we'll see kind of what happens in the future.

34
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:46.950
So I decided to retire, talks it over with the wife and that was, you know,

35
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.950
what the game plan was. So, uh,

36
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.190
fast forward two and a half years later, um, you know,

37
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:57.570
obviously I still have that desire. Um, and obviously my CR,

38
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.310
my baby girl is bigger. Now we are, uh, pregnant with a second. And,

39
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.640
uh, I just started thinking like, man, I'm getting older.

40
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.200
I don't want to get into my forties.

41
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:11.640
And then basically still have this desire to compete and be like, it's too late.

42
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:15.510
You know? So I'm like, let's, let's start talking to some of these guys.

43
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:19.520
I've always wanted to box, you know, coming off of wrestling. My,

44
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:22.380
my style even in the UFC was boxing and wrestling and were probably my two

45
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.490
favorite things to do. Like,

46
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.660
I absolutely loved boxing sparring when I would be training through to through

47
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.230
training camps. Um, and then obviously wrestling too, but, um,

48
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.120
I always wanted to try and compete in some type of boxing competition. Um,

49
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.200
and so, uh, bare knuckle actually reached out to favor and was like, Hey,

50
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.830
do you think Mendez would ever be interested in this? And I'm like, I mean,

51
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:47.940
I probably never thought about anything bare knuckle before, but you know,

52
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:49.620
boxing definitely would be fun.

53
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.570
<v 0>Let me ask you this about Bernard. Well, why,</v>

54
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.890
why do they have those like really thick wraps that go all around the hand,

55
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.420
but just expose the knuckle.

56
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.340
<v 1>And it's not mandatory on anybody.</v>

57
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:02.800
Like I see some guys where they just take their hand. Right.

58
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.300
But I think a lot of people do that for wrist support, right? Like, you know,

59
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.960
obviously you punched like a bag with no support in your wrist.

60
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.120
And a lot of the times it folds, but didn't.

61
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.860
<v 0>Joe rigs get his eye cut because of one of the, uh, when he fought Lombard,</v>

62
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.720
didn't the rap actually scraped.

63
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.240
<v 1>I heard that. Yeah. And it's, you know,</v>

64
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.020
I think that this is an organization that's still very brand new and there's

65
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.980
probably still working all these kinks out. But, um, I mean,

66
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:33.970
I'm probably gonna re tape the out of my wrist just for that,

67
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.140
for the reason of support. But yeah, I think that's something that's, you know,

68
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.800
it's definitely a possibility of getting cut on that stuff. Do you know.

69
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.640
<v 0>When you're fighting?</v>

70
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.770
<v 1>October 22nd? Oh, Jesus. It's coming up October 22nd opponent.</v>

71
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.550
No opponent yet, but it's still a Chandler Arizona is what they're saying.

72
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:54.520
So wait one 50 fives. Okay. So.

73
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.450
<v 0>You're not going to have to cut.</v>

74
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.470
<v 1>Nope, that's it. I told him, I said, look, dude, I, we just talked about,</v>

75
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.320
I don't want to cut much anymore. You know, obviously I'm getting older,

76
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.100
it's harder. It's going to be hard as hell to make 40 fives. But, um,

77
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.760
if I can go 50 fives, I would greatly appreciate that. And they're like, no,

78
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.340
that's actually better. You're going to have more opponents to choose from. So,

79
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.550
uh, I think that's what we're going to do. Um, how many rounds, uh, there 5, 5,

80
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.100
2 minute rounds, which I think is doing two minute rounds.

81
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.140
I don't know why they're maybe just,

82
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.350
I'm not sure exactly what their thought process on that, but I mean,

83
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.690
I love that I'm a explosive athlete. Obviously.

84
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.100
I think this I'm pretty much built for this style of fighting. You know,

85
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:37.990
I can get in there. I can be fast, explosive, quick, um, powerful.

86
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.000
And you know, it's a quick round. I don't have to pace myself,

87
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:44.440
grind out those five minute rounds.

88
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.830
I can just get in there and knock someone's head off and, uh, and be good.

89
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:49.000
So that's going to be a big.

90
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.190
<v 0>Difference for you, right. Going from five minute rounds.</v>

91
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.150
<v 1>Two minute, minute rounds,</v>

92
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.490
I've been hit mitts for two minute rounds and I'm like,

93
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.730
I feel like I just started. Right, right. Like I could go, you know,

94
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:58.564
I feel good if.

95
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.400
<v 0>You training two minutes or you doing longer so that you feel like.</v>

96
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.570
<v 1>Two minutes is nothing we're going to mix both in.</v>

97
00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:08.380
And my thought process on that is, um,

98
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.140
even when I was training for five minute rounds, we do five minute rounds.

99
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.470
I don't, we would do more of them, but I want my body,

100
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:18.790
my mind to get used to exactly what it's going to feel like because of that

101
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:23.110
reason, like, holy, it's already over, you know? So I need to know like,

102
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.520
you know, basically where I'm at in the round, you know, and,

103
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:28.660
and I want to get used to that,

104
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.570
but I'm definitely going to do some longer stuff too, or we'll do you know,

105
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:32.830
like 10, two minute rounds.

106
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:36.640
So you're basically just doing more of the exact same thing to where it's,

107
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.280
you know, you hit those five and it's like, I could go another,

108
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.900
another full fight here. So.

109
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.510
<v 0>How long did you have to think about this before you decided to do it?</v>

110
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.800
<v 1>Well, like I said, it's been a whole year process kind of going back and forth.</v>

111
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.140
Uh, my wife absolutely hates it. She's like, you're nuts,

112
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.260
but you know, I married a fighter. No. And that's what she's got.

113
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.790
She's got to remember that. Right. But, uh, um, no, I mean, it's,

114
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.360
it's definitely something we sat down and had, had to figure out because it's,

115
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.340
you know, it is something that's pretty brutal. And my,

116
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.540
my argument to her was this like a UFC gloves,

117
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.620
maybe a quarter of an inch of leather, half inch of leather over my knuckles.

118
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.830
I mean, the concussion's not going to be much different. If anything,

119
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.010
I think we're obviously dealing with a sharper object hitting you.

120
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.550
So cuts are probably going to be a lot more prevalent,

121
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.270
but as far as the concussion of, you know, getting hit,

122
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.150
you know, I don't think it's going to be much different.

123
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.730
I also don't have to worry about a baseball bat,

124
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.990
head kick going whipping through and cracking me in the dome either or someone

125
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.290
taking these out. So, you know,

126
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:45.140
there's a lot of other things in the MMA game that I think are a lot more

127
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.320
dangerous, but, um, you know, for me, it's just,

128
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.270
it had to make sense,

129
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:55.130
obviously the numbers they were thrown out in the beginning didn't make sense

130
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:58.010
for me. I have, you know, other businesses that are,

131
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.920
are doing really well right now that are,

132
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.210
are something that I can do for the rest of my life and not have to ever fight,

133
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.240
but I have that itch to get in there, compete still.

134
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.810
And I might as well do it now while I'm still in my prime.

135
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:16.040
And I have that opportunity because like I said, when I started hitting 38, 39,

136
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.850
you know,

137
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.420
maybe those opportunities have come and gone and nobody even really cares to see

138
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:22.430
me fight anymore or, you know,

139
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.820
I just don't feel good enough to get in there and do it. So.

140
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.560
<v 0>It's interesting how they're going after so many former UFC fighters. I mean,</v>

141
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:34.100
it's smart, right? These people are already famous, you know,

142
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:38.600
they got Paige Vanzant, Hector Lombard. Um, you now,

143
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.160
who else is over there? I know, uh, Leonard Garcia. Who else?

144
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.420
Uh.

145
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.650
<v 1>Rochelle, uh, she just fought page, uh, as Austria.</v>

146
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.690
<v 0>Rachel [inaudible]. Oh yeah, yeah. Sorry. No, no, no. I didn't say I'm just</v>

147
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.690
trying to, uh,

148
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.690
 so they're doing a smart thing where they're getting popular fires or who were

149
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.690
, you know, known for UFC fights mostly, and then just introducing the bare knuckle world to them. 

150
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.690
And

151
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:50.690
 I know it's growing, right. I mean, it's, it's, it's people are paying attention now they're watching a lot of 

152
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.523
fights.

153
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.420
<v 1>Yeah. I, I know, uh,</v>

154
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.440
Forbes just did a write up saying it's the fastest growing combat sport in the

155
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:22.610
world right now, you know?

156
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.320
<v 0>Well, I always thought that, like,</v>

157
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.800
it was weird that you could else elbow somebody in the face.

158
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.200
You could head kick somebody with a bear shin.

159
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.940
You can name in the nose with no pads, but your hands are covered with a pad.

160
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:40.610
I was, I was like, but I used to say like, why don't we just go bare knuckle?

161
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:43.940
Because first of all, it make grappling more realistic, like submissions,

162
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.070
you could sink and chokes and stuff.

163
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.350
But then I saw Chris leaving versus, uh, who is it?

164
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:55.070
Dakota, what's his name? Anyway,

165
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.090
Chris Lehman's face got destroyed. It was crazy the cuts. And I was like, oh,

166
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.080
maybe bare knuckles.

167
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.460
<v 1>It is. And I think that, you know, you're going to have a lot of blood,</v>

168
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.930
which probably makes it pretty entertaining for a lot of people, but yeah.

169
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.440
Cuts are definitely going to be there. I mean,

170
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.970
like you said, elbows though in the UFC like, oh yeah.

171
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.940
Up against the cage slash somebody or even off,

172
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.160
off their back and you're on top dropping elbows. I mean,

173
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:26.700
those cut probably more than knuckles I would imagine. But yeah. Um,

174
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.750
I think you get hit a lot more with punches than you do with elbows and a fight.

175
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:34.110
And that's probably where more, more cuts would come in. But.

176
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.580
<v 0>How many of these things you're going to have.</v>

177
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.020
<v 1>Man? So, so here's the situation I S I'm still under UFC contract.</v>

178
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.130
I still have fights on my UFC contract. So, you know,

179
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:47.550
there still is a possibility that I come back and maybe I want to do one or two

180
00:09:47.551 --> 00:09:50.370
more UFC fights after this. We'll see, I'm going to get in there. And I'm.

181
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:52.950
<v 0>Going to have, see, given you a green light to do this, is that how it works?</v>

182
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.970
<v 1>And so, which is super cool to use. I mean, they basically could have just said,</v>

183
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.980
you, you're not competing. They kind of.

184
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.950
<v 0>Said, you to George St. Pierre when he wanted to fight Oscar de LA.</v>

185
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.570
<v 1>Hoya. Well, that's because it's Oscar.</v>

186
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.650
<v 0>I know, but that's a great payday for Jordan.</v>

187
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.970
<v 1>I know. I know. Um, and in fact, some of that stuff was in the works for me.</v>

188
00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:16.140
Like we taught, I was, my name was thrown in there with Oscar really? Yeah. Uh,

189
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:17.820
which would have been freaking cool just to say,

190
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:20.460
you get in there and box a guy like Oscar, but yeah. They,

191
00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.870
they wanted nothing to do with any of that stuff. So, you know, for them.

192
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.680
<v 0>I see an Oscar do not get it's Dana and Oscar do not get along.</v>

193
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.500
<v 1>I don't know, but I always see them talking to each other. Yeah.</v>

194
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.360
<v 0>But so dumb, like, you know why that is what's happening?</v>

195
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.201
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

196
00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:44.670
But luckily the payday I was talking about getting with them is what I'm

197
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.310
getting in bare knuckle now. And, you know,

198
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:51.120
obviously it would have been cooler to say that I'm boxing Oscar de LA Hoya,

199
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.930
but.
