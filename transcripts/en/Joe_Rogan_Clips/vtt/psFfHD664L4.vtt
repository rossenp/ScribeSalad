00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's supposed to be amazing fishing.</v>

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.700
The Catalina apparently is like the greatest Maaco shark fishing in the world,

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:11.970
which is, here's a weird one, shark fishing, all of a sudden, you're an.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.960
They used to be with jaws. Like you caught a shark. Hey, good.

5
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.660
Get that thing out of here. They're going to kill people now.

6
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:22.770
It's like you monster shark's fin soup. Don't you care about that?

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.100
Don't you know, this global warming, like everything is conflated.

8
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.980
It's all like piled on together. Like what are you doing with a shark?

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.440
You used to be able to buy Maaco shark in a restaurant.

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.960
<v 1>Oh, you still see it. But there, there is a, there is,</v>

11
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:37.470
I saw a thresher shark the other day on a menu. I did a story.

12
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.620
I did a magazine story about this long, long ago. It was like,

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.400
it was right when I got out of school and it was the first assignment I had to

14
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:48.540
go write an article and I was wearing it for outside magazine. And, um,

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.060
this is 19 years ago, man. And there's a thing called Maaco madness.

16
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.430
And it was this thing in Montauk. Uh, you know, what's funny about doing this.

17
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:02.250
This was in 2000 and I got sent out there and had never,

18
00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:04.410
ever been to New York and I didn't even go into the city.

19
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:09.210
I just flew into wherever the hell I flew into and got a car and stupidly took a

20
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:14.190
cab to, I didn't understand the, I was just very young. I didn't understand,

21
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:17.730
like I took a cab from the airport out to Montauk. Oh my God.

22
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.630
<v 0>How much that.</v>

23
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.900
<v 1>Costs. I don't even remember. I remember like when I had to turn my expenses,</v>

24
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.160
people like on what I didn't know, but anyways, it was funny cause uh,

25
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.170
I remember driving along and seeing the,

26
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.650
it was like the summer before and seeing this when it was like a year before and

27
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:33.990
seeing the twin towers, you know, uh,

28
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.900
and I was like my first ever view and I never saw that place again.

29
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.430
I never saw it again till after,

30
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.900
but there's this thing called a Maaco madness and was like a sharp tournament.

31
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.060
And traditionally had been like a contest to get the biggest shark and they

32
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:52.110
would bet money on it. And there was like the general registration fee.

33
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:57.060
So all these captains who had charter boats would join Maaco madness node

34
00:01:57.061 --> 00:02:01.260
book clients on their boats for Maaco madness. And when you had to,

35
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.810
you had to pay some amount of money to there's probably still goes on.

36
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.660
You had to pay some amount of money to register your boat,

37
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.240
to be in the contest.

38
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.690
But the real money was in all these side bets called Cal cutters.

39
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.780
And so you could, there was enough side betting going on,

40
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.520
run all the various captains that the biggest Maaco could win a hundred

41
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:23.460
thousand couple hundred thousand dollars to catch the biggest Maaco.

42
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.440
But the sort of the fatal flaw in this tournament

43
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.550
from a poet perception standpoint would be that there was a category for just

44
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:36.630
biggest shark. And there's a category for like biggest Maaco.

45
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.530
So people going out like at a time,

46
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.750
this is when at this is when shark populations were still,

47
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.290
you know, and globally they're still on a decline,

48
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.930
but there was still a lot of shark bycatch from soy fish,

49
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.310
long lining and other things.

50
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:56.490
And there was people were getting very worried about shark stocks and shark

51
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:59.650
numbers. Um, and at one time madness,

52
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:01.690
there's a lot more makers like people be register makos,

53
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.170
but there had been some years where Maaco madness had no makos.

54
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.330
People were bringing in a Maaco,

55
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.080
so everyone would go out and just make sure that like,

56
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.700
I don't want to come back empty.

57
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.770
So they would catch a blue shark because if no one caught a

58
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.640
Maaco, you still might get biggest shark from catching a blue shark.

59
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.840
And at the end of this thing, man, they had dumpsters. They were not dumpsters.

60
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.230
They had,

61
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.150
they would fill a dumpster with blue sharks and knowing where

62
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.440
the dude it would, no, it would go into a dumpster. You can eat blue shark.

63
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.990
Yeah. Well you can, they're high in urea and just, you know,

64
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.880
it's like everything else, like yes,

65
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:44.500
you can pose the most edible Maaco thresher um,

66
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.050
can you eat a great white, you know,

67
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.790
what's funny about great whites is there's a guy as a writer. I love.

68
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:51.190
And he does all of these fisheries guidebooks named Vic Dunaway.

69
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.110
I don't know if he's dead or alive, but I got all of his books.

70
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:57.550
He's got like Gulf coast, Pacific ocean land coast. Um, he does these books.

71
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:02.260
Like it's like all the fish that you're likely to catch kind of like how to

72
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.000
catch them. And then he, what I like about it,

73
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:08.680
he's got like a clout food quality section and his food quality

74
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.790
sections are really funny.

75
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.560
And like the highest praise you can give some like excellent or one of the best,

76
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:18.100
right? So if you look up snuck, it'd be like one of the best, um, his,

77
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.980
his headline for great, uh, I lurked in great white shark.

78
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.030
It says don't even ask,

79
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.660
but people feel that they be good because salmon shark are good.

80
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.370
These con porbeagles like salmon shark have a very good reputation and makos

81
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:33.040
have a good reputation and threshers have market value.

82
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.640
And there's other sharks and other areas that have market value.

83
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:40.450
But those ones are like, are ones that are popular table fare. Um,

84
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.350
the assumption is that white, that great white sharks would probably be good.

85
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.150
It must be somebody who's eating one. Oh,

86
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:47.440
I'm sure there's plenty of people that have eaten them.

87
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.710
But at this Maaco madness thing, I can't remember the point I was getting at,

88
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.430
what the hell was I driving at? But talking about Maaco madness. Oh,

89
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.590
in this article I got into like the history of where like shark hunting and

90
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:02.560
killing sharks came from is you're familiar with jaws. Right?

91
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.060
Well sort of the shark fishermen character in jaws is based on this like very

92
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:11.200
real dude, Frank Mundus and Frank Mundus used to fish out of Montauk.

93
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.940
And at a time Montauk was this premier destination for catching swordfish and

94
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.050
big bluefin tuna.

95
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.390
And as those big pelagic fisheries had collapsed from over fishing in the

96
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:24.610
seventies, Frank Mundus,

97
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.260
he'd go out and he'd just go out and find, uh, you know, he'd go out famously,

98
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:31.420
he'd go out and find a beach whale or not a beach whale,

99
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:35.410
but a floating dead whale. And he'd anchor up on that whale and catch big,

100
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.453
great whites,

101
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.410
and then come in and hang the bloody carcass up on the docks.

102
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.170
And he made necklaces with tooth sharks and.

103
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.980
And he became like the monster man or something of the monster hunter and

104
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:51.820
started booking all these crazy trips where tourists would come be like, holy.

105
00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.470
I want to go kill a big monster.

106
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.220
And he's credited with having created this like culture,

107
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.530
like going out and getting, yeah. That's Frank Mondo.

108
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.730
Let me see that picture of the left.

109
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.653
<v 0>Dude.</v>

110
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.670
<v 1>So yeah,</v>

111
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.320
he kinda like built this idea of like shark haunting and in light shark bite.

112
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.150
<v 0>And his forearm go back to that. That'd.</v>

113
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.983
<v 1>Be interesting.</v>

114
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.680
<v 0>Well, understood forum. Ah, something took a bite out of that.</v>

115
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.020
<v 1>Yes. He's got the necklace. Yeah,</v>

116
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.590
the dead shark and Frank Mundus kind of like,

117
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:26.150
like spawned this sort of thing where you'd want to go out and catch a big shark

118
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.620
and hang it up and then throw it in the dumpster.

119
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.570
<v 0>Wow.</v>

120
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.810
<v 1>And people look at like, when people look at that history,</v>

121
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.460
they look at it being is like,

122
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:39.440
it's like in some ways Mundus and shark hunting was symptomatic

123
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.780
of declining fisheries.

124
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.000
<v 0>Look at that picture of him and the dude with, from the movie.</v>

125
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.590
They're so similar. Look at that.

126
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:47.360
The black and white and the color next to each other. Look at that.

127
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.973
<v 1>Oh yeah.</v>

128
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.410
<v 0>What was that? Guy's name? The guy in the movie.</v>

129
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.500
Can't remember what was the actor's name? That guy was awesome.

130
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.120
What a great scene.

131
00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.460
<v 1>You know, Mo Fallon. Yeah. That's his favorite movie.</v>

132
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:03.860
I think it's a great mobile. Dirty loves John.

133
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.050
It's interesting that the negative,

134
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.410
the next time you see them having convinced you that jaws is the greatest movie

135
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:09.680
ever.

136
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.420
<v 0>That's a great movie. It's a great movie, Richard Dreyfus and come on, um,</v>

137
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.130
the narrative of a shark's fin soup and sharks being, you know,

138
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:22.730
something that we need to protect that sort of, it's a new thing.

139
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.200
It's something that only existed over the last decade or so I think so. Yeah.

140
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.370
It used to be, if you caught a shark, like good for you, you,

141
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:32.210
you keeping it from killing someone who's swimming or someone is surfing.

142
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.670
<v 1>Th th the idea of shark's fin soup and its allure was driven home to me one time</v>

143
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.700
when we were in Berkeley and we were at a boat launch,

144
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.140
we'd come off fishing and we'd been out fishing for leopard sharks. Um,

145
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.960
remember I had the life aquatic. That's a good movie.

146
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.450
Do you like his stuff or no? Bill Murray love him.

147
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.860
I mean like the director Anderson.

148
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.830
<v 0>Was saying, oh, what has he done besides that a.</v>

149
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:56.870
<v 1>Royal Tenenbaums.</v>

150
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.670
<v 0>Oh, okay. Yeah. I like that.</v>

151
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.240
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I think his masterpiece is the life aquatic, but, uh,</v>

152
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:04.660
and there, they got, you know, the,

153
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.910
the famous shark and here's the Jaguar shark, which is a good idea for shark.

154
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.751
I don't think it exists,

155
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:10.870
but there are leopard sharks and we're fishing for leopard sharks.

156
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.990
We came back to the boat launch and there's a dumpster there and everybody

157
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:17.540
cleans or fish and fills a fish guts and the dumpster.

158
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.900
And I remember there was a gentlemen digging through the dumpster,

159
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.210
getting out leopard, shark fins, and, and heads and stuff.

160
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.860
And I took pity on him.

161
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.260
I thought that he was acting out of some sort of desperation. And I said,

162
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.210
uh, Hey man, do you want like a nice filet?

163
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.200
I'd be happy to give you a filet. And he's like, no,

164
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.690
you just want just the fence.

165
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.400
<v 0>Just to make soup. Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever had it? No.</v>

166
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.660
<v 1>Shark fin SU yeah. Did you enjoy it? It was weird.</v>

167
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.300
<v 0>It weird. It was like, it's okay. It's okay.</v>

168
00:08:57.301 --> 00:09:00.450
It's definitely not worth eradicating a entire species.

169
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.210
<v 1>No, it's a little disgusting. Uh,</v>

170
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.710
it's a little disgusting and you know, I'm always reluctant, like, uh,

171
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.690
I'm always reluctant to,

172
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.280
I'm a little bit reluctant to sort of, uh,

173
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.990
over simplify things around, around harvest and,

174
00:09:20.991 --> 00:09:22.920
and animals and stuff because, uh,

175
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.740
I think people can take it too far,

176
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.820
but if you've seen footage of people cutting fins and dumping the sharks in the

177
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:34.330
water and kicking the sharks off the deck, into the water dark, and I think,

178
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.650
but it speaks to something. I think that seeing like live Finless sharks,

179
00:09:38.651 --> 00:09:43.150
going into the water speaks to something about just your level of care.

180
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:48.010
Do you want me, like, whether you view something as, as sacred or not,

181
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.640
it's hard to see the individual engaging in that is viewing it as,

182
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.130
as sacred. And there's like, oh, you know,

183
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.300
there's a lot of stories about even like swordfish captains, uh, you know,

184
00:09:58.301 --> 00:10:01.900
burning blue sharks and stuff in AFA because they lose so much of their sword

185
00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.840
fish catch the blue sharks, but to see people kicking them off,

186
00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.510
it speaks to something about animal suffering.

187
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.440
It speaks to something about like, what does that person's view of the resource,

188
00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.560
like to what boot, how do they respect it?

189
00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.480
But it also speaks to like a general thing where you,

190
00:10:17.481 --> 00:10:19.300
you don't like to see things wasted. Yeah.

191
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.150
And then my understanding about like one of the things that slowed in us waters,

192
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.840
one of the things that slowed finning was just used to be able to go out and you

193
00:10:28.841 --> 00:10:33.230
could feel your hold full of just sharp parts. If you were a,

194
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:35.890
a fishing cap, then you could just be like, I'm just gonna keep the fins.

195
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.020
And eventually they made it. Um,

196
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.810
I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong here. I don't think I am.

197
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.670
They eventually made it that whatever you have for shark materials in your boat

198
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:50.500
on a commercial operation, only a certain percentage can be comprised of fins.

199
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.700
And since when you're on a commercial vessel, you're hold like your, your,

200
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.650
the air where you keep iced fish is finite. It's limited. Um, it want to being,

201
00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:04.570
not worth it because let's say only like 30% of your shark parts could be

202
00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:06.940
shark fins and you had to keep the rest.

203
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.390
It wasn't worth it to fill your hold full, like shark meat.

204
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:15.220
And so it sort of de-incentivize people to go out and fin in us waters. Mm.

205
00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.950
<v 0>That makes sense. I had it a long time ago.</v>

206
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.450
I had it back in probably the nineties at a Chinese restaurant.

207
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.010
<v 1>In the U S or overseas.</v>
