<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.990
One time I was doing a bright Garrett's club in Vegas, MGM.

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.600
I was like old Chinese people understand Vegas.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.150
I'm going to hook them up with a nice room. I was,

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.690
I think opening a middling is years ago. I was like, finally,

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.310
they're gonna see me in MGM.

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.250
Cause they know that's a nice place going to comedy club.

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.100
I crushed it that night I could set. And you know,

9
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.670
afterwards you and the headliner and everyone's out there shaking hands,

10
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:30.300
meeting people. My parents walked out. Right. My, my mom's all smile.

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.530
She's very, just positive, you know, general. Um, um,

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.850
and then my dad walked out and then my, my, my buddy Jack was next to me. Uh,

13
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.640
he, he was the middle. I was the opener. Yeah. My buddy Jack Cohen, uh,

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.630
older comic. Um, he, he went up to my dad. He was like, oh my.

15
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.620
<v 1>God, Hey Richard, aren't you so proud of your son? He's so good. Right.</v>

16
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.240
<v 0>And then my dad just looked at me in front of the entire audience of everyone</v>

17
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.550
else shaking. And he's like, no, Jimmy's not funny.

18
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.650
<v 2>Yeah. Wow. Yeah. And,</v>

19
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:07.670
and I don't know if he was years later, he said.

20
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.980
<v 0>That was a joke because, because, uh, it's not,</v>

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.540
he said this. He said, it's not funny if I tell you, uh,

22
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.240
you're funny, but it's funny if I tell you, it's not funny,

23
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:22.940
there's a story there. I was like, yeah. But yeah, you were my dad though.

24
00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:26.180
I mean, come on. Like you're not, you're not my buddy at an open mic.

25
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.600
And then he also said he was like, well,

26
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.190
I honestly didn't think it was funny because I don't get the

27
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:37.670
references. I don't get culturally, like what you're saying about whatever.

28
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700
I didn't get it. So he was kind of just being honest also.

29
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.220
<v 3>So he's trying to be funny in his own way while being honest about his own</v>

30
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.670
take on it. I don't, yeah. Yeah. He's.

31
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.470
<v 0>Honest. But he's also still being the ball breaker. Right. He's a funny guy,</v>

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.380
but sometimes it's hard to, uh,

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.390
be his son if he's using me in the expense

34
00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.070
of, you know, is.

35
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.450
<v 3>It like a, the style of comedy, like insult comedy?</v>

36
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.650
When you say ball, ball breaking, like what kind of, yeah. That's what he does.

37
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.460
Yes. Like a older Chinese Don Rickles.

38
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.800
<v 1>Yes. Yes. That's it one Chinese people. I think in general, I say.</v>

39
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.551
<v 0>This my standup,</v>

40
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.570
and it's funny if I do it in front of a white audience or a non-Chinese

41
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.970
audience, like what the is that that really happened? Like,

42
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:35.750
I do this bit about how Chinese people would tell you exactly what the is wrong

43
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.020
with your.

44
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.890
<v 2>Face. Like Thanksgiving.</v>

45
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.870
<v 0>You know, my mom would tell my girl, cousin like, oh, Christina, you got so fat.</v>

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.050
<v 1>Wow. Just straight. I was like, man, you can't say that.</v>

47
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.380
<v 0>And then, and then my mom and my dad would be like, oh,</v>

48
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:55.580
if we're not telling her who would, and like also being like, um,

49
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.730
uh, a comedian, I mean, not, not being committed being, um, uh.

50
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.910
Was I gonna say, oh, being Chinese, uh,

51
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.570
being fat or gaining weight is prosperous. It's, it's good. It's auspicious.

52
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.340
<v 1>Or whatever. She's a girl. So you can't just say that,</v>

53
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.250
you know? Um, and Christina is not fat.

54
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.190
She's this beautiful young woman.

55
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.740
<v 0>You know? And, and yeah, it's, it's,</v>

56
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.230
it's hard to grow up with a high self-esteem in an Asian.

57
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.320
<v 2>Household, you know, but.</v>

58
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.410
<v 0>There is a weird honesty to it. I don't know. I don't buy it.</v>

59
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.250
They say it's honest. I think it's passed down trauma.

60
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.930
Their parents did that to down and now they're doing it. I don't know.

61
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.660
<v 3>Well, there's something about work ethic in Asian households. Um,</v>

62
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.520
when I was a young, one of my good friends with his kid, uh, his name was junk,

63
00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:48.900
sick, junk, sick Chang.

64
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.670
And he went on to be a national TaeKwonDo champion while, while he was in,

65
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.860
uh, his medical residency, like, wow. Yeah. I,

66
00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:58.530
I always used to compare myself to him.

67
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:00.780
If I ever thought I had discipline or I worked hard,

68
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.490
I compare myself to that guy. He was like, I'm a lazy. This, this guy was,

69
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.630
he worked so hard,

70
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.110
but he was telling me that this is just how it was with family.

71
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.830
Nothing you ever did is good enough. Like he's Korean. And he was like,

72
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.510
my parents are so ruthless. It's like everything had to be better.

73
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.620
Nothing was ever good.

74
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:22.290
It didn't matter if he had straight A's you could do better.

75
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.390
You could always do better. You never, never good enough.

76
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.150
<v 0>It's interesting. I think, um, that,</v>

77
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:30.330
that is more like the very stereotypical Asian parents,

78
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.100
the helicopter tiger parents or whatever tiger parents, tiger mom,

79
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:39.450
I think is a real term. Um, mine is, I guess, a little nuanced.

80
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.920
Like they would give it up for academic and they always call me smart and stuff,

81
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.600
but they will make fun of me. Like I remember, uh, uh,

82
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.330
after orchestra practice in high school ones,

83
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.390
my dad came very proud of me playing the violin was like, oh, you're great.

84
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:58.230
You know? So that stuff they'll give it up, you know? But then a girl,

85
00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:02.670
this really cute white girl came and talked to me after Tracy was her name, uh,

86
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.060
that I kind of had a crush on. Uh, she just came and talked to me. She was like,

87
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.340
oh my God, you're so good. Hey,

88
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.230
I'll talk to you later gave me a hug and everything. And I was such a nerd.

89
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:13.770
I didn't get any action. And then, and then I just looked at my dad.

90
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.930
I was hoping he'll be proud, you know?

91
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:18.330
And then he looked at me and is like shoo and her.

92
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.820
<v 2>Yeah. Wow. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.940
<v 0>So certain things like it goes a little too far, making fun of you.</v>

94
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.750
That's a confidence crusher from pops. Yeah. But I mean, once again,

95
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:31.200
it could be because he grew up, he never got no girls like that. So he's like,

96
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.330
if I couldn't like, why would my son, you know,

97
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.850
you think he's competing with you a little bit there in that way.

98
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.720
I hate to think about that, but I think there's gotta be a part of.

99
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.420
<v 3>That. That's gotta be a part of why he wanted to get into acting.</v>

100
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.970
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.210
<v 3>I maybe that's one of the reasons why he's so confident it's because he on you</v>

102
00:05:51.211 --> 00:05:56.070
and if you can do it, he's like this guy can do it. Yeah. Yeah.

103
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.010
It's a weird, like he picks.

104
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.700
<v 0>And chooses what he gives it up and not. Ooh.</v>

105
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.560
<v 3>So it's manipulative a little bit. So you never know, it's like, uh.</v>

106
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.150
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Stockholm syndrome.</v>

107
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.380
<v 0>I, I called them out once and I was like that. Why don't you.</v>

108
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.390
<v 2>Why, why didn't you.</v>

109
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.640
<v 0>First of all, tell me any dating advice. And also,</v>

110
00:06:18.641 --> 00:06:22.480
why did you never think I could like date Q girls or whatever, right.

111
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.500
Like that took me years to overcome. And he was like, sure.

112
00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:28.540
But like I always said you were smart. Right?

113
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.940
Like he just gave me like a non-answer of like, he was like,

114
00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:33.190
but I always said you were smart. That's what, w what's important to me.

115
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.890
<v 2>Um, yeah. So.</v>

116
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.710
<v 3>It's sort of like, he's excusing the fact that he, uh,</v>

117
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.950
dismissed your ability to.

118
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.240
<v 0>I think, whatever he wasn't good at. He projected on me.</v>

119
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.710
Like I was, uh, as small as I was, I was a pretty good athlete.

120
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:54.190
I could run pretty fast. I can jump pretty high. I used to play basketball,

121
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.580
even though small it's like the underdog, but I was athletic, you know?

122
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.420
But my dad, like when I was trying out for the high school basketball team,

123
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.110
that was like, no, you, you can't do that. You're flat-footed just like me.

124
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:05.944
You can't come on.

125
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.050
<v 3>Oh man. So that's a very,</v>

126
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.090
it's the opposite of what some weird like theater parents do or,

127
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.940
or out coach parents do. Like just a thing that,

128
00:07:15.941 --> 00:07:20.290
that happens when kids get into athletics, where their parents failed at sports,

129
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.260
and then they get really invested in their kid being awesome.

130
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.520
<v 0>Yes. Yes. I'm not sure which way is healthier or both of them less healthy.</v>

131
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.593
Yeah.

132
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.340
<v 3>They're both gross. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:37.210
There's something really weird about like, it's a burden too, for the kids.

134
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.080
Like I've seen it with kids where the overbearing parents just want the kid to

135
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:45.190
succeed so well, because it, it like, that's my boy out there kicking.

136
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.160
That's my boy. Look how fast you were very selfish.

137
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.920
<v 0>You don't really care about the kid being happy or not.</v>

138
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.260
<v 3>It also with the kid's head and it, a lot of times it,</v>

139
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:58.210
it ruins their love of whatever the sport is. Yeah.

140
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.780
<v 2>Yeah. Um, I don't know. I guess</v>

141
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.820
ma you know, it's fine. It's fine. Um, I'm fine.

142
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.080
<v 4>Joe. I'm fine. Fine. I'm fine.</v>

143
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:14.980
I've seen enough therapy. I'm fine. Did it's fine.

144
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.570
It's fine. He's flawed. We're all flawed. Yeah, no worries.

145
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.920
It's like the.

146
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.700
<v 0>Seen in a Goodwill hunting, like I'm afraid you're going to be like Robin.</v>

147
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.430
<v 2>Williams and be like, it's not your fault. It's not your fault.</v>

148
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:28.480
And that just start balling.
