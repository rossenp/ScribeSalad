00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.520
<v 1>Experience. First of all, the game looks tell everybody who you are,</v>

3
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:06.354
what you do.

4
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.660
<v 0>Um, my name is Hugo Martin and I'm the game director on doing maternal.</v>

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.260
<v 1>The dragon is back yet. Let me tell you something, folks.</v>

6
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:16.590
We just played some of do maternal.

7
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.390
He showed us the game and show him and ran through the, some of the first level.

8
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:26.070
Holy. God. It's so next level it's so next level graphics.

9
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:29.730
It's so cool. Everything about it, like the weapons, the demons,

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.780
the way you kill them. It's the most violent thing I've ever seen in my life.

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.970
It's awesome. It's so ridiculous. But it's like,

12
00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:38.880
it seems like it's okay because it's violence against demons. Yeah.

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.390
<v 0>And we, we, we work hard on that. Like you never,</v>

14
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.350
there's no cursing that I have three kids. There's no cursing. There's no sex.

15
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.350
I do want it to be something that my nine year old could play.

16
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.670
<v 1>You think it's kind of crazy that you could rip people's heads off.</v>

17
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.760
You could shove their arm down their throat. You could cut them in half.

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.210
That's fine. Just don't use any of those naughty words, kids. Yeah.

19
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.760
<v 0>Yes, because I was joking with someone the other day. It's like,</v>

20
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.140
when I'm with my kids, like,

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.720
he's not going to go up to somebody and like glory kill them.

22
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.973
But when someone says.

23
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.410
<v 1>They were the glory killers, cause it sounds too much like glory hole.</v>

24
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.730
We're going to get really confused.

25
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.560
<v 0>So in the game, when you damage a demon, uh, enough, they will glow, uh,</v>

26
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:18.930
with like a shader on them. And that means you can go to do a,

27
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.300
a Malay finisher basically, which is like a,

28
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.780
a melee attack and you'll get help from it. And there there's really,

29
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:25.350
really cool.

30
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.440
<v 1>And melee, we should explain is like with your own hands,</v>

31
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:32.340
you can rip them apart or cut them in half with a sword or a chainsaw. Yes.

32
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.180
<v 0>It's so crazy. Like when my kids see that they're not going to do that,</v>

33
00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:39.000
but when they hear someone use the F word, they're like, oh,

34
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.020
I could use that in everyday life. And that sucks.

35
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.290
<v 1>Interesting rationalization. I'm not buying it, but the game is awesome.</v>

36
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.160
And it would be cool if you had an R rated mode that you had to like enter in

37
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.980
your security number, social security number or something and it'll unlock it.

38
00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:57.750
It shows you're over 21 or over 18.

39
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:00.870
I feel like over 18. Yeah. And then you just hire your brother, dude,

40
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:02.400
get in here. I'll give you five bucks a month.

41
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.080
<v 0>That would be awesome. It's cartoonish violence. So you could see it.</v>

42
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.330
It's very much like a cartoon, you know? Yeah.

43
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.250
<v 1>And again, you're killing monsters,</v>

44
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.350
walking dead when they spike them in the head,

45
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.150
you can't do that to a person on TV, but you could do.

46
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.760
<v 0>It to Islamic and their demons from hell. You're doing God's work.</v>

47
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.330
<v 1>Yes, that's right. And we should explain that.</v>

48
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.830
Doom was one of the very first 3d games who was castle Wolf and

49
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:29.640
Stein. Right. That was like the first one with ed software.

50
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.250
We've had Carmack in before. He's no longer with the software,

51
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:33.420
but who is his will. It's.

52
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.100
<v 0>Still there. No, he's not there anymore.</v>

53
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.110
<v 1>Without hauling said no, what the bro? How's it did software,</v>

54
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.400
Marty Stratton name. You got a whole bunch of new people running it. Listen,

55
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:45.121
whoever's running it.

56
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:48.930
They're doing an amazing job because that game looks set and I'm scared.

57
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.440
I'm scared. I'm gonna get sucked into it. It's awesome. The game, first of all,

58
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.670
the game play, and then just the beginning sequence, the end game,

59
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.940
like whole sequence looks like, uh, like a CGI movie.

60
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:02.770
It doesn't look like game play.

61
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.360
Like remember when we used to play games and he used to have that opening scene,

62
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.800
there was like a video. And then it would go to the game and the game was crude.

63
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.750
This game is exactly like the opening scene, which is so crazy.

64
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.020
<v 0>No, pre-rendered that everything. Those are the end game assets.</v>

65
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.770
That's how good they are. The team is like insane. The guys are true. Artists,

66
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.500
craftsmen, you know, like they just go crazy on the details.

67
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:28.930
And when you zoom in with the camera for the cinematics,

68
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:32.260
they completely hold up the rigging. Like it's like a feature film. It's nuts.

69
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.410
<v 1>Are you guys there? There it is right now. Let's play the let's play the, the,</v>

70
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.120
uh, the old jailer. This.

71
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.200
<v 0>Is the old trailer. Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.510
<v 1>This trailer is good. Just play it for people.</v>

73
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.103
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

74
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.320
<v 1>And if you're just listening, you got to see this on YouTube.</v>

75
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.800
If you're like, I'm a grown-up bottom of types.

76
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.900
I have an IRA and a 401k and I have kids. Me too. Me too.

77
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.130
<v 4>People will not bring you peace. Won't be,</v>

78
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.800
make the burden worse.

79
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.890
<v 2>We have. So</v>

80
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.940
this sacrifice in the name of our.

81
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.013
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

82
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.590
<v 1>Now, if you're just listening, this is just annoying music and noise.</v>

83
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.530
But if you're watching, it looks sick.

84
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.480
<v 0>Oh. And then it gets my head quickly.</v>

85
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.890
<v 1>The angels angels too. Oh Jesus. Oh.</v>

86
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.400
So he's like the boss demon.

87
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.953
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

88
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.840
<v 1>God. This looks good.</v>

89
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.890
Doom eternal.

90
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.960
It looked quite anticipate a massive waste of time for people three 20.

91
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.990
So that's when it comes out. So it was that nine days from now.

92
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.000
<v 0>Yes. Wow. That guy, if you're Bruce Lee, that is your Chuck Norris.</v>

93
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.790
Yeah. And you guys are going to, and then the whole scene, actually,

94
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.800
when you meet him, w which is a little clip from that,

95
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.600
it's really inspired by that scene. Uh,

96
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.930
is it enter the dragon or return to the dragon when he fights Chuck Norris?

97
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:54.640
<v 1>I think it's under the dragon.</v>

98
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.550
<v 0>Yes. And, uh, you know, like when they square off in the Coliseum, like,</v>

99
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.850
you know, you, you, he comes out and he said some bad and you're like,

100
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:02.720
look at him and you're gonna find.

101
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.480
<v 1>That is a great way of the dragon.</v>

102
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.470
<v 0>Is it the way of the dragon, the dragon or for the star wars fans? We say like,</v>

103
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.810
it's like your OB one and that's your Darth Maul.

104
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.020
<v 1>Uh, okay. I liked the first announcement.</v>

105
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.000
<v 0>A little bit where.</v>

106
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.230
<v 1>It's just like, I don't know.</v>

107
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.100
Star wars has become to Disnifying it doesn't really sync up with that.

108
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.820
<v 0>The fight is bad-ass though, between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul and man.</v>

109
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:29.450
It's awesome.

110
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.400
<v 1>Yeah. That's pretty bad. Yeah, it does. Before it went to.</v>

111
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.230
<v 0>The fights in the prequels were amazing. They were really good. Yes.</v>

112
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.650
I've watched the one against obiwan and, and, um,

113
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.430
an akin like a million times. Like, I love that one. It's so good.

114
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.700
Like when they sh and the Levin and they just go off on each other and like,

115
00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.360
it it's a mate, George described it in an interview that it would be like,

116
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:53.420
you would be seeing a Jedi at their peak that,

117
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.180
that really in the first three star wars films, they were not at their peak.

118
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:59.090
And then in the prequels, you would see them in their prime, like kicks in,

119
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.270
in his prime. So like, that's, what's so cool about that fight.

120
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:04.820
They're just going off on each other. It's amazing. Yeah.

121
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.750
<v 1>Well,</v>

122
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.100
what you guys have done is create something that's going to ruin people's lives.

123
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.570
So I hope you're really excited about massive waste of time. I mean,

124
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.930
we were talking before the show about video games and the addictive quality of

125
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:21.170
video games. I have a real problem. I just can't play him that much.

126
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.330
I guess I can dip my toe in every now and then.

127
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:25.400
And then I shake my head and I got to go running or something.

128
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.300
Cause otherwise it'll get the grip on me. Yes. There are two fun.

129
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.490
Like there's no movie that you're going to watch.

130
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:33.710
It gives you the kind of engagement that your video game downs.

131
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.630
<v 0>Cause you're like in the movie. Yes. And it.</v>

132
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.390
<v 1>Looks like a movie now.</v>

133
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.990
<v 0>And you see what the glory kills.</v>

134
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:42.590
Like you are your own fight choreographer for your sick of breaking the arm and

135
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:45.740
shoving it in his head, then swing around from behind and cut them in half,

136
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.000
you know, do anything you want.

137
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.580
<v 1>So now, as far as multiplayer, because I'm not really into playing games,</v>

138
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.350
the game game I'm into multiplayer.

139
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.290
<v 0>You. I promise if you play the single player,</v>

140
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.980
what is unique about our single player is that it will give you the same buzz

141
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.520
that a multiplayer will give you because your opponents this time are the AI and

142
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.470
that opening level. That's why belts. You're,

143
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:09.020
you're messing with like easy dudes. Um,

144
00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.930
the later on it will continue to level up. And as you saw,

145
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.390
like that guy that comes out with the ax, like, again, he is,

146
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.790
he is as tough as you are. So, uh,

147
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.430
you will get the same feeling from the single-player that you do from a

148
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.690
multiplayer. It's not really possible.

149
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.100
<v 1>What I like as duels. I like, like, like in quake champions,</v>

150
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:28.760
I like playing duels and that's, what's fun for me. Like one on one,

151
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:32.720
like me and Jamie would get barbecued and we'd come here and we play for hours.

152
00:08:32.721 --> 00:08:37.040
Just one-on-one you run around the map and collect your rocket launchers and

153
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:40.700
your ammo and armor and and just each other up.

154
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.050
<v 0>We have a multiplayer called battle mode. That is awesome. Like it's really,</v>

155
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:46.640
really good. And then is it.

156
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.320
<v 1>Like quake multiplayer? Like.</v>

157
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.650
<v 0>No, it's, it's different. It's, it's very unique. Uh,</v>

158
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.740
the last multiplayer we remade was not super well received.

159
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:57.000
It was a really competent, good multiplayer, but it was,

160
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.630
I was just doomed 2016 is multiplayer experience. But, um,

161
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.040
it really wasn't innovative enough.

162
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.350
Like fans wanted to see us like do something new.

163
00:09:04.351 --> 00:09:08.070
So we basically took the single player experience that combat loop that you'll

164
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:10.890
master. And then we, we give you a way to do it with your friends.

165
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.690
It's a two V one. So it'd be, you know,

166
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.540
two of you guys versus one guy gets to be this layer with all the guns.

167
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.300
And it's really, really cool. And then there's invasion. So like,

168
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.710
you'll play the single player campaign and then someone can become a demon.

169
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.410
Like Jamie could become a demon and then invade you while you're playing.

170
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:27.840
And you won't know where he is and he'll just come out and try to with you.

171
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:28.470
Like.

172
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.680
<v 1>It's really cool. But is there any one-on-one multiplayer.</v>

173
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.170
<v 0>Invasions kind of one-on-one but battle mode,</v>

174
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:36.780
the closest we'd be we come to the one-on-one is two V one.

175
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.370
<v 1>Oh, okay. That's weird.</v>

176
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.580
Why did you side two versus one instead of one versus one.

177
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.910
<v 0>It's just unique, you know, it's, it's, uh, the balance there,</v>

178
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:47.910
no one demon can stand against the Slayer. You know,

179
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.030
the doom guy is all powerful. He's got all these, you know, he's right here.

180
00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.600
He's, he's got all the guns and the mods and he's got eight guys.

181
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.820
<v 1>Bicep exposed. It seems like a vulnerability.</v>

182
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.970
<v 0>It's like a kind of, pretty much.</v>

183
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.340
<v 1>She's. If someone comes on cuts his arm off,</v>

184
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:03.900
it seems like that's a good spot to hit.

185
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.870
<v 0>His arms. You're like trees. So like they're made.</v>

186
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.530
<v 1>Out of jelly donuts. They're very.</v>

187
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.770
<v 0>They are so big that in one scene he raises like a sword and the bicep just like</v>

188
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.080
is absurdly huge. But, but, um.

189
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.380
<v 1>That's cute, but it's still made out of meat. That's true.</v>

190
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.100
<v 0>That's true. The, the, uh, I forgot what I was saying, but yes, you, you,</v>

191
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.730
you can compete. Vital mode is really good. You really like it.

192
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.440
<v 1>Yeah. But why don't you ever one-on-one?</v>

193
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:33.600
<v 0>Uh, because we just, it didn't, it just didn't work out that way. Like, do you.</v>

194
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.480
<v 1>Anticipate anything like that in the future on, or.</v>

195
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.350
<v 0>You never know? Like certainly, uh, we'll see, but, but we're really,</v>

196
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:42.960
really proud of this. Like I think what you want to do is you,

197
00:10:42.961 --> 00:10:44.080
you got to innovate. If,

198
00:10:44.081 --> 00:10:47.460
if you want to make something that's really going to engage people like that.

199
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.750
Like the whole point is to like give them something to master that they've never

200
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:52.500
seen before.

201
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.410
Because if you're just asking me to master a new version of a thing that I

202
00:10:55.411 --> 00:10:57.720
already mastered. Sure. A lot of people would appreciate that,

203
00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.640
but you're not really going to capture like a large audience.

204
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.480
So we really created something that was completely unique. And, um,

205
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.403
so we're excited.

206
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:04.951
<v 1>Now,</v>

207
00:11:04.951 --> 00:11:08.220
is there going to be a death match mode where like all of us can get in a room

208
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:09.120
and each other up?

209
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.010
<v 0>Uh, no, Jesus Christ.</v>

210
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.060
<v 1>You go, what are you doing?</v>

211
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.880
<v 0>We, we have, uh, quick champions for that.</v>

212
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.510
<v 1>I know, but we already played quake champions. I want to play that.</v>

213
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.760
I'm going to use those weapons. Well with that guy,

214
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.530
like this is this the multiplayer, Jason.

215
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.000
<v 0>This is the multiplayer. Jesus Christ looks crazy. It is nuts, dude.</v>

216
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.510
The it's kind of based on a couple of core pillars of like,

217
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:32.070
we needed something that had a lot of drama.

218
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.170
We wanted something that I had a lot of pacing,

219
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:38.370
like the variations and pacing in the match and something with deep strategy.

220
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.730
So, and was primarily innovative, like unlike anything, any,

221
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.670
anything anybody had played before and was for like,

222
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.250
it's a multiplayer for people who love do maternal.

223
00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.310
So play the dual maternal single player. You'll you'll like this.

224
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.650
<v 1>Right. It looks so incredible, man. It's awesome.</v>

225
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.430
The graphics are so off the charts. I just want to play this right now.

226
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.280
I'm looking at this video that Jamie's playing, uh,

227
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.030
showing the video of this guy playing. And it's just, it looks incredible.

228
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.760
<v 0>He's he's the Slayer you're seeing through the Slayer right now.</v>

229
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.040
And those two demons that he shooting with the numbers coming out of them.

230
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:10.180
Those are the other guys.
