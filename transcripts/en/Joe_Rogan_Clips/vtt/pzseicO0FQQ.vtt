<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.060
<v 3>How did you become the undertaker? So,</v>

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.810
so that's, that's Vince's brainchild.

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:14.340
So I went to another company WCW where I was a main mark

5
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:18.960
callous and, uh, the right day I checked that young stud out right there.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.690
That's terrifying in it. Ms.

7
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.310
Hobbit. Yeah, that's a, yeah,

8
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.720
we can take that down anytime.

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.210
So I go there and, uh, I was about,

10
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.790
I was there about eight or nine months and, uh,

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.150
my contract was coming up and I go,

12
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.390
I go in to renegotiate my contract and they were like, look,

13
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.000
you're great athlete kid, but no one's ever going to pay money to watch Russell.

14
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.780
Like, I'm just looking for a little bit of bump, right.

15
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:04.050
A little bump in my paycheck. I'm not looking for the mega deal.

16
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.610
I'm just looking for a little bit of bump.

17
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.660
Now we're going to give you the same deal for a year.

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.190
<v 0>I mean, you just, you know, you do great things in the ring,</v>

19
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.350
but no one's ever going to pay money to see you Russell,

20
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.670
did they give you advice on how to get someone to pay? Oh, wow. That was it.

21
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.690
That was it. So I'm like, okay, well my ceiling,

22
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:29.550
I know where my ceiling is here. Right. So, uh, just through,

23
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
uh, you know, a few different people, I get connected with some people in the,

24
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:38.070
in the WWE WWF at the time WWE now. And, um,

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.200
I had a match coming up. My hip was already bad at that point, even back then.

26
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.210
Yeah, it, it got much worse, but I was already limping. And, uh,

27
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.700
and I just heard it when we'd got Vince, you know, they had said art, you know,

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.880
they've got a, pay-per-view just watching him work. You know?

29
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.780
So Vance watches me work and I'm calm. Like I I'm I'm, you know,

30
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:04.440
talking to my buddy, Bruce I'm like, Bruce, my hip is jacked. He goes,

31
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.750
just go out there and Vince is going to be watching. Right.

32
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.120
So I'm working with a guy by the name of Lex Luger,

33
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.660
went out there and did what I could. I sucked. I mean, I, you know, I was,

34
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.870
I was physically, you know, I was physically not able really to,

35
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:21.870
to go the way I could go. And that's what impressed, you know, he's like, okay,

36
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.730
he's, you know, he's run of the mill. Fortunately guys like, uh, you know,

37
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.660
Paul Heyman and, and, uh, and Bruce Prichard, you know,

38
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:35.550
they believed in me and they kind of kept pushing for me to get this meeting

39
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:40.050
with Vince. And finally I did, and he calls me I got to go to his house. Right.

40
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.320
So I go to his house Vince's house, like,

41
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.170
it's nice. It's, he's a Connecticut man.

42
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:53.790
He's Greenwich. Yeah. So I'm up in hall to the castle. Oh dude.

43
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.290
Yeah. And that's what I'm thinking. Right? Cause most people go to the,

44
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.650
the office to the towers they're in Stanford. Right. And I'm thinking,

45
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.890
I'm going to the house. I got this. Right.

46
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.800
So I go in and have the meeting meeting goes for about an hour and a half.

47
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.070
And you know, and this, you know,

48
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.100
there's a lot of Butler,

49
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.970
but I know we had a housekeeper.

50
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.140
Imagine there'd be a dude with a British accent from the door.

51
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.720
I never saw him just ramped. Right.

52
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:30.550
You had to be everybody everybody's jacket works. But, uh, so I go,

53
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.130
I go there and uh, you know,

54
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.910
granted we do some hokey. It is what it is.

55
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.460
And they really, at that point had some really, really goofy characters.

56
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.960
And uh, you know, so we're having this,

57
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.210
we're sitting in his living room and he goes, well, mark, you guys,

58
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.150
do you have any hidden talents? You know, other than, you know, wrestling,

59
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.180
do you do anything? You know? And I'm trying to be funny and not nervous.

60
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.300
And uh, well, you know, I was singing in the shower pretty good.

61
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.240
And as soon as I said it, right, I'm like, oh. I shouldn't have said that.

62
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.170
I'm going to be, I'm going to be shower guy or something.

63
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.630
Some silly right shower. I'm going to have to sit, you know, and I'm thinking,

64
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.340
I'm like, oh, I should not have said that. Right. And then I'm like,

65
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.220
I'm kidding. I'm trying to clear the air right away. Like, I'm just getting,

66
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.910
I can't sing. You know? And he, you know, he's got the look right.

67
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.750
And he knows how to, you know, he can read people and he's like, really? Oh no,

68
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.890
I can't. I can't. So I got this long meeting right. At the end of the meeting,

69
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.610
he goes, well, we don't have anything for you right now.

70
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.900
I think, uh, oh. I guess, uh,

71
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.910
I guess overplayed my hand here.

72
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.200
Cause I'd already give WCW my notice that I was leaving. I like, I got it.

73
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.510
I'm this is what I'm thinking in my head. Right. I was like, okay.

74
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.560
He invited me to the house. He's going to hire me. Right. That's all I,

75
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.870
you guys, I'll see you guys down the road. So now I'm sitting there.

76
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.540
I got no job. And uh, anyway, so one day,

77
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.300
uh, it's getting, it's getting close to Thanksgiving and uh,

78
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.850
they start doing this promotion where they've got this giant egg.

79
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.870
You heard the story gobbledygook, the gobbly Cougar. Right?

80
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.070
So we do a pay-per-view around SA uh, around Thanksgiving.

81
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:25.240
It's called survivor series. So this year, this particular year, it's 1990.

82
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.020
They're gonna, yeah, there it is. Uh,

83
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.520
they've got this giant egg on the set on the TV every week and I'm sitting there

84
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:35.440
thinking to myself, holy.

85
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.550
I'm going to be now I've gone from shower guy. Now.

86
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:43.360
I think I'm going to be egg man. Right. I'm going to have to, you know,

87
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.620
I'm trying to grow my hair out and. He's gonna make me shave my head.

88
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:51.610
I might shave my eyebrows. I'm F I'm going to be egg man off.

89
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.380
And I'm a nervous wreck. Right?

90
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.070
So one day I'm sitting at home phone rings.

91
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.790
I get up and go answer it. Cause we didn't have cell phones back then. Right.

92
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.390
So hello. And he goes, is, uh,

93
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.640
is this the undertaker? I was like, undertaker,

94
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.780
undertaker, undertaker hitting. Heck man.

95
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.470
undertaker. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. This is undertaker. Yeah.

96
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.310
And it was Vince. And that was how I introduced the character to me. He.

97
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.230
<v 1>Called you up and asked you if you're the.</v>

98
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.680
<v 0>Undertaker. Yeah. And I had no clue to what it was. Wow. And uh, uh,</v>

99
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.740
I said, yeah, I I'm the undertaker. Cause I knew it wasn't egg man.

100
00:06:36.741 --> 00:06:39.950
And everything had to be better than egg man sing in the shower. Yeah.

101
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.970
It wasn't singing the shower guide. It wasn't egg man flew me up to Connecticut.

102
00:06:43.971 --> 00:06:47.480
The next day he showed me the storyboards and the character of the original

103
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.860
character is based on an old Western undertaker.

104
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.160
You know, the two guys and main street, they had the shootout.

105
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.260
One guy loses the undertaker, comes out and measures them. Does the box.

106
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.630
Well, that was the original likeness and the name, the undertaker.

107
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.640
And uh, he'd just never found the guy he had had it for years, I guess.

108
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.660
So why did he send.

109
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.680
<v 1>You away the first time.</v>

110
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.580
<v 0>When you went? He didn't have he at the time he didn't have a spot for me,</v>

111
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.650
but he was thinking, but he was thinking,

112
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.730
and then it kind of dawned on him that he had that character and he just needed

113
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:24.260
a big guy with no personality.

114
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.910
He needed to go, you know, there was void of personality to do the deal and uh,

115
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:35.300
and he gave it to me. And um, there's my debut right there.

116
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.450
That's November of 1990. Yeah.

117
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.500
<v 2>And I was six years old and I was my pants. Where are you?</v>

118
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:45.980
This was the scariest thing. You can imagine for a six-year-old, you know,

119
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.750
you're watching all these, you know, the Gibbs,

120
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.990
some guy in a chicken suit that came out of that egg to show you how silly

121
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:53.210
things were back then. So it had our attention.

122
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.720
And then all of a sudden this guy comes out and he's like half dead and you

123
00:07:56.721 --> 00:08:01.520
don't know what's going on and he's scary and dominant more than anything.

124
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.190
<v 0>Yeah. Th the thing was, was dominant,</v>

125
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.990
but this is the era of everything. I mean,

126
00:08:08.991 --> 00:08:13.250
you could tell this guy's in bright pink. And so that's Coco be aware.

127
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:15.020
Yeah.

128
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.890
<v 1>He's wearing some hot.</v>

129
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.780
<v 0>Yoga pants, you know?</v>

130
00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:18.921
<v 2>I mean, you know,</v>

131
00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:22.760
that guy had a parrot on his shoulder when he came to the ring. Did he? Yeah.

132
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.140
Right. Was it a parrot?

133
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.970
