00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 1>The right we'll do it, the right.</v>

3
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.350
I mean the Q Anon things kind of a way they're doing it where they're like,

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.410
David spades got an ankle brace and on,

5
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:14.190
and he's in jail and Trump's put everyone in the house arrest,

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.590
like they're in this other thing where it's like, oh,

7
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:20.550
you guys have left the planet. And you like, so explain.

8
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.870
<v 2>Pete to people who don't know what this QAnon Q1.</v>

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.830
<v 1>On stuff is like.</v>

10
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.130
Th there is this idea that there's an intelligence dissemination operation

11
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:28.491
happening,

12
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:32.930
meaning behind the scenes high-level intelligence guys or military people are

13
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:37.190
leaking information about a shadow war that we don't really see happening.

14
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.290
And the shadow war involves Trump and the people on the side of lightness

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.030
battling the, you know,

16
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:48.710
these deep state pedophile cannon pedophile cannibals. Like, I don't know why,

17
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.040
like, I don't never understood why they have to be cannibals out of tomorrow.

18
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.950
They were cannibals. They're no, they're cannibals. They're eating children.

19
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:57.320
And then they get the adrenochrome and it keeps them young. Oh, that's right.

20
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.010
So this is all the end. Then Trump is going to war with all of them right now.

21
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:05.240
Listen, pedophilia is a big problem. They do cover up at high levels.

22
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.870
A hundred percent. The Epstein stuff is 100% real,

23
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.680
a hundred percent Clinton's on that plane. He's on that island, 26 times,

24
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.340
the Franklin scandal there scandals all over the world. So I'm not,

25
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:19.610
de-legitimizing like the idea of real human trafficking,

26
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.410
but the idea that Donald Trump is fighting human

27
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:27.470
traffickers and the human traffickers are Ellen,

28
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.780
who is a little wild that everyone in Hollywood's eating children and

29
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:36.200
there's tunnels under central PA. I mean, it's hard to keep up with.

30
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.420
And the Q drops, so to speak are like these, these, um, you know,

31
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.750
they're like, they're like poems or they're, they're coded information.

32
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:47.900
So it's never like, Hey, this is what's happened at these drops.

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.270
Where do you get a four Chan or something? You get them like, unfortunately,

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.810
but.

35
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.150
<v 2>Fortune is the best place in the world.</v>

36
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.450
<v 1>For trolls. Well, that's what, maybe this is, this could be like,</v>

37
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.010
that's what I'm saying. Yeah. It could be a title.

38
00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.680
Nobody knows because it's bay, it has nuggets of truth, right?

39
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.790
Just like anything else, right? It has nuggets of very real things.

40
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.990
The government is shady as.

41
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.330
A lot of the elites are doing things engaging in pedophilia and probably worse.

42
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.840
Like some of those kids on Epstein's island probably did disappear.

43
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.520
But the idea that like that,

44
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.050
that Trump is fighting this underground war and it's all about human traffic.

45
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.530
I just don't think that's born out by the facts.

46
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:26.690
Like there's no facts to point. I mean,

47
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:28.850
Trump was like friends with the Clintons for his whole life.

48
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.080
<v 2>Well, not only that, if Trump was doing it and not talking about it,</v>

49
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:34.010
it would be so.

50
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.920
<v 1>High character, like, imagine.</v>

51
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.490
<v 3>This one thing that is doing this, the most noble thing that he's ever.</v>

52
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.450
<v 1>Done ever. Right. He's the most selfless, the most important,</v>

53
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:46.460
the majority effort, humanity. And he's not even bringing.

54
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.740
<v 2>It up. It's just secretly winking at all the queue.</v>

55
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.350
<v 1>People. Well, you know, and, and so everything he does,</v>

56
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.410
there's like a reason that he does it. They say like, when he wishes lame max,

57
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.410
where he goes, I wish her well, yeah. Now the thing is that's,

58
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.920
that's a rich guy. Who's forgetting he's the president.

59
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.220
Who's just on a TMR Lago. Cause that's how rich people talk. I mean,

60
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.070
that's literally, I've been around a few, like really wealthy people.

61
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.760
This is how they talk. When you say something bad, anything bad. If you go,

62
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.700
you know, you know, John's wife has cancer. You know, their kid had a,

63
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.610
we he's got a problem. He had a couple incidents there at Harvard.

64
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.170
They collect this guy. I them, well, T off that's, that's how they talk.

65
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.490
That's how they tell you. It's just a dismissal. It's a way to dismiss it.

66
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.280
But the cute people are like, oh, there's a meaning. There's hidden.

67
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.610
Meaning he's saying that she's and if you look at it,

68
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.120
Ivanka is wearing this dress. And it means, and it's just like, listen,

69
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.710
I'm a conspiracy guy, but this is well, the, I don't care my.

70
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.130
<v 2>Jacket, the jacket. I don't care. Do you, is.</v>

71
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.120
<v 1>That what it said? I don't care. I don't really care to you, right? Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:45.121 --> 00:03:48.330
I mean, it's weird. Is this? Yeah, these are weird things. What are we doing?

73
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.870
So I think the Trump administration feeds the trolls. Like I think they like it.

74
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.200
I think he'll, by the time you lecture rolls around, he'll be like full,

75
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.570
full kill. Just leaning in who's who's.

76
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.610
<v 2>Behind the scenes, pulling the strings. Is it Ivanka?</v>

77
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.310
WCHR Cushner has a lot of power,

78
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.410
but wouldn't it be funny if it was Ivanka doing the whole thing?

79
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.770
She's the one like stroking her chin. Like she's the boss.

80
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.330
What is the nugget we released next? Right?

81
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.820
<v 1>She's she's cute. She's the.</v>

82
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.500
<v 2>Smart one. Who's like, how do we, how do we, yeah, she's the pretty daughter.</v>

83
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.920
Everybody dismisses her. I mean, nobody takes her, right?

84
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.850
She's the background and the whole show. Q black leather gloves on.

85
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.830
<v 1>The elbow. Like the inspector gadget hand. You just hear hand typing.</v>

86
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.900
Unfortunate send, send. Yeah. I don't, I don't know, man. You know,

87
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:38.310
Steve Bannon said something and there was a documentary about arrow arrow.

88
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.200
Morris made a documentary about Steve Bannon's.

89
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:43.140
He backed into this very interesting thing. He said, you know,

90
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.620
there's a guy out there. Who's got a horrible life. Like he's divorced.

91
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:48.330
His kids. Don't like him. He has a job.

92
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.150
But when he plays like league league of legends or world of Warcraft,

93
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:54.330
one of these games, he's a hero. And when he dies in real life,

94
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.400
nobody really cares what, when he dies in the game.

95
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.580
So many people come out and they like, they, you know, they show them respect.

96
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.100
Cause you're playing with people from all over the world. So band is like,

97
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.730
which, which life is the real life. So which of course,

98
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.910
it's the real one that you're living, not this fantasy game,

99
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.780
but I think the Q Anon thing, I think the Trump administration is like, yeah,

100
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.950
let people believe they're hunting pedophiles online. It gives their lives.

101
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:20.610
Meaning like let these people believe. They're like hunting the Clintons.

102
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:23.040
It's like fun. It's like a fun video game for them.

103
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:25.530
And then they don't have to ask why they don't have health insurance and can't

104
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:26.610
get a knee operation.

105
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.880
<v 2>I don't think that it's that involved.</v>

106
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.450
I think it's just a thing that's happening that happens to fit in with human

107
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:35.260
nature. That's probably true too. Yeah.

108
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.290
Like I don't believe that the Trump administration has the resources to do that,

109
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.700
but still, I mean, they would have to be so 4d chess. They would,

110
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.610
they would really have to.

111
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.910
<v 1>I think they may like encourage you to, well,</v>

112
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.160
I think they may just pour a little gasoline on it. Maybe. Why not?

113
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:56.520
They think that's their base. They're like, why not? They're having fun.

114
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.900
Go as a Trump rally. You want a little fun? Oh, for sure.

115
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.160
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. It's the things that he does that are mistakes.</v>

116
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.450
Like these, these interviews that he does, where he he'll argue about,

117
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.950
like he'll, he'll argue about how well they're doing or what, you know,

118
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:17.870
what's wrong or what he got right. Or what his IQ is or how well he did at this,

119
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.740
uh, intelligence test. Like anybody's playing like 3d chess.

120
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.530
Not going to do that.

121
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.280
<v 1>No, no. He's not playing any chess,</v>

122
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.700
like instinct he's he's riffing. And we've said it before.

123
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:32.270
I've said it on the show before. It's like, it's amazing to watch a guy get up.

124
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.180
No material, anxious, crush. I mean,

125
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:38.420
just he's really going by instinct. He's perfect.

126
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:42.560
He's perfectly suited for this era. Yeah. Because he's like,

127
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:46.460
he he's hypnotizing. Like if you start listening to him, he can't stop. Like,

128
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:48.830
I'll try to watch one, five minute clip of an interview.

129
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:51.260
I end up watching the whole hour. Yeah. Because he's like,

130
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:55.460
there's a hypnotic thing that's going on where he just is up and down and you

131
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:57.110
just, you can't not listen.
