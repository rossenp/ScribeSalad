00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Right now,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.570
right now we are a week, not even a week out,

3
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:13.020
just a few days away from two mass shootings in a row.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.110
And whenever these things happen,

5
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.770
there's all these people that want action,

6
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:22.920
but nobody knows exactly what to do. There's calls for gun control,

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.390
there's calls for mental health reform. There's calls for, I mean, what,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.520
if anything can be done to stop these things from happening and how have

9
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:37.410
you sat down and tried to come up with some sort of a solution.

10
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.610
And is there a solution?

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.220
<v 1>Look, I would be lying to you if I told you I had a magical answer.</v>

12
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.580
Um, I don't, and this is such a horrific situation. I, you know,

13
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.000
we were in, um, you know, we, we had a town meeting, uh, we were in Nevada,

14
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.540
actually in Las Vegas when El Paso happened.

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.140
And, uh, we did tell me and I said, okay,

16
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.220
let's take a moment of silence to remember the victims and pray for the

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.990
survivors, literally the next day. And another part of Las Vegas,

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.360
I have to do it again. And I said,

19
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:15.660
I can't believe that just yesterday we did this and I have to do it again.

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.450
This is, I don't know what the words my friend Bader or rock would say, good.

21
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.690
You don't know what words, what, what can you say? This happens again and again,

22
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
who can imagine some lunatic walking into a school or a mall,

23
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.290
or just on a nightclub area and taken out of the assault weapon and shooting now

24
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.133
people.

25
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.620
And that we almost become to accept this as a normal part of American life

26
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.410
is, is incredible, is, is, is, is,

27
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.050
is just totally demoralizing art.

28
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.440
So here's what I think there's no magical answer. And,

29
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.290
but let me tell you what I think, first of all, this is the reality.

30
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.130
The reality is that today as we speak,

31
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.940
there are approximately 400 million guns in America.

32
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:01.470
Today we have more guns than we have people

33
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.430
we have between five to 10 million assault weapons and an assault

34
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:09.264
weapon, as you know,

35
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.200
is a military style weapon designed to kill human beings kind of rapidly.

36
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:18.120
So that's, and then on top of that, we have, again,

37
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:19.620
nothing to be proud of, but you know,

38
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.700
we have a number of mentally unstable people, people for whatever reason,

39
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.020
I walk in the streets as suicidal or homicidal. That's the mix that we have.

40
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.520
I think the answer is, and I'm not the guy to invent all these ideas,

41
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:34.830
but here's some of what we have to do. First of all,

42
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.910
if you want own a gun in America,

43
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.820
you have got to, we have got to know that you are a stable person,

44
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:48.390
and that means that we need to expand, uh,

45
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.570
eh, the background checks that currently exist. Okay. So we got to know,

46
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:59.440
did you beat up your wife, have you committed crimes, uh, et cetera, et cetera.

47
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.950
What is the state of your mental health? Uh, number two,

48
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.090
we want to make that universal number two right now

49
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.080
that there is a background check. If you walk into a gun show,

50
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.940
it did look into a gun shop,

51
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.370
but you can buy guns in various states at a gun show and you don't

52
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.310
have to do any of that. You and I go to a gun show, you sell me a gun.

53
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.410
I don't have to, you know, I don't have to do that. Third of all, I can today,

54
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.300
legally walk into a gun show, uh, pass the background,

55
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.830
check and buy a dozen guns,

56
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.970
walk out and sell them to criminal elements who will use them for bad things.

57
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.900
So I think those are issues, um,

58
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.650
that most Americans believe we have got to deal with.

59
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.830
And we can fourthly. I happen to believe,

60
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:52.030
and I believe this for 30 years that we should not be selling with distributing

61
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.430
assault weapons in this country. Uh,

62
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.180
they are weapons of mass destruction in a sense they kill people rapidly as we

63
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.500
saw. And, and thank God by the way, when we talk about both Dayton and El Paso,

64
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.030
thank God cops were there very,

65
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:07.900
very quickly and did an incredible job because of that guy had walked into the

66
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:11.470
nightclub that could have been dozens and dozens, more people killed.

67
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.190
And within a few minutes time, um,

68
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.230
I happen to believe a that we should not be selling or

69
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:24.670
distributing an assault weapons in this country. That's my view period. Uh,

70
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.260
so I believe in a ban on assault weapons.

71
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:30.970
And I think we have got to begin thinking about when we have five to 10 million

72
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.490
assault weapons, which is more than the us military has,

73
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.010
we have to think about a strong licensing procedure in terms of who

74
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:43.150
owns these assault weapons. So that's some of, uh, what I think, eh,

75
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.820
there are many other things, but those are some of the ideas that are out there.

76
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.350
<v 0>Now, the legal gun owners who are law abiding citizens,</v>

77
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.800
who would never in a million years think about going around shooting people,

78
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.030
but they love guns. They hear this kind of stuff about like banning assault,

79
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.050
rifles, banning assault, weapons. They don't even like the term assault weapons,

80
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:02.320
right?

81
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.500
They like to refer to them as their individual names for whatever they are.

82
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.290
These people feel like this is an inexorable part of being an

83
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.000
American,

84
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.060
that you should be able to own a gun it's written into our bill of rights is

85
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:20.920
written into our, the way we, the way this country was founded.

86
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:24.640
It's the second amendment. What do you say to those people that don't,

87
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.750
that don't want to give up their guns, where they wouldn't do,

88
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.050
and they want to protect themselves.

89
00:05:29.051 --> 00:05:33.670
They feel like these guns are viable options to protect themselves from

90
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.504
criminals.

91
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.260
<v 1>I understand that. And Joel, you may know him,</v>

92
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:41.320
a Senator from the state of Vermont and the state of Vermont is one of the most

93
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:43.690
rural states in America, every fall,

94
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.350
that whole thousands and thousands of people are out in the woods hunting.

95
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.050
And it's something that's part of our tradition. I believe in it,

96
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.370
I believe in the second amendment,

97
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.630
but all that I ask of the owners and you're absolutely right.

98
00:05:55.631 --> 00:06:00.320
99.9% of gun owners would never in a million billion years think of doing these

99
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:04.700
horrible things, but in the moment that we are living in,

100
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.540
uh, I think that we're all going to have to make, you know,

101
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.650
some concessions to the reality of what is going on.

102
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:17.030
And that is that there is a small number of call them what you want to pray for

103
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.930
people who are prepared to do that. You know, in Australia,

104
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.810
you remember that terrible, uh, New Zealand, I'm sorry,

105
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.700
the terrible shooting at the mosque. And they moved pretty quickly, uh,

106
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.480
in an aggressive way. So, you know, I wish I can say in, in,

107
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.620
in the best of all possible worlds, yeah. You know,

108
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:39.080
you could own any weapon you want and so forth and said,

109
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.600
we're not living in the best of all possible worlds.

110
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:44.540
We're living in a world where we're shocked every day. My horror.

111
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.620
<v 0>So I, I agree. We are living in a terrible situation. I mean,</v>

112
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:52.760
there's hundreds of mass shootings a year now, which is insane.

113
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:55.400
And if you look at the number in comparison to the rest of the world,

114
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.980
it's crazy like a big one in another country,

115
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.240
like three mass shootings in a year, we had more than 270. Correct.

116
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.470
It's it's crazy. But how would you implement something like this?

117
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.850
<v 1>Well, the idea of banning assault weapons has been done in</v>

118
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:15.710
1994, we've manned assault weapons. Uh, I believe,

119
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.170
I believe it was for 10 years, uh,

120
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:22.580
that ban was undone by Republican majority. Uh,

121
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.540
and it didn't, you know, I'm not suggesting by the way that anything here,

122
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:28.400
that if you banned assault weapons tomorrow,

123
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:29.840
that would radically change everything.

124
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:33.860
But we have got to do the best that we can do. And again,

125
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:36.860
I preface my remarks by telling I don't have a magical solution.

126
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.230
You've got hundreds of millions of guns out there.

127
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.160
You have people who should not be owning these guns who get set off by God,

128
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:46.040
knows what and, and do terrible things.

129
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.270
All we can do is the best that we could do. But to say we can't do anything,

130
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.690
I think is a real disservice to the miracle.

131
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.560
And I'll tell you something else that bothers me. You know,

132
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:02.510
in addition to the horror of seeing people lying on the street dead is

133
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:04.490
what this is doing to the children of this country.

134
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:08.660
And I think we underestimate that. I have seven grandchildren and,

135
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:11.990
and for them, and for kids, all of this country,

136
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.810
you're going to see the falls coming, kids going back to school,

137
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.900
you're going to see in schools all over America, drills are,

138
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.990
this is what you do. If somebody walks into the school, all right,

139
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:24.380
you're going to hide under, here you go over there kids.

140
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.160
A couple of months ago, I was in Iowa. This guy he's about six foot,

141
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:32.450
two big guy, probably a football player. And he says, Senator Sanders,

142
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:36.380
I got to tell you that the young people in my school are increasingly

143
00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.320
frightened, terrified about what could happen in the school.

144
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.780
Think about what this, the trauma, the trauma of,

145
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.650
of what this gun violence is doing. So I think we're all as Americans,

146
00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.780
the Louisiana [inaudible], but they're

147
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:50.780
 all going to have to come together and figure this one out and do the best the

148
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.613
 weekend. Now.

149
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.080
<v 0>Would that mean forcibly removing these guns from</v>

150
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:01.914
people's homes?

151
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:05.100
<v 1>You're going to have the FBI knocking on somebody's doors and taking them.</v>

152
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.210
That's not what we do in America.

153
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:11.280
<v 0>We have 400 million guns already out there building more every year. Right now,</v>

154
00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:13.980
as we speak gun manufacturers are, make money.

155
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.010
Manufacturers are making more guns. This is happening right now.

156
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.040
So if those guns already exist, there's more than enough. Oh yeah.

157
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.240
How would you stop?

158
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.380
<v 1>Well, again, I think, look, you know,</v>

159
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.690
I do think there should be a ban on assault weapons.

160
00:09:27.691 --> 00:09:31.200
So that means that manufacturers would not be able to produce or sell those.

161
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.430
<v 0>To American citizens, but not to the military, obviously, obviously.</v>

162
00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.330
<v 1>Okay. So, you know, and your point is well-taken,</v>

163
00:09:39.331 --> 00:09:42.690
if you've got 400 million guns out there, you know, so I,

164
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:46.470
I think there are approaches, no one has any magical solution,

165
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:49.050
but I've given you a, I'll tell you something else that I didn't mention.

166
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.150
And that is the role of gun manufacturers is that if

167
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:58.380
you are a gun manufacturer and you are selling a hell of a lot of guns

168
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.030
to a gun store in an area, which normally would not think, I mean,

169
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:07.620
these guys know, you know what, cities by what towns, by how many guns.

170
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:13.320
And if suddenly there is a tremendous demand, you gotta be thinking and be like,

171
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.260
why is, why is this con store buying so many guns?

172
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.690
Doesn't reflect the population in the area.

173
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.060
You gotta deal with that issue with the gun owners have to take some

174
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:21.894
responsibility.

175
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.030
<v 0>Besides the guns, the gun.</v>

176
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:24.893
<v 1>Manufacturers.</v>

177
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.020
<v 0>Right? Besides the guns, the gun manufacturers,</v>

178
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.810
the other gigantic issue is mental health.

179
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.580
The only way any of this ever happens is someone has to be insanely

180
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:40.320
mentally depraved. This the only way, and many of them are Medicaid,

181
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.920
and many of them are on pharmaceutical drugs.

182
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.840
And they have been since they were children,

183
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:50.610
including amphetamines like Adderall and Prozac and all this

184
00:10:50.611 --> 00:10:54.960
different stuff that has varied effects on the human brain,

185
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.370
what could be done? What would you done to analyze this,

186
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.450
to find out what the cause and effect are, and to try to figure out what risk,

187
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.200
what role and how much these drugs are responsible?

188
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.641
<v 1>Oh, well, well, two things,</v>

189
00:11:08.641 --> 00:11:12.690
let me response respond first by saying it goes without saying that we have a

190
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:17.610
mental health crisis in America before we even talk about drugs and for whatever

191
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:19.980
reason, um, you know,

192
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.280
there are a whole lot of people in the nature of our healthcare system.

193
00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:27.810
Getting back to healthcare is I just talked to a woman literally last night.

194
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.530
Um, and we had a town meeting and she said,

195
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:37.980
this is unbelievable. She said, Bernie,

196
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.810
I was in Las Vegas when the terrible shooting took place. Okay.

197
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.530
And now I am, and I can understand this perfectly.

198
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.980
I'm seeing Dayton than I'm seeing watching television El Paso,

199
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:55.150
and I'm getting a PT PS PTSD reaction. All right. And that's totally under.

200
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.170
If you were in a place where people were shut down and anxious,

201
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.580
I'm trying to get counseling. I can't find it.

202
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:05.650
I remember a guy called up a woman called at my office in Burlington, Vermont.

203
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.970
And she said, I'm worried about my husband.

204
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.820
What he, my brother was his brother,

205
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.420
what he might do to himself or somebody else we're looking for mental health

206
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:18.400
counseling. We can't find something that we can afford.

207
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.980
So we need above and beyond gun violence we need.

208
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.060
And this is why I believe in Medicare for all mental health is healthcare.

209
00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:31.120
You break your arm. That's a health issue. That's a medical issue.

210
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.610
Mental health is a medical issue.

211
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.860
And we have got to make mental health counseling available to all people in this

212
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:42.940
country when they need it. Not six months from now at a price,

213
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:45.100
they can afford it on the Medicare for all that would be free.

214
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.970
So that's number one. Number two, your point about, uh,

215
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.560
studying the impact of drugs on people's

216
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:58.210
behavior and possibly resulting in violence, absolutely deserves to be studied.

217
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.130
We should be studying the impact of drugs. In my view, this is a layman's view.

218
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.420
You know, I'm not a psychiatrist.

219
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:09.850
I worry very much that we are over medicating kids in

220
00:13:09.851 --> 00:13:14.650
schools. You know, we have this, uh, deficit deficient issue.

221
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.920
You know, kids are running around in their act of, you know, when I was a kid,

222
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:20.200
people used to run around lay or act. If you know what, there wasn't,

223
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.350
they weren't drugged up. So I worry about that whole business,

224
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:24.610
but your point is well taken.

225
00:13:24.611 --> 00:13:28.870
I think we need to study this issue and make sure that these drugs in fact are

226
00:13:28.871 --> 00:13:31.930
not causing kinds of reactions that we will regret.
