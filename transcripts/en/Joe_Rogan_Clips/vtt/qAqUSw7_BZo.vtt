00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>You were just telling me something that is one of the most ridiculous things</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:07.290
I've ever heard that you swam from Maui to Lanai.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.710
Right? And you're the, one of the only humans to ever do that.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.390
<v 1>I am told I was the first person to swim for Maui to Lanai. And back.</v>

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.500
The one way is a pretty famous swim race. That's done every year.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.660
<v 0>The first person to do it the round and go back. dude, why'd you do that?</v>

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.813
<v 1>How long you got.</v>

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.220
<v 0>It started? When I was a boy, they told me I couldn't do it. What,</v>

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.850
what made you want to do that? That's a ridiculous proposition.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.830
<v 1>Um, so I got into, I decided in, it's going to sound silly.</v>

11
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.300
I read a book in January of 2004, about this woman named penny Dean,

12
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.370
who, uh,

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.060
still to this day holds the record for the fastest crossing of the Catalina

14
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:55.410
channel. So it was filming from Catalina island to San Pedro or, or, uh, to, uh,

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.240
you typically swim to point point Vicenta and she had done it in like

16
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.440
seven hours and 20 minutes. And I was like, that's amazing.

17
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:08.910
I find that as a Crow flies, it's 21 miles with the currents.

18
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:13.350
It's a little longer. And I was like, you know, I really want to do this. Um,

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.660
but I, I got to learn how to swim perse. That.

20
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.110
<v 0>Seems like three miles an hour swimming. She.</v>

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.790
<v 1>Is a phenom,</v>

22
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.230
penny Dean had a stroke rate of 90 strokes per minute. Which, I mean,

23
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.130
that might not mean anything to someone who doesn't swim, but like to turn,

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.670
to have a hand hit the water, every, you know, third of it,

25
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.400
two thirds of a second is a remarkable gains. Yeah.

26
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:37.980
I can't hold a cadence of that for a hundred yards.

27
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.030
<v 0>Wow. And she did it for 20 miles. Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.700
<v 1>What a beast she's out of control.</v>

29
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.910
<v 0>Yeah. There's certain people like that, man. That.</v>

30
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.460
<v 1>Yeah. I think, I think marathon swimming might be one sport. Where if,</v>

31
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.800
if you just look at the numbers, I think women are better than men.

32
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.340
<v 0>Um, well, there's that woman who swam from Cuba to the United States. Right.</v>

33
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:01.560
She was the first person ever. And she didn't,

34
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:03.570
she do it like at a fairly advanced age.

35
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.621
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

36
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:07.830
she's of course got an amazing pedigree of swimming and this wasn't her first

37
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:08.490
rodeo.

38
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.310
<v 0>Right, right, right. Why, why do you think women are better than men?</v>

39
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.270
That's that?

40
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.560
<v 1>I mean, those of us that I, I'm not a member of this community anymore,</v>

41
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:19.590
but when I was, it was one of our favorite topics of discussion.

42
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.910
I think a thing opportunities or ideas that were put forth were higher pain

43
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.150
tolerance, something about being, you know,

44
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.390
evolving to be able to give birth, um,

45
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.690
just means they can tolerate pain a lot higher. Um,

46
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.110
I think another thing I've heard is buoyancy, you know,

47
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:40.110
women are naturally going to have more body fat, which provides insulation.

48
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:44.070
When you do these swims, you're not allowed any wetsuits or aids of any sort.

49
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.510
So shorts,

50
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.590
you're like you're in a Speedo and single latex cap and that's it.

51
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.420
And so if you can have a little,

52
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.620
and so I think women's hips because they're going to have more fat on their

53
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:56.550
hips. They, they,

54
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.710
it corrects one of the big buoyancy issues that we have in swimming. We,

55
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:04.360
we didn't evolve to swim. We're horrible at it naturally. Um,

56
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.630
because we swim like this, we drag our hips through the water.

57
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.820
And if you think about the importance of aerodynamics in most of the things that

58
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:16.480
we think about, whether it be archery or race, car driving, or cycling,

59
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.920
you know, in water,

60
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.980
it's that much more important because the density of water is, you know,

61
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.720
thousands of times greater than air.

62
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.260
So swimming is just a hundred percent about avoiding drag.

63
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.370
<v 0>Wow. So, well, that totally makes sense. Um,</v>

64
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.590
I just have been fascinated forever with people that are capable of

65
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.100
pushing their brain to do things that other people just don't think are

66
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:42.040
possible. Like, uh, you know, big foot, 200 race,

67
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.140
or like any of those things.

68
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.580
But the swim one is particularly crazy because you can't stop.

69
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.451
Right. Right.

70
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:52.450
Like if you're running an ultra marathon and you just want to sit down for a

71
00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:55.270
couple of minutes and just take a break, you can do that.

72
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.140
But if you're swimming, there's no, you've got a thing you can do.

73
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.360
<v 1>You could tread water is about as good as it gets,</v>

74
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.500
but you can't touch the boat or the kayaker. It's an immediate disqualification.

75
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.690
<v 0>Oh God, that's so crazy,</v>

76
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:15.280
man. That is such a, wow. So you heard about this woman doing.

77
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.900
<v 1>That's what I read this book and I was like,</v>

78
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:19.690
I really want to do this at the time I was, uh,

79
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.410
I was actually in my residency in Baltimore and I was like, you know,

80
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.080
I really want to do this and I'm going to have to learn how to swim, to do it.

81
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:29.470
So I started taking swimming lessons and then, um,

82
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.420
I mean to make a very long story short, basically by about the summer of 2005,

83
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:39.280
I entered my first swim race, which was a two mile swim race in lake Reston,

84
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:43.330
Virginia. And I did it and I was like, oh my God,

85
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:47.800
I just swam two miles in the open water. You know, it was hard. But I was like,

86
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.540
okay, that's the proof of concept.

87
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.770
Now you just got to figure out how to make it 20, 25 miles. And, uh,

88
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.440
so I just, you know,

89
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.310
went completely psycho and ratcheted up the training. And,

90
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.300
and then in October of 2005, I did my first Catalina swim. Wow.

91
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.330
<v 0>That's gotta be a pretty good feeling though.</v>

92
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:15.310
When you're done that you are capable of pushing yourself to what most people

93
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:16.900
think is an impossible distance.

94
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.040
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, people you asked a moment ago, why do you do this?</v>

95
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:23.590
I would say that in life, um,

96
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.890
velocity means very little acceleration means everything.

97
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.960
So what do I mean by that? Right?

98
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:32.560
Like if you're going 650 miles an hour in an airplane,

99
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:37.330
you don't actually feel it. You only feel when speed changes. Right?

100
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.010
So I've always had this theory that emotionally that's also true.

101
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.660
Like happiness is only interesting when it's juxtaposed with sadness.

102
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.390
And so the feeling of crawling on the shore after you've been swimming for

103
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:54.850
12 to 14 hours is amazing.

104
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.850
But what makes it especially amazing is that six hours earlier,

105
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.440
you thought you were going to die.

106
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.250
So you start these swims in the middle of the night to avoid the shipping

107
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.084
traffic.

108
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.430
So that first swim boat drops you off at Catalina island. It's midnight,

109
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.350
that's a darkness. You can't imagine, like you can't even see LA from Catalina.

110
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.310
You have to swim for six hours before you even see the lights of Los Angeles.

111
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.010
Really? Yeah. What do you see?

112
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.260
The stars and the phospho, like bio luminescent organisms in the water.

113
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.310
Whoa. Which is incredible. I mean, that's worth the price of admission.

114
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.010
So every time your hand comes through the water,

115
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.690
you're pulling and ripping these little things and you're seeing the sparks and

116
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:42.860
you can't tell where the water ends in the sky starts. In other words,

117
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.520
the stars and the bioluminescence looks like one cylinder.

118
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.470
Wow. So for the first few hours, that's cool. But then, you know,

119
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.860
on my first swim, the water was incredibly rough. Um,

120
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.400
I had only swim in the ocean for two weeks before the swim.

121
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.960
I did all my training in a swimming pool. So in a lake on the east coast.

122
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.950
So now I work, I wasn't used to how to keep the salt water out of my mouth.

123
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.390
Right. So then I was like, puking my guts out. And then my, um.

124
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.510
<v 0>While you were swimming. Yeah. Yeah. Does that.</v>

125
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.340
<v 1>Work? You just stop and puke and then keep swimming. Wow. And then,</v>

126
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.750
uh, but then my tongue started to get really swollen from the salt water.

127
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.880
Because again, as I would learn later on,

128
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:27.740
I would go on to do many more of these swims.

129
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:32.000
But what I learned is the importance of spitting the water out of your mouth

130
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.830
very quickly. So in a, in a freshwater pool or lake, you get away with more,

131
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.400
but in the ocean, you swallow that salt water. You're going to get sick as hell.

132
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.020
So all this stuff's going on. So by five in the morning,

133
00:07:45.021 --> 00:07:48.320
you've been swimming for five hours. You're getting cold.

134
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.820
You're I mean, you know, frankly, just physiologically,

135
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:56.750
like your cortisol levels are at an eight or you're just, you feel horrible.

136
00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:00.440
It's like, it's a really bad feeling and you're not even halfway there.

137
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.260
And it's like, you don't know if you can do it and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

138
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.120
Well, if six hours later,

139
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:08.570
you're now crawling out of the water feeling like you've done this amazing thing

140
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:13.250
that that's emotional acceleration. That's like the greatest contrast.

141
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.300
Okay.

142
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.310
<v 0>I know what you're saying. I mean, I've never experienced that,</v>

143
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:20.270
but I was explaining the other day to a friend of mine about this,

144
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:24.200
a camping trip that we went on in Montana when it was like nine degrees outside,

145
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:27.920
it was freezing cold. We stayed out there for five, six days.

146
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:30.470
And then when we finally got to a hotel room,

147
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:34.340
I took a shower and it was the most amazing shower I've ever experienced in my

148
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:35.990
life. And that's a small.

149
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.870
<v 1>Right? No, but you take a shower every day and it's like a big deal.</v>

150
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.410
But when you do it in that setting or, or think about the, the meal you've had,

151
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:44.630
if you've been fast, similar situation.

152
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.810
<v 0>Yeah. We're starving are lost at sea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.470
I can't imagine that's a, so now that you've done,

154
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.260
how many of these have you done these crazy swim races or swim?

155
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.030
<v 1>Call them several. Yeah. Usually these major, major ones are not racist.</v>

156
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.190
You're on your own. You have to,

157
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.000
you go to the Federation that oversees that body of water and you say, Hey,

158
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:07.710
I want to do this. And then you, you know,

159
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:09.450
you go through all the channels to do it.

160
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.370
Like they have to have an observer there and they,

161
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.020
you follow these official rules that you.

162
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.210
<v 0>Can be registered as someone who's actually completed.</v>

163
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.520
<v 1>It. Right. And someone's there to make sure you didn't, you know,</v>

164
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.150
you did it correctly. Um, I don't know.

165
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.270
I've probably done all in probably like a dozen of these,

166
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:27.630
but probably like six of them really long ones. What's the longest.

167
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.170
Well, I, that's a good question.

168
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.460
<v 0>The Maui one was 20 miles there and back. So 40 miles total.</v>

169
00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.020
<v 1>The Maui channel is a 10 mile channel. So round trip is 20.</v>

170
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.370
The bigger question is time in the water because you rarely get to swim these in

171
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:48.960
a straight line. So the Maui Lanai one, I wanted to go Maui, Lanai,

172
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.600
Molokai, Maui to do the triangle.

173
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.980
And that would have been 30 miles as a Crow flies, but we just, you know,

174
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.850
boat captain, wasn't willing to do it at night because of the tiger sharks.

175
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.080
And during the daytime,

176
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:06.030
we couldn't physiologically figure out how one could suffer

177
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:07.260
against those, the wind,

178
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.210
because the wind gets so brutal in the middle of the day.

179
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.810
So even the one that I did, which was just there and back,

180
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.240
I ended up swimming for 12 hours because on the

181
00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.841
first way,

182
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:23.640
crossing where there was no wind took me four hours and then it took eight hours

183
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:28.320
to get back because I was swimming like the hypotenuse of a triangle, right?

184
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:30.390
Like the current's going this way.

185
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.680
So I had to swim this way just to go in a straight line. And I still can.

186
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:37.710
I almost missed Maui Jesus Christ.

187
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.060
So I almost got swept out to Molokai just because the current was about

188
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:46.680
1.7 knots, which is about as fast as I can swim. Maybe two knots.

189
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.900
<v 0>That is a ridiculous thing, man. Why are you doing this? This is,</v>

190
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.590
this has maniacal.

191
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:58.770
<v 1>Well, I don't do it anymore. I mean, it was certainly a,</v>

192
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.570
it was an amazing season of my life.

193
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.980
But I think once my daughter was born,

194
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.110
which was 10 years ago, this summer that's when I,

195
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.470
I only probably did two of these after she was born,

196
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.010
because then the training just got, so I just, you got to live in the water.

197
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:21.180
If you want to do this sport, like you got to eat including the winter.

198
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.350
You know, like, you know, even in San Diego where I live, it's still, you know,

199
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.570
55 degrees in the water and you're going to spend three,

200
00:11:27.571 --> 00:11:32.490
four hours a day in the water freezing, you know, it was just, so that was like,

201
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:33.430
you know, I just don't have the,

202
00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:37.740
the drive to spend 25 hours a week swimming.
