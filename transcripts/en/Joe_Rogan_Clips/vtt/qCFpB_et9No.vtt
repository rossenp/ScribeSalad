1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Growing up in Akron. And like,</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.700
you guys had to feel like you were on the outside of the music business, right?

3
00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:13.050
Like the business itself was in Nashville and LA and New York. And,

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.120
you know, growing up in a, in a town,

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:16.970
do you think there's an advantage while we did.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.850
<v 1>But oddly, pat and I had a connection to the, the real music business,</v>

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.920
but both in our family, uh, my cousin was Robert Quine,

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.060
uh,

9
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.200
guitar player who played with Lou Reed and Richard hell and avoids one of the

10
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:35.730
first punk guitar players really influential. And the pats uncles, Ralph Carney,

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.990
a saxophone player played on all the Tom waits records before to two records,

12
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:41.940
all kinds of records. Ah.

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.630
<v 2>It was weird. And these guys weren't like, uh, financially successful,</v>

14
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:48.420
but they were critically lauded kind of individuals.

15
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.860
<v 1>We're professional musicians. So they own records and it was just odd.</v>

16
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.390
So I grew up around the block.

17
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.300
<v 2>From each other. So what we want, I mean, we looked at that, right?</v>

18
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.030
The idea of making a record with what we want,

19
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.050
that's all we wanted to do was make a record. And then, you know,

20
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.130
by the time we were selling like 150 200 seat rooms, we were like,

21
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:11.220
we have made it. This is it. This is awesome. This is what we wanted.

22
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.640
And then we would be like,

23
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:19.020
what if we try to sell out those 400 seat room? What if, you know,

24
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.460
it would just kind of slowly went.

25
00:01:20.461 --> 00:01:24.990
And then finally we got to this point where we were like, well,

26
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.320
what if we try to play Madison square garden? And our manager was like, yeah,

27
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:30.840
you could do it. And we're like, well, let's do it.

28
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.760
And then we did two nights there.

29
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.350
And that's literally what started from playing the R R his tour history,

30
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:41.540
like in Brooklyn or in New York was like, we opened for a Pascal band.

31
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.440
And on a Monday night

32
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.880
in Brooklyn for 50 bucks.

33
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.070
<v 1>We drove all the way from Akron, eight hours.</v>

34
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.770
<v 2>Eight hours, each way, made $50.</v>

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.850
That's our first show in New York and wow. Yeah,

36
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.050
that's a Barclays or whatever, but it all started. It was all like, it was like,

37
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.011
it was like, honestly,

38
00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:03.720
when we got to the point when we were playing a Troubadour, I was like,

39
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:07.500
we have done it. We got there. And they're like, well,

40
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.550
there's another venue down the road a little bit bigger. Well,

41
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.450
it's always your agent. Gap's another venue.

42
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.501
<v 0>Well,</v>

43
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:17.130
that's why someone who doesn't understand anxiety is never gonna understand how

44
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:21.900
a person like you with all that success could still get weirded out.

45
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.670
Do you know? I mean, that's, that's what makes it interesting. Like the,

46
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.500
the managing of the mind.

47
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.860
<v 2>You know, I mean, uh, Dan and I are both pretty confident, but we're also at,</v>

48
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:36.360
but we're not like, did you know, I think you're only as good as your last show,

49
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:40.260
really, you know, as good as your last record and you know,

50
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.510
you can't escape by and your. Yeah.

51
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.320
<v 0>Uh, and we all knew bands growing up that kind of did right.</v>

52
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:49.530
They had a couple of good albums and then things kind of went off the rails.

53
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.281
<v 2>Dude. It's like,</v>

54
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:53.790
my favorite band is like growing up with Divo cause they're from Akron.

55
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:57.630
And they were like this different kind of crazy band punk band.

56
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.500
Um, you know, and there is something special about Akron though. Yeah. There is.

57
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.780
<v 0>Something special about Ohio.</v>

58
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.570
<v 2>But you watch, you watch a band like diva though. I was going to say,</v>

59
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:12.100
get to get to LA and whatever happened there, the change that happened and,

60
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.950
um, is something, I mean, that's been something that Dan had been, I mean,

61
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:22.630
I think actively trying to avoid is that, that kind of thing,

62
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.820
you know? Um, but yeah, that's like, I go home to Akron. I fully get,

63
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.810
I fully accept and know that I'm going to get made fun of for certain things.

64
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.930
I'm not, I mean, I'm going to like a real individual,

65
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.150
get my thrown at me by my friends.

66
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:41.350
And they're going to make fun of me for whatever and

67
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.480
rightfully so. Um, but yeah, acronyms, I mean,

68
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.430
Ohio in the Midwest,

69
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.720
it's an inspiring place because it kind of is a vacuum and the people who are

70
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:53.321
operating there,

71
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:57.940
like 99% of them are operating this because they have no other choice that,

72
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.950
and they love doing what they're doing music wise.

73
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.360
So you go to New York for the first time and it's like, um,

74
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.560
you know, the smallest little band has a connection to the biggest producer.

75
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:13.060
And if I tell you here too, you know, I'm, that's why like,

76
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.720
it's like true people, like a little like a group,

77
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.500
anytime there's like four teenagers playing music together here, like ANR,

78
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.590
we're going to give you a big deal and get you on MTV. It never works out.

79
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.160
I mean,

80
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.640
that's like it think about the amount of bands that have come from Los Angeles.

81
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.760
How many great rock and roll bands have come from LA? I mean, seriously,

82
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.630
it's a massive city. It's the biggest county in the country.

83
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.030
The music industry is here and the take the last

84
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.960
20 years, great bands from Los Angeles. You wouldn't have a long list,

85
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.760
same with New York city. Um, you know,

86
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.460
if you go to the last 40 years, it's the list doesn't grow that much.

87
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.890
<v 0>Do you think it's better? That's what I was saying.</v>

88
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:58.540
Do you think it's better to be on the outside?

89
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.450
Do you think it's better to be in a city where you're in carnival?

90
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.430
<v 2>Here's what I think is best.</v>

91
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.330
I think if you can really integrate with the music industry

92
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.340
peripherally from the outside, it's always best. How so? What do you mean?

93
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.480
Like if you end up signing a major label, like, well, we almost signed up,

94
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.980
we got some offers early on to signed to major labels early on and we did not do

95
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:25.000
it mostly because like the co they kept, we kept being strung along.

96
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:27.880
Like the contract will be there in a week, a week would pass it.

97
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.630
Wouldn't show up two weeks pass. We call it. It'll be there next week. Finally,

98
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:35.290
we were like, this. We realized at the age of 22,

99
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:39.790
we realized if we signed the and they can't get a contract to us to even look at

100
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.560
in six weeks, if we make a record, there's, we're going to be so long janitor,

101
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.470
like we're never going to be able to do this. So we,

102
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.070
we took the gamble and we signed with the small Indian, just kept going,

103
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.340
you know? And when we finally went to a major,

104
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.250
it was on a subsidiary,

105
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.500
a major with really supportive president.

106
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:02.300
And we were kind of on the outside still,

107
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.600
even though we were inside run outside and we were able to do our thing,

108
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:09.350
we've never had an AR guy sit around and tell us to speed the song up or,

109
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.453
or whatever.

110
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.930
But the problem is if you get in without having some of those boxes ticked and

111
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.040
you get in and you sign a big lit big record, deal off the bat,

112
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.050
some dumb who has a communications degree from like Pepperdine

113
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.520
is going to be sitting down next to you. Like, I think the high hats too loud,

114
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:32.840
bro. I mean, K rock can't play that the drums are,

115
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.440
they just got to know he's talking about. And like, that's that right there.

116
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.390
When you get those notes coming from some dude,

117
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:40.340
that's your ANR guy that doesn't really notice. I mean,

118
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.540
there are good a and R guys,

119
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.530
but most of them are these types of dudes and they'll be like, yeah, man, like,

120
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.740
and it's, it's basically what they're doing right.

121
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.930
Then when they're telling they're getting in your head, be like,

122
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.270
you got to change the high hat on the mix. Man,

123
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.160
what they're saying is when this record fails and I can't deliver that,

124
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.080
any sort of fandom to you that I want to say that you turn the high hat down too

125
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:06.860
low, or I turn the high, he didn't turn it down low enough.

126
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.330
It was all cop outs everywhere. And the only way to get through that is to,

127
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.420
to we, we learn how to make records yourselves in a basement.

128
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.010
We had a tape machine,

129
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.180
a hundred dollar tape machine and radio shack microphones.

130
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.160
And we recorded our first record like that. We did our second record like that,

131
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.460
our third record, like that, our fourth record like that. And finally we,

132
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:31.280
we went into the studio danger mouse and we,

133
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.330
we knew how to run a mixing desk. You know what I mean?

134
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.310
We knew what we liked.

135
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.700
So if someone came in that wasn't danger mouse and was like this, or,

136
00:07:41.701 --> 00:07:44.500
or one of the mixing engineers we've worked with, if,

137
00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:47.960
if someone came in and said, the kick drum sounds like, we'd be like, off.

138
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.840
We know what a kick drum drum can sound like we've been doing this. Um,

139
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.030
and I think basically if you can spend the time,

140
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.380
get the time and get the that's why that's why, like back in the day, it's like,

141
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.900
you know, a record deal, a record, a band takes years to develop.

142
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.340
You know what I mean? It took us,

143
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.550
it took us eight years before we got us on the radio of actively making records

144
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:12.440
and touring. Um,

145
00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.800
and a lot of this stuff set up with labels where they want like a hit on the

146
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:17.150
second record. You know,

147
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:22.340
my I'm married to a woman who sold millions and millions of albums and, um,

148
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.200
of songs that she wrote, you know? And when she turned in, uh,

149
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:31.190
an Americana record, like Warner brothers gave her such the run-around,

150
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.260
they shelved a record that costs 800 grand to make,

151
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.540
because they said there wasn't any hits on it.

152
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.470
That's that's no way to be an artist. Do you know what I mean? Yeah.

153
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.140
And so we've just always avoided that. So they shelled the record.

154
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:46.280
They just didn't even bother trying to release it to cut their losses. No, man.

155
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.760
And then they charged her for it. And then the dropper, I mean, that's, that's,

156
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.150
that's why, so they shelve it. They never release it. Yeah.

157
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:55.770
They've never released and they just drop her. Yeah, dude. That's how that,

158
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.770
that's how they do this though. The archives of these labels are filled up with.

159
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:03.330
That's been shelved really? Hell yeah, man. And I don't know the business. Well,

160
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:07.560
my, my, I, I learned all this stuff early on. Cause my uncle Ralph,

161
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.250
who Dan mentioned was signed to Warner brothers in the late seventies,

162
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.360
he made a record with his band called tin Huey.

163
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.890
It sold like 5,000 albums, you know, like failure. Um,

164
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.690
and then they gave him like 30 grand to off. Uh,

165
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.960
and they made some right. They made a record in between them and this shelter.

166
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.390
It happens all the time.

167
00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.770
<v 0>How many good records have they have shelved? What do they do with them?</v>

168
00:09:34.771 --> 00:09:35.790
Ultimately, like.

169
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.090
<v 2>I think there's a lot of good records, but I also think,</v>

170
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.390
I think there's a lot of records that started off really good.

171
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:47.220
And then some Pepperdine dudes like remix this, you need to remix it.

172
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:50.100
You need to do that into the, add this. You need to do this, do this.

173
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.120
Some dude just gassing. You know? It's like, it's not hard to just guess.

174
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.690
It's like, if I'm, if you're like looking at remodeling your kitchen, it's like,

175
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.980
and you're an idiot. You just put the stove here, up, put it over to the left,

176
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:04.050
actually redo the, you know what I mean?

177
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:08.820
But if you're really a producer musician that makes records and you turn it,

178
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.260
like you turn in a record,

179
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.960
it's so frustrated when you get someone that doesn't know what you're doing

180
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:15.840
coming back. Like maybe you should do this. I actually had that happen to me.

181
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.040
There's this band called the sheep dogs, this Canadian band. They actually, uh,

182
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.180
this record ended up going platinum in Canada and in the U S it never even got

183
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:28.110
pushed to radio. Not, not even one song, but um,

184
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.050
this guy, Chad Blake, who, Dan and I work with all the time,

185
00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.830
who's mixed her last four records. He mixed this record.

186
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:36.870
This guy's like a genius in audio.

187
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.600
<v 1>Wizard. Yeah, he's a wizard.</v>

188
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:44.580
So he lives in Wales in a little house is his wife works with horses.

189
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.130
He's got a little side room, just tiny little room,

190
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:50.790
just like half the size of this. And he mixes huge.

191
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.900
<v 2>Records. So he's,</v>

192
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.640
he's a bad-ass and this whole records budget was like 60 grand,

193
00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:58.140
including them living off of it and.

194
00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.830
So I took the entire budget and let the fur,

195
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:05.670
and it was spent on a little cheap studio, um,

196
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.650
of some friends, a friend of mine, who's going to engineer it, them to live.

197
00:11:10.651 --> 00:11:12.600
And the rest of it went to Chad to mix it. So I get the,

198
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.690
I get the mixes back and this NR guy is listening to the mixes.

199
00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.730
And there's like, I think, uh,

200
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.750
I think that hi-hats too loud on the song. I'm not joking. And I'm,

201
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.500
I I'm on tour. Uh, how much were Dan? And I'm like,

202
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.590
I called danger message. What do I do? He's like, you know what to do.

203
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.513
I was like,

204
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.600
send him the same mix and label it mixed four and tell him it's been lowered

205
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.490
that's right. But then he was like, you also need to remember,

206
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.540
you are down. They will never service this song because that's the cop-out.

207
00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:46.800
I was like. He said, just watch. And it is exactly what happened, Mike.

208
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.550
And I caught him like a year later and was like, dude, you're genius. He's like,

209
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:54.130
oh, well I've been through this. Yeah.

210
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.160
Because check it out. If you're an ANR guy, right.

211
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.830
You're getting like probably six figures.

212
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.720
You report to a senior HR who reports to a vice president who reports to the

213
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:08.800
president and that if you stick your neck out and you say,

214
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:13.080
I want to take a million dollars from the machine. And I want to, I want,

215
00:12:13.081 --> 00:12:17.110
I bet bet at all, in this band, or even a quarter million dollars,

216
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.490
the odds of any band making it, like probably one in a hundred,

217
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.320
I'm gonna talk about even breaking even.

218
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:28.870
So if you only an idiot would ever really get behind a band that is

219
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:32.710
unproven. So you, your whole job is to deflect blame.

220
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.940
You know what I mean? So like, that's why, that's what the problem is. You know,

221
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.910
like if I was going to sign a band and someone offered me,

222
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.910
he said I had a million dollar budget to sign a new band.

223
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:45.940
Like I also wouldn't give them all the money.

224
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:50.050
Cause there was no way I'd make it back. You know what I mean? Yeah. Um,

225
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.430
but yeah, that's the music industry, dude is up. And then, you know,

226
00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:57.730
you spend years and years and years. And if you're lucky,

227
00:12:57.731 --> 00:13:00.160
like Dan and I looked out and then you look back and it's like,

228
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:03.670
I don't even know how, how it happened.

229
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.740
There's all these other factors that come into it, you know?

230
00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.550
And you go try to help a band. One thing, something that worked for us,

231
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.370
we'd never worked for another band. So there's no, there's no formula to it.
