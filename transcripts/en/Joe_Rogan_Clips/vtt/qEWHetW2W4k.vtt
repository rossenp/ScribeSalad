00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.800
<v 2>Listen, it was a long time coming. It's it's just,</v>

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.120
I'm I'm happy that it happened now. Cuz if it, if it didn't happen,

4
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:12.800
it would've been something else. I would've been in a grave. Yeah.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.080
Or somewhere else who the hell knows where they would've put me.

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.280
When did you start? I've been, I've been fat my whole life.

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.670
I've been thinking out losing weight for a long time for probably about.

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.270
<v 0>30 Years. But when did you start losing weight? When last March, last March.</v>

9
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.030
So right around the pandemic. Right? Literally.

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.350
<v 1>Right when it hit my brand new baby and my wife,</v>

11
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.910
they were gonna go to Columbia to show the child, you know,

12
00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:39.270
you have to show the child to the family. And it was around March 10th.

13
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.460
We get to the airport. &lt;affirmative&gt; some sh they,

14
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:45.500
they wouldn't let my dog get on the plane cuz they didn't have the,

15
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.180
the air conditioning didn't work in the, in the gal or whatever that is.

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.380
So we turned right back around and went home and that's the day hit the fan.

17
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.100
I was supposed to go on tour a week. Right after that, everything done.

18
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.690
I knew it was all gonna be done. &lt;affirmative&gt; I was talking to my agent.

19
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.290
He was like, yeah, this gonna be fine. Don't worry.

20
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:09.890
They're gonna still do the show in Hawaii. I was like, nah, watch this.

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.770
gonna be done. So bottom line is why why'd.

22
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.650
<v 0>You think everything was gonna get shut.</v>

23
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.170
<v 1>Down? I don't know. I had a feeling. I just had a,</v>

24
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.850
I had a feeling that this was just bigger than what it was. Hmm. You know,

25
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.240
than just it, it just seemed fish just seemed fishy. Yeah.

26
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.880
So pretty much. I mean to get the dog onto the plane,

27
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.080
we had to put her on the scale cuz she was a little overweight.

28
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.840
<v 0>What's overweight for a dog.</v>

29
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.720
<v 1>I'm not really sure. I think she looks.</v>

30
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.480
<v 0>Great. What is overweight for a dog though? How do they decide that?</v>

31
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:40.520
Like I used to have a dog that was 140 pounds. Was he overweight?

32
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.390
<v 1>I don't think so. She just jacked. This is &lt;laugh&gt;. That's all.</v>

33
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.630
I think if you're at a certain weed, just Jack, this dog is an English set.

34
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.750
Supposed to have a little waste and listen, she lost it a little bit.

35
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:55.430
She lost herself. She's living in Brooklyn now. You know,

36
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.830
she's not back where she's from exercising.

37
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.950
<v 0>It's different.</v>

38
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.430
<v 1>Yeah. She's eating different foods. Right? Her metabolism changed. Right.</v>

39
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.980
So I don't blame. So I, I dealt with it. She's fed.

40
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.133
I feel her.

41
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.100
And then I started losing weight cuz of her because we both got on the

42
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:15.300
scale and I was like, what the is going on?

43
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.500
What was the highest Three 80 something? Oh yeah.

44
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.290
It was despicable. I didn't look it though. Holy. I looked about three 50.

45
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.643
&lt;laugh&gt;

46
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.890
A round ball of meat. A meatball. Yeah. How was a meatball? Well,

47
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:34.330
what was your.

48
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.570
<v 0>Health like? Like what did you, what did it feel like walking around like that?</v>

49
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.530
Cuz that's this is the thing, man. Um,

50
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.610
people love to talk about like fat shaming. Yeah.

51
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.400
And I know it's not good to make people, people feel bad, but you have to.

52
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.480
<v 1>But that you have to shame me. I was shamed into this for sure.</v>

53
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.160
<v 0>It's unfortunate that you have to make people feel bad to start getting them to</v>

54
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:54.420
change.

55
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.360
But sometimes whether it's a person doing that to you or you just looking in the

56
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:02.120
mirror and you feeling bad, that that feeling is just reality.

57
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.080
That's what that feeling is. Like you can't fat shame a skinny,

58
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.720
you can't fat shame. Jamie. No, he's not fat. Right. So if you said, Hey Jamie,

59
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.960
you're fat. Like it doesn't work doesn't mean anything.

60
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.280
It only means something when it's real and it's an indulgence thing.

61
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.670
It's not it's it's not a thing that you can't control.

62
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.630
It's a hard thing to control. It's a hard thing to bounce back from.

63
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.390
And that's what I'm most impressed with you. You've you've really bounced back.

64
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:32.190
You've lost 130 pounds man. And we, we had a good workout today.

65
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.550
We went over to the honor gym. Yep. Shout out to my man. John Wolf. Yes. John.

66
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.110
Wolf's the master. I love him. How good.

67
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.620
<v 1>Is he? I mean, I I've watched him and now that I met, I met him.</v>

68
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.980
It's like all the pieces came together today. For me, he's.

69
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.380
<v 0>One of the most knowledgeable trainers I've ever worked with in my life.</v>

70
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.260
He's amazing. He, and it's not just like meathead stuff.

71
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.700
It's all about mobility and flexibility. There's no nothing meathead.

72
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.940
<v 1>Nothing. I mean he can obviously lift a lot of weight. Yeah. He showed us,</v>

73
00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.050
he could do the 106 overhead press with like nothing. Yeah.

74
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.210
But it ain't about that. It's about being able to it's fluidity.

75
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:06.650
It's about to be a it's about using your body and using your muscles in a

76
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.170
functional manner. Yeah. Not just.

77
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.810
<v 0>Earth. He's he's all about longevity and he's all about range of motion.</v>

78
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.330
His whole thing is about having, you have like the full mobility of your body.

79
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.840
It's all these flexibility things that we did. The things that we did,

80
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.600
all that stuff and it's all to strengthen into joints, stabilize your shoulders,

81
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.880
stabilize all your joints. And he he's just so good. So amazing.

82
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.880
<v 1>The tree workout that we did. Yeah. I was soaked &lt;laugh&gt;. I was so before.</v>

83
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.080
<v 0>We started it was great. It was unbelievable. You're very strong though. Man.</v>

84
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.920
You're really strong. It was, it was interesting to watch you do it.

85
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.590
Like I can see like over this past year, you know, you've gotten your body to a,

86
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.790
a really good place where you know, you haven't just lost weight by dieting.

87
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:52.150
You've been lifting weights. You've been exercising and pushing sleds. And I,

88
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.950
I watch your Instagram man. You're doing some wild for sure.

89
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.910
<v 1>I mean, I, these are the things that I always wanted to do.</v>

90
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.940
I always knew I could do this. I played football in high school and I actually,

91
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.260
I excelled in practice. Like I liked doing that. I liked drills.

92
00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.500
I like having an aim the game. Yeah. It's fun. But I like the practice stuff.

93
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.940
Right. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

94
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.740
And I started losing weight by myself, in my house.

95
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.420
Literally during the pandemic, just eating different. My wife,

96
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.010
she was shaming me because yes she was because we have a brand new child.

97
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.610
She's like, what you you doing? You don't wanna be around here for our baby.

98
00:05:28.611 --> 00:05:33.090
Like you, you wanna take yourself away from us. Right. And that hit.

99
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.210
<v 0>That's real. It, it hit.</v>

100
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.650
<v 1>Hard. That's a real thing. And not only that, like I love life.</v>

101
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.970
There's no doubt about it.

102
00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:41.970
I've I've been going so fast for the past 10 years that,

103
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.120
and really enjoyed myself. So this forced,

104
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.680
this forced stoppage allowed me to really reassess my happiness

105
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.520
and I've regained everything. You know, it's not just work, work,

106
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.280
work. Next thing. Next thing. Next thing of course, I'm an artist in my mind.

107
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:01.160
There's always all over the place. I'm always thinking about something,

108
00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.960
you know, but this slowed me down.

109
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.560
It allowed me to spend every moment with my brand new child, you know? Yeah.

110
00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.560
It's, it's, it, it, it was something that I didn't know I needed,

111
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.240
but I needed that. Yeah. I needed it. And,

112
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.910
and to gain my health, like in this, in this manner, man, it's like you said,

113
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.670
I wasn't, I don't wanna just lose weight.

114
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.790
People could get the surgeries and all that that ain't, for me, I'm a worker.

115
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.403
The problem with the.

116
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.110
<v 0>Like hard work, the surgery can help people. But it also,</v>

117
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.700
it messes you up and here, one of the things that have, I've seen it,

118
00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.820
it diminishes your ability to absorb food.

119
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.740
You can't have as much food and it's harder for you to absorb nutrients. I.

120
00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.220
<v 1>Would never do that. Yeah. That was just never in my cards. It was never for me.</v>

121
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.700
Good for you. Yeah. Hell no, because I knew I did this to myself. Yeah.

122
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.580
I have to fix it. Yeah. And I'm dedicated, you know,

123
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.530
like I was talking to my boy like me and CE Easter Saba were friends and I was

124
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:00.650
talking to him for a while.

125
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.250
We were just text back and forth cuz he was a fat BA too.

126
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.730
And he changed his up and we would just talk about how we want be jacked.

127
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:11.330
We just want be, we want to get, you know, strong and.

128
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.450
And he put me onto my trainer that I was working with Dave Pino and

129
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.680
Dave is kind of, you know,

130
00:07:18.681 --> 00:07:22.040
he's like an old school meathead from the Jersey shore. And I love that.

131
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.560
So we clicked. Yeah.

132
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.600
Because it could have met somebody else and it wouldn't have clicked. Right.

133
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.200
You know, like I've worked out with other people, but it just wasn't.

134
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.160
I almost don't wanna let him down, you know? Right. Like he's a.

135
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.400
Like he's in the Sopranos or some &lt;laugh&gt; I swear. It's maybe it's in my mind,

136
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.830
but I have to, but it works that way. Right? I know. Yeah.

137
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:42.550
He was showing me all, he's like Joey Diaz,

138
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.670
but jacked &lt;laugh&gt; I swear that's who he is. That's what I was thinking about.

139
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.070
I was like, yo, that's who this guy is exactly him.

140
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:52.670
He has the stories of the shore.

141
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:56.310
He used to bounce all the clubs with the Fanny pack and the,

142
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.420
I don't wanna mention what else, but you know, listen, it, he,

143
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.100
he put me onto different types of training.

144
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.420
He didn't just start me off with meathead stuff. We did the sleds.

145
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.940
We did the torturous, the skier, the, all that,

146
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.660
the stepper. Oh my God. The, that is torture, but I love it.
