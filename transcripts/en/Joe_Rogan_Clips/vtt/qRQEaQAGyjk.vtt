00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Often you guys do it once a week, twice a week,</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.130
twice a week.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.350
<v 1>I see Matt every Monday and Wednesday, really?</v>

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.670
And you meet in the city at a studio or something, Mississippi in a studio.

5
00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:13.250
And they, we had a lot of fighters on,

6
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.550
usually they're not in studio a lot of times they're Skyping. And that sucks.

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.770
I prefer in studio every.

8
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.551
<v 2>Time I don't,</v>

9
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:24.440
like I've only done a couple of Skypes to actually Snowden

10
00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:28.940
and John Anthony West, who is, uh, more of my favorite guests ever.

11
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.510
He's an Egyptologist who is incredible,

12
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:36.200
a understanding of Egypt and the hieroglyphs.

13
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:41.150
And he had this great DVD series called magical Egypt. Um, just,

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.330
he just passed recently, amazing guy, but, um,

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.100
him just cause he was sick and he couldn't get in here and then, uh, snowed.

16
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.350
And obviously because he's on the moon.

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.700
<v 1>Or wherever he is, he goes, that was weird. It's weird to do.</v>

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.970
I don't like the Skype interviews. I prefer them to the phone though,

19
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.030
because guys would call on their way to practice. Like, you know what I mean?

20
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.260
But have cowboy on the phone, they'd be in,

21
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.080
they just drive and go on and do something and you hear the wind and you

22
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:06.770
couldn't get anything.

23
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.990
<v 2>Done. Well, the weird thing about the Snowden one too,</v>

24
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:10.520
was it wasn't just that it was remote.

25
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.120
It was also like what we're talking about, like who he is and what,

26
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:18.140
what his situation is that he's trapped in Russia. Allegedly. I mean,

27
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.280
you might be in Cleveland who the knows where he is, but that he's, you know,

28
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.300
got this situation where he's never going to really be able to come back to the

29
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.600
United States unless they, you know, work out some sort of a deal.

30
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.030
And even then he's not going to believe them. You know what I mean?

31
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:33.830
I wouldn't believe him. I probably would. Neither.

32
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.580
<v 1>Didn't he say no about UFO's though. They,</v>

33
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.870
they didn't you ask him and he said that he hadn't seen evidence. You haven't.

34
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.471
<v 2>Seen evidence,</v>

35
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:42.860
but how much did he look into and how much was available to him and, you know,

36
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.940
w where, where is that kind of evidence? If there is any of that stuff?

37
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.020
I don't know, maybe.

38
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.150
<v 1>On a closed system too. I don't, I don't want to.</v>

39
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.350
<v 2>Not believe in UFO's I resist it. I resist it hard. I'm not rational about it.</v>

40
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.140
<v 3>It's been an uptick in UFO stuff recently.</v>

41
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.280
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I wonder why I wonder what that is space for us. Um,</v>

42
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.300
you know what I think, honestly,

43
00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:05.930
it is at this when the New York times had that thing where they were talking

44
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:10.820
about all the different re reported UFO sightings that are reputable from

45
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:14.020
people like David Fravor and you know,

46
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.520
these air force guys that are like,

47
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.240
otherwise rock solid individuals who talk about their experiences.

48
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.680
But my problem with it,

49
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:25.490
my legitimate problem with me as a human being is I want it to be real.

50
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.750
So when people don't think it's real, like, oh, that's all. I'm like, no,

51
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:33.560
it's real. Like I'm not, I'm not, um,

52
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.190
objective unbiased, like legitimately biased.

53
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.240
And I know it and I'm, I come on, man, wife, why is so biased about this?

54
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.630
It's it's a weird one. Like, I want it to be real, so much,

55
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.050
like talking to Bibles are like, God, I hope he's telling the truth.

56
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.760
<v 3>I'm sure this was a theory because it's no way to be proven.</v>

57
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:53.810
But I saw someone online,

58
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.730
like postulate that the uptick in alien stuff could be like us

59
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.100
coming from the future.

60
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.080
<v 2>I've heard that too. That the idea is that what, what the grays are,</v>

61
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.690
and this is something that I've personally thought,

62
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.880
I think independently was that if you look at human beings and you look at say a

63
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.150
gorilla, right, you look at a gorilla, was his big,

64
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.490
hairy animal thing. And then you slowly turn that into, well,

65
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.910
I guess we didn't really come from gorillas. We came from chimps, but champs,

66
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.290
you know, monkeys, lower hominids Australia. [inaudible] you know, and then,

67
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.150
you know, ancient man, right?

68
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.160
And then all these different versions of what we are until we become

69
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.960
right now, homosapien 2020. Well, what are we w how do we look different? Well,

70
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.810
unless you're someone who works out a lot,

71
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.290
you're losing a lot of your musculature. You're not as dense.

72
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.740
You're not as hairy. You know, when you see like,

73
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.990
I'm that killer wrestler from Russia. Remember when we showed videos of that,

74
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:58.360
dude. I'm trying to remember his name.

75
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.330
Rostom. Yeah. Rustam uh.

76
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.970
<v 3>Is it on.</v>

77
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.780
<v 2>[Inaudible] he's a, this tank of a man that's covered in hair,</v>

78
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.290
but he looks like someone from the past, you know, when,

79
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:18.930
when he's throwing people around this giant,

80
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:22.140
hairy back and hair all over his chest and arms, you always,

81
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:25.290
th this is that guy, but that, that almost,

82
00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.600
he almost looks like a normal human there, but there's some,

83
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:31.080
some videos of him when he's grappling. I mean, like that one right there,

84
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.650
where he's got the double flex, the red one, right above that. Yeah. Like,

85
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:38.370
look how hairy that is. That guy that's from another time. Yeah.

86
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.370
That is from another time. I mean, that guy, you could call him his chest hair.

87
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.130
My, we were talking about aliens and I was saying,

88
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.930
if you look at people like that, like real hairy testosterone filled savages,

89
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:52.410
like this guy was an elite wrestler. He's a killer grappler.

90
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.530
And then you look at aliens.

91
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.570
If you look at chimps to that guy to aliens,

92
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.710
what's happening well,

93
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:04.470
what's happening is we're getting less hairy and we're getting smaller and

94
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:05.430
weaker. Right?

95
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:09.060
We're getting more and more like when an alien looks like an aliens,

96
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:12.450
have no genitals, they have no mouse. They're just as smooth,

97
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.410
skinny thing with his big head. And these big, weird eyes,

98
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.650
like when we get rid of the need,

99
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.320
if we evolve past the need for physical strength,

100
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.330
if we evolve past the need for, you know, sex,

101
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.430
if sex is the, no,

102
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.930
we don't reproduce any longer through just normal biological male,

103
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:36.010
female sex. If they've, you know, who,

104
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.270
who knows a million years from now a hundred thousand years now,

105
00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:42.630
we might decide that one of the biggest problems that face as human beings on

106
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:46.830
earth is our emotions are our desire for sex

107
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:51.090
biology, all of our animal instincts that we still hold on to,

108
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.830
and we could evolve past those,

109
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.970
just like we're so much different than chimps are. We're so much different.

110
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.230
We used to be when we were lower hominids, we've evolved.

111
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.570
We evolved to the point where we're communicating with words,

112
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.420
we're using phones. We fly in planes. We have technology,

113
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.560
but also our bodies are softer and our bodies are less VE they're the less,

114
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.340
there's not as strong. They're not as animalistic and explosive.

115
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.830
And if it continues along that path,

116
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.980
especially aided by technology when we don't have any need,

117
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.350
especially if you have these big, giant brains,

118
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.280
and we can use telepathy to communicate,

119
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:29.030
we can communicate through some other way, maybe even electronically enhanced,

120
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:30.590
maybe you know, something in their brain.

121
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.820
But when you look at an alien with the big head in the little tiny body,

122
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.970
that's what a person is probably going to become. Our heads are way bigger.

123
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.270
Our brains are bigger than other hominids and other, other primates.

124
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.990
Our bodies are softer and weaker. And if you just keep going with that,

125
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.150
that's what happens. But do.

126
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.380
<v 1>They have no genitals though? That's been like, or is it something that the,</v>

127
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.190
at least the phone or the repeal of say they are?

128
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.430
Are they just wearing something that hides her genitals? Like,

129
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.130
I don't know if they have no time. I mean, that's pushing hard for them.

130
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.430
<v 2>You'd also, it could be no genitals, but it also could be.</v>

131
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:03.130
Those aren't even biological things anymore.

132
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.750
It could be that human beings become some sort of cybernetic,

133
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:12.280
some sort of cyborg. Look, if you think about body parts, right?

134
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.700
Like we, if we start replacing body parts, like I met a gentleman the other day,

135
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.440
I did this, um, benefit, pull it, the guy, what is the guy's name?

136
00:07:20.441 --> 00:07:22.660
The Australian gentlemen, who was a,

137
00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:27.430
a soldier lost both his arm and his leg in a shark attack.

138
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.570
I did a benefit the other day with him, for the Australian wildlife.

139
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.230
He's got a carbon fiber arm and a carbon fiber legs. It's crazy.

140
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.800
Shakes your hand, like grips it with his carbon fiber hand. And you know,

141
00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:42.730
right now you can tell the difference between his carbon fiber hand,

142
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.170
this electronic hand and his other hand, but maybe a hundred years from now,

143
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:50.020
you won't be able to, and maybe in the future,

144
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:54.100
it's better to have one of these artificial bodies than it is to have a

145
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:57.520
biological body that can break and get all up. And you feel pain.

146
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.760
We're replacing things all the time. We're,

147
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:03.970
we're replacing body parts all the time with operations.

148
00:08:03.971 --> 00:08:06.850
And we use organic substitutes. Paul Dick elder. Yes.

149
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:11.830
That's the man shout out to Paul. Um, yeah, we, uh, we did this Australian, um,

150
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.620
benefit with Jim Jefferies and, um,

151
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.460
Moni Franklin and Whitney Cummings the other night for the Australian, uh,

152
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.800
wildfire, um, for wildlife relief,

153
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.480
they lost a billion animals in that fired a billion Jesus. It's crazy. Yeah.

154
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.640
Anyway, in the future,

155
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.720
maybe they'll get to the point where they'll have limbs that are better than the

156
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.210
limbs we have. Like, what are you doing with these biological limbs?

157
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.770
Jimmy upgrade case have a alien body, you know.

158
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:43.440
<v 1>Believe dude, I, you know, I, I saw the Lasar documentary. You had him in,</v>

159
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.060
I enjoyed it. I didn't see the whole interview, but what I saw, I liked a lot.

160
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.411
I just, I, I,

161
00:08:47.411 --> 00:08:50.890
there's always that one place with conspiracy that I there's always a gap.

162
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:53.470
I cannot cross. And for me, it's the degrees.

163
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:57.690
I just can't get beyond the degrees being gone, the twos degrees,

164
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.240
I can't get beyond it. And I want to, I want to,

165
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.180
I would much rather believe in UFO's than not believe in them.

166
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.670
<v 2>Well, he's clearly educated. And he,</v>

167
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.350
he says he worked for Los Alamos labs and they sent him to MIT to work on top

168
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:14.070
secret projects. There's clear evidence that he worked at Los Alamos labs.

169
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.500
Ashley, do me a favor, go to, uh, Jeremy, did you go to Jeremy's? Um,

170
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.700
uh, I think it's on his Instagram page. He has this thing.

171
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.850
It might be on his Twitter. He has this thing where he, uh,

172
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.970
has George Knapp explain all the different things.

173
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:33.030
He went through to prove that Bob Lozar was legit.

174
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.910
One of them being that he definitely worked at Los Alamos.

175
00:09:35.911 --> 00:09:39.030
He was even in the employee registry, even though they said he didn't. Yeah.

176
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.290
Play that and give me some volume.

177
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.310
<v 4>Those central question for me about Bob was, did he work at Los Alamos lab?</v>

178
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.220
If he worked there on classified projects,

179
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:53.990
it is plausible that he could work at RA 51 at papoose lake on other

180
00:09:53.991 --> 00:09:57.230
stuff. Did he work there? I can tell you flat out.

181
00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.390
He did a hundred percent certain that he did.

182
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.190
I found his name in the phone book.

183
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.670
I found his name in an article in the Los Alamos newspaper.

184
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.000
I talked to people who were there and finally, Bob took me there.

185
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:13.070
He took me into the lab, waved at the security guys. We brought a camera along.

186
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.240
This guy was familiar.

187
00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:18.140
It was like a rabbit running through a borough that he had traveled every day.

188
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.770
And he's waving at security guys and walking into all these buildings.

189
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.460
He knew his way around. He'd been there before. They knew him. They let him in.

190
00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:28.700
They let me in. I interviewed people. He worked with, they said he was there.

191
00:10:28.701 --> 00:10:32.690
We proved it. And yet the paper trail ends at a certain point.

192
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.760
We don't have any records. We can't find anything.

193
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.410
They had already told me they had the records.

194
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.950
As soon as I think I'm getting close, they yank the rug out from under me.

195
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.700
<v 2>He took a lie detector test. He passed all of them.</v>

196
00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:45.950
I know it doesn't mean anything. But look, this is,

197
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:47.300
we're talking about the 1980s.

198
00:10:47.301 --> 00:10:51.230
They'd get away with a lot back then in terms of erasing your history. And, um,

199
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:55.580
his, his education is undeniable in terms of what he knows. He's a,

200
00:10:55.581 --> 00:10:58.040
he's a brilliant guy. When you talk to him, he's not faking anything.

201
00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:00.280
He's not like he doesn't have any holes in his understanding,

202
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.860
his knowledge of physics, or, you know, I don't know if he's telling the truth,

203
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.780
but again, I'm not, I'm not a objective. I'm biased. I want to believe.

204
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.420
I want to.

205
00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.310
<v 1>Believe as well. I can't get beyond the school. Things that my,</v>

206
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.520
into me that says he's not being truthful. Well, the MIT.

207
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.540
<v 2>Thing I'll tell you this.</v>

208
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.080
He told me that they sent him from Los Alamos labs to there,

209
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.690
to work on something. And I'll tell you what it is off air.

210
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.630
But I told him I wouldn't, I wouldn't talk about it during the podcast,

211
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.420
because you're going to hear when I tell you you're going to go, holy.

212
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.510
And I'll make a little more sense. It's um, I don't know. You know,

213
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.730
it's again, I'm a loser. I want it to be real.

214
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.130
<v 1>No, but it can be real. I just, but I mean, I.</v>

215
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:44.000
<v 2>Want it to be, so I'm not looking at it. I'm not, I'm not, you're.</v>

216
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.200
<v 1>Very biased and I'm invested. I'm not, I mean, I'm not invested anymore.</v>

217
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:51.350
Like even the, uh, the, the, uh, the three Naval videos,

218
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.030
I'm like whenever a sees something that tick tag video.

219
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.760
But now that there's something that they're saying, that's making me go.

220
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.760
That might be man-made because they're saying something about,

221
00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:04.930
if we were to reveal this, it would compromise national security.

222
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.420
<v 2>No, no. They could reveal all the files they have on these UFO incidents.</v>

223
00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:11.430
It would compromise national security. First of all,

224
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:13.710
because it will compromise there.

225
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:18.300
If they reveal how they know that something is blocking radar,

226
00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.050
that object, whatever it was was actively jamming radar. I had commander Fravor,

227
00:12:22.051 --> 00:12:23.460
the guy who filmed that thing,

228
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.820
the guy who was there and who reported that thing, I had him here.

229
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.740
He said that thing went from 60,000 feet down to 200 in less than a second.

230
00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:34.020
There's nothing that we have that can do that.

231
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:39.090
He said that the thing moves so fast, it made this, this travel in this radar,

232
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.630
you know, radar is a blip, right? It's like BIP, BIP, BIP, Mattoon,

233
00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:46.530
one blip to another, it had moved in a preposterous speed.

234
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.470
You couldn't even track it. It was, it was moving so fast.

235
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.570
They don't know if it did it in less than a second,

236
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:53.610
or if it did it in one second, but whatever it was,

237
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.400
the amount of distance that has traveled is impossible.

238
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.800
What ha did they have the laws of physics as we understand.

239
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.580
<v 1>They see it. Uh, could they see with the naked eye as.</v>

240
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.330
<v 2>Well? Yes. They can see it with the naked eyes under the water. Yes.</v>

241
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.760
You could see the video. You could see the thing on video.

242
00:13:08.761 --> 00:13:10.350
You could see the thing on video, move off.

243
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.840
You can see that it's actively jamming radar.

244
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.410
You can see that they're trying to track it and stay with it,

245
00:13:16.411 --> 00:13:17.430
but it's moving too fast.

246
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:20.490
<v 1>Something they said recently that made me think, oh, that might be manmade.</v>

247
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.000
And I forget it was something to do with compromising national security or

248
00:13:24.001 --> 00:13:25.170
whatever the quote was. I was like,

249
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.990
that sounds like something that that's man-made and they're worried,

250
00:13:27.991 --> 00:13:30.420
they'll compromise something that they've created. I know what you're saying.

251
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.980
<v 2>But here's the thing, like, whatever it is someone made, okay.</v>

252
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:38.730
If it's not man, then it's something from another planet. Maybe it is manmade.

253
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.970
Maybe it is some project that the government has, but whatever it is,

254
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.890
it's something that moves at an insane speed that we're not capable of

255
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:48.960
understanding is in terms of what,

256
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.490
what the average person who understands propulsion and engines and combustion,

257
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.503
all those people.

258
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:55.980
<v 1>Let's see when pilots say stuff.</v>

259
00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:59.220
I listened to it because they understand those things. I don't like for me,

260
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.470
I don't know how things are supposed to move, but they do.

261
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.600
So when they're confused by something,

262
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:06.930
that's what got me interested was when the time is, did the article on those.

263
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.750
So I really started going, like, I, I started, you know,

264
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.300
watching and reading and I'm like, I want to believe,

265
00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:16.320
I just can't find anything that doesn't have a gap that I can't cross.

266
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.100
<v 2>Well, you should talk to Fravor. He's a rock solid guy. And he's very,</v>

267
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:21.960
it's very compelling when you talk to him in person,

268
00:14:21.961 --> 00:14:25.350
because he doesn't want to have anything to do with these non interested at all.

269
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.440
He wanted to tell his story because he felt like they're not being honest about

270
00:14:28.441 --> 00:14:32.190
it. And that people really should know that there's some things that we don't

271
00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:36.690
understand. And that these guys that are down in San Diego that were, uh,

272
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.680
at this air force base,

273
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:42.620
they were seeing these things like fairly recently before his, his experience,

274
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.900
they'd seen one like in the last couple of weeks, I think it was.

275
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.480
And then they find them on the east coast, too, same thing.

276
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.180
And they move in the same way that Bob Lasar,

277
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.570
these things that he worked on area,

278
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.820
[inaudible] the same way where there's something called element one 15,

279
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:02.900
that Bob Lasar described in the late eighties, early nineties,

280
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.570
they didn't even know it was real until 2013.

281
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.700
He was describing it long before it was ever proven to be an actual thing long

282
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.120
before they ever created it with a particle accelerator. You.

283
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.560
<v 1>Don't have to remind me. This was my, and again,</v>

284
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.330
I I'm basing this only on opinion. I have no facts for this.

285
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.130
When I listened to him, he re he, my first thought was after these things,

286
00:15:24.131 --> 00:15:26.170
that don't line up. Oh, he took somebody's story.

287
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.870
What he's saying is somehow true, but he's telling somebody else's story. Yeah.

288
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.140
And that may be a total lie,

289
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.040
but that's just what that was my head told me was because he knows so much.

290
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.160
And yet, how do they make your education disappear?

291
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.630
<v 2>Like not, not hard, not hard. In the 1980s. I went to school with him,</v>

292
00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.710
have talked about it. That's.

293
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.750
<v 1>What I want to hear from. Oh yeah. He went to school with them.</v>

294
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.570
<v 2>Well, he, they have records of people that went to school with him.</v>

295
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.310
We've talked about it. Also.

296
00:15:51.311 --> 00:15:53.860
They have records of people that work with him at Los Alamos labs.

297
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.200
They've talked about it. Have they talked to publicly?

298
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.530
Because that's what I haven't heard. We talked to George Knapp. I know that.

299
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.490
<v 1>I want to hear who these people are. Not, not in equation,</v>

300
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.340
but I want it to be true. Like I want people to go. I go, yeah. He was in my,

301
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.680
my class going to talk to on.

302
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.190
<v 2>The podcast where he went back and found these guys that he worked at the lab</v>

303
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.040
with. He worked at Los Alamos lab for sure.

304
00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:19.720
And he worked on top secret nuclear projects and he worked in propulsion and

305
00:16:19.721 --> 00:16:22.210
that's one of the reasons why they send them to this area as for,

306
00:16:22.211 --> 00:16:26.890
because he put a jet engine in a Honda in the 1980s

307
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:27.340
and.

308
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.400
<v 1>You know, he's the, guy's a super genius. And so when he.</v>

309
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.480
<v 2>Did this, they were like, well,</v>

310
00:16:31.481 --> 00:16:36.400
this guy has a very intense understanding of combustion engines and propulsion

311
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.520
and all these different things that he's creating. And so like,

312
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:41.860
let's see if this guy can crack this crazy nut. Yeah.

313
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.430
And so they were just bringing scientists to try to get a different perspective

314
00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:48.370
on these crafts and the one that he was working on,

315
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:49.810
or one of them that he's working on.

316
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:52.270
They said that they had found in an archeological dig.

317
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.240
That's where it gets really crazy. Like they found this thing,

318
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:58.570
what he was working on, they think would he read,

319
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.940
was that what the government was telling them when they were working

320
00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:08.710
there, when they were briefing him was that human beings are the

321
00:17:08.711 --> 00:17:13.300
product of science projects that human beings were created

322
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.780
when many, many thousands of years ago, hundreds,

323
00:17:16.781 --> 00:17:20.830
whatever millions of years ago, however long it was now,

324
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:25.270
aliens came down here and did experiments with lower

325
00:17:25.271 --> 00:17:26.104
hominids.

326
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:31.060
They did experiments with primates and added their DNA and manipulated the DNA

327
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.920
to create human beings. I have.

328
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.630
<v 1>Great question. And it's not that I, I,</v>

329
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.720
cause I don't know enough about it to convince you otherwise, but I just don't,

330
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.920
but I'm kind of hoping you can convince me if they made the school records

331
00:17:41.921 --> 00:17:42.970
disappear. Right?

332
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.890
Why do they leave the records that we just saw from that place?

333
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.300
<v 2>They didn't know they were there that that's somebody had a copy of the, the,</v>

334
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.760
um, the registry for the, that place.

335
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.270
Someone who worked there during the same time he did how to copy the registry.

336
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.250
Do they, they didn't just eliminate his,

337
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.020
he eliminated his social security number.

338
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.790
They eliminated a lot of to, to the 1980s.

339
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.270
They can make you effectively disappear. Yeah.

340
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:11.510
<v 1>I'm sure they can. I mean, the A's paper trails were a little bit different,</v>

341
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:16.790
but it's just, I can't get beyond the two degrees. And I, I,

342
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.160
again, I want, I want to, I'm sure I've heard him interviewed.

343
00:18:19.161 --> 00:18:23.780
He's a very compelling guy not to harp on. And I just, you.

344
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.690
<v 2>Did, two degrees are not hard. That's not hard to get past.</v>

345
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.880
That's not hard to eliminate.

346
00:18:28.881 --> 00:18:32.120
What's hard is understanding all the things he understands when it comes to

347
00:18:32.121 --> 00:18:35.420
science without an education, the way he talks about it.

348
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.240
Have you ever seen the videos where he's describing it in the late eighties?

349
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.960
Yeah. It's exactly the same as he describes it now. Exactly the same,

350
00:18:41.961 --> 00:18:45.890
no variation whatsoever. That's kind of what I tell a story 40 years ago.

351
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.740
And then I asked you again today to tell me that same story,

352
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:53.360
most bullshitters are going to have some holes in that story and change it.

353
00:18:53.361 --> 00:18:57.080
And it doesn't mean he's telling the truth, but he's been insanely consistent.

354
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.740
Most.

355
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.080
<v 1>Thing too, that a lot of times, truth tellers have things changed.</v>

356
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:01.580
That's what eye witness testimony is.

357
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.720
So unreliable because even a truth teller will make mistakes over time.

358
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.360
If it's a, if it's a story that I've created,

359
00:19:08.361 --> 00:19:11.870
I think I'm less likely to forget details if I've created it because I have a

360
00:19:11.871 --> 00:19:13.100
beginning, middle and end to it.

361
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.860
<v 2>Right. But it's very complicated. What he's saying,</v>

362
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:19.880
what he's saying is very complicated in the descriptions of them with

363
00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:23.720
descriptions of these crafts and the way the propulsion system works.

364
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.140
And the fact that it uses this incredibly dense element that doesn't even exist

365
00:19:27.141 --> 00:19:30.890
on earth in, you know, 1989 or whatever it was.

366
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:35.540
But now they've found actually as a real thing, like that element one 15,

367
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.060
that was, that was, people were saying that science fiction,

368
00:19:38.061 --> 00:19:38.900
you're making things up.

369
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.400
But now that they have created it in particle accelerators. So like, oh, okay,

370
00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:44.234
this is a real thing.

371
00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.330
Now what if there is a planet that has a completely different atmosphere,

372
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.050
completely different relationship with its star and element one 15 is common.

373
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.910
Like they find things in asteroids all the time that are very,

374
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.360
very rare on earth, but very common in space.

375
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:02.660
It's one of the ways that they know whether or not we've been impacted.

376
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.230
Like one of the ways that they know that the Yucatan was hit with his gigantic

377
00:20:06.231 --> 00:20:10.640
asteroid that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is a layer of

378
00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:13.940
Iridium at 65 million years. Iridium is very,

379
00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:17.270
very rare on earth, but very common in space.

380
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:19.160
And this layer of it,

381
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.290
this dense layer at 65 million years ago shows that that's when it was hit

382
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.340
that this giant chunk of space rocks slammed into the earth and killed

383
00:20:28.341 --> 00:20:31.910
everything. Yeah. I know. Look,

384
00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.880
I like the fact that you're skeptical. I'm very skeptical. Wish I was more.

385
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:35.481
<v 1>And I don't,</v>

386
00:20:35.481 --> 00:20:39.650
I don't want to be because I really want to believe it because it also gives us

387
00:20:39.651 --> 00:20:43.310
a hope that we have some kind of a possible and mortality summer, believe me,

388
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.320
I'm like Ray Kurzweil as much as anybody does. He gives us all hope. Um,

389
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.040
but I just, I keep getting to a sticking point every single time.

390
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:54.610
There's something I can't get beyond. Um,

391
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.880
when it comes to that conspiracy, I know what you mean.

392
00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.210
<v 2>I know what you mean. It's look, I thought it was all horse for a long time.</v>

393
00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.150
I was, I was like, I was mocking it all for a long time.

394
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.770
And then Jeremy Corbell,

395
00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:07.530
his documentary really flipped a switch with me and was like,

396
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.730
God it is this real.

397
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.590
And then getting to know Jeremy and talking to him and then getting to know Bob,

398
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.550
having dinner with Bob and then getting Bob to come here and sit down.

399
00:21:17.551 --> 00:21:21.540
And it was very hard to get him to come in very hard, very hard.

400
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.290
He was super nervous. He was getting migraines. He didn't want the,

401
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.230
he didn't want the scrutiny. And then meanwhile,

402
00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:32.040
while he's doing Jeremy's documentary, they raid his business.

403
00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:35.850
They raid his business and go through all this stuff. The FBI did,

404
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.290
they caught it all on video. It's all part like this is not just a regular guy.

405
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:45.000
They're going through all of his, his, his data that going through his, uh,

406
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:48.030
all of his emails. They, they confiscated his computers.

407
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.760
They didn't find anything he's, he's free and clear,

408
00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.070
but they were looking for element one 15. He thinks,

409
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:57.300
cause he had some apparently and they had done some tests and there's video of

410
00:21:57.301 --> 00:22:01.500
it with George Knapp, where they've got like there, they've got fog.

411
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:03.390
They're usually some sort of a fog machine there.

412
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.870
They're showing how this gives off a certain,

413
00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:11.640
it gives off a certain field that makes it almost impossible to grab and touch.

414
00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.250
And this fog is rejected by this field.

415
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.120
And what they were saying about that element is, and I'm a butcher this, uh,

416
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.710
I don't really understand the science, but this, this gravity,

417
00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.620
intensifier this gravity multiplier, whatever the it is.

418
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.970
Gravity projection thing with that one 15, it distorts gravity.

419
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.480
And that's how these things are able to move through these insane, um,

420
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.830
through insane speeds and the way he described it as that, it's like,

421
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.860
if you had like a real cushy mattress,

422
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.910
real soft mattress and you put a massive bowling ball in the center of the

423
00:22:44.911 --> 00:22:49.380
mattress, everything would just go zoom and bend around the bowling ball. Well,

424
00:22:49.381 --> 00:22:53.190
that's what element one 15 with that craft.

425
00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:58.170
And that propulsion system does to space time. It bends gravity.

426
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.830
<v 1>It depends based on, I don't know the answer to this. I always walk.</v>

427
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.380
Cause I've heard of that. Doesn't everything else get up.

428
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.290
They give you bending space time because everything else has kind of come closer

429
00:23:07.291 --> 00:23:09.510
together. And I don't know. I don't.

430
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.500
<v 2>Know. Maybe it doesn't, maybe it does. Maybe it doesn't, I don't know.</v>

431
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.230
Maybe he just does it with whatever's around it.

432
00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.270
And maybe we don't understand how space we know that gravity

433
00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.540
bends things. Right. Get Ben's light. That's why, you know,

434
00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:28.500
when you're looking at the sun, you can actually see things.

435
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:33.270
They can see things that are actually behind the sun because it was the massive

436
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.820
gravity of the sun. Cause it's so enormous.

437
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.870
It actually manipulates light. It bends it.

438
00:23:39.871 --> 00:23:41.910
So you can see things that are actually behind it.

439
00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:46.550
<v 1>I want to know, like, I'm sure if you had near the grass, Tyson lunchtimes.</v>

440
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.060
Yeah. He's fascinating. And a skeptic. Um,

441
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.540
and he's an interesting skeptic because he may, he, I mean,

442
00:23:53.541 --> 00:23:57.260
he saw he can base it in what he knows or believe scientifically, but you know,

443
00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:00.140
guy try it. Our show went at it with him, you know,

444
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.580
who went on Troy who's Troy. He's our, uh, he's a DJ.

445
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:07.010
And he's our like a guy who works our computers.

446
00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.220
<v 2>Wait, wait, Troy went out with Neil deGrasse Tyson. Oh yeah. About.</v>

447
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.110
<v 1>What? Because he thinks he's full of. Government agent and a hiding UFO is no,</v>

448
00:24:15.111 --> 00:24:18.470
it was great though. It was, it was a fun video. But Troy thinks that Neil is a,

449
00:24:18.471 --> 00:24:21.920
is an agent, an agent that agent. But I mean like an agent, as in,

450
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:25.520
as in representing the point of view of the cover of Stan,

451
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.800
is he one of those flat earth guys? None at all.

452
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:31.460
He just thinks that he thinks that there's a UFO is there's a lot of things were

453
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:35.120
not being told. Um, but it was a great video that, uh,

454
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.430
but if they're not being told, do you think that they tell.

455
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.230
<v 2>Strong numbers and astrophysicists,</v>

456
00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:41.120
do you think they'd tell guys like Neil deGrasse Tyson,

457
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.130
like why would they pull him aside? Hey,

458
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:45.920
Hey guy who works at the Hayden planetarium, we're gonna,

459
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.420
we're going to give you secrets.

460
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:50.450
And we met definitely want to make sure you don't tell them to people on the OPN

461
00:24:50.451 --> 00:24:52.940
Anthony show. Troy thinks that he, uh.

462
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:57.140
<v 0>He knows really? Yeah. Come on. Oh, it's legit. You know, he really does. Okay.</v>

463
00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.390
All right, Troy. But he's a, we always going back and forth.

464
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.050
<v 2>Was it entertaining or did he get weird? He was okay with it.</v>
