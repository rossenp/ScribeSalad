00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 2>Yeah, you're a legitimate chocolate fiend.</v>

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.540
<v 1>I'm definitely at legitimate.</v>

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 0>How much do you eat a day? How much?</v>

5
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.300
<v 1>No, I, I,</v>

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.220
every single morning I have hot chocolate and it takes about 45 minutes of

7
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.520
preparation time has about four different ingredients.

8
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.030
So I start that and then I have some chocolate over the course of 45 minutes.

9
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.080
Yeah. A lot of it is simmering, so it's not really fully active,

10
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.570
but it's some active in some passive interventions.

11
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.110
<v 0>Is this a preparation that you do? Like, is it,</v>

12
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.800
does it prepare you for the day? Is it like a meditation thing?

13
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.410
<v 1>It's probably some kind of morning ritual, but it's just, I dunno,</v>

14
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:42.900
it's very calming for me. And by the time after this 45 minutes,

15
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:46.950
it's like pudding. I mean, it's like this thick bubbling, hot chocolate. I just,

16
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.620
it brings me joy. I feel like everyone should start their day with joy.

17
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.160
<v 0>Well,</v>

18
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.930
there's some like positive qualities and it's not just a good tasting thing,

19
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:56.940
right? Like, oh yeah. Chocolate with some.

20
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.471
<v 1>Again, dark chocolate,</v>

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.190
especially has all kinds of very positive health benefits.

22
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:04.980
I'm not saying that everyone should just eat chocolate bars all day and you're

23
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:07.950
going to live forever. But actually the, the world,

24
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.990
the woman who lived longest of everyone in recorded history ate two pounds of

25
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.580
chocolate a week. John Kelman in France. So at least it could help.

26
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.350
<v 0>Two pounds seems like excessive.</v>

27
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.360
<v 1>It's a lot, but she lived to 122.</v>

28
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.980
<v 0>But N but chocolate's different in terms of like some chocolate is like really</v>

29
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.150
sugar, sugar based. And some chocolate is more of like a kind of,

30
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.050
I really like dark chocolate and peanut butter together, you know,

31
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.913
chocolate bar.

32
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.170
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Or like a recent species. Yeah. So the,</v>

33
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:41.460
the dark chocolate is the healthier version of chocolate on,

34
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.300
on average. And so these, the darker, pure cacao, that's where the,

35
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.363
the health benefits.

36
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.140
<v 0>But some people think there's like a,</v>

37
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
there's some psychoactive benefits to chocolate, right. To couch.

38
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.730
<v 1>Yeah. Well,</v>

39
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.230
so cacao has been used ceremonially for about 5,000

40
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.850
years. So there definitely is a, is a history of that. And, and it, it has some,

41
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.061
I mean,

42
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:06.690
it's not as psychoactive as some of the other stuff you talk about on the show,

43
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:07.510
but it has.

44
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.520
<v 0>A little bit of it. Well,</v>

45
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.940
we did a podcast before the podcast while we're getting COVID tested out there.

46
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.350
Yep. Exactly.

47
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.050
<v 1>Exact talking about our experience last.</v>

48
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.010
<v 0>Time. Yeah. Um,</v>

49
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:21.750
and so there's another thing that happens that I was reading about

50
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.300
some people like chocolate because it replaces, uh, it like,

51
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:30.210
it gives them a feeling of being loved. Have you ever read that?

52
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.450
<v 1>I read that, but I mean, maybe it's true.</v>

53
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:37.230
I don't know whether there's some doubt there's something that's chemical about

54
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:38.010
chocolate, but it's,

55
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.120
I think there's probably an association with chocolate and happiness and

56
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:45.990
everybody's or hope lots of people's grandma grandmother's gave them little

57
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:48.090
chocolates. I think that there's a little bit of that.

58
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.550
Maybe it's part of the chocolate. Maybe it's part of our experience.

59
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.510
<v 0>Oh God. I wish I could remember it. See if you could find this, like</v>

60
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.290
really that's what it is. An immuno.

61
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.960
<v 1>Acids, small quantities flavored nuts is the.</v>

62
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.750
<v 0>Yeah. Does it have something to do with, uh, love? What does, what it says here?</v>

63
00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.193
<v 1>This is fast.</v>

64
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.700
<v 0>Acting, talk in the brain signs my chocolate, but okay. There we go.</v>

65
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.970
Butterflies. We feel and falling in love. Yeah. Wow. All right.

66
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.910
<v 1>Great. Well, if, if the internet says it, it must.</v>

67
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.960
<v 0>Be true. Must be.</v>

68
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.880
But that was the idea that I had read that some people like chocolate,

69
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:28.390
like when they're depressed, when they're heartbroken, electronic,

70
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.270
what sort of a replacement for love? Yeah.

71
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.170
<v 1>I mean, I definitely, if you're feeling bad and you eat chocolate,</v>

72
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.080
it you're probably going to feel better. So maybe it is a replacing.
