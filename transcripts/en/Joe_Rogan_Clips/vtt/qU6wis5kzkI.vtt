00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 1>Experience. Do you think that there,</v>

3
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:09.030
is there a style of film or a kind of movie that you want to do that you haven't

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.280
done yet? That you're thinking you'd like to get in?

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.230
<v 0>I mean, there's two different projects.</v>

6
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:18.180
I tried to develop for a long time and they both failed to get off

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.270
the ground. One was this movie called the broad street bullies,

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.920
and it was about the 1974 Philadelphia flyers.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.140
And the movie is the true story is so insane that you can't

10
00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:33.720
believe it's real. Just the way that they decided, you know,

11
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.460
there are a fledgling team, nobody cared.

12
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.240
So they basically built a team of tough guys, you know, which is kind of like,

13
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:44.130
slapshots almost like the same won the Stanley cup twice based on just being

14
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:48.330
so scared. And so terrorizing other teams would be scared to play them.

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.980
And they'd be like, oh, you got the Philly flu.

16
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:51.480
Cause major players would be like, ah,

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.630
I'm too sick to play when we get to Philly. Cause,

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.840
and you go back and you watch the fights that took place during those

19
00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.693
seasons,

20
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.930
they literally go into the crowd and they're fighting with fans.

21
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.290
They come off the ice, they break up. I mean, when the guys are fighting,

22
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:10.080
it's not, and it doesn't seem like good natured, like, okay, we're going to go.

23
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:10.561
We're going to go.

24
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.820
It seems like gripping someone's hair and punching them in the face til their

25
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:16.320
teeth are all gone type fighting.

26
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.680
Cops are breaking up the fights on the ice cops,

27
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.440
cops with skates,

28
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.200
no pull uniform policemen,

29
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.170
come onto the ice and start breaking things up where they're sliding around.

30
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.003
<v 1>With their yeah.</v>

31
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.030
<v 0>Trying to on YouTube. It's amazing. I mean, I, I researched this for,</v>

32
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.980
for years and um, and then they just, you know, and,

33
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:40.620
and Bobby Clark at that time was like the most hated man in hockey.

34
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:41.730
I don't know if you're a hockey fan at all,

35
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:45.330
but he was just like another one was guys, who was he at? I don't know.

36
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.520
I could go on forever for a movie that didn't make, but, but I,

37
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.610
I kept trying to make it go and go and just get it just never,

38
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.880
you could just never. And I was in, I went to Philadelphia, knows it,

39
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.730
hanging out with the team and I was in their archives and having access to

40
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:00.330
everything that this is going to happen. And just couldn't, it wouldn't move.

41
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.800
Why? Why not? I don't know.

42
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:06.180
I don't know if the team and the team owners want to glorify that

43
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.130
time and the, if there's an amazing documentary on it,

44
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.420
that was on HBO. Maybe like five years ago, you got to watch it.

45
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.770
Do you remember the name?

46
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.560
It might've been called broad street bullies because it was, you know,

47
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.110
the spectrum was on broad street. So that's how they got the name,

48
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.510
but it's nuts. And I was like, you know,

49
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.880
the Dave Schultz and he's wearing like a Nazi helmet.

50
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:29.640
And he was the tough guy on the team that was petrified of,

51
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:33.520
and these guys are like, had really long hair, big beards. I mean,

52
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.620
does not like hockey.

53
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.550
And everybody looked like a maniac and they'd get stuff like, you know,

54
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:41.910
you'd see them get stitches, get hit, get stitched,

55
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.680
go back on the ice with the stitches.

56
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.920
There's jerseys covered in blood and they don't even change their Jersey.

57
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.330
They're playing covered in blood. Well,

58
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.390
that's such a crazy thing that would never do now.

59
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.721
<v 1>Well,</v>

60
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:55.410
the sports still to this day is such a throwback because it's the only sport

61
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:57.240
where you're allowed to fight in the middle of the sport.

62
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.830
But imagine if they had that with basketball, hockey.

63
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.730
<v 0>Players are the toughest, because I always love hockey.</v>

64
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.580
I want to be a hockey player when I was little kid. And that was my thing.

65
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.850
And for a long time, me and my wife, we had season tickets for the king.

66
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.550
So we'd go to every single game year after year after year.

67
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:15.130
And we'd always hang out with the team and they'd come to our house and then

68
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.020
party. And we'd always be with them in Vegas.

69
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.380
And they're like football players on skates.

70
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.070
And they're all for like these like guys from like moose jaw Saskatchewan.

71
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.320
And like,

72
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.600
they keep the teeth out and they get crazy in the bar and they're like mental.

73
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.340
And they're just like, who else is skating?

74
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.480
90 miles an hour crashing into boards that are just have no give.

75
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.820
<v 1>So interesting that that's the one sport where it's written in that you can</v>

76
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.900
fight that fight.

77
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.980
<v 0>I mean, it's.</v>

78
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.720
<v 1>So funny. It's so crazy.</v>

79
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.990
Like that would make so many sports so much more interesting,

80
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:51.320
but nobody would ever do it. It's literally the tough guy sport it is.

81
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.820
<v 0>And the thing that always drove me crazy, like drove me crazy.</v>

82
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:58.810
Like it involves me, but they would always advertise the LA Kings as like,

83
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:02.290
it's like this family thing, like, oh, come on down and cheer for the Kings.

84
00:04:02.291 --> 00:04:05.500
And they'd be like a girl in a hockey Jersey on the billboards around timely.

85
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.160
You should just put up mugshot style portraits of the players,

86
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.620
like smiling with their teeth missing. And it just says,

87
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:14.530
you think you're a tough Kings because,

88
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.590
and that's not like the old days where they're kind of like skillful.

89
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.460
They're like this,

90
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:22.270
guy's like six foot five and you put them on skates and they're huge. And they,

91
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.193
you know,

92
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.580
they they're all jacked up in big like football players except their own skates.

93
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.870
<v 1>I think it would be a hard sell for a lot of people,</v>

94
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.860
but what's not a hard sell is MMA, which is weird, right?

95
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:38.590
Because that's like the darling of so many,

96
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:42.610
you go to the fights and Matt Damon will be there and Leonardo DiCaprio and

97
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.280
everybody wants to be seen there. And Kanye is in the crowd.

98
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.850
And it's one of those things where people have decided like, that's okay,

99
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.050
meanwhile, they're smashing their faces open with elbows on the ground,

100
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.620
mental man heads trapped in a cage and they're pummeling each other and it's

101
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:57.540
okay. And.

102
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.060
<v 0>They break it up. Like, I'm pretty sure that guy's already got brain damage.</v>

103
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.910
You needed to stop that punching two seconds earlier.

104
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.200
<v 1>It's so crazy sport because it's become accepted. Like,</v>

105
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.000
like that's what I was saying. It's weird.

106
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:14.500
Like a fight in a basketball game is a giant deal. Like, oh my gosh.

107
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.000
<v 0>Shoves another guy. And it's like, this.</v>

108
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.930
<v 1>Is crazy. Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.160
If a guy like judo tossed a guy and landed on his head,

110
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.770
somebody did that recently in a hockey game was awful.

111
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.300
Like Robin black did a breakdown of it where some guy got a guy in a clinch and

112
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:33.070
hit him with a hip toss and slammed his head onto the concrete is horrible.

113
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.640
<v 0>It's weird. Well, I mean, I can see why they, they want,</v>

114
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.340
I think they probably like hockey being more family friendly.

115
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.740
Cause the arenas are so nice.

116
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.630
You bring the grades and they don't want a bunch of maniacs beating the out of

117
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:46.690
each other, but they can still fight. They can still fight. But it is. Yeah.

118
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.830
<v 1>Just watch this. This is crazy. Boom. Oh, that's bad. That's horrible.</v>

119
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.340
That's an move because like that's not even fighting. Like,

120
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.640
and plus that guy landed with bolted, their weights guys on his head.

121
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.450
He's out called. I mean that's like serious, serious brains.

122
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.800
<v 0>Yeah. I remember one time,</v>

123
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.630
one particular incident at King's game where the guy was out and it went on

124
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:12.830
forever and the vibe was so heavy in the arena because we're like, is he dead?

125
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.100
Cause you know, you know, when someone hits and they just stop moving.

126
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.933
<v 1>And that.</v>

127
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.030
<v 0>Freaks you out, you pull up some broad street, bullies fighting from 1974.</v>

128
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.600
<v 1>Pull up some of that. Yeah. I've seen statement.</v>

129
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.320
<v 0>Oh that's this thing. Yeah. This is the documentary. It's amazing.</v>

130
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.720
<v 1>Look at the way they look back then everything it's like back in the day.</v>

131
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.140
It's just such a weird thing to see people from that era.

132
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.860
<v 0>I hear that. Yeah. They don't.</v>

133
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.230
This is like early days before they became insane.

134
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.840
<v 1>Oh. So it built up because what.</v>

135
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.850
<v 0>Happened was when they were starting as a team,</v>

136
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:50.780
they got really manhandled one time by a certain team. And they were like,

137
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:53.270
this is never going to happen again. And they rebuilt,

138
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.240
the team would basically like thug type guys.

139
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.380
<v 1>I'm always amazed in. Anybody could punch while they're on skates and that's,</v>

140
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.910
I can't even skate. How the do you maintain your.

141
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.890
<v 0>I don't know. But these guys are amazing athletes. I, one time I went,</v>

142
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.100
I went down and got to skate at practice with the LA Kings.

143
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.240
Would they guys were injured and,

144
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.610
and that rink seems small when those big guys all get on the ice. I was like,

145
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.473
wow, there's no room.

146
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.800
<v 1>Sure. Well, it's also the collide into each other against the wall,</v>

147
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:23.930
which the amount of shock on your body.

148
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.000
<v 0>I know. It's amazing that,</v>

149
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.510
I mean they just go and go and go.

150
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.030
<v 1>Can reignite some interest with this conversation because I think that would be</v>

151
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:36.530
it well, because he's pulling his hair.

152
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.980
<v 0>Yeah. Oh it wasn't like it was, I'm going to wash that. It's amazing.</v>

153
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.330
<v 1>So have you tried again recently or I really think that it's just like,</v>

154
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.060
they just don't want to be connected to this story.

155
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.740
<v 0>Well, there's this guy, ed Snyder,</v>

156
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.610
who was the guy who started the whole team and that's where, and I met with.

157
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:57.380
I thought he was the reason it wasn't going to happen. And then he passed away.

158
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.423
Cause I mean, he was pretty old.

159
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.010
And then we started talking to the newer people and it just,

160
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.250
I don't know how many years of my life I'm going to dictate, you know,

161
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.150
put into place and you don't know. And someone said to me one time, well,

162
00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:09.830
you got further than anyone else ever did.

163
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.130
I'm like how many times did they try to make this movie warned me about that

164
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:13.964
five years ago?

165
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.100
<v 1>Is there any other kind of movie that you're interested in other than something</v>

166
00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:19.760
like that?

167
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.730
<v 0>Yeah, there was this other one that I worked on for a long time that never went</v>

168
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:26.030
either. I had bought the rights to this book called raised eyebrows,

169
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.890
which was a light that about the last few years of Groucho Marx, his life, ah,

170
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.480
this guy, Steve Stoll, you wrote it.

171
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.730
And he was an 19 year old college kid who started

172
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:41.030
this petition drive. Do you like the Marx brothers love them. Yeah.

173
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.920
And cause animal crackers had been lost. That was the last film. And it used to,

174
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.550
I think it was at UCLA. Sorry, Steve. I can't remember your college. Um,

175
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.680
he started a petition drive to get animal crackers released from the vault and

176
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:57.360
released. Cause it hadn't been seen since like the forties or something.

177
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:01.530
And he did, this was in the S this was in the early seventies. And through that,

178
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.950
he became Groucho's assistant,

179
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.570
but Groucho's final years are really dark because he kept having strokes and he

180
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:11.250
was ill. Any of this woman, Erin Fleming,

181
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.130
who was supposed to be as they kind of played it, like it was his girlfriend,

182
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.500
but she was so the caretaker and it was,

183
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.050
it turns into sunset Boulevard inside his house, you know?

184
00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.700
And Steve eventually is put in charge of Groucho because it's.

185
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.490
<v 1>A really dark Belvoir household because.</v>

186
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.430
<v 0>Groucho was being abused and drugged by this woman.</v>

187
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.420
She isolated from his family and it's like happening in this Beverly Hills home.

188
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:37.590
And it's just dark. It was dark towards the end for Groucho really? And,

189
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.860
but the book is fascinating because the guy wrote it. Steve who's still alive.

190
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.250
And we're friends. I was just like, it was one of those books.

191
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.470
You're reading like five seconds. And I just happened to find it by accident.

192
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:49.140
I was like, this is an amazing movie. But again,

193
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.090
years and years go on and trying to get it made.

194
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:53.940
<v 1>Groucho was such a controversial character,</v>

195
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.550
had one of the greatest lines ever on you bet your life.

196
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.530
He is talking to this guy and he's asked the guy like, uh, you're married. Yes.

197
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.490
How many kids? You guys.

198
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:04.050
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

199
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.650
<v 1>You guys has, he got a gang of kids and he goes, geez. He goes, he goes, oh,</v>

200
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:09.570
I love my wife. He goes, I love my cigar too.

201
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:12.600
But I take it out of my mouth every now and then. Yeah. That is,

202
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.330
that was a hugely controversial line. Yeah.

203
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.200
<v 0>Yeah. He's was amazing. And he was like, and he was very eyebrows. Yeah,</v>

204
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.040
there it is. He was very outspoken. He was like on Nixon list and stuff.

205
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:24.180
And he didn't give me crap.

206
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.710
<v 1>Inside Groucho's house.</v>

207
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.460
<v 0>It's really fast. If you get that book, you'll read it in like two seconds.</v>

208
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.890
<v 1>It's always sad when some iconic,</v>

209
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:35.880
old figure like is being taken care of as he's older and you know,

210
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:38.760
he's getting over and someone's waiting for him to die so they can get the

211
00:10:38.761 --> 00:10:39.450
money. Yeah.

212
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:40.470
<v 0>And she kept kind of doing, saying like,</v>

213
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:44.160
we're going to make you come back Groucho. And we're going to do as TV specials,

214
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.100
enemy, you know, like you and Frank Sinatra. And Groucho's like, you know,

215
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.300
had on his like third stroke and it was like, can't really talk or, you know,

216
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.823
it was just like,

217
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.130
and a couple of the final appearances are of him are pretty rough.

218
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.220
Cause he was pretty sharp and good. Even when he was older,

219
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:02.370
really watch my Dick Cavett or something, but then it got bad.

220
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.460
<v 1>And then how did this lady get into his life?</v>

221
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.110
<v 0>How did that go down to remember? She was a, has been,</v>

222
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.040
I think she was a secretary at first and just kind of weasel their way in. Oh,

223
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.800
I can't remember exactly. I should. I should be able to remember everything.

224
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.280
<v 1>There's so many stories like that of like, oh,</v>

225
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.600
I think there was a Stanley story like that in his last few days it happens a

226
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:28.290
lot. You know, people were trying to get his money.

227
00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.850
<v 0>I remember a member of that. Martha Ray. Yeah. That was like the end with her.</v>

228
00:11:32.851 --> 00:11:35.610
Like he was like, oh and her boyfriend and she's like this in a wheelchair.

229
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.740
<v 1>Right? Yeah, yeah.</v>

230
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.090
<v 0>And I was like, yeah.</v>

231
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.290
<v 1>Oh yeah, that is sad. And their kids are done with them.</v>

232
00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.570
And so someone else is taken care of them.

233
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.970
<v 0>Well, they're so old. Their kids have all died of old age.</v>

234
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.570
And this was like, you know.

235
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.740
<v 1>So you wanted to do that film. Yeah. What happened.</v>

236
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.500
<v 0>With that? It just, it just couldn't get it going.</v>

237
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:59.500
We thought we'd every time it seemed like we were on the move,

238
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.640
it just would stall.

239
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.600
And then I had a falling out with the producers and I was like, oh, you know,

240
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.600
five years spent with this. I'm out.

241
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.600
<v 1>Oh my God. The dream at a time.</v>

242
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.780
<v 0>Yeah. That's the thing like for every movie I've ever gotten made,</v>

243
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:17.260
there's probably five others that I tried to get made that couldn't get made.

244
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:20.500
So it's a real time suck. Yeah.

245
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.470
<v 1>That's, that's a huge drag man.</v>
