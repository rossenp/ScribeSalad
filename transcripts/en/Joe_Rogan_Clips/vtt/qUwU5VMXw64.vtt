00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.800
How did that scene come to play where you were with Hicks and Gracie?

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.040
<v 1>Oh, cuz I, cuz I was, I studied Ike. Oh. When I was in college. Um,</v>

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.960
I, I was studying Ike. Um, and then

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.630
when I was studying Ike, uh &lt;affirmative&gt; um, hoist grace,

6
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.270
he won the, you know, that was, went into the fighting championship.

7
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:32.110
That was like the late eighties. Right. 19 93, 93. Okay. Close five years later.

8
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.550
Right. So, but he, I became aware, oh no, that's it. That you're right.

9
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:37.950
You're right. Cause I was in New York.

10
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.140
I was studying Aikido in New York and &lt;affirmative&gt; and hoist,

11
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.980
Gracie won that first UFC. And like I said, I'm,

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.540
I'm six feet tall, but I literally, if I'm in shape, I weigh like 1 55. Right.

13
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.180
And hoist, when he won, that was 1 76, like six feet and under 180. Right. Yep.

14
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.060
And I remember it melted everybody's mind. Yeah.

15
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.210
I mean it melted everybody mind and I, um, so I,

16
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.090
I became interested in them and, and what they were doing, honestly.

17
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.130
Do you, do you know that, um, you know, in the story in there,

18
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.250
in that family's whole crazy story about being, um, you know,

19
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:21.890
they were Scottish, the, the grandfather was Scottish, right.

20
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.360
And he was like a, a consular, he was a customs,

21
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.200
he was a customs official in Brazil.

22
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.280
And because he had a good relationship with the Japanese console

23
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.360
and helped was with very generous in helping Japanese people get their papers

24
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.390
to come through. And in the Japanese, these console,

25
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.430
I think the story is who,

26
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.550
who knew Ike and jujitsu offered to like teach his sons? Yeah.

27
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.260
It was count.

28
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.110
<v 0>Meda, right? Yeah. Who came to,</v>

29
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.710
he came to Brazil and taught Carlos and Jian and,

30
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.670
and Helio. Well mostly who are.

31
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.670
<v 1>The fathers of the ho six and generation and.</v>

32
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.700
<v 0>Ilios oldest son. I think, I think, uh,</v>

33
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.300
Hoan was the oldest son and he's the one who created the ultimate fighting

34
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:10.580
championship. But Hickson,

35
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.620
the reason why it was so significant that you had him is that was the champion

36
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.140
of the family. Like undeniably, undisputed, everyone,

37
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.180
everyone throughout jujitsu, this it's very,

38
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.170
very rare at one figure is universally recognized as being the

39
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.570
superior product of jujitsu. And that was Hickson. Yeah. You.

40
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.810
<v 1>I, yeah. If you followed that stuff at all, you kind of yes.</v>

41
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.050
Heard that breakdown of it and yeah, I thought I thought a part of the story,

42
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.370
I think Hickson told me when we were in Rio.

43
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.000
I think what he said to me was that the reason Gracie jujitsu

44
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.960
became its particular derivation and its particular kind of things

45
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.080
that allowed hoist to do so well was because their father

46
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.320
was smaller than his brothers that's Ilio. Right. And he, and because,

47
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.040
and they were all bigger and because he was smaller, he adapted yes.

48
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.933
You know,

49
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.000
he adapted the style to work for a smaller person against a bigger person. Yes,

50
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:15.920
obviously. And um, and then that kind of like reached its,

51
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.230
its pinnacle with hoist winning that yes. That tournament, which, which,

52
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.030
which this, this gets down in the weeds for people who aren't into this stuff.

53
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.030
But the, but it was, I mean that was that you talk about these things,

54
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.390
the cracking through moment, right? Yes. That was a cracking through moment.

55
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.670
It was like, wait a minute, a guy,

56
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.740
his size just literally won in all form, all eyes tournament.

57
00:03:39.741 --> 00:03:42.740
Like how is that possible? You know what I mean? And it was like,

58
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.740
it was like jaw hits floor. And to me,

59
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:47.900
what was really interesting was I was really little,

60
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.140
all the way until literally the end of high school. I was very small.

61
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.940
I grew a lot, um, in my, like when I was like 17,

62
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.250
but I was really interested in Japan and I was interested in martial arts and

63
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.770
you know, James claves show gun, like not mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know? And,

64
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.490
um, and I would take, I, I took like a karate class and it scared me. I,

65
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.570
it was people if they were bigger and faster, it was just scary.

66
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.010
If you were little, it was like, I can't,

67
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.930
it doesn't matter if I can do these combos or whatever in

68
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.120
truth. I'm terrified of anybody bigger than me.

69
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:26.960
And I don't feel that this is teaching me anything that I would have the

70
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:31.440
confidence to, to use, to defend myself. Right. That's how I felt as a kid. Mm.

71
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.080
And when I, when I bumped into Aiki, I,

72
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.520
it completely changed my mind. The guy,

73
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:41.910
there was an incredible teacher in new Haven when I was in college and he was

74
00:04:41.911 --> 00:04:45.030
small. He was like, ho you know, maybe smaller than hoist grace or whatever.

75
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.430
And the guy was unbelievably like potent,

76
00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.350
like just in one of the most potent teachers in anything I ever

77
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:58.590
had. I was riveted by this guy. And, um, and, uh,

78
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.300
and it kind of started to make me believe that with grab grappling and

79
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.580
locking, which there's a lot of,

80
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:09.580
there's a lot of jujitsu in Aikido mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. And I was sort of like,

81
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.860
I was fascinated. I started feeling like this, this,

82
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.900
this makes me feel like I, it's not like kicking someone's at all.

83
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.180
It's just more like, I feel more empowered. I feel,

84
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.890
I feel helpless able to handle an authentic situation. Yes. Um,

85
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.210
which is just mentally empowering more than like, I want to get into scraps.

86
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.610
Right. And it was just kind of amazing. It's like having a secret in a way,

87
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:34.091
like, whoa,

88
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:37.450
there's a secret to a much smaller person being able to lever a much bigger

89
00:05:37.451 --> 00:05:40.930
person. And then that thing happened with the gray season.

90
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.000
It was sort of like the whole thing cracked open. It was like this,

91
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.760
it was like proof. Yes. In a way, you know? And,

92
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.960
and if you were interested in that stuff, it was an incredible moment.

93
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.760
But because my interest in that for years when we went to Rio

94
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.520
Rio, and I had been working on the script of that movie and stuff,

95
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:59.354
and I was like,

96
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.840
I was really interested in this idea that banner is,

97
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.240
is desperate for control. Right. That he desperately,

98
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:10.920
desperately needs to control his heart rate, his breathing.

99
00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.160
That it's a massive liability in his mind if he can't control his

100
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.350
emotions and his adrenaline. And I was like, well, who in the world?

101
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.750
And, and I I'd seen the videos of Hicks. I'd never met him or any of them,

102
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.230
but I'd seen the videos of him doing the, um, amazing stuff with his stomach.

103
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.190
Yeah. The yoga. Yeah. And the breathing, fire breath. And I was like, and I,

104
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.110
I just was like, we have to, and, and everyone was like, who's that? I was like,

105
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.980
&lt;laugh&gt;. I was like, I was like, Phyllis steins. You're a, all Phyllis steins.

106
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:40.020
Like I was like, and I was like,

107
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.420
find me Hicks and Gracie and ask him if he'll do a scene with me in the movie

108
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.900
being the guy who's training banner to like calm himself.

109
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.140
And he was there and he, and he did it with us and it was like, I was like,

110
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.460
yeah.

111
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.460
<v 0>There it is right here. Yeah. Yeah. When I saw this in the movie, I was,</v>

112
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.970
oh. Yeah. Like what a smart.

113
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.850
<v 1>Move. Yeah. And I was like,</v>

114
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.970
I was, I was like, yeah, see, I got, I forgot this. Holy crap.

115
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.410
I haven't looked at this in a long time. He's look how charismatic he is.

116
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.770
He's amazing. I mean, the guy, the guy could have been like Charles Bronson,

117
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.450
a hundred percent.

118
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.680
<v 0>Like a movie star. Did you ever choke the documentary? Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.200
One of the greatest documentaries in, in, in history it's like pumping.

120
00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:27.040
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. For martial arts and it, it, uh,

121
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.480
it details Hickson's, uh, journeys to Japan to fight in Japan valley Tudo,

122
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:32.680
which was around 94,

123
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.200
which is right after his brother had won the ultimate fighting championship.

124
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:36.481
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

125
00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:40.750
And the story was that if his other lost Hickson was going in,

126
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.710
like the idea was like, well, bring in hoist because it's more impressive.

127
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:46.070
He's a smaller man. He's not physically imposing.

128
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.150
Whereas Hickson in that video there, he was older when he was young, he was,

129
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.750
you know, very fit and it was big into yoga and physical fitness.

130
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.390
And he had the strongest body of all the grace mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he's like,

131
00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:01.460
he looked very formidable &lt;affirmative&gt; whereas hoist looked unassuming and it

132
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:01.941
was a,

133
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:05.780
more of an advertisement of jujitsu if hoist could beat everybody and hoist

134
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.180
wound up doing. But if at any reason, right.

135
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.460
If they needed to bring in the big gun &lt;laugh&gt; it was gonna be Hickson and,

136
00:08:11.461 --> 00:08:14.380
and Hoy always talked about it. Like Hickson could tap him left and right.

137
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.700
And everybody was like, that doesn't even make sense. Right.

138
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:19.020
Hoist is the ultimate fighting champion. Yeah. He's the guy,

139
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.010
but his brother would just run right through him. He'd run. Right.

140
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:23.370
He would run right through everybody. He would,

141
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.250
they would have a line of black belts and they,

142
00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:29.250
they would all wait for their turn to get tapped and they would roll with

143
00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:31.370
Hickson. And he would just dismantle everybody,

144
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:34.050
people that thought they understood jujitsu it's.

145
00:08:34.051 --> 00:08:38.610
So there there's so many levels and layers to jujitsu that E even though it

146
00:08:38.611 --> 00:08:41.000
looks like, what is the difference is guy's doing an arm bar,

147
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:45.640
you're doing an arm bar there's specifics in the intricate aspects of the

148
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.440
positions that Hickson understood that they just didn't understand.

149
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.720
And then on top of that,

150
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.920
he had much greater control of his body because of his yoga background.

151
00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:56.000
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I mean, he, he became obsessed with yoga and breathing.

152
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.400
Yeah. Some breathing and, and something called gymnast, uh, natural,

153
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.200
which was like a, a style of movement that was like,

154
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.440
sort of like Vinyasa yoga with all these like flowing postures,

155
00:09:07.441 --> 00:09:10.600
but also with a bunch of like, almost like animal movements to it too.

156
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.120
And it was a very physically demanding thing.

157
00:09:13.121 --> 00:09:17.910
And he became a outstanding at that as well. Right. Sorry,

158
00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:20.470
but it's, uh, people don't from the outside,

159
00:09:20.471 --> 00:09:22.910
when you start talking about things like jujitsu and ultimate fighting,

160
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:24.950
you think of like this brutal, violent,

161
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.390
but it's an intellectual pursuit and it's a spiritual pursuit because to be the

162
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:32.270
person that can overcome all of the obstacles,

163
00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:34.750
you have to have incredible control of your,

164
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:38.180
and your thought processes and your understanding of who you are.

165
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.100
And that I think is one of the things that separated Hickson from everybody I do

166
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:42.260
too.
