00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.080
But it's like USA is one of very few countries that competes clean.

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.560
And so it's like, how do you compete? You know? Yeah. Uh,

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.640
so he had this outside pressure of, to like produce an athlete,

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.200
whether it was the right way or wrong way. Isn't.

6
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.600
<v 1>That up? That statement that you just said, but I know it to be true.</v>

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.110
When you said the USA is one of the few countries that competes clean that's

8
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:25.590
it's actually true. Oh, it's and so strange.

9
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.030
<v 0>I remember at the junior world that I competed that the winning guy in my weight</v>

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.270
class snatched more than what I clean a jerked. Like he,

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.110
this like 18 year old kid and he like power snatched, 155 kilos.

12
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.980
It was where where's he from? I wanna say he was

13
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.220
like somewhere over in Europe and I'm pretty sure it was like the whole podium

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.740
got popped. &lt;laugh&gt; it's kinda like, I remember like the 2008 Olympics,

15
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:55.060
like the 94 kilo class, they started testing down and it's like,

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.900
like currently it's like ninth place guy has the bronze medal because they just

17
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.130
kept testing down, down, down. So did.

18
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.690
<v 1>They pop 'em right after the competition? Or did they pop 'em future?</v>

19
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:05.370
I think its.

20
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.490
<v 0>Years, years later, cuz it's like at the time with the drug,</v>

21
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:09.050
they don't know how to test for. Right.

22
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.730
And so they save the samples and then years later they figure out how to test

23
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:13.730
for this stuff. Did.

24
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.563
<v 1>You see IOUs?</v>

25
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.490
<v 0>I, I watched like the first bit of it. Uh, yeah.</v>

26
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:20.050
I haven't seen the whole thing yet. It's.

27
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.490
<v 1>Nuts. Yeah. It's.</v>

28
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.840
<v 0>Nuts. I mean, it's just crazy. Like if there's a sport with money,</v>

29
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.240
people are gonna start bringing drugs into.

30
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.921
<v 1>It. Well, the,</v>

31
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:30.520
the crazy thing about that was that it was a Russian state sponsor.

32
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.680
They sponsored the entire dope. They, they DOD everyone, that guy, uh, Gregory,

33
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.040
uh Chenko mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah,

34
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.760
the guy who was the supposed anti-doping guy from Russia,

35
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.830
he's had the only people they didn't dope were the figure skaters because, uh,

36
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.190
they, they found that the figure skating, it actually interfered with, uh,

37
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.110
fine motor skills. Really? Yeah. So, so, and made the women too manly.

38
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.390
<v 0>So kind of funny about that. My parents were both figure skaters. Whoa.</v>

39
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.620
And so they they're both Olympians 1976, like no. Yeah. Pair freestyle.

40
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.780
And my dad talks about like,

41
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:09.300
he would be in the locker room and like different countries. They, he was like,

42
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:12.700
they just had their syringes on the, on the bench. Oh my God. And he was like,

43
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:15.620
you'd come in after your session on the ice.

44
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.700
And he's like the German team's just there. Like,

45
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.980
like they're not even hiding it because it was legal.

46
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 1>It like, well, they.</v>

47
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.810
<v 0>Didn't test for yeah. They didn't know, you know.</v>

48
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.330
<v 1>But the American team did that too back then supposedly. Oh really? Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.570
I was reading this thing about Bruce Jenner, where they were talking about all,

50
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:32.770
all the that they gave him when he was winning the decathlon.

51
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:37.730
And then they gave to every apparently post when it was,

52
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.210
uh, post the, the, uh,

53
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.960
Eastern Europeans winning like a lot of weight lifting competitions.

54
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.240
And then it was clear that they were experi experimenting with different kinds

55
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.600
of.

56
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.760
<v 0>Steroids. I remember reading the article, uh,</v>

57
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.080
like they were testing it at York barbell. And like,

58
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.600
I remember reading these journal entries from the lifters and some, uh,

59
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.680
they, they were bolting the bars,

60
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.000
like to the ground or to squat racks and they would take the drugs and then

61
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.720
just push on the bars as hard as they can.

62
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.200
Cuz their theory was like the heaviest bar you can lift is the one you cannot.

63
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.790
And it was like, huh, what? And some of these lifters are saying like, yo,

64
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:25.190
these pills or these injections are where everything is coming from. Like,

65
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.150
this is where all my gains are coming from. And then others were like, no,

66
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:31.190
no it's the training methodology. Like the drugs have nothing to do with it.

67
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.190
I'm just hitting all these personal records. Hmm. Yeah.

68
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.870
<v 1>Maybe a little bit of both. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

69
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.670
<v 0>I think, I think I know which one, which ones? I.</v>

70
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.700
<v 1>Sure, sure. But I mean, you know, you, don't just taking the drugs,</v>

71
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.020
doesn't make you stronger. You have to actually lift the weights,

72
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.620
but for sure the drugs are helping like this,

73
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.260
the idea that the drugs don't help.

74
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.900
I've actually seen someone argue that before. Oh, I,

75
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.180
that steroids are useless and, and if you train properly,

76
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.140
they actually get in the way I was like, what are you talking about?

77
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.420
<v 0>No. What are you talking about? I mean,</v>

78
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.690
there's been a couple people that like in CrossFit that got popped and they're

79
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:05.850
like, oh, the drugs weren't even doing anything. And it's like, oh.

80
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.170
<v 1>Silly boy. &lt;laugh&gt; of course they were. Yeah. They work.</v>

81
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:11.690
There's a reason why they're so prevalent.

82
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.530
And there's a reason why they test for 'em. Yeah.

83
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:15.130
They don't test for things that don't work.

84
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.810
They're not testing you for Cheerios. You know, they're test, they test you for.

85
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.730
They really.

86
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.160
<v 0>Work. I mean like the, the one guy,</v>

87
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.640
the one guy that he was on the podium at the games and then got popped, oh,

88
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.880
I competed against him month, like six or eight months prior. And like the,

89
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.880
the one stat, like he was snatching like two 60 or 2 65.

90
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.560
And then he shows up to the games and snatches like two 90 and he's taken,

91
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.510
he almost hit 300 and he's like, no, no, the drugs had nothing to do with it.

92
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:43.344
It's like.

93
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.230
<v 1>I bet they, I did. Yeah. I.</v>

94
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.910
<v 0>Don't believe that. And it's like,</v>

95
00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.070
like you've been in the sport for years. Like if you're just a beginner,

96
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:53.870
you can make progress like that. But I'm like,

97
00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:55.310
you've been in the sport for years. Yeah.

98
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.390
And then in the last six months you just had this huge spike in your performance

99
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:01.900
and you're like, oh no, it's just because I dedicated. It's like,

100
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.500
I'm not buying it.

101
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.540
<v 1>Yeah. So important to be dedicated &lt;laugh&gt; now how often do they test</v>

102
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:10.374
everybody?

103
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.220
<v 0>I mean, pretty often do they.</v>

104
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.140
<v 1>Show up randomly?</v>

105
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.260
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. So we have outta competition, drug testing. Um, you know,</v>

106
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:21.460
it's like when I did weightlifting, we we're on like the Nan programs.

107
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.090
No advanced notice. So you had to give, if you're in the Olympic sports,

108
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.290
you're tested by the Olympic association,

109
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.970
you have to give one hour a day of where you are and

110
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.370
they show up, they don't call nothing.

111
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.050
So like everyone put from like five to 6:00 AM. I'll be in my dorm room.

112
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.480
And like, if you're leaving for the airport at like four 50,

113
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.240
you'll see someone sitting outside the dorm, just like looking at their watch,

114
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.760
waiting for 5:00 AM to hit and give the knock and like, they'll follow you.

115
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.160
They come with you to school work. Doesn't matter what you're doing.

116
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.880
<v 1>Will they make you miss a flight?</v>

117
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.560
<v 0>Uh, yeah, probably. I I'd assume they would, but I mean,</v>

118
00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.720
like I remember having to talk to professors of like, I have an exam and like,

119
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.240
I didn't have to pee.

120
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.720
So I'm like guys gotta come to class with me and having to like explain to a

121
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:15.160
professor of like, Hey, like these guys are here for drug testing.

122
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.310
I compete in the sport. Is it okay if they just sit there in? Wow. Yeah.

123
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:22.830
So the CrossFit, how creepy. I mean, it's weird.

124
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:26.310
Like I've had it before where they showed up at 5:00 AM. I didn't have to pee.

125
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.470
And I'm like, yo, it's 5:00 AM. I'm going back to bed. And they're,

126
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.270
they're like, yep. We'll sit right.

127
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.190
<v 1>Here. So they just sit in the room while you're sleeping. Yeah.</v>

128
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.950
<v 0>They just pull up a chair and they'll just sit there,</v>

129
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.140
just stare at you while you're.

130
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.060
<v 1>Sleep, go back to bed. How.</v>

131
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.060
<v 0>Can you sleep while this guy,</v>

132
00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.140
can you just like put on the TV or something for him? And like,

133
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:44.900
you just go back to bed. &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,

134
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:49.060
after a while you get used to it of like the first time having to take a drug

135
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:53.820
test in front of someone it's weird. Like, yeah. They're inspecting you.

136
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:54.654
They have to look.

137
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.053
<v 1>Yeah. Making sure it's not rubber.</v>

138
00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.170
<v 0>And uh, and then I'm mean now it's like, I don't even break conversation.</v>

139
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.010
It's like, it happens so often every competition outta competition,

140
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.490
you get to know the guy that's like in your region for drug testing.

141
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.410
<v 1>Did CrossFit always have drug testing?</v>

142
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.370
<v 0>I, I don't know. I don't know if enough about the history. I think it's newer.</v>

143
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.770
Um, but yeah, with the CrossFit drug testing,

144
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.720
I remember the first time I got drug tested cuz when I first got on the sport,

145
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.880
I was like, I think these guys are doping. Like I don't believe it.

146
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.440
And I didn't know about the drug testing protocols and then I had to sign up for

147
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.880
it cuz I was doing well enough in the sport.

148
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.440
And then I get a phone call of like, Hey,

149
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.750
this is so and so from the drug testing where your name got old

150
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.310
and I was, I was honestly excited. Cause I'm like, oh sweet.

151
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:45.270
They do regulate this. This is great. So I was like, yeah,

152
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.550
I'm at the address that I listed, come on in doors unlocked. And he is like,

153
00:07:49.551 --> 00:07:53.870
oh no, no, no we'll be there tomorrow. And I was like, what? I'm like,

154
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.630
you're call, you're giving me a day's notice. I don't like that at all.

155
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.653
Like you.

156
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.460
<v 1>Can flush your system out in a day. Right. I have.</v>

157
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.620
<v 0>A lot of things. I have to assume that if you, if you know what you're doing,</v>

158
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.380
you have a plan B like you have to assume that you're gonna get tested at some

159
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:10.120
point. Right?

160
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.860
<v 1>How can they, I know that the, you saw stopped allowing people to use IVs.</v>

161
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.500
Cuz one of the things they said about IVs allows you to flush your system out.

162
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.810
I did, you.

163
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.770
<v 0>Can test negative. I never knew the reasoning.</v>

164
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:27.090
I remember it was coming up like those IV bars that like they just

165
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.730
jam, pack it full of vitamins. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; whatever,

166
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.770
like these super doses. And it's like started as like a hangover cure. Right,

167
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.890
right. Um,

168
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:37.610
and I remember that was getting pitched like other people around me were doing

169
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.720
'em and they're like, you should do this. And I'm like, all right.

170
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.480
My livelihood depends on not breaking the rules. So I'm like,

171
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.160
and I'm contacting people at CrossFit like, Hey, is this allowed?

172
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.760
And it's like right there in the rule book of like no IVs over 50

173
00:08:53.761 --> 00:08:57.680
milliliters or something equipment to like a tablespoon or two tablespoons.

174
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.800
So I was like, oh, okay. That's not allowed not doing that. But yeah. I mean.

175
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.520
<v 1>So you can't even do IV vitamin trips. Mm-hmm interesting. Yeah.</v>

176
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.920
But you can do some IVs. Like I said, no IVs.

177
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.680
<v 0>I think if it's a medical emergency. So like if you're super dehydrated. Yeah.</v>

178
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:17.750
So like if you're in and like getting hospitalized or like there's a,

179
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.550
a need for it. I think it's allowed.

180
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.030
