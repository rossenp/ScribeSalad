00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.320
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.000
<v 1>It's just a random Tuesday and there's some kid in Minnesota. That's like, yo,</v>

3
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.520
I love you, dude. Keep going. We're listening.

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.640
And I might have needed to hear that, that day. Mm. You know,

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.360
so like those kids don't know that that means that much to me and it,

6
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:20.320
and it does. So like, I, I wasn't really that big with talking, you know, and,

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.750
and having such a presence online. Cause I was weird about it and I,

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.310
I got a grip over it. It's, it's no problem for me. I love that I can, you know,

9
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.590
just hit up a kid randomly and just make their whole year, you know,

10
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:33.910
and just gimme some confidence is something that's using it for good. You know,

11
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:37.750
rather than me posting a picture of some jewelry or some new thousand dollars

12
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:42.140
sneakers, I bought that doesn't do anybody any good other than being like,

13
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.180
I ain't got. &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, that's the reality that people realize.

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.061
And then it's like, well,

15
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.180
I need to do what I gotta do so I can have what he have.

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.780
And I don't want people to think like that, you know, like when I post,

17
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.460
I like to post like, you know, maybe my lactate milk or, you know,

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.140
like some like, so does this.

19
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.170
<v 2>Come from like lessons that you've learned watching other people and what,</v>

20
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:04.290
like their behavior,

21
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.010
you felt like the shortcomings of their behavior once they became.

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.810
<v 1>Famous? Oh yeah, man. I watched everybody around me, you know, and I think,</v>

23
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.930
and I, and I, and I kind of use,

24
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.010
I want kids to look at me and understand what not to do. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

25
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:21.450
you know, when I was dealing with my drug issues back in 2010, 2009, you know,

26
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.800
I was just had to be in the cocaine and it was like beauty, big thing for me.

27
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.480
Cool. &lt;laugh&gt; and it was like a really big thing for me.

28
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.240
And it was something that, you know,

29
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:37.240
kept me level something that I felt like I needed self-medicating and, uh,

30
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:40.400
you know, so you felt like cocaine kept you level. Yeah, man.

31
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.280
Cause I had this whole technique, uh,

32
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.230
where I don't know if I even should get into this,

33
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.390
I don't even want to talk about this.

34
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.950
You don't have to run around and talk do it, you know, but let's just say I,

35
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.590
I got into like, you know, uh, what I would call like, you know, a trifecta,

36
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:58.390
which was, you know, I would wake up in the morning. I would, uh, you know,

37
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.990
do Coke immediately, even before I had cereal breakfast. Whoa. And then I would,

38
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.460
would have a beer and then I would smoke weed.

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.300
So like I never wanted people to know I was doing cocaine.

40
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.340
So the beer in the marijuana leveled me out in a way where I

41
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.340
was able to walk in the streets and talk and,

42
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.180
and see as though I wasn't on anything but deep inside, I'm just like, you know,

43
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.100
with my face and just like, yeah, that's right. You know,

44
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.730
but what it did for me, uh, it, it completely numbed me.

45
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.610
I didn't care about anything and I was a robot, but also with,

46
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.770
with being so numb,

47
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.130
it allowed me to go out and meet my fans and be out in the streets.

48
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.290
So in a twisted way, it did, it did a positive thing for me.

49
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.570
And that's why I didn't see it as an issue. It was like,

50
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.680
today I went walking in Soho with no place to go.

51
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.520
And I was just high fiving fans and. Like, it was just the most, you know,

52
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.440
amazing experience.

53
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:56.360
Something that I never get a chance to feel because I'm just like such a

54
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:00.000
reclusion I'm just at that time was just weirded out when people recognized me

55
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.600
and just didn't want to go anywhere, you know? Yeah.

56
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.080
<v 2>That's a, an issue with substances that can help you in some ways,</v>

57
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.720
but they're ultimately detrimental to your health or wellbeing or your ability

58
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.240
to keep it together. Yeah. You.

59
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.200
<v 1>Know? Yeah. I mean, I abused it, you know,</v>

60
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.680
it's not like the guy who like goes out with his buddies in spring break and

61
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.230
it's like, yeah, let's do up. And it's like, Hey cool. You know,

62
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.070
those guys aren't.

63
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.310
<v 2>Real. &lt;laugh&gt; those, those guys are only people in movies, man.</v>

64
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.750
Everybody else is just too broke to keep going.

65
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.070
They just don't have the amount of money that it requires to be a full-time

66
00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:33.350
Coke. Yeah. I, it was.

67
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.830
<v 1>Definitely expensive, man. It was definitely expensive, but you know, I, I, um,</v>

68
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.150
did.

69
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.460
<v 2>You find like while you were doing it every day, like,</v>

70
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.180
was there a thing that made you stop? Because that's usually,

71
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:44.860
there's like a moment you got.

72
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.060
<v 1>Caught and then people started to know I did it and that wasn't arrested. Yeah.</v>

73
00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.180
And it was like, now everybody knows I do it. This is not cool anymore.

74
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.420
Like it's only cool when no one knows. Cause Coke is a weird one.

75
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.420
<v 2>Right? Yeah. It's like.</v>

76
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.460
<v 1>I didn't really let you know. I didn't let the public make me,</v>

77
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.290
you feel bad about it though. It was just kind of like,

78
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.570
guess I can't do that no more. I mean then also my daughter was born.

79
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.570
So it was like, you know, it was,

80
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.450
it was like two kind of life lessons back to back that I experienced in,

81
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.490
in 2010 and you know,

82
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.290
my daughter's birth and being arrested were those two things,

83
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:19.890
because I think I had already started toning.

84
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.960
My cocaine used the beginning of that year,

85
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.480
but then I was the king of like something tragic happening or something I felt

86
00:04:26.481 --> 00:04:29.240
was tragic or stressful and spiraling back into it.

87
00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:31.920
Just needing any excuse to be like, all right, I'm gonna go do cocaine now.

88
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:34.400
Cause I'm upset and I'm dealing with something and I don't know how to deal,

89
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.280
just like my way of copping out and avoiding my issues. Wow. You know,

90
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:42.030
so it was like a block. It was like maybe a couple months ago I'd be in Hawaii,

91
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.791
you know,

92
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:46.230
working on some stuff with Kanye and I never did cocaine or anything around

93
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:49.830
those guys that was like my time at detox when I would be away. Cuz you know, I,

94
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.390
if you do Coke, you either doing Coke with other people, you know, or alone.

95
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.190
And I felt weird about traveling the world and every place I was at asking

96
00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:02.460
people where the drugs was at. So like it was something that I do it, you know,

97
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.420
at home and at certain time, you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, which was,

98
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.060
you know,

99
00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.020
I was able to like kind of keep it together and go out and work on my music and,

100
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.300
and be into it. I had a system, it was a weird sick system. I developed,

101
00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:16.820
you know, for myself, you know, where, you know,

102
00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:18.540
I was able to be cool if I wasn't in New York.

103
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.260
But then when I was back in New York,

104
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:24.570
it was on you cuz it was just like being home in the apartment alone for hours

105
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.970
on end, just really just got me, you know? Right. Uh, and doing it,

106
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:30.010
just kind of like, oh man,

107
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.610
I could just put on leaky Lee and just chill out for hours by myself.

108
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:34.444
And it's all good.

109
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.450
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; it's interesting that like the arrest made you wanna stop because you</v>

110
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:42.440
real, was it because like the, the feeling like, like, oh,

111
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.120
an event has taken place.

112
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.360
Like this is obviously a big sign that I'm going down the wrong direction.

113
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.520
I'm I'm in, I'm dealing with a legal system now I'm getting.

114
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.560
<v 1>Arrested. Nah, it was, it was just more like, did I,</v>

115
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.880
this is not Scott Medi how in the hell did I let this

116
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:06.520
become Scott Medi how in the do I got people looking at me?

117
00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:11.440
Like I'm not Scott Medi and I know what it was and I know

118
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:14.760
how to fix that. And I went and made, I, I just, it was just,

119
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.150
I didn't like how people were looking at me at that moment in time.

120
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.070
So they were looking at.

121
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:18.903
<v 2>You like you're a Coen.</v>

122
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.430
<v 1>Yeah. Crazy cracked out dude. Like everywhere I would go.</v>

123
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.270
It was just these looks. And I was just like, man, I just did a little blow.

124
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.670
&lt;laugh&gt;. &lt;laugh&gt; get off my back. You know what I mean?

125
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.910
Like y'all acted like y'all I ain't never did a bump get outta here, man.

126
00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:36.030
Like it was so I was like, are you kidding me?

127
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.740
<v 2>People love to be Sanon.</v>

128
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.620
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But I, but that's the thing when it happened, I wasn't like,</v>

129
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.700
you know, on, you know, the next complex interview I did like,

130
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.740
I have a statement that I issued here. &lt;laugh&gt; this camera. Okay. Yeah.

131
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.340
I'm really sorry on my fans for you guys,

132
00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:57.300
knowing that I do cocaine now or I used to, I don't do it anymore. Uh,

133
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.890
sorry if I let anyone down that, you know, that.

134
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.250
It was really just like I'm dealing with some. If you don't understand it,

135
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:07.610
I don't give a. This is how I was surviving. If I didn't do it,

136
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:09.770
I would've blew my brains out. Well, I like how you.

137
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.571
<v 2>Describe it too,</v>

138
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.290
because you're very honest about the positive aspects of the effects.

139
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.810
And I think that's super important.

140
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.450
<v 1>And this was my contract by the way used. So.</v>

141
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.640
<v 2>The relief. Yeah. Don't worry about it man. Sorry. Don't worry about it.</v>

142
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:21.360
You I'm.

143
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.240
<v 1>An actor. You do. Everything's.</v>

144
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.520
<v 2>A prop, your method, your very method.</v>

145
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.720
You're very honest about the positive benefits of it.

146
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.640
Like people have this idea,

147
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.800
like you shouldn't talk about positive benefits of any drugs,

148
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.310
whether it's harmless drugs, like marijuana or dangerous drugs, like cocaine,

149
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:42.070
he may be even especially dangerous drugs like cocaine,

150
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.510
because the reality of what you're saying,

151
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.150
your experience and the positive aspects of your experience,

152
00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:51.750
it's like he's promoting drugs when clearly you're doing just the opposite.

153
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.170
Yeah.

154
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.630
You're talking about how you needed them and used them and they helped you.

155
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:59.740
But the reality is it was because you were dealing with an issue. Right.

156
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.580
And it just helped mask the issue, but it did help. Yeah.

157
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.300
And to lie and deny that it clouds the issue for people dealing with their own

158
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:12.380
drug issues, dealing with their current drug issues or their past drug issues.

159
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.140
People aren't honest about it, man.

160
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.220
It puts people in this weird place where like,

161
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:19.260
you know what if I wasn't for meth, I would've never started this business.

162
00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:22.810
This, you know, the reason why I'm doing so well is cuz I got on meth.

163
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.530
Like yeah. I mean's some people that can say that probably.

164
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.190
<v 1>Well,</v>

165
00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.730
the only reason why I could sit here and say that is because like I've been four

166
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:34.770
years clean, man. I'm not like dipping back it's yeah. And it's,

167
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:37.730
and I can speak about it candidly. And it's not something I'm weird about.

168
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.640
And uh, I've just grown so much since then.

169
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.720
And I also know that the more I talk about it, you know,

170
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.680
the more it'll help somebody else who might be dealing with it.

171
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.880
You know what I mean? Definitely. You know, I, when you're in that,

172
00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:51.760
it's probably just,

173
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.200
it seems like you can't get out of it because it is like a thing,

174
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.520
you know what I mean? And cycle. Yeah. And you, you get caught up in it.

175
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:01.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and um, you know, I,

176
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.640
I just know as with kids listening to me talk now it's,

177
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:06.920
it could be helping a lot of people.

178
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.120
I'm not like one of those people now that used to do cocaine and I'm like, oh,

179
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:11.561
you're bad.

180
00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:14.910
If you do cocaine or cocaine's bad and you shouldn't do cocaine and I don't

181
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:19.870
promote any drug, but I'm not judging anybody if they do it. Right.

182
00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:21.870
You know, it's not like a big deal. Like I,

183
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.590
I did it and I just abused it in a way and it didn't benefit me.

184
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.590
It didn't benefit Scott. I didn't like the person I was becoming.

185
00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.550
There's some people that could do this and they could live and do it in

186
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.230
moderation and it doesn't affect their lives.

187
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:38.260
Like how it mine more power to 'em they got super powers if you ask me,

188
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.220
but I just have that, you know, it's a history of drugs in my family.

189
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.820
It was like, my blood was waiting mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it was like, yeah,

190
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.540
like let's go. And I noted about myself and I just had to make that choice. I,

191
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.220
I had to make a choice and I think that's what,

192
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.890
anything cigarettes and which I'm, you know, for of months,

193
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.730
five months done with now, um, you know, you just have to make a choice.

194
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.730
And I made that choice, you know, for myself, for my own health,

195
00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:05.730
for my daughter, for her future, for my fans, you know?

196
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.451
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

197
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:10.050
A bunch of people quit cigarettes cuz their Anthony Bordain quit cigarettes cuz

198
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:13.450
of his daughter too, just realized like, what am I doing? Yeah. I mean.

199
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.320
<v 1>For me, like my, my, my father passed away from cancer.</v>

200
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:21.320
All my uncles passed away from cancer and my father died when I was 11,

201
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.720
you know? So that was an experience, you know, for me, uh,

202
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.880
that kind of like traumatized me in such a way, but I can't, you know,

203
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.720
when I got older, I started to, you know,

204
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.080
do everything that my father was into. Like my dad smoked Newports.

205
00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:39.550
I started smoking Newport at 17, you know, my dad's, you know, he,

206
00:10:39.551 --> 00:10:44.390
he loved MGD Miller, genuine draft. I drank MGD Milligen draft. You know,

207
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.350
it was like a tribute to him. No,

208
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:50.510
I just kind of was becoming my dad in a weird way. And, and you know, it wasn't,

209
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.110
you know, it was like a, one of those things where, you know, I don't know,

210
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.620
I just kind of, I never really had a relationship with him.

211
00:10:57.621 --> 00:11:01.420
So the only memories I had was just this guy, like, you know,

212
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.740
like this guy that was just so cool.

213
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.980
He had his cigarette and he had his beer and he was always awesome.

214
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.660
And he was there for me as a man up until he left, you know? Uh,

215
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.860
and I think I kind of got caught up in that and that's something that like,

216
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:14.660
you know,

217
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.340
I can't say the image of my father drinking and smoking is what made me drink

218
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:19.570
his smoke, but I can't say it didn't.

219
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.370
<v 2>Right. Do you think you took like comfort in it? Maybe.</v>

220
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.490
<v 1>Like I think maybe, yeah. For sure.</v>

221
00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:28.210
I think everybody takes comfort in smoking cigarettes. It's like, you know,

222
00:11:28.211 --> 00:11:29.044
one of those things.

223
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.530
<v 2>Yeah. That's the, the,</v>

224
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:35.090
the grand trick that cigarettes pull on you that they give you comfort in that

225
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.410
need to replenish.

226
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.480
Like you give you a little stimula from the nicotine and all the chemicals that

227
00:11:40.481 --> 00:11:41.180
are in the cigarette.

228
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.920
And then you're so addicted to it that you have this weird stress when you don't

229
00:11:45.921 --> 00:11:49.400
have it. And then when you smoke it, ah, it relieves that stress.

230
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.840
And you think that it's actually calming you down,

231
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.720
but all it's doing is feeding the dragon. It's like a drug it's anything. Oh,

232
00:11:55.721 --> 00:11:56.680
it's a drug. Yeah.
