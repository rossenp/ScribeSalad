1
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 0>There's no video evidence of what hit the Pentagon.</v>

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:06.620
<v 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.480
there's a video of something I know there was one camera thing or a security

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:15.200
camera video that was released. But what they did have is all sorts of pizza,

5
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.740
pieces of aircraft, all over the lawn. I mean,

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.030
in a blown up building and a plane that's missing and all the people dead,

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.360
like I'm going to guess it was a plane. Yeah. You know, I just,

8
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:29.660
I think people look for conspiracies and everything cause it's exciting.

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.990
Stimulating there is.

10
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.430
<v 0>But then obviously B I know that you don't believe that everything we're told</v>

11
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.410
is the truth right away. Right. I mean,

12
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:43.070
if we go to something like a Gulf of Tonkin incident, right? I mean,

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.180
that's been proven to be false or the facts like the banana republics, right.

14
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.990
Where Dole asked us to go take out one of their dictators because they were

15
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:53.780
going to nationalize all the banana plants in that country. I mean,

16
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:58.100
those things have been now proven to be totally factual that the United States

17
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.860
government went and did that stuff. So the fact that, and you know,

18
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:05.630
in 1960s or seventies, those things were reported the opposite, right?

19
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:08.600
So we can't obviously take everything that we've been reported as truth.

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.880
<v 1>Well, there's definitely been conspiracies that have been put together</v>

21
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.130
and executed and these conspiracies have greatly affected the American people.

22
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.350
The Gulf of Tonkin is a perfect example.

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.010
Another one that they were planning on was operation Northwoods.

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.650
Operation Northwoods was one that they were planning on,

25
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:31.520
blowing up a drone jetliner and blaming it on the Cubans that were going to arm

26
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:33.890
Cuban friendlies, and have them attack Juan Tamo bay.

27
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:36.980
And they're going to sacrifice American troops and American lives.

28
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.730
And they're going to do this in order to get people to be excited about a war

29
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:44.330
with Cuba. This is a real thing that was signed by the joint chiefs of staff.

30
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:47.750
It was released by the freedom of information act and it was vetoed by Kennedy.

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.640
So we know that there were people,

32
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.260
at least in 1962 that were planning on like this. So that's a real thing.

33
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.980
And the idea that that just went away and no one does that anymore. It's crazy.

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.050
I don't, I don't believe that. I think there's,

35
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:04.850
there's most certainly evil people in all sectors of

36
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.540
life. Yes, absolutely. Yeah. So it's good to have an open mind,

37
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.930
but there's also a lot of conspiracy loons. It looked.

38
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.250
<v 0>For consumed with it.</v>

39
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:17.420
That's that's the issue is they get consumed with nothing that I've been told is

40
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:18.110
true,

41
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.470
which is obviously I said the one far end of the spectrum and anyone who's dead

42
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:23.300
end is crazy. Yeah. There's people.

43
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.620
<v 1>Out there that think the satellites are fake and they think that it's.</v>

44
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.980
<v 0>Not real. And then the earth is flat is the ones where I just shake my head,</v>

45
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.560
like the moon landing. One's my favorite. Really?

46
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.420
<v 1>I got balls deep in that for years I was complete completely.</v>

47
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.840
They did not go to the moon. No, I don't. I don't think that anymore,

48
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.200
but you know what I think now I think, I don't know. Um,

49
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.300
but I do think that it is one of the more fascinating conspiracies that between

50
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:51.800
1969 and 1972, they had 7, 7,

51
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.780
7 attempts, six of them successful,

52
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.650
but they went to the Apollo 13 was the one that they didn't apparently make it

53
00:02:57.651 --> 00:02:58.760
and they had to come back.

54
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.820
But that was the only time in history that a human being has been more than 400

55
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.930
miles above the surface, all the space station missions, all the space,

56
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.470
shuttle missions, all that stuff is, is.

57
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.760
<v 2>Within orbit. Yeah. It's low. That's.</v>

58
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.900
<v 1>All very low. They went 260,000 miles out and back in a deep space,</v>

59
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.560
but they had never even flown a chicken out there and see if it comes back

60
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:21.394
alive.

61
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 0>Yeah, no, I'm not into this, this space shovel.</v>

62
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.890
And so they did a couple of flybys.

63
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.870
<v 1>Went around the moon early, before they landed on the moon. Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.430
But other than that, I mean, without unmanned drones,

65
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:34.260
like what we have on Mars and things like that,

66
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:38.190
we've never really sent a living thing out through the magnetosphere,

67
00:03:38.191 --> 00:03:41.970
through the van Allen radiation belts into deep space. Have it, you know,

68
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:42.360
I mean,

69
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.630
th there's all these possibilities of solar flares and anything that would have

70
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:48.060
killed them instantly. And they just did that.

71
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.120
And then we haven't been able to do that since 19. Yeah. That's.

72
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.370
<v 0>The one way I I've never looked into the moon landing.</v>

73
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.870
I think it's kind of goofy. Right?

74
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.670
<v 1>Well, it's weird. It's a weird one.</v>

75
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.010
<v 0>Why have we never gone back? It's been 50.</v>

76
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.850
Surely our technology is far superior to what it was in 1969, right? Yeah.

77
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.560
<v 1>Technology is far superior,</v>

78
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:09.300
except that they're not using that technology for man space

79
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:12.510
travel into, you know, deep space like that and to go into the moon.

80
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:16.590
So it's like our technology and all these other areas is superior,

81
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:19.710
but they haven't really worked towards that because they haven't been funded.

82
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.790
So the big issue is in many ways it's money, right?

83
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:26.340
It's there's how much money is there and going to the moon.

84
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:29.460
And it's also very risky to send humans out there.

85
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.430
Maybe we're talking about manned missions to Mars now,

86
00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:35.400
which may or may not take place by 2030. They're talking about doing that,

87
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:39.330
but it's way cheaper and safer to send robots out there.

88
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.880
Like why risk human lives? Well, it's very.

89
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.780
<v 0>Robust on the moon. Right. And they put robots on Mars. Yeah. Yeah. The rovers.</v>

90
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.420
<v 1>On Mars or most, that's the most interesting because they're,</v>

91
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:54.090
they're sending these really high resolution photos of the surface of Mars and

92
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:57.270
they're running tests and checking for biological life. It's really,

93
00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:02.220
really interesting stuff. But between 69 and 72, when they did all this stuff,

94
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.220
I mean, there's the technology back then.

95
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.240
It was nothing compared to what they have now in terms of calculations and

96
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:14.190
computers. And, and it's also, there was a there's unquestionably,

97
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.140
some stuff that,

98
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.920
whether it was images or video that was faked.

99
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.930
And I think really, yeah.

100
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.270
<v 0>Like I said, I never looked into this at all. Gemini.</v>

101
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.330
<v 1>15 Is the big one because there's a photo of Michael Collins.</v>

102
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.690
It shows him in deep space and they,

103
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.680
they use it as a press release saying that he was on a spacewalk when it was

104
00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:38.190
really an image of him from a test run,

105
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.090
where there was all this stuff in the background and he was on his harness and

106
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:45.600
they just blacked out the background and tried to sell it as him being in space.

107
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.690
See if you find that my Michael Collins, I was looking.

108
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.240
<v 0>At how much it cost to send somebody to space. Oh, it's insane.</v>

109
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.850
70 million Ash, NASA Ash, not to fly on a Russian shuttle. What was that?

110
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.160
Private guys trying to sell tickets to places? I mean,

111
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.550
bayzos is trying to do it Musk obviously, but that space.

112
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.000
<v 1>That's just, that's just lower thrower, but that's,</v>

113
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:10.210
that's still inside 400 miles. None of them are trying to go anywhere. No. Well,

114
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:13.720
they might in the future Branson. Well, that's all same thing.

115
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.190
It's all way through. But, but,

116
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.600
but they are talking about future visits to the moon and to Mars.

117
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.300
But a lot of times I feel like when they say that, you know,

118
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.300
George Bush senior said that they were going to go to the moon,

119
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.260
back to the moon again and like one was that in 1990 or whatever the hell that

120
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:32.560
was. But people have always said, we're going to go back to the moon,

121
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:36.550
but we haven't been back since 1972. Does that mean that we never went? No,

122
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.350
but then it gets weird when you find out that Wernher Von Braun was a Nazi

123
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.620
who Wernher Von Braun, the guy who he was the head of NASA,

124
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.200
he was the guy who organized the moon landings.

125
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:49.870
And he was the head rocket guy.

126
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.670
<v 2>He was.</v>

127
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.670
<v 1>He, that guy was a legit Nazi,</v>

128
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.660
like he's wanted by the Simon Wiesenthal center said that he was alive today.

129
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.090
They would prosecute him for crimes against humanity.

130
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.860
They would hang the five slowest workers every day in front of his Berlin,

131
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.360
rocket factory. Oh yeah, no, a hundred percent. I mean, that's what they did.

132
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.440
The, the, what,

133
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.090
what they did was they took this thing was called operation paperclip, where,

134
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:18.250
when we won world war two,

135
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.600
they took all the top Nazi scientists and they secretly brought them over to

136
00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:26.170
America and they did it on the down low so that no one would think like, Hey,

137
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:31.090
why do we have a guy named Wernher Von Braun running the American space

138
00:07:31.091 --> 00:07:35.860
program because the, the Nazi scientists or insanely advanced. Hmm.

139
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.710
So the question is like, well, were they really Nazis?

140
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.160
Or were they scientists that were under the boot of the Nazi administration?

141
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.500
I mean, well, I don't know. I mean, not around that,

142
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:49.720
but I do know that these are the people that were the head engineers

143
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.280
and the people that designed it,

144
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.530
Werner Von Braun's himself was saying how impossible it was just years

145
00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:59.980
before they did the moon landing and years before operation paperclip,

146
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.370
that it was impossible to go to the moon or how ridiculously impossible would

147
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:03.670
be.

148
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.560
But technology advanced from then to when 1969 happened to when they

149
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:09.370
did it.

150
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.160
I stopped saying that we never went to the moon because I really don't know what

151
00:08:12.161 --> 00:08:15.700
the I'm talking about. And that's, that's a big part of understanding.

152
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:17.890
These conspiracies is hard. You have to, well,

153
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:21.610
you have to really know how much do I know about rocketry?

154
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.640
How much do I know about aerospace zero?

155
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.550
So if I'm running around saying I don't, I, you know,

156
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:28.750
I don't believe people went to the moon.

157
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.960
What is it based on it's based on mostly on ignorance,

158
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.000
speculation and the exciting,

159
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.290
the excited feeling that comes with trying to uncover a conspiracy.

160
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.770
<v 0>Sure. But, eh,</v>

161
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:43.600
I think you do have to be a little bit discerning on what you hear and,

162
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.270
but it is frustrating. And that's where a lot of these conspiracy guys,

163
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.350
they think they know more than they do because you have to come to the

164
00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:53.650
realization that you're probably never going to know the real answer with a lot

165
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:56.580
of these things. Very likely I, some of them come out many, many, many,

166
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:57.211
many years later,

167
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:00.780
we're talking about like Gulf of Tonkin writer or operation Northwest many years

168
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:02.550
later, it comes out. But you know,

169
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.460
there's a good likelihood that I'll never know the truth on stuff.

170
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.650
I read a lot about, I.

171
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.500
<v 1>Think with the moon landing, it's way more likely that we went to the moon,</v>

172
00:09:09.501 --> 00:09:11.180
but that some of the footage is fake.

173
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.020
And I think they probably did that because it's incredibly difficult to film

174
00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:15.860
things on the moon.

175
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.820
And I think they filmed some stuff in test runs and then tried to pass that

176
00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:20.750
stuff on.

177
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.520
They didn't have it back then they had these cameras that they had in the center

178
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.050
of their chest. I think.

179
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.730
<v 0>They would've been taking a selfie on the moon.</v>

180
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.650
They had the Snapchat Snapchat you'd have.

181
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.980
<v 1>To take your shoes off and then you would die. It was, yeah.</v>

182
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.650
They didn't have a camera that you could put in front of you. Maybe they.

183
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.110
<v 0>Have one of those clicker buttons. They could have what they're big gloves on.</v>

184
00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:39.920
And they, they, you know,

185
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.650
they put the thing out and then they click it and then boom, Snapchat,

186
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.050
wifi in the moon. That's what they said. Well.

187
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.730
<v 1>It was that they did it remotely.</v>

188
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:50.600
That's how they captured the video of the lunar module,

189
00:09:50.601 --> 00:09:52.180
leaving the surface of the moon,

190
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.750
panned up and watched it go that they did all that remotely. Hmm. It's all,

191
00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.160
there's some squirrely footage ever see the video of them jumping around.

192
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.720
It looks like they're on trampoline and see that like,

193
00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:05.060
they're just bouncing straight up in the air. You're like, well,

194
00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:09.080
what the is that? How come the physics are different in different flights?

195
00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:11.810
Like in some, some of the flights like Apollo 11,

196
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:13.460
they're barely getting off the ground. No one.

197
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.850
<v 0>Where they're like, they're walking, but they're kind of like that. Yeah.</v>

198
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.660
<v 1>Well there's ones like that. And then there's also ones where they fall down.</v>

199
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:22.520
It looks like they're getting yanked up by wires.

200
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.380
I think it's entirely possible that some of that stuff was fake, but I don't,

201
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.440
I think it's way more likely that they actually went to the moon than they

202
00:10:30.441 --> 00:10:34.940
didn't, but it's way sexier to think that they fake the whole thing. It's fun.

203
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.390
It's fun to think they fake the whole thing. And everybody was quiet about it.

204
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:39.021
And you know,

205
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:43.130
Neil Armstrong gave this real cryptic speech on the 25th anniversary of the moon

206
00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:47.510
mission saying that, you know, there are hidden truths, uh, that the, the, that,

207
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.560
uh, what, uh, what is the exact quote that he said? Um,

208
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.220
some of the great truths that could be real revealed,

209
00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.500
removing some of truths, hidden layers, like he was giving her away.

210
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.670
It was real cryptic. It was like, what? He's let's see if he could find it.

211
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.360
I got the video. Yeah, play the video. He might've been given it away. Well,

212
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:14.930
it seemed if you were conspiracy theory, this would give you a rock hard.

213
00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:16.903
Cause less than listen to them.

214
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.320
<v 3>Neil Armstrong leader, rare public appearance, next generation of taxpayers. We.</v>

215
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.200
<v 1>Have no, no, no, just play the whole thing. So you don't confuse everybody.</v>

216
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.230
<v 3>In 1994, Neil Armstrong,</v>

217
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.000
meta rare public appearance and held back tears as he spoke these brief cryptic

218
00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:36.680
remarks before the next generation of taxpayers, as they toured the white house.

219
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.950
<v 4>Today, we have with us,</v>

220
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.610
a group of students among America's best

221
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.700
to you. We say we have only completed a beginning.

222
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.760
We leave you much. That is undone.

223
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.940
There are great ideas,

224
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.050
undiscovered breakthroughs available to

225
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:07.360
those who can remove one of truths, protective layers.

226
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.090
<v 5>What the does that mean?</v>

227
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.380
<v 1>I mean, what are you supposed to say? Yo, I went to the moon.</v>

228
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.890
Yeah. It's supposed to say breakthroughs. He's given it away.

229
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:22.920
Protective layers. Like I don't even understand what that means.

230
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.220
The VIG co the press conference is one of the more fascinating things.

231
00:12:26.221 --> 00:12:27.810
If you watch the press conference again,

232
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.270
I was balls deep in this stuff for years,

233
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.060
the press conference from 1969,

234
00:12:33.061 --> 00:12:36.180
when they were turned from the moon is one of the most cryptic,

235
00:12:36.181 --> 00:12:37.770
weird things you'll ever see.

236
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.420
These guys look like they just stole something and they're being questioned.

237
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.770
It's it's, it's,

238
00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.990
I've never seen a video where people look like they're more full of than that

239
00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:53.250
video of the press conference from 1969. It's weird, man. It's weird.

240
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.870
They're like fidgety and looking nervous. Like they getting away with something.

241
00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:01.290
Then they might have done it. They might have, uh,

242
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.140
been forced to say some things that they didn't want to say.

243
00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.840
And that could be part of it. You know, they could have done it,

244
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.420
but there's a lot of weirdness with the moon landing.

245
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.800
It's it's if you wanted to have like a conspiracy,

246
00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:15.870
that to wrap your head around, it's exciting.

247
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.560
It's one of the best ones who benefits from it.

248
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.010
The United States government did because it showed military superiority over the

249
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.980
Russian. So we were able to do that, but also, you know,

250
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.750
it was the Nixon administration. People were just flat out full of. I mean,

251
00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:33.930
they were just lying to people left and right back then government though. Yeah.

252
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:37.230
But even more so then, cause it was unchecked. There was no media.

253
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.940
There's nothing that would expose them for this and this stuff.

254
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:46.170
They would air it on TV once in 1969. You never see it again.

255
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.690
Unless you watched it on film. There's no YouTube.

256
00:13:48.691 --> 00:13:52.350
We could go back and watch the astronauts on trampolines video.

257
00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.120
That's my favorite one. You watch that.

258
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.950
And you'll what in the is happening there.

259
00:13:55.951 --> 00:13:58.920
These guys are bouncing up in the air. Like how are they doing that?

260
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.620
Like they never did. If you watch Apollo 11,

261
00:14:01.621 --> 00:14:03.780
when they were moving around on the surface of the moon,

262
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.790
it just like they're moving in slow motion.

263
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.740
And then you go to whatever it was like Apollo 14 or 15 when they were doing the

264
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:14.130
trampoline thing, there's flying through the air. Have you seen it?

265
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.020
<v 0>I know I had never gotten to the moon thing. The flight what's this.</v>

266
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.890
<v 1>And like their feet are hidden. Look at this,</v>

267
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:24.990
watch these guys bounce up in the air. It's like,

268
00:14:24.991 --> 00:14:28.110
they're on some sort of wireless. They could be being yanked up into the air.

269
00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.690
Oh yeah. Like what the are they doing?

270
00:14:30.691 --> 00:14:34.860
And they're playing like falling down and it's very weird,

271
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.800
but it could have been that they were really on the moon and these guys were

272
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.910
Cowboys and yahoos and they wanted to bounce around.

273
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.420
<v 0>Oh, you were pacing. You're posting those videos. Post those videos.</v>

274
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.430
<v 1>I had a debate on Penn Jillette's radio show with, uh,</v>

275
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:54.410
a guy who an astronomer. And he wasn't willing to admit a lot of stuff.

276
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:57.260
That it was a fact like the fact that Wernher Von Braun was a Nazi.

277
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.600
<v 0>The fly looks, I still there. Well.</v>

278
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.370
<v 1>The flag had a wire, first of all,</v>

279
00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:03.560
on the top of it that stiffened it up to make it.

280
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.840
But there was there's videos of the flag moving in a non-existent breeze,

281
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:10.640
which is weird too. And there's,

282
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.290
they try to make some logical explanations for why the flag could be moving in a

283
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:17.360
vacuum. And some of it makes sense,

284
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:21.560
but some of it doesn't like the wires. One is weird.

285
00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:26.060
If you watch them fall down, like go to that one right there. Jamie, you like,

286
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.320
if you watch, like sometimes they're falling down and when they're falling down,

287
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:31.910
it looks like they get yanked back up.

288
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.270
But I think it might not have been real footage.

289
00:15:35.271 --> 00:15:38.480
What they might've done is used some test footage,

290
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.430
like right there at Jamie right there. Let it go.

291
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.330
Like homeboy falls down and then it looks like he is yanked back up.

292
00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:49.000
<v 0>Oh, he did not want him standing up. What is this? That's not him standing up.</v>

293
00:15:49.001 --> 00:15:49.810
You can't stand up like.

294
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.950
<v 1>That. But you're on the moon. Now you realize you're on one six Earth's gravity.</v>

295
00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:54.340
But.

296
00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.130
<v 0>There was no, there was nothing to make him go like this. Right.</v>

297
00:15:57.131 --> 00:15:58.390
You can't get up without him.

298
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.830
Now we go back to MMA because that's what these freaking folkstyle wrestling is.

299
00:16:02.831 --> 00:16:06.640
The next generation of MMA turn to your base to get up.

300
00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.740
You can't look at it. There's nothing on the ground.

301
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.060
How's he going to get them a Mexican, the.

302
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.050
<v 1>Yanked up? Like he would have super abs. He would have to be like dancer.</v>

303
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.380
<v 0>Okay. Maybe a break dancer, maybe a break dancer.</v>

304
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.660
<v 6>But you can't get up without putting a base down, right? Yeah.</v>

305
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.390
<v 0>Yeah. That was really weird. I didn't.</v>

306
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.060
<v 1>Watch it again. Watch him get yanked up.</v>

307
00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.410
<v 0>He's got no base. Yeah.</v>

308
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.720
It almost seems like that little piece has played in reverse.

309
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:33.120
Almost does it almost does. Yeah. That he couldn't stand up.

310
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.010
<v 1>But the thing falls down right afterwards. So it wasn't reversed.</v>

311
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.090
I think it's entirely possible that some of the footage was,

312
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.180
but it doesn't mean that they didn't go to the moon. Yeah.

313
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.840
It means that overzealous people in here.

314
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.240
<v 0>Put on the ground there too, right? Yeah. Well, that's true. Look at this watch.</v>

315
00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:49.870
So he stood.

316
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.180
<v 6>Up like, that's ridiculous. You can't do it. What.</v>

317
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:52.870
<v 1>Is rifle?</v>

318
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.160
His dad's left foot's up and he just goes straight up the air and that's fake,

319
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.710
but I've never been in one six earth gravity.

320
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.170
<v 0>Neither of you. No fake dude.</v>

321
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:08.650
<v 6>That says we never went to the moon. That video is fake.</v>

322
00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:10.800
<v 1>Now the video was real. That's from television.</v>

323
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.550
<v 0>The video, that guy standing up like that, he got helps on that.</v>

324
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.380
Can't stand up like that very well.

325
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.700
<v 1>He could have been on wires.</v>

326
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.720
It could have been that they were using that to simulate what it would be like.

327
00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:25.930
Cause they definitely filmed a lot of simulations.

328
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.540
They did a lot of that because they wanted to prepare the astronauts.

329
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.220
It's entirely possible that some of those simulations got passed off as being an

330
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.240
actual video of them on the moon. Sure. Yeah. Fair enough. Or the fake,

331
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:39.190
the whole thing. I wasn't there.
