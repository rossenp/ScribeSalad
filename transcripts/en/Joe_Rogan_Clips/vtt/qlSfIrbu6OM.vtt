00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.030
<v 2>One of the things that happened to me, um,</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.560
as a result of like traveling all over the world is that I met this

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.880
schizophrenia researcher. Um, his name is Paul Fletcher,

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.970
he's at Cambridge. Um,

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.480
and he wanted to experience like schizophrenia.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.400
He's treating these people and he wanted to really know because of this

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.300
critique that you just laid out. And, um,

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.100
he's the only person who I know in that area. Who's done this, you know? So he,

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.590
he did like ketamine to try and reproduce the experience because he heard

11
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:43.980
that that was like reproducing the would reproduce the experience.

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.170
Of course it doesn't. Uh,

13
00:00:46.171 --> 00:00:51.060
but this is what people have said are animal models use ketamine

14
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.610
for that reason, but it doesn't. Um,

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.320
but he was curious enough to try to figure out what

16
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:01.440
schizophrenia people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia.

17
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.440
He tried to figure out what they were experiencing.

18
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.630
<v 0>Um, I don't know if he figured that out, uh,</v>

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.510
from this sort of experiential perspective,

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.160
but what I do know is that if I ever had a relative who had

21
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.780
schizophrenia, I would send them to Paul Fletcher, um,

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.900
because his perspective on it, uh, I,

23
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:29.730
it really respects the person who's has this diagnoses

24
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.320
and, uh,

25
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
it offers them the greatest amount of hope that I have seen

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.230
in that area.

27
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.330
And it would be good if other scientists in these

28
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:44.580
areas, drugs, whatever it is,

29
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.830
what also seek to try to figure out the experience that their paper,

30
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.950
their patients are going through. Yeah.

31
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.820
<v 1>It'd be almost like learning martial arts without ever sparring. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.140
<v 0>Yeah. Or coaching basketball without.</v>

33
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.290
<v 1>Yeah. Under pressure. Do you, is there anything that mimics schizophrenia that,</v>

34
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.390
that, that someone, is there a,

35
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:13.200
like a commonly thought of substance that mimics schizophrenia?

36
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.590
<v 0>Um, they have suggested large doses of</v>

37
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:23.610
amphetamines over periods of time with sleep

38
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:27.570
deprivation can member paranoid schizophrenia,

39
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:32.070
but I don't know if it really does. I mean, all of this stuff, uh,

40
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.030
I am now questioning, so I, I don't know. I mean, at one time,

41
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.790
if you would ask me that question, maybe five years ago,

42
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:41.760
I would have said amphetamines, but I don't know. Now.

43
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.260
<v 1>It's a pretty, he's an odd one to right.</v>

44
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:46.800
Cause doesn't it affect somewhere in the neighborhood of 1% of the population.

45
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.050
<v 0>A lot of people it's a lot of people. Um, uh,</v>

46
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.280
but I have a lot more hope about schizophrenia at the having met

47
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:00.760
Paul Fletcher, just in terms of, um, uh,

48
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.020
I don't want to bastardize his sort of model of thinking about it.

49
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:08.380
And so I may not have all the details. Right. But I'll just say,

50
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.840
just simply try and explain them, like you and I, we go through the world,

51
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.950
everybody, we have these theories about how the world work. So like, um,

52
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.840
like you smile, I have a theory about what that means,

53
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.550
right? And so, uh, oh, Joe likes me or he's happy today,

54
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:31.210
whatever. And then I'm right, because you tell me that whatever,

55
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.910
somebody who's diagnosed with schizophrenia,

56
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.100
they also have these models that they're testing out.

57
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.020
And so their model might be like a use when you smile.

58
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.610
They think that you're angry or whatever, uh, and you're plotting against them.

59
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.780
Yes. And their model is just wrong. I mean, it's just like,

60
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.930
they're just getting, they just have, uh, they're bumping,

61
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.060
bumping up against, uh, these wrong answers. And then when they get,

62
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.060
they get more wrong answers, it's even,

63
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.830
it causes even more stress and that's very anxiety provoking.

64
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.040
And then all of that is playing into this. It's like, first of all,

65
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:13.480
your models are off and now you're just getting this increased anxiety.

66
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.500
And so I think that's how his model sees it. So that,

67
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:20.020
that means that it's okay.

68
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.060
As long as we let people understand that don't worry if

69
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.060
your model is getting it wrong. Um,

70
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.740
it doesn't mean that that something's wrong with you. It could be, um,

71
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.390
maybe we are good, we have it wrong in our society.

72
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:42.220
And you have, you might have a better way of thinking about this. So it's like,

73
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.290
as opposed to it being one way that might be multiple ways of thinking about

74
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:52.210
these, these solving, these problems that humans solve throughout their day.

75
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.710
Uh, then that's how, uh, I think that's how he thinks of it.

76
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.620
Um, and it's, uh, it's a, it's a model of hope for me because,

77
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.270
um,

78
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.070
you lessen the anxiety among the patients and many

79
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.110
of the much of the problems deals,

80
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:15.340
what does anxiety of people telling them that they're incompetent and you know

81
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.410
how that is, how that feels. That's an adult,

82
00:05:17.411 --> 00:05:20.290
somebody telling you that you're incompetent. It's like,

83
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:21.340
how can you tell me I'm co.

84
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.600
<v 1>I mean, competent.</v>

85
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.410
So it exacerbates whatever problems initially have it makes them far worse.

86
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.960
Exactly. Yeah. There's also a thing that seems to have,

87
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.270
I've only know a few people that are schizophrenia,

88
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.170
but it's a disturbing thing when they think that everybody's against them and

89
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:36.280
they feel like they're on their own,

90
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.480
but by virtue of everyone being against them, they feel, they feel isolated.

91
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.420
Yes. And then there, whatever paranoia they have,

92
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:46.300
it's like throwing dry sticks on it,

93
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.750
just rages into a fire and it gets even worse.

94
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.510
Cause they think that people are plotting against them and everyone's against

95
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:56.890
them and they don't have anybody comforting them. Yes. And we need,

96
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.120
we all need that. Absolutely. You know,

97
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.860
and I think particularly people with like a slippery version of reality

98
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.260
probably need that more than most. Yeah.

99
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.940
<v 0>When you say reality,</v>

100
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.940
it might be multiple realities and that's the thing that we need people to

101
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:18.350
understand or that it's like it's okay. Um, uh,

102
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.370
it might be, your reality just might be different from theirs,

103
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.620
but not to the point where you have a different reality and that you're allowed

104
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:28.960
to abuse people. Not.

105
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.780
So I want to be clear cause I know there are some people out here saying

106
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.150
something about alternative facts, not,

107
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.120
I don't mean it like where you manipulate people. I mean, it,

108
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.050
for people who are struggling, uh, like these people with schizophrenia,

109
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.650
um, just to help lessen their anxiety.

110
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.570
<v 1>Yeah. So with, in terms of marijuana, particularly like high doses of marijuana,</v>

111
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.900
um,

112
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.850
particularly edible marijuana could really seriously exacerbate someone who has

113
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.470
it. Who's kind of hanging on barely anyway. And then boom, you eat an edible.

114
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.333
Absolutely. You're.

115
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.530
So someone like Alex would say that person's schizophrenia was brought on by

116
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:10.010
marijuana. Whereas I think you and I would probably agree.

117
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:13.850
They were more likely inclined towards schizophrenia anyway.

118
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.290
And the high dose of marijuana pushed them over there. And then, you know,

119
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:19.124
every.

120
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.920
<v 0>All the evidence says what you just said. I mean,</v>

121
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:25.670
so when you look at the evidence where people have done all of these studies,

122
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.490
um, folks who didn't have these predispositions, um,

123
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.320
the marijuana didn't, uh,

124
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.300
doesn't cause people to be schizophrenia or have a psychotic disorder.

125
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.190
Um, but it certainly can precipitate, um,

126
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.060
or exacerbate, um, um, um,

127
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.900
psychosis in people who are pre-exposed pre predisposed.

128
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.610
<v 1>So what I was going to get to was,</v>

129
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:56.840
do you think that maybe for people that have this

130
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.660
predisposition towards schizophrenia,

131
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:04.340
they should probably avoid psychoactive substances were avoid

132
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:08.180
something that radically perturbs their version of reality.

133
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.520
<v 0>They probably should avoid cannabis. Right. Um,</v>

134
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.900
I don't want to say avoid everything because, um,

135
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.220
um.

136
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.053
<v 1>Is there anything.</v>

137
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.470
<v 0>I mean, so like.</v>

138
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.470
<v 1>Could maybe use that maybe would.</v>

139
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.340
<v 0>Help them. Yeah.</v>

140
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:29.600
So I spent a little time working in an heroine clinic in Geneva

141
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.850
and so they give out heroin to these patients twice a day. How do they,

142
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.890
every day intravenous or oral, however the patient wants it. Uh,

143
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.720
but a lot of intravenous heroin users. Um, and it's all, you know,

144
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.790
sanitize setting,

145
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:50.420
hospital setting or clinic setting twice a day.

146
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.510
Many of these people, um,

147
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.120
have psychotic disorders like diagnosed with

148
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.250
schizophrenia and heroin helps me.

149
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:06.960
Yeah. When many of these symptoms and they feel better, um,

150
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.520
even more so in some cases than anti-psychotic uh,

151
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.990
yeah. I talk about this in the new book, in fact, but yeah, this is, uh,

152
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.100
so I don't want to have this blanket statement that they should avoid

153
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.260
psychoactive substances because some might actually be helpful.

154
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.510
Um, and um, some other people have tried other drugs.

155
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.360
Um, one, uh, psychiatrist in the Netherlands, uh,

156
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.920
gave his patients in fettuccine and he swears that it works.

157
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:46.440
Um, but that has to be, um, well researched out, but,

158
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.290
uh, we'll see, but I, I know cannabis for sure. Uh, I wouldn't do that.

159
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.640
<v 1>You wouldn't do cannabis and perhaps maybe not high levels of amphetamines as</v>

160
00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:57.720
well, either because.

161
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:03.000
<v 0>I don't know, I will, I would have to, um, um,</v>

162
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.070
slowly titrate and see whether or not it worked or whether or not people feel

163
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:08.904
better.
