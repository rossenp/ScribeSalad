00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.543
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.990
<v 0>Either. He's feeding videos of guys that like they like it and can see that.</v>

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.000
I mean, they really get kicked in the balls,

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.180
like hard stop by from that guys,

6
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:16.500
get their balls stomped with stilettos. That's a really common thing. Like,

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.390
ah, ah, stopped, uh, guys lose testicles.

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.470
I know a guy who lost the Tesco cause he got kicked and he didn't have a cup on.

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.440
And he was sparring just like, he's like, I'll do one more round.

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.540
So he spars and he gets slammed in the sack with a shin and his testicle

11
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.750
burst burst.

12
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.700
And these guys are just lending some chicks, stomp on them with a stiletto heel.

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.593
Yeah.

14
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.880
<v 1>I was around with Dave Vata one time when I was in like 10th grade and we were</v>

15
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:54.300
wrestling around and he reached down and grabbed my balls really hard and squoze

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.310
them like a night. He was a little bit of a nut.

17
00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.720
And I remember laying on the ground for like 10 minutes being in like the most

18
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:02.490
severe pain I've ever been in in my life.

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.690
<v 0>Dude. I thought it was sterile for a long time.</v>

20
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.160
Cause he getting kicked in the balls.

21
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.600
I been kicked in the balls at least a hundred times hard

22
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.430
by black belts. Like I've been kicked in the balls dude,

23
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.230
like many, many.

24
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.430
<v 1>Many. Are they trying to.</v>

25
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.010
<v 0>Kick you in the balls? No, no you clash. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
Like say if you're throwing a kick with your right leg and I'm throwing a kick

27
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:29.940
with my right leg and we throw them at the same time and you just were moving

28
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:32.610
weird, sometimes it just goes right into the sack. Yeah.

29
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.700
Sometimes a kick will deflect, you know,

30
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:40.260
like someone will be hitting you and you're trying to hit them in the

31
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:40.980
chest,

32
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.840
but inadvertently they catch part of your leg and it redirects it

33
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.040
right towards their balls.

34
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.080
<v 1>Cups. Don't really cover your.</v>

35
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.970
<v 0>Balls. That's the, they do new ones do. And they also there's a new, well,</v>

36
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:57.120
there's a company called diamond MMA and I wear their cup when I do jujitsu.

37
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.920
And it's a compression short with all these straps built in and it's cup that

38
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.420
it's got like a, a, like a more flexible foam, rubber,

39
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.460
rubber on the outside. And then a very hard rubber that covers the, uh,

40
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.870
like the outside edge,

41
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:17.490
rather a very hard rubber that covers like the sack and the, and the deck.

42
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.410
And then it fits very snugly to your body. And you can,

43
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.620
you can get kicked in the balls pretty hard. But yeah, it's a,

44
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:28.830
it's a giant improvement. Yeah. But when I was a kid, we didn't have that.

45
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.640
We had a cup that slid into a jockstrap and a barely held in place.

46
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.600
And one time I was in a tournament and I got kicked in the balls. So,

47
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.550
I was pretty sure this guy did it on purpose. Uh, he was, he was at mean, this.

48
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.610
I was fighting this Korean dude. He was very good and very mean,

49
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.030
and I'm pretty sure he kicked me in the balls on purpose because I punched him

50
00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.390
in the face on purpose right afterwards. Yeah. I was pretty sure. Yeah. Um,

51
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.160
but uh, my ball, my cup slammed into my ball. So the,

52
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.640
the cup did worse than protect me. Then not protect me.

53
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.180
It actually became a weapon against my ball. Right?

54
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.840
So the cup slammed into my ball. My ball swole up.

55
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.170
It was awful. It was. So it was what were those.

56
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 1>Cups protecting pretty much your shaft, but not your ball.</v>

57
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.920
<v 0>They do protect your balls a little bit. Under the ideal circumstances.</v>

58
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.100
Like something comes at it straight on and it hits the cup.

59
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.580
It's way better than hit the cup than it is to hit your balls by themselves.

60
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:26.440
It's definitely better. But.

61
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.700
<v 1>Take a bicycle.</v>

62
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.120
<v 0>Helmet.</v>

63
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.840
They made a TaeKwonDo cups that we used to wear on the outside that were even

64
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:34.750
better because you'd wear them. Uh, you'd have your, uh,

65
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.810
your pants on your like, uh, your geeky pants.

66
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.460
And then you would put the cup on over the pants.

67
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.670
And it was, they were like more sturdy and they would tie on,

68
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.640
they would hold them in place and it was a little more material there.

69
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:53.020
So it was like, it would cover your, your junk better. Yeah. But still

70
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.180
sack is it's. It's a terrible design. It is a bad.

71
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.770
<v 1>Design, dangling and midair.</v>

72
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.850
Just waiting to be heard. You ever sit on your ball?

73
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.080
<v 0>Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You ever cut your Dick in a zipper? No.</v>

74
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.720
<v 1>Never. No. Oh my God.</v>

75
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.160
<v 0>We're underwear. I've just done it.</v>

76
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:14.440
I have to go and commando before and call my Dick and his zipper. Yeah.

77
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.363
It's like.

78
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.793
<v 1>The crown.</v>

79
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.640
<v 0>No, the shaft somewhere in the side of the shaft.</v>

80
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.280
I caught it in the zipper. It was, it was bleeding.

81
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.010
<v 1>Oh, no sex for a while.</v>

82
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.550
<v 0>After that, because then you have to explain. Yeah. Like what's on your Dick.</v>

83
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.830
Oh, caught it in the zipper. He'll liar. You lie.

84
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.750
You're going to give me a disease. Just such a piece of.

85
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.010
<v 1>That's why they invented. But button fly.</v>

86
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.750
<v 0>Yeah, probably right. Yeah. I think button fly was first, but is it? Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.120
I think the old device, I think they were all button fly.

88
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.490
They hadn't figured out zippers yet. Like zippers,

89
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.610
like A-list guess when do you think they invented the zipper?

90
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.640
I want to say like the 18 hundreds.

91
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.930
<v 1>Yeah. I think the, I thought the original Levi jeans had zippers.</v>

92
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.793
Don't think so.

93
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.030
<v 0>I think they were originally.</v>

94
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.720
I think that's why they call them the original button fly. Yeah. Right.

95
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.070
Like five. Oh, one's original 5 0 1 jeans. Yeah. Button flies.

96
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.050
<v 1>I remember dry humping. I was a dry Humper in junior high school, man.</v>

97
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.830
Dude, I would go all night. I would get it. I, I was, I was gifted and you know,

98
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:28.420
you G you try to get your, right, right in the middle there. Right in the spot.

99
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.230
And then, uh, I was perfect. And I remember one time getting a scab.

100
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.050
I got so raw. I had a scab on it.

101
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.020
<v 0>Jesus. Yeah. Did you nut from dry humping?</v>

102
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.370
<v 1>A couple of times, but I was pretty restrained.</v>

103
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.440
<v 0>Well, you got to, if you dry hump the right way to do it is uh,</v>

104
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.310
with silk pajamas. Oh no underwear. Nice.

105
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.450
Right? You see guys, you could go back in time. I would talk to my old self.

106
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.703
Hey, Dick head.

107
00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:59.533
<v 1>You're going to get some.</v>

108
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.023
<v 0>Corduroys.</v>

109
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.980
<v 1>You're showing up at some girl's house. She's in eighth grade.</v>

110
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.890
Dad answers the door. Why are you wearing silk, silk?

111
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.530
<v 0>Uh, I'm just really into, uh,</v>

112
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.330
so I'm reading a lot about trade China.

113
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.600
<v 1>Is that rain here. She comes down with it.</v>

114
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.500
<v 0>You wear an underwear. You piece of. What? Huh? You think I'm stupid?</v>

115
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.250
I'm married. I have children. All right. I've had sex. You little.

116
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.990
I know what you're doing. You want to dry hump? My kid, huh?

117
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.000
<v 1>Ooh. She comes down and she's wearing silk pajamas. The is going on here.</v>

118
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.600
<v 0>The.</v>

119
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.420
<v 1>Way dry humping, man.</v>

120
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.600
<v 0>The good old days. Remember you grab a. You were so happy.</v>

121
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.580
I can't believe I'm holding a tit.

122
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.290
<v 1>Outside the shirt. I was.</v>

123
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.190
<v 0>Outrageous. Yeah. You were so happy.</v>

124
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:57.800
Like this is so much better than not holding a tit. Yeah.

125
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.540
This is as good as it gets.

126
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.800
<v 1>And then if you, if you were a girl, I felt bad for girls back then.</v>

127
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:06.890
Because how annoying would it be? That somebody is just grabbing.

128
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.740
<v 0>The, what we're talking about. Call me right now.</v>

129
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.820
<v 1>That you just grabbing their tit and you can't stop. Like you're,</v>

130
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.960
she's got her Bron.

131
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:19.940
You wedged your hand under her bra and you just grabbing. Just squeezing.

132
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.130
Yeah. That's not pleasurable for her. No.

133
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.420
<v 0>No, definitely not. But they did it.</v>

134
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.620
Maybe she did like it. Maybe it's just like the fact she's naughty. Yeah. So,

135
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.520
no.

136
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.410
<v 1>I couldn't fathom that girls were enjoying fooling around for a long</v>

137
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:39.290
time. I really thought that they were just being nice to.

138
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.550
<v 0>I couldn't imagine the girls like boys, like why do you even like me? Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.480
Like why do you like boys? Boys are so gross. Yeah. You know,

140
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:50.270
I remember being a kid thinking that, man,

141
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.610
I'm so happy. The girls like boys, but I don't understand it. Like,

142
00:07:55.611 --> 00:07:57.980
it doesn't make sense. Like why would they like us?

143
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.450
Like it's we don't have any of the good things that they have. Yeah.

144
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.400
They have tents that they get wet.

145
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.280
<v 1>They were ready, were dirty.</v>

146
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.020
<v 0>And gross. They were makeup. We don't that we're gross. We're stupid.</v>

147
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.390
And we're dumb as. And we are dumber too.

148
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.550
Like the whole process of men developing and getting testosterone and going

149
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:21.920
through the whole cycle of adulthood.

150
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.200
It's just the fact that women mature quicker. They're smarter at an earlier age.

151
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.580
So when you're 15,

152
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.150
you got to have a 14 year old girlfriend because you have 15 year old

153
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:36.770
girlfriend. She's like you idiot. Got to get someone smarter.

154
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.740
Yeah. If I get someone smarter, like if you're, if you like,

155
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:43.820
how many guys who are 18 have a 17 year old girlfriend. A lot. Yup. Yeah.

156
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.810
But how many guys who are 18 have a 19 year old girlfriend, 19 year old girls.

157
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:50.420
Don't want to have anything to do with an 18 year old moron. Now,

158
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:54.080
now they're smarter already. They're looking for a 22 year old. Yep.

159
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.950
<v 1>No, it's so true. Like my daughter said that she's like, I can't.</v>

160
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:04.020
<v 0>She goes, I can't even talk to guys my age. She just wants a couple of ages.</v>

161
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.250
They're smarter. Yeah.

162
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.310
They don't have to go through that whole testosterone thing.

163
00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.910
Just all you're thinking about is getting rid of loads. Yeah.

164
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.180
It's you're barely thinking about anything else studying school.

165
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.600
<v 1>Oh, I know Jesus.</v>

166
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.940
Oh yeah.

167
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:25.740
It was pretty much playing sports and having an orgasm. That was,

168
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.923
that was.

169
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.280
<v 0>Yes. And as soon as you found out about orgasms sports, took a back seat.</v>

170
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.890
A big back seat. Yeah. I used to do a bit about that. My dad's like, Hey,

171
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:37.290
how come you're not playing baseball anymore? Yeah.

172
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.730
I found this new thing and uh, I'm way better at this. I like it more.

173
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.863
It's more fun.

174
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.110
<v 1>I always win.</v>

175
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.140
<v 0>Every game. Every time you come you in. Yay.</v>
