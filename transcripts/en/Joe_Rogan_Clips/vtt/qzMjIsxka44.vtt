WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.070
We should fill people in on exactly what we're talking about.

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.420
So we're talking about a skeleton that was discovered that is 1.2 million years

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.180
older than Lucy. So yeah.

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.420
<v 1>The skeleton is, yeah, it's 4.4 million years old.</v>

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.370
The oldest known.

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.680
<v 0>Human relative. Uh.</v>

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.180
<v 1>Well, it's the oldest known skeleton that actually this is an okay distinction I</v>

9
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:27.560
should make. So, like I said before, skeletons are rare. Um,

10
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.280
this is the oldest skeleton. There are, uh,

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.890
three other members of the human family that are, uh,

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.180
older, but the thing is, they're much more fragmentary.

13
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:43.730
They're not anywhere near as complete. Like there's one,

14
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.380
another one from Ethiopia found by the same team that found the skeleton we're

15
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:53.150
talking about. Um, that's, you know, some, some teeth, you know,

16
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.030
like a towboat and a few other broken elements of the skeleton.

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.800
And there's another thing, uh, another species called Aurora or from Kenya,

18
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:03.080
which is about 6 million years old, again, you know,

19
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:07.670
much more fragmentary and teeth. I think they got a couple, um, thigh bones,

20
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.540
partial thigh bones.

21
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.680
And then there's a skull from Chad called style Anthropocene.

22
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.950
That's about, uh, 6 million, maybe seven years old,

23
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:19.610
depending on whose dating you believe. Uh, and that's, that's a very nice skull,

24
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.650
but it's a head without body. So, um, so, so anyway,

25
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.110
so there are, uh, people sometimes get confused by that.

26
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:31.400
So Hardy is indeed the oldest skeleton it's by far more complete than this other

27
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:35.300
stuff. Uh, but, uh, there are some, you know,

28
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.840
fragmentary things that are older and they all become part of the story too.

29
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.650
What is.

30
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.620
<v 0>The, what is the scientific controversy? Do you think it's,</v>

31
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.200
is it based on real skepticism or

32
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.790
it is ego involved in this? Like you're laughing.

33
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.030
<v 2>What are you talking about, man?</v>

34
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.400
<v 0>A lot of egos involved in science, unfortunately. Right. There's a lot of egos.</v>

35
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.830
<v 1>There's a lot of disbelief, uh, because the,</v>

36
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.480
the skeleton was so surprising in a lot of ways.

37
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.800
And so contrary to the predictions that many

38
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.000
people in science had made, that there was a kind of like a, you know,

39
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:23.030
a head exploded for a lot of people, you can.

40
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.110
<v 0>Break down those particular things that are different than what was expected.</v>

41
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:28.880
Right. First of all, we walked up. Right?

42
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.130
<v 1>Yeah. So it, it, it walked up, right. So it's primitive. I mean, if you saw it,</v>

43
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.510
you know, if we could go back at a time machine and look at it, you know, this,

44
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.900
this thing that the species name is Ardipithecus reminisce,

45
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.950
that's kind of a mouthful,

46
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:47.840
but RD is the individual skeleton that they found is that's,

47
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.270
you know, the individual like, like you're Joe,

48
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.420
you're the individual and your species is homo sapiens.

49
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.200
So that's how you think about this Arctic, the Ramadan species already,

50
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.210
the individual skeleton. So, um, uh,

51
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.990
so the interesting revelations with it is it has upright posture,

52
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.200
so it's standing upright, but it's still got the opposable toe.

53
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.090
So this is a creature that was in the trees, um, you know,

54
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.690
clearly climbing, but it also, uh, you know,

55
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.460
appears to be upright, uh, walking with this opposable tope. So it, it seemed,

56
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.390
it, you know, everyone knows that sometime deep in the human past,

57
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.860
there was some kind of a boil ancestor, you know, some kind of ape, but,

58
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.320
you know, the question has always been, what, what,

59
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.440
what kind of Abe does it looked like a modern ape or does it look like,

60
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.790
you know, something we've never seen before? And, um,

61
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.440
uh,

62
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.580
so the surprising thing about already is it's actually quite different than the

63
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:50.200
living apes. Um, so it, yeah, so it's got this opposable toe walks up,

64
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:52.680
right. Are there, are there proportions.

65
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.590
<v 0>When chimps have shorter legs and they have arms,</v>

66
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.290
are these proportions similar to that?

67
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.780
<v 3>Uh, don't already.</v>

68
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.670
<v 1>I mean, it's certainly more ape-like than, than, than, than any of us.</v>

69
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.960
Uh, but it's, uh, there's a couple of interesting things about its proportion.

70
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:14.040
So all the other living apes have longer arms than they do legs,

71
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.030
or they spend a lot of time climbing. That's, you know, that's long arms long,

72
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.770
and they have, you know, the different proportions,

73
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:20.790
but they all had that in common.

74
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.170
They got longer forelimbs than Highlands RD was a big surprise

75
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.760
because it actually had longer legs than forelimbs. I mean, you know, it,

76
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:34.080
it definitely has bigger hands as longer arms than we do, but, uh,

77
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.580
you know, that was a surprise, at least to me.

78
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:42.090
And I think that'd be some of the researchers. Um, and you know,

79
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.640
I was talking before about these kind of, um,

80
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.210
surprises that appear after the fact, well, that,

81
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.390
that was one because the bones are broken. You know,

82
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.610
these guys on this research team, it's called the,

83
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.750
the middle of the squash research project. Um, they spent a lot of time,

84
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:00.810
you know, reconstructing this and then estimating, you know, how,

85
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.290
what are the length? So the pieces that are not there and then, you know,

86
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.610
run all kinds of regressions and a lot of calculations and stuff. But, uh,

87
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.840
so that revelation was sort of a delayed,

88
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.700
you know, delayed bombshell, if you will, that it actually had, uh, Islam,

89
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:20.070
proportions of that were more like a bypass.

90
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.960
<v 0>Um, and so, uh, ours, our legs are longer,</v>

91
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.330
chimps have longer arms. So is this like, does it have almost equal length,

92
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.110
arms and legs? Like, can we actually just put a photo of it up here?

93
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.690
I'm getting a chance to take a look at, oh, it's fascinating.

94
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.480
So it has long legs, almost like a person,

95
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.410
but longer arms than we do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

96
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.800
<v 1>Longer arms than we do for sure. I think, uh, I don't remember the exact name,</v>

97
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:51.780
but I think the calculation they did it was the legs are, um, uh,

98
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.990
oh, I think, I think the arm, yeah.

99
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.150
I want to say it's like nine 90 something percent,

100
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.030
so it's pretty close to one-to-one um, of, uh,

101
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.800
length, but indeed the, the arms are, uh, a bit shorter.

102
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.360
So the.

103
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.220
<v 0>Surprising part was that it didn't walk at all and its knuckles being th that it</v>

104
00:06:12.221 --> 00:06:14.170
was that old. Uh.

105
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.560
<v 1>Yeah. So, so the, okay,</v>

106
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:21.640
so humans are, we come from the African apes.

107
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.560
That's pretty clear from genetics. That's been clear for a long time. Um,

108
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.010
there are two bank groups of African apes there's, uh,

109
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.620
gorillas and there's chips.

110
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.340
Now within those and shifts also includes this other species you might've heard

111
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:39.140
of called Bonobos. And then within those there's like debate about, you know,

112
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.740
should we divide them into some subspecies and stuff, but you know,

113
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:43.570
I don't worry about that for now, but anyway,

114
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:46.300
what they all have in common is they knock a walk.

115
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.900
So they got these long fingers and when they walk, you know, I mean,

116
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.160
they do this. I mean, if you look at a video sometime you'll see it. And,

117
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.620
um, you know, because our two closest cousins both do that,

118
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.910
you know, there was a perfectly plausible theories that, um,

119
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.020
human ancestors did it well. So we evolved from a knuckle walking ancestor.

120
00:07:08.021 --> 00:07:12.370
I mean, there was even a cover story in nature that, that the title,

121
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.290
the headline was almost that, you know,

122
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:18.940
humans evolved from a knuckle walking ancestor. Uh, so, um, yeah,

123
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:21.340
so that was, that was the theory. And then, so here with already,

124
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:24.040
we have a creature that's, you know, it's, it's,

125
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.960
it's not the last common ancestor with the African

126
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:30.820
apes, but it's, it's, it's certainly getting closer.

127
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:35.110
It's getting a big step closer. And, uh, the people, you know,

128
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.770
the anatomists who specialize in these things say that there's like,

129
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.540
no hint of knuckle walking, not, not only was it not knuckle walking, uh,

130
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.890
to get around,

131
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.390
but also it has no vestige of a knuckle walking

132
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:51.130
ancestry. So in other words,

133
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.960
there's no like residual anatomy that would suggest that.

134
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.880
<v 0>Yeah. So it was bipedal from the very early days.</v>

135
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.920
<v 1>At very, very early days of.</v>

136
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.340
<v 0>The species evolution. Well.</v>

137
00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.650
<v 1>It seems it's by Peter at that, at that for,</v>

138
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.460
you know, 4.4 million year old window, and that, you know,

139
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:21.720
what comes before that is, is the speculation. It, yeah. I mean, it's, you know,

140
00:08:21.721 --> 00:08:24.600
these, the people that do this, you know, it's,

141
00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:26.460
it's intelligent speculation obviously,

142
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:30.210
but you don't know what you haven't found. And so, um,

143
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.290
uh, you know, now the, the, I mean,

144
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:39.150
there's a debate about just how long ago the last common ancestor of humans and

145
00:08:39.151 --> 00:08:43.410
chimps lived. Um, it's probably at least, you know,

146
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.420
anywhere from 1.5 million years before already to, you know,

147
00:08:48.421 --> 00:08:52.960
some estimates put it even further back than that. So yeah, the,

148
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.520
the there's another school of that's kind of emerged that says, well,

149
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.670
it still could be a knuckle walking ancestor, you know,

150
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:04.140
that gave rise to humans and RD, but it just,

151
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.300
all this stuff had disappeared by the time you got to already. Anyway, that's,

152
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.600
that's kind of a counter argument that we can get more into that later.

153
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:12.620
I don't want to get too esoteric on you, but, um, but it.

154
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.700
<v 0>Seems so fascinating that it has these really long arms. Uh,</v>

155
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.500
but that there's no evidence whatsoever of not only knuckle walking

156
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.550
in that species,

157
00:09:22.551 --> 00:09:27.410
but knuckle walking as an ancestry episodes of the Joe Rogan experience

158
00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:30.530
are now three on Spotify. That's right.

159
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.680
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

160
00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:36.110
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

161
00:09:36.111 --> 00:09:39.800
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

162
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.820
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

163
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.620
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
