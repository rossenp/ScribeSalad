00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What I would do.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.610
I was seduce people into this story and get them as obsessed as I was

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.900
like.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.450
<v 1>Pretend I'm a guy. And you're trying to pitch me.</v>

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 0>This book in the beginning of the first years, uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.310
just that the trial that had occurred that had been prosecuted by Vincent

7
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.960
Bugliosi had a lot of, um, malfeasance in it, uh,

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.190
by the prosecution.

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.170
I was able to document that they planted a former prosecutor on that defense

10
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:32.210
team to sabotage the defense.

11
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.170
I found out that two or three of the principal witnesses,

12
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:39.260
including Terry Melcher, who played a big part in this.

13
00:00:39.261 --> 00:00:43.010
And we'll probably talk about that at some point, lied on the stand, you know,

14
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:45.740
suborn themselves in a, in a murder trial.

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.320
And if you commit perjury in a murder trial,

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.180
you could be convicted of murder. I mean, you could be sentenced to a murder.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.410
You could get a murder sentence too, because of that. Uh,

18
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:02.270
so there was about a dozen of those and none of them happened all at once. So.

19
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.190
<v 1>If you committed perjury during a murder trial,</v>

20
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:07.790
you could be sentenced for murder for the same amount of time that someone would

21
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.770
get sentenced. If they murdered somebody, you.

22
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.620
<v 0>Are subject to an actual capital,</v>

23
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.660
you could be lucky you could be sent to the chair and the five people who were

24
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:22.430
convicted of murder in the first trial once had I been

25
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:26.930
around and able to prove this in the early seventies, um,

26
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.000
Vincent Bugliosi and the three people who lied on the stand in a

27
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.640
material way, you know, in a very important way,

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.620
they all could have been tried for that perjury and sentenced to the same,

29
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.600
uh, or given the same sentence that the people who had gotten the best sense.

30
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.110
Yeah. I told.

31
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.580
<v 1>You that I just got to the 11th chapter of your book and</v>

32
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.770
essentially what I'm getting so far, I haven't finished the book,

33
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:59.030
but what I'm getting so far is there was some sort of a CIA

34
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.540
program where they were,

35
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.760
explain how they did it. They,

36
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.740
they infiltrated these hippie communities and they allowed Charles

37
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.160
Manson over and over and over again to get out of jail.

38
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.510
They knew that he was committing all these crimes and instead of incarcerating.

39
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.970
<v 0>Therefore when we say they who's that, yeah,</v>

40
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:23.120
we have to kind of break it all down, let's break it all down.

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.230
One of the other things I found out that was very significant was that Manson

42
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:28.610
had a parole officer,

43
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:33.260
his first parole officer who kind of had given him a get out of jail free

44
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:37.070
card for the first year after Manson was released in prison and

45
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.800
Roger Smith. Yeah. And he was a criminologist in the bay area.

46
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.270
Manson violated his parole the day that he was released in Los Angeles.

47
00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.760
And this is one of the, you think it's a little lie,

48
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:54.530
but it's an important lie that Vince bully OSI presented not just in a trial,

49
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:58.550
but also in his book, a trial it's much more serious. He, uh,

50
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.790
change the narrative. He said,

51
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.440
Manson had been given permission to travel to San Francisco from LA when Manson

52
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.980
was paroled Manson, hadn't been given that permission. He just showed up there.

53
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.850
They originally were going to violate them, send them right back to prison.

54
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.130
And someone stepped in and took care of that and let Manson

55
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:22.480
stay in San Francisco. And he was assigned to Roger Smith. Uh,

56
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.920
it took about a year and a half,

57
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.360
but through a freedom of information act process, I got his federal parole file.

58
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.350
And those were the kind of seeds of how I found out that Manson had this

59
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.840
immunity from prosecution for the two years.

60
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.400
He was out of prison from 67 until the murders occurred in the summer of 69.

61
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.080
<v 1>Who I'm sorry to interrupt, but who was Smith doing this for?</v>

62
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.000
Who was giving him the instructions to continue to let Manson out and to con

63
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.290
to continue to monitor him?

64
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.600
<v 0>Well, that's the problem. I didn't get the whole file.</v>

65
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.940
And the file I got had redactions.

66
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:58.520
He would report to the head office and they would give him instructions. Uh,

67
00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:00.870
and then he would violate those instructions.

68
00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:05.790
And there'd be no repercussions for him or for Manson. Uh, for instance,

69
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:10.200
Manson was arrested in July of

70
00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:14.730
19 67, 3 or four months after he got out of prison when he was under Roger Smith

71
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:18.810
supervision for, um, interfering with an officer, uh,

72
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.780
who was trying to arrest one of his first young followers,

73
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:25.800
Ruth at Morehouse who was 15. And he was put in jail,

74
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.760
uh, pled out. So he got a three-day sentence,

75
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.960
a new probation sentence as well. And all that was hidden.

76
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:37.110
Like it's not in bullying this book, uh, the,

77
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.390
the parole officer Roger Smith a week later wrote to the head office at

78
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.860
Manson was doing fine.

79
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.060
And he actually recommended that Manson be allowed to go to Mexico and work in

80
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:52.440
Mexico and the head parole office in the United States since it's federal wrote

81
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:54.870
back. And they said, that's insane. He was supposed to,

82
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.130
the job that he was going to do in Mexico was surveying, um,

83
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.280
soil for insect insecticides. I mean, it had nothing to do with,

84
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.580
I have all these documents show who was hiring.

85
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.100
<v 1>Him, Charles Manson to survey soil.</v>

86
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.590
<v 0>Uh, it was a company in Nevada which disappeared a couple of years later.</v>

87
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.440
Um, so it was a company, I believe so. Yeah, they were doing down there. I see,

88
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:21.630
that's it. I don't like to speculate cause I can't prove it.

89
00:05:21.631 --> 00:05:25.590
All I know is just the fact that his parole officer asked to send them not only

90
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:26.610
to Mexico,

91
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.500
but to the country that Manson had been deported from a 1959.

92
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.550
The last time he was a free man. He had violated his parole.

93
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:37.500
Then he was arrested in Mexico. Right.

94
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.030
He was arrested in Mexico and brought over by the federal rallies and given over

95
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:46.440
to federal custody, uh, for, uh, I was a drug violation and,

96
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:47.550
and some other stuff.

97
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.860
So why would his parole officer send them back to this place three months

98
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:56.340
after he'd been released and how do you supervise somebody who's in another

99
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:57.174
country?

100
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.400
<v 1>Can I make a summary just for people that like, what the is going on right now?</v>

101
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.860
Uh, essentially what you're saying is that Charles Manson was a part of some

102
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:11.120
sort of a program and that through this program,

103
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.680
they were using him and using with

104
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.950
LSD and all the members of the family,

105
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.510
they were turning them violent. And why,

106
00:06:23.511 --> 00:06:24.740
why do you think they were doing this.

107
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.550
<v 0>Again? This is where I got to reel it in a little bit. Understand. Okay. Um,</v>

108
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.390
I have to be real careful about not saying anything that I haven't been able to

109
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:32.224
prove.

110
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:37.030
What I've proven is that he was getting leniency from the federal

111
00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:39.880
government and the, uh,

112
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.970
law enforcement first in San Francisco that year,

113
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.530
the person who represented the federal government, there was his parole officer,

114
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:51.190
Roger Smith, the federal parole officer who was giving him leniency.

115
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.650
Roger was also doing drug research at the Haight Ashbury free medical clinic,

116
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.640
which opened in June of 67 Manson.

117
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.410
During that period turned into the Manson that we're familiar with today.

118
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:06.700
You know, the monster,

119
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.380
the embodiment of evil has been slowly OSI called him the guru who could

120
00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:13.630
control the minds of these followers.

121
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.690
So he would come into the clinic to see Roger. Well,

122
00:07:16.691 --> 00:07:19.420
he went for two reasons that it was a free clinic.

123
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.950
It was at the height of the summer of love, the summer of 67. And, um,

124
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.960
he would come in with the women, the girls,

125
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.500
we had about five or six followers then, and they would walk behind him.

126
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.110
They wouldn't speak unless he spoke to them,

127
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.130
any command he issued towards them, they would follow.

128
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.030
And they became very well known around the clinic and they were there

129
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:42.130
principally for, uh,

130
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.840
Manson to see Roger for his weekly parole appointments.

131
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.620
And then the girls were going in for STDs and there were some pregnancies and

132
00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:52.120
stuff and they were getting free treatment.

133
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.690
That was the summer that the Manson family formed.

134
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.000
And then they left in late 67, early 68,

135
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.080
and migrated down to Los Angeles and became this killer cult.

136
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.100
It's crazy how quickly this all happened. It's insane how quickly it happened.

137
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:09.790
I don't understand.

138
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.900
<v 1>We're talking about two years, we're talking about 67. Manson is in Haight,</v>

139
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.010
Ashbury 69, the Tate LaBianca murders and then the trial. And then,

140
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.510
then everything else two years is the speculation that Charlie Manson

141
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.130
was basically just sort of a two bit criminal who had spent most of his life

142
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:32.320
inside the system and, uh, had been incarcerated for what half of his life.

143
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.130
<v 0>Half of his life, when he was released about age 32 and 67,</v>

144
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:38.830
all federal institutions too, which was interesting,

145
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:43.510
even bully OSI pointed that out in his book. Um, first of all,

146
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:46.660
his mother was a prostitute. She kind of,

147
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.020
she would get sentenced to jail for petty theft or prostitution,

148
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.810
and she'd hand them off to her parents or other people.

149
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.090
And by the time he was 10, 11 years old, he was stealing cars,

150
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:01.200
committing petty theft and stuff. So then he was sent to, um,

151
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.610
you know, juvenile detention centers and schools, uh,

152
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.400
reformed schools all run by the federal government.

153
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.600
And then when he committed his first crime as an adult, uh, which was again,

154
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:16.890
car theft, the first, um, crimes required that, but when he stole the cars,

155
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.240
he'd cross state lines. So then it became a federal offense and he got, uh,

156
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.950
in prison with much more serious sentences if it's a federal offense.

157
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.390
And if it's a state and he do these long sentences back to back to back,

158
00:09:30.391 --> 00:09:34.860
and then every time he was released, he either violate his parole or probation.

159
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:39.120
And they were actually strict with him in the fifties and early well, till 60,

160
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:43.890
when he finally went to prison for seven years, it wasn't until 67.

161
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:47.930
When he came out that all of a sudden it was hands off. Now.

162
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.940
<v 1>What do you think happened.</v>

163
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:55.460
<v 0>In prison? Did they find him in prison? Well, again,</v>

164
00:09:55.790 --> 00:10:00.560
I'll go there with you. Okay. And I kind of lay out the book is,

165
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.870
and I got criticism for this, um,

166
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:07.250
which we know was a good possibility as I lay out

167
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.500
circumstantial evidence for a case with proof of each

168
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.140
circumstance. But when you put them all together,

169
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:20.330
that's the hardest part is linking them, finding the bridges. Um,

170
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.020
what I do is show what the objectives were of an,

171
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.490
either the federal government's case through MK ultra, and then other programs,

172
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.470
COINTELPRO and chaos,

173
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.380
and the law enforcements in Los Angeles and San Francisco at the time.

174
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.450
So, um, MK ultra began in the,

175
00:10:41.451 --> 00:10:46.090
in the federal prisons experiments on prisoners famously or

176
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.990
notoriously Whitey Bulger. I don't know if you've heard about this, but, um,

177
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.030
a few years ago it was revealed that Whitey Bolger had been a part of MK ultra

178
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:58.820
experimentation in the fifties when he was incarcerated.

179
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.860
And after he was convicted,

180
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:05.810
he was claiming that he believed that all of his violence

181
00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:09.740
was a product of what had happened to him in prison when he was experimented

182
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.770
upon with LSD through these scientists.

183
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.110
So theoretically Manson was in the prime place where the

184
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:23.030
experiments were occurring in prisons before he was released in 67 in

185
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:25.060
federal institutions. They couldn't do it in the.

186
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.000
<v 1>Did Manson ever talk about any experiments that took place? Turn print? No,</v>

187
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:29.420
never.

188
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.850
<v 0>No, no. He, he, you know, I actually have a, uh,</v>

189
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:36.110
his not only his federal parole file, which was the hardest thing to get,

190
00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.110
because it had never been released from 67 to 69.

191
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.610
But I also have the one prior to that from the fifties to the sixties and all

192
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:44.690
the correspondence.

193
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:50.060
And he would talk about these doctors coming in to examine him and he didn't

194
00:11:50.061 --> 00:11:53.500
trust them and he didn't know what they were doing, and this was late fifties.

195
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.930
Um, and unfortunately he never had the first names for the doctors.

196
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:00.640
There were two, one of them was Dr. Hartman.

197
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:01.960
I can't remember the other one's name.

198
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.860
There was a Mortimer Hartman in Los Angeles who was one of the early

199
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.950
psychiatrists using LSD in the fifties,

200
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.000
Cary Cary grant was one of his patients. Um,

201
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.510
so theoretically

202
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:23.170
he could have come out of the program or the experimentation that began

203
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:28.000
there. Um, but, uh, you know, I hate to even, I rather, and again,

204
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.360
it's hard to kind of synopsize all this without showing all the documentation

205
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:35.650
and stuff of what was going on and where he was and how everything matches up.

206
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.170
But you'll see that when you get through chapter 11.

207
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.150
<v 1>Okay. So I wish I got to it, but you know,</v>

208
00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:46.680
it's a rush to get to that far. So 1967,

209
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.070
he gets out of jail and he,

210
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.190
how long before he hooks up with this clinic?

211
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.700
<v 0>Uh, so he got out in March of 67.</v>

212
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:01.710
The clinic opened in June of 67. So just a few months. Yeah. Well,

213
00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:05.010
Roger Smith, he was actually living in Berkeley. Manson was,

214
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:10.050
and he got his first follower, Mary Bruner, and then two or three or four more.

215
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.240
And then Roger was the one who suggested that he go to the hate to absorb the

216
00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:20.100
vibes. He thought Manson might benefit from the love and peace fives that were

217
00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:21.540
happening in the summer of love.

218
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.410
<v 1>Your Smith was his parole officer in 67,</v>

219
00:13:25.411 --> 00:13:28.440
but also was his parole officer before that was that proven.

220
00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.240
<v 0>N well, no, Roger Smith's well, his assistant that's good. You remember that?</v>

221
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.920
Gail Sedalia told me she was his assistant at the clinic at the Haight Ashbury

222
00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:42.740
free medical clinic when he was running his amphetamine study, uh, um, in,

223
00:13:42.741 --> 00:13:43.800
in 68,

224
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.510
she said that Roger had told her he met Manson when he was doing

225
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.010
probation work in Illinois in

226
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.700
the early sixties. Uh,

227
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.320
I eventually interviewed Roger several times and Roger denied that.

228
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.600
And when I went back to gal, she was shocked. She was like,

229
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:07.070
I can't believe he's denying that that was a connection he met.

230
00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:10.440
That's why Manson was able to leave Los Angeles. He was sent to Roger Smith.

231
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.870
So Roger could be his parole officer.

232
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.970
I was never able to document that Bateson had been in

233
00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:22.860
Illinois except for three days from in 61 or excuse me,

234
00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:26.610
in 61, he was brought from Mexico to Texas.

235
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:31.770
And then they brought him to Los Angeles to be violated in front of the judge

236
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:32.790
there. Uh,

237
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.780
and he did spend three days at Joliet prison where Roger Smith worked,

238
00:14:36.781 --> 00:14:40.230
but he was there a year or two later. So that was one of the,

239
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:43.680
one of the many frustrating moments where everything made sense,

240
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.780
except for one but one very important, um,

241
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.680
whole, which was, well, they weren't there at the time,

242
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.250
at least as far as the official record. Yeah. So.

243
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.840
<v 1>If Smith was a part of these experiments and Smith was also</v>

244
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:03.490
his parole officer and did know him before he did the seven years

245
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.690
before he got out,

246
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.430
which is when it's speculated that Manson was possibly experimented on

247
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.980
and Smith might've been aware of the entire process of it and was supervising

248
00:15:14.981 --> 00:15:16.710
him upon his release. Yeah.

249
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:20.080
So that's why every time Manson got arrested,

250
00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:23.230
which should have just locked him up, they would just let them go. Yeah.

251
00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.250
<v 0>Yeah. And, and Smith, I mean, to give you a little background on Smith, uh,</v>

252
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.460
as he told me, he called himself, he goes, I was a rock rock,

253
00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:35.050
rib Republican from the Midwest. And I came out, he went to Berkeley,

254
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.700
uh, to the school of criminology to, to become a criminologist.

255
00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.100
I think in 65 or 66,

256
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:46.750
he was getting his masters and his PhD and his special area

257
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.800
of study was in the beginning, gangs,

258
00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:52.870
collective behavior and violence.

259
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.970
And then how drugs would make some of these gangs that he had

260
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:02.050
people who was working with infiltrate students infiltrate, um,

261
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:07.180
to get information. Yeah, this wasn't an Oakland and the ghettos in like 65, 66,

262
00:16:07.181 --> 00:16:10.980
when the Panthers were forming, then in 60,

263
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.460
late 66,

264
00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.350
he decided to become a federal parole officer while he was still writing his

265
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:20.020
dissertation. And he, um,

266
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.200
got assigned to something called the San Francisco project,

267
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:28.210
which was an experimental program run by the federal government

268
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.300
to see how different, um,

269
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.780
numbers of parole clients caseload's for per parole

270
00:16:37.781 --> 00:16:42.010
officer were, you know, you know, supervision. It was about recividism.

271
00:16:42.011 --> 00:16:45.490
So if you had the lowest load was 20 clients,

272
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:49.480
the largest was like 50 or 60. Were you able to super, I mean,

273
00:16:49.481 --> 00:16:52.720
you wouldn't think that 50 or 60 is going to be a lot more difficult,

274
00:16:52.721 --> 00:16:53.920
but it always wasn't.

275
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:59.020
So Smith joined that program where he's supposed to be paying much more

276
00:16:59.021 --> 00:17:02.350
attention and care to his clients. Uh,

277
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.190
because as part of a special program called the San Francisco project.

278
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.590
And in fact he was, I mean, he was,

279
00:17:08.591 --> 00:17:12.730
he was seeing Manson more than he was even officially supposed to

280
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.740
things, you know, it gets even crazier. Uh, after 68,

281
00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:19.540
he stopped being his parole officer.

282
00:17:19.541 --> 00:17:23.140
He was actually removed and he said it was voluntarily.

283
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:27.640
So he could focus more on his drugs and violence research at the clinic. Uh,

284
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.570
Manson's three or four women followers got arrested and Mendocino.

285
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:36.130
They had Lord a couple of young boys into a house, given them LSD there.

286
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.820
Manson had sent them out up to Mendocino to recruit people for the family.

287
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.730
The three women were four women were arrested.

288
00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:47.200
One of the Mary Bruner had the first baby with Manson and the group and

289
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.910
Roger Smith and his wife,

290
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.430
Carol went up to Mendocino and petition the court to take foster

291
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:57.810
custody of the child until Mary was, um,

292
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.370
until her case was resolved. So they were the foster parents of Manson's son.

293
00:18:02.371 --> 00:18:04.800
I mean, everything was irregular about this,

294
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.660
that actually that case is pretty interesting. So Mary Bruner and Susan Atkins,

295
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:14.550
two women who actually killed for Manson in 1969 were, um,

296
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.953
given,

297
00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:20.850
they were convicted of contributing to the delinquency of minor is illegal drug

298
00:18:20.851 --> 00:18:25.300
possession. And, uh, without a trial, they pled out, uh,

299
00:18:25.301 --> 00:18:26.940
and then there was a,

300
00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:31.380
what they call the sentencing phase where a probation officer is assigned to

301
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:35.280
decide whether or not they should be sent to prison or give them probation

302
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.100
supervised probation. So, um,

303
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.910
I got access to their files, pruners and Atkins,

304
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:47.040
and in the file where recommendations to the court by Roger Smith and his wife

305
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:51.540
saying these are good women, they shouldn't go to prison. Um,

306
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.290
Susan Atkins, who, you know, stabbed Sharon Tate and.

307
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:57.690
<v 1>Proven cause she said it, and then she.</v>

308
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.010
<v 0>Went back and forth and back and forth. Yeah. Is it proven?</v>

309
00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.960
<v 1>Cause Tex Watson clearly was.</v>

310
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.270
<v 0>A murderer. Right. And so.</v>

311
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.080
<v 1>She had said that Tex did it, she couldn't do it, but this was later on.</v>

312
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:11.990
<v 0>Yeah. First her first accounts were that she did it.</v>

313
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.420
And then when she testified to the grand jury, she said that she didn't do it.

314
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:21.650
She held Sharon while tech stabbed her later in prison.

315
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.170
She said that she did do it. And then she changed again,

316
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:28.790
she'd go back and forth. But she was pretty brutal. And, uh,

317
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:33.740
Mary Bruner and Susan Atkins were given probation instead of being sentenced,

318
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:37.520
partially based on Roger Smith's recommendation,

319
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.960
Roger Smith identified himself as a former parole officer, you know,

320
00:19:41.961 --> 00:19:44.420
with his expertise.

321
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:49.760
And he said he had known both of them for two years and which was also a

322
00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:52.490
lie. He had only known Susan. He couldn't have known Susan for two years.

323
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:56.690
He knew her for about a year. He didn't know Mary pretty well.

324
00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:01.850
Um, and he never disclosed that he was Manson's parole officer.

325
00:20:01.851 --> 00:20:06.620
And Manson's identified in the same files as the person who Lord these women

326
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:11.510
into crime, that they were his communal wives that they would steal for him,

327
00:20:11.511 --> 00:20:15.440
prostitutes themselves for him. And the other people that they interviewed,

328
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:17.900
the probation officer argued against it saying,

329
00:20:17.901 --> 00:20:20.960
they're going to go right back to this guy who's down in Los Angeles and

330
00:20:20.961 --> 00:20:24.140
continue the life of crime. But the judge released them.

331
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.670
<v 1>Now this was, they were doing Charlie's bidding.</v>

332
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.860
According to the, the record,

333
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.220
what they were trying to do was recruit people into the family.

334
00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.930
And so they would offer them drugs and, and, and uh,

335
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:43.550
sex and a lot of women and bring them to these parties and where they screwed up

336
00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:47.520
is they got an underage boy who was right.

337
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.760
And he was the son of.

338
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.320
<v 0>A local sheriff. Yeah. He said, his legs turned into snakes. Yeah.</v>

339
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.290
That's when they screwed up in that situation. And that's.

340
00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.700
<v 1>How they got arrested that time. And still they got released. Yeah.</v>

341
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.320
Which is really crazy. It's like,

342
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.910
there's so many of these instances where Charlie or members of the

343
00:21:06.911 --> 00:21:08.380
family were arrested.

344
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:13.420
And then it seemed like the police officers who were holding them were

345
00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.100
being told, Hey,

346
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.790
you got to let these guys go there's this is a higher situation.

347
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.440
Is above your pay.

348
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.460
<v 0>Yeah. Well,</v>

349
00:21:20.461 --> 00:21:25.170
a real turning point in my reporting was after I got access to Manson's parole

350
00:21:25.171 --> 00:21:29.750
file and saw that, I mean, helter-skelter bully OSI,

351
00:21:29.751 --> 00:21:33.960
I think describes to arrest that Manson got released on

352
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.700
technicalities, you know,

353
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.580
shoddy police work or something when he should have been violated.

354
00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.460
But what he didn't do was talk about three or four more.

355
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:44.700
And if you've gotten up to chapter 10, you've seen all that stuff laid out.

356
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:49.020
So when I got this record, a pretty substantial record,

357
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.990
I took it to someone named Louis walk neck,

358
00:21:51.991 --> 00:21:56.820
who was a retired judge and retired district attorney from the valley out

359
00:21:56.821 --> 00:21:59.010
around here, van Nuys. Um,

360
00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.780
cause I needed somebody with the expertise and the knowledge of how things

361
00:22:03.781 --> 00:22:06.210
worked because you have to look at everything in context,

362
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.410
things work at differently today than they did in 2009 or

363
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.700
2000 when I interviewed him. But he was there in 69 in the DA's office.

364
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:19.860
I brought the documents to him and we laid them all out on his

365
00:22:19.861 --> 00:22:22.980
kitchen table and he's looking at them. And the poor guy was, um,

366
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.250
very sick with cancer and he talked like this,

367
00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:30.510
but I had the recorder going and he's looking at all the documents and he's

368
00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:33.600
seeing this pattern of catch release, catch release, and he's gone chicken,

369
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:38.250
chicken. This is all chicken. He goes, he shouldn't,

370
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.050
he should have gone back the first time he goes, they wanted him out. He said,

371
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:47.460
he that he was more important to somebody out than in. He goes,

372
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.020
you've got to find out who it was. And I go up, how do I do that? And he goes,

373
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.410
you're not going to be able to that's he's an informant. I go, but who should I,

374
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.060
what should I look at? He goes, well,

375
00:22:57.061 --> 00:23:01.980
he was working either for local law enforcement, uh, the federal government,

376
00:23:01.981 --> 00:23:06.300
the FBI, but somebody wanted him out there doing whatever he was doing.

377
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.830
So that was important.

378
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:12.690
Another turning point was a bunch of years later was when I brought similar

379
00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:17.130
materials to Stephen K, who was bully OCS co prosecutor in the case.

380
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.230
<v 1>Can I stop you for a second? So the speculation,</v>

381
00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:23.400
his speculation was that Charlie was an infant. Well.

382
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:25.710
<v 0>And again, I'm informed informant has many definitions.</v>

383
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:30.240
It's not just informing on crime. It also can be doing the police is bidding.

384
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:34.050
That's where the CIA or the CIA or the FBI.

385
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:37.050
<v 1>Part of a program where they're allowing this.</v>

386
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.530
And also there's speculation that the,

387
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:44.430
the goal was to try to diminish the anti-war movement.

388
00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:47.210
And this guy was a part of the hippie movement.

389
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:51.620
And then so now people would associate hippies with violence and drugs and

390
00:23:51.621 --> 00:23:53.090
murder and all this.

391
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:01.990
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
