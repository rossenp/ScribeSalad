WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. So where we are is, is a, what the hell?</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.550
It's it's a Friday and.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.920
<v 1>It looks like Pennsylvania is leaning towards Biden. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.400
George is leaning towards Biden. It's basically over four for Trump.

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.660
<v 0>You would, I mean,</v>

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.800
look at it that you don't see a lot of avenues for success on, on this one.

7
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:24.710
I mean, look, Pennsylvania, you know, they're still saying rightly so,

8
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:29.090
it's too close to call. They've got 8,000 some odd, uh,

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.490
military absentee ballots still to count.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.970
The assumption would be just like they just, Trump, those would be for Trump,

11
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:37.850
just like they assume a lot of the mail-in ballots in the Philadelphia area or

12
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.450
Allegheny, or it will be for Biden. Um,

13
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.040
but they have to go through that process.

14
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.570
Now that Pennsylvania is an interesting one, right? I mean, I, again, uh,

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.500
there's a lot of people that are,

16
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.860
that are getting very pissy about Trump's attitude towards this whole thing.

17
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.810
And could he be more eloquent?

18
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:56.450
Could he just shut the up and let the system work? Right.

19
00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:59.060
Let his legal teams do what they're supposed to do and what they're entitled to

20
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:03.680
do. Um, and just say, you know, we just have to work through the process. Well,

21
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.630
yeah, he could, of course he could, but he's not going to,

22
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.830
but Pennsylvania is interesting because the, the, the, the problem up there,

23
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.110
and maybe there's no fraud, you have to, it's like an investigation, right?

24
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:18.200
When you do an investigation, you have to base it on, right.

25
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.560
From the very beginning, you had to base it on facts on something concrete,

26
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.740
right. If you don't, you're building an entire investigation potentially on,

27
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.560
on very shaky ground, the whole thing comes tumbling down. And it's a,

28
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:31.610
it's a house of. So, you know, it's like a, it's like a, uh,

29
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.570
an operation until operation. Everybody remembers from maybe not the WMT,

30
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.890
you know, fiasco, you know, from Iraq, the idea that, oh my God,

31
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.550
we've got to get in there because they got Wnt. Well, a lot of that, you know,

32
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.370
was, was based on one source reporting, right.

33
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.080
Which got into the reporting chain and then got re reinvented in another

34
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.440
report and then got, you know, uh, self corroborated and other reporting.

35
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.251
And before, you know, it,

36
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:59.360
you're confirming all the same information from originally that one source.

37
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:03.140
Right. Very shaky. So you're not building a, uh,

38
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.850
an invasion of a country on, on solid information. So with Pennsylvania,

39
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.020
um, if people are looking at that and going on there, so all sorts of going on,

40
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:15.710
and it's it's as fraud. Well, you gotta step back and you gotta say, okay,

41
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:18.430
where are the problems? Now? There's a handful of,

42
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:22.310
of issues that I think are legitimate in Pennsylvania. One of them being, uh,

43
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.070
this idea that the state Supreme court, uh,

44
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.630
circumvented what the legislative branch in Pennsylvania said about, uh,

45
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.710
ballots. And when you can count the ballots up until what time, uh,

46
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:35.450
the postmarking on the ballots. And,

47
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.980
and so that's a legitimate issue that probably, or could end up in,

48
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.780
in a higher court is,

49
00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:44.510
did the state Supreme court in Pennsylvania have that right?

50
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.380
According to the constitution to just cause because the state houses in each

51
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.030
state set the laws about this very thing.

52
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.550
And you've got a problem though,

53
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.890
in Pennsylvania because the state house is run by Republicans.

54
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.790
Now this about how long it's taking to count,

55
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:04.300
the votes could have been sorted out if a year ago,

56
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.990
or not even that if six months ago, when we knew this pandemic was,

57
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.160
was a problem.

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.940
When we knew we were going to get unprecedented levels of Malin votes,

59
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.820
if the Republican state house had said, okay,

60
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.220
here's when we can start counting those mail-in votes,

61
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.800
as soon as we start receiving them. How about that?

62
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.970
So they could have been well ahead, you know, so it's,

63
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.810
it's both, both sides have this up, right?

64
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.630
It's not one side of the other, both sides. Once again, both, you know, it's,

65
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.920
it's, you know, th th th the, the, the truth is always, uh, you know,

66
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:38.260
we talked about this before. It's always somewhere in the center and that's,

67
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.670
that's true here, but anyway, Pennsylvania close to call, um, you know,

68
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:43.600
this idea that they're,

69
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.860
they're preventing observers from coming in or standing close enough because

70
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.060
they allowed them in. But then, you know,

71
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.500
were they able to stand close enough to observe anything of any value? Um,

72
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.330
that should never be in question.

73
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.610
<v 1>All right. So they let them in, is this all been corroborated?</v>

74
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:01.020
This is proven they let them in,

75
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:02.880
but they wouldn't let them actually observe what they were doing.

76
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.790
<v 0>Yeah. There was delays in some districts, right?</v>

77
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.740
Some eat cause counties run these elections.

78
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:12.150
And so some counties do it by the book and others apparently have decided they

79
00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.860
can do things a little bit differently. So, um, some, uh,

80
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.000
they were not able to get in as far as access goes, as you know,

81
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:22.470
once the voting started,

82
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.770
some they weren't able to go in for the pre vote counting or the pre, uh,

83
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.940
pre voting day counting of these ballots. Um,

84
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.380
and others, they were able to go in and they were kept maybe 25 feet back.

85
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.370
Instead of that's currently, what's like a six feet distance that had been,

86
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:40.890
I think I'm not, don't quote me on this, but maybe, uh,

87
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.250
responsibly decided that you could be six feet away because.

88
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.550
<v 1>Of social distance twenty-five feet away. That seems insane.</v>

89
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.410
<v 0>Some places had them watching on monitors, which again is, is, is useless. But,</v>

90
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.550
uh, so, and those, the problem there is that should never happen.

91
00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.750
You should be able to always agree, both sides that you need, uh,

92
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.070
campaign observers in there.

93
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:05.310
And they have that right to observe the counting of these things.

94
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.960
And it all comes down to the same issue, whether it's that, or whether it's, um,

95
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.850
you know, uh, counting ballots because, you know, or, or discarding ballots,

96
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:17.490
because the person's died previous to the election,

97
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.820
it all comes down to the perception of fraud.

98
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.360
There may not be anything going on in this election in terms of fraud,

99
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.700
fraudulent active. And when it, when, when all is said and done,

100
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:27.810
the only investigations are done,

101
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.270
but the damage is already done because people perceive it as, as, as,

102
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.420
as possible. It's a lot of people perceive it as likely or is happening.

103
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.710
And if you don't have a transparent system set up, right,

104
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.520
that is easy to see.

105
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.200
You've gotta be able to look at it and not be told by politicians and not be

106
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:50.940
told by, uh, you know, election officials or the media that it's,

107
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:51.400
it's a,

108
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.070
it's a good credible system that the voter has to be able to look at the process

109
00:05:56.071 --> 00:05:59.690
and say, yeah, no, that's fair and transparent. And it's like, um,

110
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:04.280
it, you know, it's, it's like a cover for action, right? If I'm doing,

111
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.550
if I'm doing surveillance on some target, right. Um,

112
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.200
and I'm out in the middle of some, whether it's a hole or whether it's, uh,

113
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.690
you know, uh, urban center in a developed country,

114
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.180
I have to have cover for action.

115
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:21.380
I have to have a reason that is plainly obvious by Passerbuys or by local

116
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.850
authorities or police that patrol the area. Oh, I get, that's why he's there.

117
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.760
Right. We did not one time where, um,

118
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.330
it was overseas, we were waiting for a target to, uh, to show up. Um,

119
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.060
and it was, uh, it was a port, right.

120
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.370
And a lot of busy, a lot of people coming and going tourists, uh, workers,

121
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:48.050
commercial workers coming and going from this busy port. And, you know,

122
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.050
what you didn't have was you didn't have a lot of people just hanging out right

123
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:53.240
there. Weren't a lot of opportunities just to hang out. So he had,

124
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.500
had to have a reason, right. So what are you doing?

125
00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:59.270
You set somebody down there with a couple of, uh, pieces of luggage and, uh,

126
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.540
and a baby stroller and a baby. Um,

127
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:07.010
don't ask me where we got the baby from and you, uh, just stole a baby,

128
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.180
you know, Hey, it's for the good of the country. Um, and I,

129
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.720
I, we requisitioned it, we got it. We have a,

130
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.570
we have a baby requisition department down in the basement of the agency.

131
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.080
Now we don't. No, no, it was my own baby. Actually. It was my daughter.

132
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.570
When she was a little baby, you can use.

133
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.720
<v 1>Your own daughter during a covert operation. Why is that wrong?</v>

134
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.450
I don't think so. No, I'm just curious. Yeah.

135
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.380
<v 0>And so, and it,</v>

136
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.670
and it worked like a charm because they could sit there for hours, right.

137
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:35.080
Waiting theoretically for a boat,

138
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.980
obviously pulling surveillance from an observation post and people walking by

139
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.980
with like, yeah, there's a, there's some lady with a baby, you know,

140
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.210
suitcases to cover for action. Um, they did, uh, they, they,

141
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.620
they whacked it and industrialist in Germany. One time where the, uh,

142
00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:55.090
the hit team, um, it was very elaborate, but they, uh,

143
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:58.870
they did what they always do. They surveil, they figure out the guys routes.

144
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.750
And as is usual, your, your choke points, you know,

145
00:08:01.751 --> 00:08:03.940
that's what they're looking for. Where does it, you know,

146
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:05.980
you get in the vehicle and you drive, you're going to have choke points.

147
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:09.910
Usually it's at a place of work or it's at your home. Right. Uh,

148
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:13.360
but it may be somewhere in between. Maybe there's a, there's a,

149
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.850
an avenue that's always, you know, blocked up.

150
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.090
Maybe there's a turn that they have to come to a complete stop there. You're,

151
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:19.241
you're,

152
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:23.560
you're looking for that choke point where you can lay out the attack where you

153
00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:25.270
control the environment. Right.

154
00:08:25.271 --> 00:08:28.060
There was a place in the Philippines that's still exists. Uh,

155
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:30.040
we used to call it ambush alley, right?

156
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:33.040
Because you'd start at one and you go to the other. And it was a,

157
00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:35.500
it was a cut-through, they weren't that very many of them.

158
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:37.810
And sometimes it was the only one to get from one part of the,

159
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.350
of the city to another. And once you got in there, you know,

160
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.950
you just hit the gas because you were host. If you got caught up in there,

161
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:48.550
and there was an insurgency going on. And so, you know, uh, roadblocks and, and,

162
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.300
uh, and local hit teams, they call them Sparrow units, uh,

163
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:54.700
were always a concern. And so that was,

164
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.870
that was choke point ambush alley was a choke point. Anyway, long story short,

165
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.260
they whacked us industrialists, but the hit team, uh, who,

166
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.900
after they'd done the surveillance and they decided where that point was for the

167
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:05.970
attack. They, uh,

168
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.720
showed up one day in construction gear and construction uniform to start digging

169
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.360
a trench as a construction team. Right.

170
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.990
You can look that you'll drive by and go out there building something,

171
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.500
or they're digging a trench, right. It's covered for action. Um,

172
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.830
and so it's this, I don't know how I'm making this analogy,

173
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:26.220
but it's the same with the election voters. Gotta be able to look at it and go,

174
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:29.070
it's transparent. I see why it's transparent.

175
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.690
<v 1>Talking about. Yeah. You're talking about them. They,</v>

176
00:09:33.691 --> 00:09:38.060
they did a bad job of hiding corruption.

177
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.340
That's what you're saying. You said, coming for action is it's deceptive.

178
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.650
Like what you're describing is deceptive. Well.

179
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.940
<v 0>What, what I'm saying is say they, the system has to be clearly,</v>

180
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.160
um, uh, transparent and, and,

181
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.100
and honest and credible by just from the voter's perspective,

182
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.720
you can't, you can't do, like adjust the rules about just because we say, ah,

183
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.850
pandemic. Now we got to change the rules. And, you know,

184
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:06.860
these states are gonna change them. These states won't and the state.

185
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.240
<v 1>Has, how did you make the connection from that to cover for action? Um.</v>

186
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.530
<v 0>You know, cause I, oh, I, I know. Thank you for, yeah. Yeah.</v>

187
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.490
Cover for action is because, sorry, I know this is, uh, this is, yeah.

188
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.960
Try being in my house, in my house.

189
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.590
I've tried to be a part of my family and following me at the dinner table. Um,

190
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.040
it's because with couple of action, just like with looking at the,

191
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:31.460
the voting and saying, okay, I see why it's transparent. I see cover action.

192
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.830
You've got to look and go, okay, I get it. That's what they're there for it.

193
00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:35.600
And you move on. You don't, you don't, you don't think about it.

194
00:10:35.601 --> 00:10:37.670
You don't have to be told, you know, you don't have to stop and go, excuse me,

195
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:41.450
what are you doing here? Right. It's just evident on the, on the face of it.

196
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:41.960
How.

197
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.820
<v 1>Are there not universal voting rules for each state that are</v>

198
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:48.350
federal? How has,

199
00:10:48.351 --> 00:10:51.680
how has it that different states are allowed to come up with their own rules?

200
00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:56.480
Like, like I was reading something about, uh, in Georgia, they were,

201
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.780
uh,

202
00:10:56.780 --> 00:11:01.430
allowing people who had made mistakes on their ballots to redo their ballots.

203
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.870
And they, they called them curing the ballots. Yeah. Yeah.

204
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:07.290
<v 0>You've got that. You've also got,</v>

205
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.610
you've got the ability to change your vote too, in some places. Yeah.

206
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.350
You can change your vote up until, you know,

207
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.920
up until the deadline of the election day. Um,

208
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.290
there are some places where you can, you can go in,

209
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:22.070
you have to request it and then you have to, and then you can change your vote.

210
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.390
Um, which if you think about it is not bad because if on election day,

211
00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:29.660
you wake up and you find out that the candidate you voted for is committed

212
00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:31.850
murder, then you think, okay, I'd like to change my vote.

213
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:32.421
<v 1>Well,</v>

214
00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:35.390
I think a lot of people did want to actually change their vote after the second

215
00:11:35.391 --> 00:11:39.680
Biden, um, w debate that was a big, uh,

216
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.650
Google search. There was a thing that they were talking about,

217
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:47.570
the Google searches for how to change your vote, went up some astounding number.

218
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.510
Yeah. Because he just had a real terrible debate.

219
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.430
No one has done worse on the campaign trail and that's,

220
00:11:55.270 --> 00:12:00.010
and more people vote in this election than have ever voted since like the

221
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.980
19 hundreds, early 19 hundreds or something. Right.

222
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.450
<v 0>I don't think maybe I'm wrong on this, but I think, you know,</v>

223
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:07.590
we should fact check this,

224
00:12:07.591 --> 00:12:10.830
but I don't think she held a press conference during the entire campaign.

225
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.730
I don't think she had one single press conference. She had appearances. Right.

226
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.180
Um, but I don't think she actually held a press conference during the entire

227
00:12:18.181 --> 00:12:22.800
campaign. That's astounding. Right. Um, but yeah, I agree. This look,

228
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.170
we're,

229
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.520
we're in this position that we're in right now in a variety of ways and because

230
00:12:29.521 --> 00:12:31.730
of the, oh, for sure. Yeah.

231
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:36.980
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
