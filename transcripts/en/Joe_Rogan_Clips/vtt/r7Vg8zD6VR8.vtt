00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now, the,</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.510
there was for a long time,

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:11.070
a stigma associated with anything that had anything to do with mushrooms. Um,

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.080
uh, particularly because of psychedelic mushrooms, is that, has that alleviated.

5
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:21.060
I know the John Hopkins study on siliciden has shown some pretty incredible

6
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:24.420
benefits and there's a lot of people now that are starting to look to it for

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.540
treatment, for people with PTSD or addiction issues.

8
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
Has that become more mainstream in, in your experience?

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.950
<v 1>It's, there's a vast title change in medical science.</v>

10
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.960
There was a, a slide. Um,

11
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.300
these are just a few of the universities right now that have been approved

12
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:49.130
by the FDA and other agencies for human clinical studies on psilocybin.

13
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.620
Wow. So we work in Harvard, Stanford.

14
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.870
<v 0>Purdue, um, Penn, Toronto,</v>

15
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.820
university of Toronto. That's amazing.

16
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.640
<v 1>So that's only a few of them. I actually could put the department.</v>

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.800
<v 0>Of veterans affairs. That's very interesting as well, right?</v>

18
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.470
<v 1>If I could put up 20 more, but you couldn't read them.</v>

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.510
Cause I had to be able to, just to be able. So, but this,

20
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:13.370
this is a huge shift and the, the clinical studies are coming out for,

21
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.270
as you know, PTSD in particular has been extremely useful,

22
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:21.410
but one of them that came out at Johns Hopkins for breaking tobacco addiction,

23
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.570
15 patients, small clinical studies,

24
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:28.430
statistically significant 10 out of 15 people after one or

25
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:33.380
two heroic doses of psilocybin, 12 months later had not smoked a cigarette.

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.000
Wow. That, so,

27
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.570
I mean to break tobacco addiction was one of the most addictive substances on

28
00:01:38.571 --> 00:01:41.300
this planet is phenomenal. That's incredible.

29
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.090
And the other research for PTSD depression,

30
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.460
I'm really excited about cognition, creativity. I think we can.

31
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.980
There's a lot of smart people out there.

32
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.680
A lot of smart people listening to your podcast.

33
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.960
I think the idea of micro-dosing and being able to increase our

34
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.550
ability of cognition and creativity to come up with a solutions that can get it

35
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.620
out, get us out of this mess. Just think of that.

36
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.410
If we had hundreds of millions of people thinking about solutions,

37
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:11.300
like I've come up with the solve.

38
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.870
Some of the environmental challenges we have today for food biosecurity,

39
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.450
the loss of B is a threat to our national security.

40
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.510
Just think about the threat to our economy. Um,

41
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.530
so this microdosing I think has enormous potential as well.

42
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.610
And when you think about, um, th th the,

43
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.030
one of the issues I see right now with the clinical studies is like, uh,

44
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.710
almost as too good to be true, statistically significant, great universities,

45
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.520
great science published in peer reviewed journals the top of their game,

46
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.130
but they, they, these mushrooms have so many benefits, um, for fighting,

47
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.210
uh, dementia,

48
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.020
potentially Alzheimer's Johns Hopkins has an Alzheimer clinical study ongoing,

49
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.790
uh, currently, uh, for a dose of psilocybin to see if it helps,

50
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.340
uh, pre Alzheimer's patients and not go into full blown Alzheimers.

51
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.030
There's so many different benefits, potentially.

52
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.330
It's almost like a chaos of data, how it's almost too good to be true. So, uh,

53
00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:12.910
my, my team and Pam, Crisco's the MD from British Columbia.

54
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.560
We've been working with people and we have just launched today, uh, an app,

55
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.790
uh, that's at microdose.me and entendre

56
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.270
microdose taught me it's available on the apple store.

57
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.970
It's available on Android. And this is a quick little, wait a minute, a.

58
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.500
<v 0>Microdosing study on Mo and apple loud this on the app store. Yup.</v>

59
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.910
That's a big shift. And it's because this is a schedule,

60
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:43.860
one drug that they're talking about taking on microdose

61
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:48.150
levels. I mean, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm just saying what it is, right? I mean,

62
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.020
obviously, you know what camp I'm in. I want everybody to do it, but this,

63
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:54.030
this is really significant. And.

64
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.110
<v 1>Is that measures, uh, uh, your ability to hear vision,</v>

65
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.150
the tap test, you know, and how quickly you can tap your fingers. It's it's, uh,

66
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.620
w whatever you're stocking it with,

67
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.820
but it's also good for non psychoactive substance use.

68
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.260
What is your baseline? So you're getting older, I'm getting older.

69
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.360
<v 2>I'm getting younger. Do I have a new thing? Okay.</v>

70
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.540
<v 1>I vote for you. I figured it out, but the idea is to create baselines in, oh,</v>

71
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.490
and then you create a baseline over time.

72
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.530
<v 0>And then on how far you deteriorated or.</v>

73
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.410
<v 1>What your trend line is versus the general population.</v>

74
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.610
So the idea with the Microsoft microdose, uh,

75
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.350
dot me is that we'll create a massive dataset, massive amount of data.

76
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.940
And then we'll offer this to clinicians for them to see signal from the noise.

77
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.170
I suspect hypothetically, I don't have the evidence,

78
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.300
but several doctors have collected case studies of tinnitus or tinnitus.

79
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.720
Both with pronunciations are correct of the buzzing in your ears.

80
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.740
And being able,

81
00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.720
and people have resolved that from doing microdosing and 30% of Americans

82
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.810
have hearing loss or more is progressive over time.

83
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.510
How much hearing loss leads to depression,

84
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.010
because you can't hear your loved one, say things, and you're getting arguments.

85
00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.590
And I didn't hear you. And you didn't say that. And I mean, just,

86
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.700
it just ramifies out.

87
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:18.660
So the ability of being able to have better cognition,

88
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.850
better neurological development, um, and helping hearing vision,

89
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.493
uh, depression,

90
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.690
if the interesting thing about the microdosing that we've been collecting is,

91
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.340
uh, people tend to be happier and they're happier. They're more creative.

92
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.750
And whether they're more creative or happier, you learning a new kata,

93
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.430
you are excited the next day, you nailed it. You're up and going to do it again.

94
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.660
You're writing a new book, you're doing an artist's work. So creativity breeds,

95
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:52.320
happiness, happiness, breeds, creativity. And then the opposite is true.

96
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.640
Malays and depression. You're not as creative. You're, uh,

97
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.500
you're, you're not enjoying life, not looking forward to the next day.

98
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.900
So I think it's almost a binary choice and the idea of using microdosing and th

99
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.030
the, the definite of microdosing is, is,

100
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.510
has sort of a variable interpretations.

101
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.100
So the using the SolarCity cubensis scale,

102
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.790
which is the most common sell-side mushroom in the world, um,

103
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.250
one gram is liftoff.

104
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.180
Five grams is what Terrence would say was a hero's journey.

105
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.400
And when I was on last, I did with you, I did 20 grams. You know,

106
00:06:31.401 --> 00:06:34.610
that was a little bit much you might say,

107
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.980
but when you do one 10th of a one gram, you don't feel it one 20th,

108
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:40.910
for sure. You don't feel it.

109
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.130
So the idea is you do dosing below the threshold of intoxication,

110
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.850
but then it benefits neurogenesis.

111
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.920
Now there's an extraordinarily interesting study that came out with

112
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.480
mice,

113
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.770
but I think it's translational medicine and they were doing a micro dosing

114
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.290
versus macro dosing. So

115
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.020
these are some numbers,

116
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.860
but basically one gram is almost equivalent to one milligram per kilogram of

117
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:13.490
body weight. 70 kilos is 152 pounds.

118
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.590
And so at one milligram per kilogram of where these mice that's like

119
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:22.610
one gram of cubensis that's, that's a dose. Um, it's not a super high dose,

120
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:25.610
but it's a dose. So what they did with these mice,

121
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.610
as they had them in an arena with a metal floor,

122
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.790
and they gave a tone Dawn, then 40 seconds later,

123
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.620
they were shocked. So they had the tone again, a few minutes later,

124
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.100
40 seconds later, they got shocked. After 10 rotations,

125
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.260
the mice realized like Pavlov's dog,

126
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.580
when there was a tone that was going to be a negative consequence,

127
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:50.830
a shock happening. So the mice were cower in fear.

128
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.290
So then they dosed them with a micro dose 0.1 milligrams per kilogram versus one

129
00:07:56.291 --> 00:08:00.610
milligram per kilogram, one 10th of a, of a dose versus a full dose.

130
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:05.710
Interestingly, the full dose, it took 10 rotations of no shock,

131
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.753
the tone,

132
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:11.620
no shock before they forgot or became reacclimated,

133
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.970
uh, not to have the fear conditioning response with the microdose.

134
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.350
One 10th of that. No, I took two rotations, two rotations.

135
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.370
And so the micro dose and they dissociated potentially PTSD.

136
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.880
Why do you think it's a less, well, that's a really good question.

137
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.300
And the evidence we have so far, and again, this is very early evidence.

138
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.890
Lots of research is going on. This.

139
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.220
It looks at the neurogenic benefits of microdosing are greater than the

140
00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:39.070
neurogenic benefits of macro dosing. You, you flood,

141
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:42.400
the receptors are having this incredible trip has fantastic. It's colorful.

142
00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:44.770
It's life-changing yes,

143
00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.790
that is all beneficial for changing your life, but

144
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.080
dosing over the long term,

145
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.420
because the nerves don't regrow and six hours,

146
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.750
but over weeks of region, generation of nerves with micro-dosing,

147
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.430
it seems to me that the dosing, instead of flooding and overwhelming,

148
00:09:07.431 --> 00:09:09.950
all the receptors are feeding these receptors.

149
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.940
They're allowing for neurogenesis. Now this is a, again, a hypothesis.

150
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.360
There's so many great people studying this right now,

151
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:22.700
but I'm advocating to all of the clinic clinicians at Johns Hopkins at Stanford,

152
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.560
UCLA at Harvard,

153
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:30.080
please do testing of the patients for hearing

154
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:35.210
and vision and other behavioral tests that are

155
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.550
launches about emotion and mood and PTSD,

156
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.310
but let's actually get some physical measurements.

157
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:45.230
So then you can try prior during the day during is too too

158
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.090
complicated. It's too, in too much intervention,

159
00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:49.850
you're tripping your brains out. You don't have time to be tested, you know,

160
00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:52.520
for vision and audit, but then post wise,

161
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.170
and then looking at the residual effects. Now, Dr. James Fadiman,

162
00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:01.580
he has of the Fadiman protocol. I have my protocol established photo protocol.

163
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.140
Uh, James Haldeman's protocol was micro-dosing one day on, uh,

164
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.220
two days off,

165
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.050
one days on my protocol that I'm suggesting is four days on

166
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.670
three days off. Um, and James and I are good friends.

167
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:20.600
We talk about this, laugh. The words were just babies.

168
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.810
Basically these are hypothetical potential treatments.

169
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.240
<v 0>And the comparing data between the two of you.</v>

170
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.320
<v 1>This is what, um, microdose, uh, not me will,</v>

171
00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:33.230
do we want to say, are you following the established protocol,

172
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:37.100
the Fadiman protocol, our own protocol, are you using it with niacin?

173
00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:39.380
Were you doing that with lion's mane? What are you using?

174
00:10:39.381 --> 00:10:44.180
One then lion's mane as phenomenally powerful neurogenic

175
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.480
plea. And we there's two clinical studies out of Japan with mild, uh,

176
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.060
cognitive decline and dementia showing very positive results,

177
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:57.410
taken for a two to four grams of lion's mane per day. The mycelium interesting,

178
00:10:57.411 --> 00:11:00.590
not the fruit bites, the mycelium is much more powerful. Um,

179
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:05.450
and we just have been contracting with a neurological

180
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.070
testing laboratory in France,

181
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.260
and then we just got some amazing results back showing that when we had

182
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:13.970
lion's mane, um,

183
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:19.000
extracts of the mycelium exposed to neurons, and they,

184
00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:23.120
they couldn't pause a control was a brain derived nerve growth factor,

185
00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.223
nerve factor.

186
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.820
And it was used as a baseline for measuring neurogenic compounds,

187
00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:32.600
comparatively, and the neurogenesis benefits from a,

188
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:34.760
this is where the pleura potent stem cells,

189
00:11:34.761 --> 00:11:39.560
stem cells that then differentiate and the neurons and the BD enough clearly

190
00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:42.200
shows that it's a standard protocol with a lion's mane.

191
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.110
It also increased the number of neurons.

192
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:50.630
Then we started looking at analogs of psilocybin and the analogs

193
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.310
when we added the lion's mane mycelium with the salsa and analogs,

194
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:57.040
which are perfectly legal. The non-scheduled one substances.

195
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.820
<v 0>Psilocybin analogs are not exactly as silicide and analog.</v>

196
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.540
<v 1>There's a number of them that have been reported in the literature there's bay</v>

197
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:08.980
assistant and Norberto system are two of the more prominent ones.

198
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.920
Now. Um,

199
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.810
I I'm a psycho not and 1960

200
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.730
bail system,

201
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.560
a report of a child died outside of Kelso,

202
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:28.510
Washington from eating mushrooms in his yard, the family ingested the mushrooms.

203
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.160
Um, they went to the hospital, the child developed a fever,

204
00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:37.210
eventually had renal failure and died. Uh,

205
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.840
I a chemist by the name of lung and then, uh,

206
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:44.680
Benedict and Tyler picked up on this. They analyze the mushrooms,

207
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.970
looking for a new toxin.

208
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.960
The mushrooms were identified as being [inaudible] beyo cistus.

209
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.220
It is a mushroom that goes in Washington state and Oregon sometimes in British

210
00:12:54.221 --> 00:12:56.830
Columbia, but not in Northern California. It's very rare species,

211
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:57.664
but grows in yards.

212
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.230
When they analyze the mushroom looking for our new potential toxins,

213
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:06.280
they found this alkaloid, it's a Dartmouth tryptamine based compound,

214
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.510
and they named it biosystem after sloppy bowel cistus.

215
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.850
So biosystem had the reputation of potentially being a deadly poisonous toxin is

216
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:18.460
present and cubensis is present in many souls.

217
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:21.700
I have mushrooms and my books also have mushed under the world has charts that

218
00:13:21.701 --> 00:13:23.290
show home it's Biosystems in these things,

219
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.640
but no one had ever eat a consumed biosystem because this reputation

220
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.650
bay assistant is legal.

221
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.990
I obtained some pure biosystem from a laboratory legally.

222
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.550
I have no soul sovereign, you know,

223
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.870
nature provides I don't people make this very clear, um, but I can have,

224
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.200
I can possess these salts have been analogs. And so, uh,

225
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.230
since there was no reports in the scientific literature of whether this was

226
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:52.150
truly toxic or not, I with my doctor,

227
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:55.900
friend of mine, MD that measured my vitals and hooked me up, you know,

228
00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.340
to blood pressure, ECG that all the biometrics that are needed.

229
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.850
And so we did an end of one study.

230
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.230
I decided that even though it has a history of potentially of killing this

231
00:14:08.231 --> 00:14:11.920
child, I think that's a false positive. I think it was bad science.

232
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.120
I couldn't find no one who ever adjusted this. So I decided I would ingest it.

233
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.280
Now, my friend, Pam, she's an MD that goes into, um,

234
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.130
and the Antarctica, she's the only doctor on a research vessel.

235
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.790
And so she goes down there and she gets to bring a roommate and it was me.

236
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.240
And so Pam and I were working really hard to be had.

237
00:14:31.241 --> 00:14:34.000
All of our plan tickets were ready to go to Antarctica.

238
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.410
We had been planning this for months. Um, and then we decided, well,

239
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:41.350
just before go Paulus, do the biosystem test. You know,

240
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.620
we had talked about this for months. We finally got the time to do this,

241
00:14:44.621 --> 00:14:46.420
but the next day we're going to Antarctica.

242
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.890
So Penn looks at her cell phone and this,

243
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:54.500
this Russian research crashed into a reef, tore a hole in it.

244
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.930
And it's like, as now the trip is canceled now. I mean, I'm American express,

245
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.370
you know, plane tickets, hotels.

246
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.900
I got 24 hours to try to recapture all this money because I can't, we can't go,

247
00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.930
the shutter trips are in canceled. So I had super high anxiety.

248
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:13.250
I told my doctor friend, I, I, I have too much anxiety. I can't go,

249
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.370
this is too crazy. And then she kind of looked at me on listening.

250
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:20.300
We've been planning this for months. Um, you know, please.

251
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.740
And I listened to her.

252
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.580
And so I did 10 milligrams of bail system.

253
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:30.410
And she had measured my heartbeat, blood pressure, all those, all those metrics.

254
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.130
My eyes did dilate. She said that was good. And so I was out drunk, like a.

255
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.300
And then she checked in with me every 10, 15 minutes, 20 minutes a year yearly,

256
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.360
you have left off one hour, you're full blown into it.

257
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.560
And she talked with me and she talked with me and she asked,

258
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.080
and I didn't get high. I'm not alone. She goes, how do you feel? And I said,

259
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.600
I feel great. I have no anxiety. Everything with this trip is going to be fine.

260
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.880
So here we found a analog of psilocybin that does not get you high

261
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.730
that's legal, that reduced anxiety.

262
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.570
I think this is the tip of the proverbial iceberg because all the clinical

263
00:16:08.571 --> 00:16:12.200
studies are approved right now for pure psilocybin. What about the analogs?

264
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.600
They activate other receptor sites, you know,

265
00:16:14.601 --> 00:16:18.020
in your field and your neuro neurological field.

266
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.610
And that's why I think this is why looking at the natural form of these

267
00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:24.560
mushrooms standardized to a sole Simon,

268
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.380
a certain concentration versus the pure molecule.

269
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.910
I think that is the way of the future because pure cells, Ivan is up to six,

270
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:34.880
$7,000 a gram, uh,

271
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.650
and you can translate that into growing. I have mushrooms for $2 a gram.

272
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.900
Now there are people out there listening, saying, well,

273
00:16:41.901 --> 00:16:43.430
the price is coming down. Indeed it is,

274
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.220
is down maybe to a thousand to $500 a gram,

275
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.230
but how many people in the urban low, lower income,

276
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:55.640
you know, uh, impoverished population suffering from PTSD,

277
00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:00.080
who don't can't afford to go to Johns Hopkins to spend tens of thousands of

278
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:05.060
dollars to have a clinical treatment. I think this democratizes the,

279
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.240
uh, the use of psilocybin and micro dosing,

280
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.790
that could be a benefit across our society.

281
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.520
And then my proposing is you stock it with niacin.

282
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.440
And the reason why you stack it with niacin is you take one 10th of a gram of

283
00:17:18.441 --> 00:17:20.750
sloppy cubensis microdose.

284
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.070
You add a hundred to 200 milligrams of niacin. Now,

285
00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.610
if someone tries to get high by taking 10 times as much,

286
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.110
they'll have like two grams of niacin. This is a flushing niacin, vitamin B3,

287
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.640
and that flushing nice.

288
00:17:34.641 --> 00:17:37.910
And we'll give you such an irritable reaction of skin touching of people who've

289
00:17:37.911 --> 00:17:40.010
taken vitamin B three, they know this.

290
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:43.640
So it becomes the ant abuse for microdosing,

291
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.950
but more over it excites, um, the, uh, nerves,

292
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:49.680
uh,

293
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.430
at the end of the peripheral nervous system and neuropathies oftentimes present

294
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:56.280
themselves a deadening of the fingertip, the nerves of the fingertips and toes.

295
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.990
And it's also a vasodilator.

296
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.550
So there's three attributes of stocking niacin with silicide mushrooms.

297
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.430
So it prevents abuse becomes the anti-abuse,

298
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:10.140
it dilates the blood vessels to deliver the neurogenic benefits of Seoul, Simon,

299
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.740
to the endpoints points of the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous

300
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:18.090
system. Um, and, um, it then, and also excites the nerve ending.

301
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:22.110
So I think those three reasons this could, uh,

302
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.430
I hope to see the future silicide mushrooms being over the counter

303
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:31.410
vitamins approved by the FDA stock with niacin that allows for the

304
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:34.740
universality of use for the benefit, uh, of our,

305
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.530
our culture and what we were talking last time.

306
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:39.860
<v 0>Can I pause you there for a second?</v>

307
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.550
Is there any other evidence of people taking these analogs and having this

308
00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:45.530
anti-anxiety effect other than you, I mean,

309
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:49.610
this seems so very small sample size, right? It's just one person.

310
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.070
<v 1>Yes. There are as an antidepressant,</v>

311
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.130
as far as anxiety and depression are interrelated.

312
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.780
There are reports James Fadiman in his studies. He is population study,

313
00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:03.770
which had admittedly small, did not see an anti anxiety component,

314
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.050
but other clinical studies at John Hopkins, also the anxiety of dying.

315
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.450
<v 0>From cancer. But that was actually silicide.</v>

316
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.320
But what I'm saying with you is also,

317
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:19.460
you had a very profoundly stressful situation happening,

318
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:21.650
something you had prepared for for a long time,

319
00:19:21.651 --> 00:19:23.930
then all of a sudden it was gone and all this money's gone,

320
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.390
you got to try to figure out how to get it back. He's like it's immediate.

321
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.400
Right? Right. Maybe with these other people,

322
00:19:28.401 --> 00:19:33.020
they didn't have such an immediate anxiety moment and maybe their

323
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:36.500
anxiety, it was harder to measure whether it was coming or going.

324
00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.830
<v 1>Absolutely. Um, is there one study this needs,</v>

325
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:42.800
this is just me. No, the.

326
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.150
<v 0>Other one with the other people that have, uh, experienced it,</v>

327
00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:49.280
but didn't experience any anti-anxiety.

328
00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:53.780
<v 1>What else that we know in the scientific literature, Johann guards mentions. He,</v>

329
00:19:53.781 --> 00:19:55.580
I published philosophy algebra lessons with them.

330
00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:59.960
The most potent sell-side mushroom in the world you'll hand guards says in one

331
00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:03.890
thing that he was asked and he said that the bail system was equal to that of

332
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.770
Saul, Simon. I don't have high confidence in that statement.

333
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.970
I considered by a system I was ready for lift off. I was hoping for lift off.

334
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:14.870
I know, but liftoff feels like, and I didn't get it. So, so this is,

335
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.720
this is what happens in science so much is the

336
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:24.020
scientists, when the, you can't do a clinical study, we bioassay,

337
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.150
this is very common. This is how Albert Hoffman discovered LSD. He bioassays it.

338
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:31.550
<v 0>So we need to do it accidentally though. He did.</v>

339
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.670
<v 1>It accidentally, right. Got in and went for this famous bike ride.</v>

340
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:37.970
But then he did it purposely, uh, after that. But nevertheless,

341
00:20:37.971 --> 00:20:41.660
this is what our scientific, you know, psycho knots must do sometimes.

342
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.690
Yeah. Sasha Shogun is famous for it,

343
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.000
the most famous of all and the most revered. Um,

344
00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:52.270
and he bioassay based on his knowledge of chemistry,

345
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.520
he wasn't going to try to commit suicide. So, so,

346
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.380
so this is really an area that I think has enormous, um,

347
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.520
value and a several medicine studies have come out.

348
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:04.721
Uh,

349
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:08.410
one that I had mentioned before is a population of several hundred thousand pro

350
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.273
prisoners.

351
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.050
And there was a 18% reduction in violent crime and,

352
00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:16.170
um, 22% or so,

353
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:21.280
a reduction in larceny and theft in a population where they reported,

354
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:25.360
they had one psilocybin mushroom experience. Um,

355
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.930
and statistically significant now association may not be causation,

356
00:21:28.931 --> 00:21:31.960
but it can be, but a more recent study from British Columbia,

357
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:37.600
which I find to be so fascinating is that they did

358
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:41.740
a large population set and partner and a partner violence.

359
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.390
If you're a male partner had done one psilocybin trip

360
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.300
to stitch the statistically significant reduction of the probability of

361
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:56.020
that partner being violent towards the other partner,

362
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.730
statistically significant. So I always thought that there's a dating app.

363
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.240
Maybe you should have the dating app. Have you tripped on soul Simon? Yes.

364
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:08.050
Well that may be a better candidate for dating.

365
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.760
So I think psilocybin makes nicer people. And I think we,

366
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:16.900
didn't a lot more nicer people that are more creative that are dedicated to

367
00:22:16.901 --> 00:22:20.020
helping the community. And I think this is a,

368
00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.480
a potential paradigm shifting, uh, drug unquestionably.

369
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.690
<v 0>And here's the other thing. This could be profit. I mean, these,</v>

370
00:22:27.691 --> 00:22:31.830
these companies that are seeking to profit off of pharmaceutical drugs,

371
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:33.360
you can profit off this stuff,

372
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.080
particularly with the protocol that you just described with the adding nice into

373
00:22:37.081 --> 00:22:40.890
it, to ensure that people are doing only microdosing. Look, man,

374
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:45.630
this could be a very profitable enterprise for some company. And the benefits.

375
00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.410
If, if people can mirror the benefits that you had of this, uh,

376
00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:51.690
alleviation of anxiety, I mean, God,

377
00:22:51.691 --> 00:22:54.060
that's like most of what people struggle with.

378
00:22:54.061 --> 00:22:56.670
So many people out there listening to this right now, like,

379
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.250
I wish there was something that didn't get me high,

380
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:04.260
but just to alleviate this [inaudible] that so many people are struggling with

381
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.123
every day.

382
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:10.770
<v 1>I'd say it's a massive disease complex as swept our societies and,</v>

383
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.480
um, and the, and facing all these problems. How could you not become depressed?

384
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.800
Well, you cannot become depressed by becoming creative. And I think that Saul,

385
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.900
Simon and microdosing enables the creative pathways for ingenuity,

386
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.790
for us to feel that we have meaning we can make a meaningful difference.

387
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.770
And it's really important. You know, we've entered into six acts,

388
00:23:34.771 --> 00:23:37.740
the sixth greatest extinction event known in the history of life on this planet.

389
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:42.390
We've have two other extinction events from asteroid impacts 250 million years

390
00:23:42.391 --> 00:23:43.740
ago, 65 million years ago.

391
00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:47.120
But we're in now involved in a massive extinction event.

392
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:52.370
And the research that came out today and the other resource has come out with

393
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:55.070
75% of the insect population,

394
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.630
40% in an immediate jeopardy. The research article came out,

395
00:23:59.631 --> 00:24:03.020
said in Europe and north America, they have good data collection in Amazon.

396
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.950
They don't. So what do you mean having measured the insect loss in the Amazon,

397
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:12.170
but if you're a trout, if you're a bird, if you like, uh, drinking coffee,

398
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.830
uh, and you like chocolate and you like almonds, I mean,

399
00:24:15.831 --> 00:24:20.750
these are all dependent upon pollinators. Um, so we lose these flying insects.

400
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:24.680
We lose the pollination services and it threatens worldwide food biosecurity.

401
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.500
This is one of the biggest threats start ecosystem.

402
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:32.360
Now I think we can invent our ways out of this. If we creatively,

403
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:36.260
you know, expand our ability to come up with novel solutions.

404
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.710
And I think those solutions are literally underfoot on all around us today.

405
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.530
We just have to wake up. Like I woke up to helping the bees,

406
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.770
so many smart people out there.

407
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.780
If they just started realizing the nature is a deep well of evolutionary

408
00:24:50.781 --> 00:24:54.980
knowledge and that we have evolved within this complexity

409
00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.780
then to delve into that library of knowledge and pulling out applicable

410
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:03.350
solutions that had by science controlled studies,

411
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.450
but not looking at these pharmaceutical pure molecules as the way of the future,

412
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.720
but looking at the, upon the complexity of the microbiome,

413
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.760
the complex interrelationships and selecting out microbiomes that then quake

414
00:25:16.761 --> 00:25:20.090
guilds of solutions that are applicable to the problems that we face today.

415
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.970
<v 2>All right. I like that idea. All.</v>

416
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.030
<v 0>Of it. It's just, it's,</v>

417
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.680
it's beautiful that there are these natural solutions that, you know,

418
00:25:29.681 --> 00:25:34.630
maybe if we could just shift people's ideas about how we view

419
00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.240
psilocybin and how we view the analogs,

420
00:25:37.241 --> 00:25:41.710
how we view the interaction with people in nature that you can, you know,

421
00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:44.980
we can make a real change, make a change.

422
00:25:44.981 --> 00:25:48.430
That's tangible inside of our lifetime. And again,

423
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.890
selling this stuff like if, look,

424
00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.830
we're seeing what's happening right now with medical marijuana and then shifting

425
00:25:53.831 --> 00:25:57.340
to commercial marijuana and now hemp it's giant. I mean,

426
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.650
this is a huge industry through it's changed Colorado,

427
00:25:59.651 --> 00:26:02.050
Colorado Denver's real estate has gone through the roof.

428
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:06.460
People are moving there so much that they've got traffic problems.

429
00:26:06.461 --> 00:26:10.780
Now they never conceived of in the past it's it's changed their economy and it's

430
00:26:10.781 --> 00:26:14.800
changed their economy due to just a really obvious shift. Here's the shift.

431
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.010
Marijuana is not bad for you. It's not, we thought it was, it's not,

432
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.610
we're sorry. You could have it now and now you could sell it.

433
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.490
And now it's legal, but federally we're still dealing with schedule one.

434
00:26:24.491 --> 00:26:27.940
So it's, it's there. These shifts are happening.

435
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.220
These companies are investing money.

436
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.130
There's a lot of profit to be made and a lot of people are profiting,

437
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.950
but it's still in this weird transitionary stage.

438
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:40.060
<v 1>Is, but this is a people's revolution. When you have decriminalized, uh, uh,</v>

439
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.440
nature coming out of Oakland,

440
00:26:41.441 --> 00:26:46.110
which I'm fully in favor of how dare we make a species illegal at that makes no

441
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:46.500
sense to.

442
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.350
<v 0>Me. What is Oakland specifically? They've made Iowasca psilocybin? What else?</v>

443
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:51.950
Um.

444
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.770
<v 1>All natural products was psychoactive properties to the best of my</v>

445
00:26:54.771 --> 00:26:57.200
understanding, uh, both Denver and Oakland.

446
00:26:57.290 --> 00:27:01.820
They removed the funding of the four prosecutors and judges in the

447
00:27:01.821 --> 00:27:02.380
courts.

448
00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.100
So you can't use public funds in order to prosecute people for possession.

449
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.450
So this is a visual arrest them for it though. Well, the law enforcement,

450
00:27:11.451 --> 00:27:13.340
officer's not getting paid, he's not doing his job.

451
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.160
He's violating his code of conduct. Um,

452
00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.130
you arrest them and you take them to a prosecutor. A project goes,

453
00:27:19.131 --> 00:27:21.770
I have no funding for this. Uh, you're wasting our time.

454
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.610
You're just coming here. I was wasting my time. I have murders. What.

455
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.360
<v 0>If someone's selling it? Decriminalization does not.</v>

456
00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:33.170
It doesn't prevent you from being prosecuted for selling a segue schedule one

457
00:27:33.171 --> 00:27:34.004
substance, right.

458
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.030
<v 1>That's a really, really good question. And I have, um, thoughts on it.</v>

459
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.920
That's controversial, uh, because this speaks to the ability of, uh,

460
00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:46.550
some people having access and not if you want,

461
00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.150
I only trip on silicide mushrooms once or twice a year. Um, that's all,

462
00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:55.850
all I need as Terence McKenna. And I think Alan Watts said when, when you, uh,

463
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.090
when you get the message from the phone, hang it up. Um,

464
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.800
so if you just have these souls have mushrooms growing in your

465
00:28:03.801 --> 00:28:07.310
backyard, or you know how to collect them, um,

466
00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:11.810
then you only need one or two doses a year and even micro dosing. You know,

467
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:16.220
you get, you get a lot more extension of that. But my,

468
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:20.870
my view and I I've never had any problem with lawns for forcement, um,

469
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.621
in Washington,

470
00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:25.940
Oregon and British Columbia in Canada in particular law enforcement has a very

471
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.840
pretty mature attitude towards this, the view of a small amount.

472
00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:33.950
And you're not trafficking and you're for individual use. It's just,

473
00:28:33.951 --> 00:28:36.380
doesn't raise the level of the need for them.

474
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.770
<v 0>No, I understand that, but I just wish there was no incentive at all.</v>

475
00:28:39.771 --> 00:28:41.360
There was nothing there like this,

476
00:28:41.361 --> 00:28:44.390
the idea that you have to rely on the good grace of a cop who understands that

477
00:28:44.391 --> 00:28:48.200
there's no incentive to arrest you. That seems like horse to me. Like we're,

478
00:28:48.201 --> 00:28:52.640
we're grown adults in 2019 with a mountain of evidence. This is not,

479
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.230
we're not living in the dark ages anymore.

480
00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:58.240
In the fact that it's still a possibility that you get arrested, or you could,

481
00:28:58.241 --> 00:29:02.240
you could face some sort of criminal charges for having something that's only

482
00:29:02.241 --> 00:29:03.680
been demonstrated to be good.

483
00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.070
<v 1>Why is the citizens movement? The federal government? I mean,</v>

484
00:29:07.071 --> 00:29:10.460
the Republicans and conservatives and libertarians are all about state rights.

485
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.990
This is a people's movement.

486
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.320
They should get behind this because individual community rights, uh,

487
00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:20.120
against the big man against, uh, the federal government, the federal government,

488
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:24.440
there needs to be a title change. And how do we do that is because we, uh,

489
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:28.310
we have decriminalized, uh, uh, nature in Oregon.

490
00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.420
We have the de vendor, Denver initiative, other cities around the country.

491
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.340
It's now spreading throughout the entire country.

492
00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.930
There's probably 20 cities and the next 16 months they're going to have

493
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.850
decriminalization the city.

494
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:46.480
<v 0>I also think it's a significant solution to this problem that we're facing with</v>

495
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.490
pills and a lot of destructive drugs.

496
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:51.400
There's a lot of self-destructive drugs that people are taking because these

497
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:55.390
people are hurting. What, what siliciden gives you that these drugs don't,

498
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.590
it gives you a potential to heal. It gives you a moment to reflect.

499
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:03.100
It gives you a change in the way you think, and you interface with the world,

500
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.580
and that just doesn't exist in those other drugs. Those drugs are escape drugs,

501
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.940
and the need to escape is what we got to eliminate.

502
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.460
And I think that's one of the things that psilocybin can help.

503
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.860
It can help alleviate the need to escape.

504
00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:19.600
<v 1>And, um, uh, shout out to, uh, Rick, uh, Doblin and Atlanta, uh, uh,</v>

505
00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.400
Galilee, um, of maps, um, maps.org,

506
00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.630
the multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies, uh,

507
00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:34.290
maps.org and maps.ca in Canada, um, have been instrumental in bringing,

508
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.630
uh, forward, uh, secondary, uh, drugs for PTSD and clinical studies. Uh,

509
00:30:39.631 --> 00:30:44.490
maps is now in phase three with MBMA with MTMA on a couple of

510
00:30:44.491 --> 00:30:47.910
times. So yeah, his, I mean, he's a real pioneer in this.

511
00:30:47.911 --> 00:30:52.350
And so what's interesting in getting now I'm from three different groups.

512
00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:55.050
I have heard, who've sat down with FDA scientists.

513
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:59.760
There's been a new turnover within the FDA and the scientists are looking at

514
00:30:59.761 --> 00:31:02.850
just pure science without politics. They don't care about politics.

515
00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.060
They want to help people. And, uh, several of them have said,

516
00:31:06.061 --> 00:31:09.030
they've never seen it with psilocybin in particular,

517
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.100
a safer drug with such a dramatic impact was so infrequency of use

518
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.530
one or two times. Um,

519
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.270
and so there was a movie that just came out called fantastic

520
00:31:21.271 --> 00:31:25.890
fungi and, um, and Michael Poland's in there, I'm in there.

521
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.010
Um, uh, Louie Schwartzberg has put it out. He,

522
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.360
he spent 12 years working on this movie. That's fantastic. fungi.com.

523
00:31:33.361 --> 00:31:38.010
It's a grass roots movement. Theaters are selling out all over the country. Uh,

524
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:40.170
they book it in New York city for one night.

525
00:31:40.171 --> 00:31:42.750
They have to keep it in for a week because they're standing lines,

526
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.870
a sanding room, you know, long lines to get into the theater.

527
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.790
And it's all about the use of mushrooms and the John Hopkins, uh,

528
00:31:50.791 --> 00:31:55.380
studies with end of life patients. Um, it's very, very well done.

529
00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.100
Um, but it speaks to this is that this is literally, um,

530
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.520
quote unquote underground movement. That's welling up. And the,

531
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:07.890
the attraction that people have for this is a reflection of the title

532
00:32:07.891 --> 00:32:09.480
change that is happening. Now,

533
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.250
this is a worldwide movement that is sweeping through the mycelial underground,

534
00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.390
through connection. So something I'd very much encourage you to,

535
00:32:17.391 --> 00:32:18.470
to see fantastic.
