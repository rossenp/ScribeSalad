00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know, music industry stuff.</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.930
I think, uh,

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.240
I've been working really hard to go against the grain of like right now I'm,

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.780
self-released like I don't have a record company and I'm self-funded,

5
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.820
and it's really hard. Um,

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.600
but it's also really gratifying at the same time because, you know,

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
right now I, since I left honey, honey, um, you know,

8
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:31.320
like, honey, honey is kind of on ice for, you know, sort of.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
<v 1>You didn't knew the territory. No.</v>

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.310
<v 0>Yeah. Well, we were figuring it out, you know? Well,</v>

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.860
well said, oh my God.

12
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.680
But you know, the, the battle is, um,

13
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.510
getting ahead, you know, and,

14
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:56.220
and being a woman and being in my thirties and, and not like,

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.630
you know, no one wants to hop on board until they know it's working,

16
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.440
even though I made this incredible record and it's so well received.

17
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.080
And then folks are like, yeah, well, you know, calls when it's,

18
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.000
when it's working rather than like, get in now. Right. And, you know,

19
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.350
I feel, I don't feel discouraged by that. I feel informed. Um,

20
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.820
but that that's, uh, also a business move, you know, because it is,

21
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.530
we're taking art and turning it into commerce and no one wants to bet on a horse

22
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:30.210
that's not winning yet, you know? Um, and you know, I'm pretty,

23
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.830
I feel pretty good about what I'm doing.

24
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.150
I don't think I should be doing something else, but it's still a struggle,

25
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:38.790
you know? So when I said, I want to change the narrative, it's,

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.840
it's sort of like,

27
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.690
I want to kind of prove to myself and

28
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:49.530
others that like, you can do it. Like you find a way, you know, and it's,

29
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:52.260
it's really hard. Um, but you can do it, you know,

30
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.520
and you get help from your friends. Like,

31
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.230
this is so cool to be here with you guys. Like, I,

32
00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.440
I don't know if I could really convey that enough,

33
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.820
that this is a huge help to what I'm trying to do right now.

34
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.830
Um, but yeah, also this is the thing that keeps me up at night and being like,

35
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.060
oh my God, this is, but at the same time,

36
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.130
you know, um, the music industry, I'll just speak to that right now.

37
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.993
It's tough.

38
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.980
<v 1>Well, it seems to me, if I,</v>

39
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.060
as an outsider has no business in the music business. When I look at it,

40
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:28.980
I feel like it's a big ship that had to like cut

41
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:33.870
parts of itself off. And now it's a smaller ship. And now it's like, whoa,

42
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.300
it's still a pretty big ship, but it's not what it used to be. The,

43
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.930
the money doesn't come in anymore in the form of record sales. So it's,

44
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:41.764
it's entrenched,

45
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.330
it's tentacles deeper into the industry and other things like merchandise and

46
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.050
live shows and all these different things to stay alive. And maybe it helps,

47
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.440
maybe it doesn't, it depends entirely upon the artist, but I,

48
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.710
what you're doing at your point in your life where you're like, look,

49
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.140
this isn't working. Like what, what do I need to do?

50
00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:02.270
Like being attached to this group is not doing it. Being attached.

51
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.540
That group is not doing it. What's what the is doing it.

52
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.770
Let me just try to not be attached to someone. Yeah. And through the internet,

53
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:13.390
you have the option to put your stuff out there and it gets a reaction from

54
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:17.050
people with stuff like this, and then they go, oh, this is talented.

55
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.410
<v 0>Well, you know, thanks. First of all, it's sweet. I know. I love you.</v>

56
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.340
I love you too. I, it's not like I want to like take over the world.

57
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.880
I just want to like, make a good living, doing what I love. That's all I want,

58
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.860
you know, and it's, it's hard. I know it's hard, but it's also, um,

59
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.900
yeah, like it, it, you know, I want to capture that thing.

60
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:45.730
I want to get into the right tune into the right radio station and also not have

61
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:48.340
to worry so much about like,

62
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.750
not having enough to get by, you know, that kind of thing. And it's,

63
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.750
it sounds silly, but it's not like that. That is my reality.

64
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.500
<v 1>This is the major function of a record label, not hating,</v>

65
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.800
just wondering what's the major function of a record label when you're not

66
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:05.470
really necessarily selling records. So.

67
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.040
<v 0>They.</v>

68
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.310
<v 1>Try to blow up anybody's business. Well, you.</v>

69
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.730
<v 0>You can, you want to weigh in on this?</v>

70
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.820
<v 2>I can give a little bit, uh,</v>

71
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.570
there for marketing promotion marketing, um, the,

72
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.330
the folks who help you with budgets for tour, um.

73
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.070
<v 0>They're a bank.</v>

74
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.290
<v 1>So when it says like, yeah, just for tour,</v>

75
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.580
is that because you have to lay out money in advance to set up a set and to make

76
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:32.200
sure that everybody gets to the place,

77
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:36.460
they have the money to get to the event and set everything up and then,

78
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.350
then they would reap some of the rewards.

79
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.350
So it's almost like an initial investment and then based on return.

80
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.380
<v 2>Right. So, yeah, so like, you know, it's,</v>

81
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.130
it's expensive to be out on tour. It's,

82
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.650
it's a lot to be out with someone you're paying for anything and everything,

83
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.210
right. You're paying to play basically.

84
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.840
And so what they do is they come in and they'll help you with things like that.

85
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:03.820
And, and, and, uh, but sometimes it doesn't work for, for people,

86
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.683
you know, and that's,

87
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.620
that's the thing is like people coming to this thing going, oh, I've made it,

88
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:12.580
I've got this, this deal, but if your record doesn't hit or whatever,

89
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.040
it doesn't hit, then they've invested all this money. So it was kind of,

90
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.170
it puts this extra pressure on you to figure out what you need to

91
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:21.370
do to make it.

92
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:26.020
And I think some people go down a different route and would change up,

93
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.580
switch up the thing and, and, and, um, but they, they can be very helpful.

94
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.090
It, it depends on your attitude too. A lot of it is your attitude.

95
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.750
And what you think of like, you know, are you being taken advantage of,

96
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:40.780
or is this an investment or this is gonna pay off because there's,

97
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:44.100
so it goes so up and down, you know, depending on.

98
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.500
<v 1>I would imagine it'd be hard to be free and creative and having a good time with</v>

99
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:47.621
it.

100
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:50.770
If you feel like you're being taken advantage of it would put a dark cloud over

101
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:51.370
it.

102
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.061
<v 0>Well, there's that,</v>

103
00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:56.290
and I think there's also the misconception that once you get a big record deal

104
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.630
and I've had a, where you think all of a sudden,

105
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.530
like you have to stop doing something and they're going to do it for you.

106
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.450
That is like the biggest mistake you could ever make it. And if anything,

107
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:11.000
you have to work harder and prove to them that like,

108
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.160
you're kind of worthy of their time and money. You know, sometimes it depends.

109
00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:18.650
It depends on the company, but, you know,

110
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.150
essentially like when you sign a deal with, with these folks,

111
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:27.590
like they have a lot of your creative integrity in, in some ways,

112
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:32.210
depending on the deal and how it's shaped. Um, and you know,

113
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.900
they own your copyright. If they want to own your record,

114
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.900
depending on your deal, sometimes you have more leverage than others.

115
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.080
And you know, if that's the case, like, yeah, good for you.

116
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.730
<v 1>Did they own the whole thing, but they could ever own the whole thing. Well,</v>

117
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.760
I sell, I sell, Philly's sell it for an exorbitant amount of money.

118
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.110
The idea that you would own the whole song, like they would own the writing,

119
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.970
the music [inaudible].

120
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.330
<v 0>Okay.</v>

121
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.730
<v 1>So you could still have someone else to that song.</v>

122
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.060
<v 0>Okay. So I self released my last record, Ruby red,</v>

123
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.990
and I learned a lot because I hired my own PR, um,

124
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.550
and distribution companies.

125
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:14.870
And I really got into the nuts and bolts on how all this works. And,

126
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.760
um, I'm not sure if this has changed. Cause sometimes this is, you know,

127
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:22.160
going back and forth. But when you own your copyright,

128
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.880
the digital return on things like Spotify and iTunes are 10 to one.

129
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.280
So when the record companies own your copyright and all of your streaming

130
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.650
is, is like kicking, like just taking off. They're making tons of money on.

131
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.900
<v 1>Your streaming 10 times more than you are. Yes.</v>

132
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.020
<v 0>Yes. I know.</v>

133
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.250
<v 1>Wow. Your labor's now earning over 1 million per hour from streaming.</v>

134
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.940
Holy So they figured it out.

135
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.310
They figured out how to get deeper into the arteries,

136
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.420
like real close to the heart.

137
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.230
<v 0>The hustle is like trying to get, but they also,</v>

138
00:08:00.231 --> 00:08:02.840
they also have the keys to a lot of doors. You know,

139
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.370
it's like a weird trade-off.

140
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.000
<v 1>I do,</v>

141
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.830
but I have a feeling if you just look at the landscape that that is less and

142
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:13.340
less of an issue almost every year. I don't know if they,

143
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.020
as long as you don't create feuds,

144
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.090
I don't think they necessarily have the keys to arenas.

145
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.710
I think if you go through major agencies that that's solved and I think

146
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.250
distribution over the internet, just through people,

147
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:28.250
finding out about it and sharing it, tossing it around,

148
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.200
it's probably as useful if not better than anything. Right.

149
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:36.120
Because I'll find out about it. Podcast, find out about it.

150
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.230
And people on Twitter find out about it. They retweet, people,

151
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:40.700
Instagram repost stuff.

152
00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.760
And then it hits millions and millions and millions and millions of people,

153
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:47.420
a hundred percent organic. And it happens all the time when is good. I mean,

154
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:51.920
it's almost like you're your bank rolling on

155
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.370
it. Not being a good idea. If you do it with somebody else, it's like,

156
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:59.070
what you're doing is like bankrolling yourself. You're saying, look,

157
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.980
I believe in myself, let's just put this out.

158
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.940
Whereas if you deal with a label, you have to, so many people have to be,

159
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:06.960
and there's nothing wrong with it.

160
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.290
And I'm sure it's worked out great for both of you and on numerous occasions.

161
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.240
But someone who has to believe in you, you have to,

162
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.850
you have to work with someone there's a lot involved.

163
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.360
<v 0>And I'm sure like, well, first of all, there are some great companies.</v>

164
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:21.900
I don't know what, like, you know, what, what label you work with,

165
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.460
but we're good.

166
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.480
Like some of them and obviously, cause you're,

167
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.210
you're amazing and you're crushing it. And you know,

168
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.130
like some companies, that's not the case and you know,

169
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.050
people's jobs depend on your success and if they're scared and they go in and

170
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:43.890
this, in this way that it's not like, um,

171
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.710
it doesn't hit or something like they drop you fast and you know,

172
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.220
I'll I'll speak. Oh yeah. Hmm. Maybe not.

173
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.290
<v 1>[Inaudible] together. Well,</v>

174
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.190
you remember when prince had to change his name to a symbol? Oh yeah. Yeah.

175
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.500
<v 0>Exactly. That is a perfect.</v>

176
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.540
<v 1>Perfect example. Imagine you are trying to keep prints. That's just business.</v>

177
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.530
G O a T is of all time, right?

178
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.690
I mean all time goats he's he was androgynous before

179
00:10:18.691 --> 00:10:22.530
anybody knew what the it was. He was dancing around with high heels.

180
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.690
No one could say because it was so good.

181
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.620
Think about all the homophobia we were talking about. Transphobia homophobia.

182
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.930
Think about all the he must've endured in like 1988

183
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:37.380
or whatever the it is when he put out that first album and it didn't matter.

184
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.840
And everybody was so good. Everybody had just had a step,

185
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:44.610
the back like purple rain. It was the way he was dressed was ridiculous.

186
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.940
Imagine if Ryan Reynolds was in a movie about a singer who dressed like

187
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:51.420
Princeton turbo grade, he'll say he's so good.

188
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:55.830
He gave himself a handicap. He said, I'm going to dress like a king.

189
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.370
I say because my music is so good.

190
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.170
He would drive up in a motorcycle helmet, shut the up. I'm doing that right.

191
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.550
I want him prince. He was on another planet. Like, come on.
