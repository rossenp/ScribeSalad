00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So you don't get high at all? No, no,</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.830
I have, I have, yeah, I, um, for my,

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.150
my 26th birthday was the first time I tried it.

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.920
What happened? Nothing, nothing, nothing. I mean,

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.200
I guess I didn't know how to do, I didn't know how to inhale it.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.070
I didn't know how to smoke it. And, uh, you know, I'm like, this does nothing.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.940
I hit it. Like maybe two, three times it does nothing. I didn't feel a thing.

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.290
And then that same year I had to, I think it was 26. Yeah. I was thinking,

9
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.730
was it last year? I was at the

10
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.530
training center Allenby training center and, um, and I had to do,

11
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.270
I did the ultimate fighter, season 14.

12
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:46.920
I was a wrestling coach for T mayhem Miller. And, uh,

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.150
me and mayhem would sit cause we were in the same house and we'd, uh,

14
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.170
we'd sit on the balcony at night after filming all day would come and he'd, uh,

15
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.200
he'd smoke and would just relax and he decompressed.

16
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.440
And that was the crazy thing about ma'am to smart guy. Yeah. I mean, yeah,

17
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.180
he had a crazy pat,

18
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.590
but smart guy who would just come back and sit there and relax and just think,

19
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.090
and he would say certain things. Um, and then he was like, yo,

20
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.110
you should try this. You should try this. I'm like, nah,

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.450
that doesn't do nothing for me, man. I just, I already tried it.

22
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.300
The does nothing for it. He's like, you don't have rock

23
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.840
and I'm like, no, it doesn't do anything for me, man. And then he's like, uh,

24
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.640
try this edible. And it's a, it's an edible is a peanut brittle. Ooh, Jesus.

25
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:36.160
Second. I'd just like a fat piece of my province. Don't we doesn't do it.

26
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.960
It doesn't affect me bro. And this indeed for me. And uh,

27
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.160
I had had a bite, a big piece to them eating it. Cause it was like, it was good.

28
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.280
It was chocolate. It was can just eating them, eat them like, ah,

29
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.990
this is nothing. And uh, maybe like six, seven minutes later,

30
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:56.250
I'm like, uh, I need to go get water. So I opened the I'm like,

31
00:01:56.251 --> 00:02:00.630
let me go get some water inside. And you walk in the balcony,

32
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.220
the sliding door, you walk inside.

33
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:05.040
My room is our rooms are this way down the hall,

34
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.880
his rooms further in my rooms just to the right and the kitchen's right in

35
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:13.260
front. So I walk in, I'm like, okay, get some water. Um,

36
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.580
I'm like three steps before I get to the counter. But I'm just like, there

37
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.420
what's going on. I never touched the water.

38
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.600
I eventually just somehow turn up to my right,

39
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.330
just stumble into my room.

40
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.870
I fell on my bed like this.

41
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.140
I woke up 10 hours later.

42
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.430
I woke up just like that didn't move best rest

43
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:50.580
I ever got. Wow. I was like, uh,

44
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.000
no. Did you have crazy dreams? No, I just went out, but it was a,

45
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.580
it was a fun. Yeah. It was a fun time. It was, it was cause that was like, uh,

46
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.410
the first time I've experienced Vegas. So the,

47
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.950
we were shooting the show in Vegas.

48
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.320
And so that was my first time being in Vegas and uh,

49
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.090
but it was fun time and I was just like, wow. Okay. But then, uh,

50
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.380
after that I smoked again with, uh, my friends down in Florida, uh, years ago,

51
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:18.610
maybe four years ago.

52
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.440
And that was when I actually got high from smoking. You know,

53
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.810
I hit it hard at first. I'm like, cause I'm the same on my,

54
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.480
this doesn't affect me guys. You know? Cause I was like,

55
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.570
the reason I hit me is cause he was an edible. I'm never doing edibles again.

56
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.220
Never again. So I already wrote that up. Like weed doesn't affect me guys.

57
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:41.140
So I hit it hard. They're like, hold it, you got holding him. I'm holding.

58
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.780
I'm start coughing. I cough for like maybe six minutes.

59
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.960
Sean hard coughing almost. So I'm like, bro,

60
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.610
this is nothing. I hit it again. Like right away. Pass me that I hit it again.

61
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.560
Heart coffin. This is not going to do nothing for it. I hit it again.

62
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.240
Hard it bro. I told you guys,

63
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:07.780
this does nothing for me, man. And we're sitting on the couch and

64
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.510
my little brother calls me and uh, he was,

65
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.360
I think this was when he was making the transition. He was leaving football.

66
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.780
He calls me, he's talking to me on the fall and we're talking. I'm like, man,

67
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.350
everything's good, man. You'll you'll be fine. Or we'll do something else.

68
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:28.060
And boom, I forget everything I was just talking about.

69
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.350
I was a, uh, I'll call you back.

70
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.170
So I hang up and I immediate. I'm one of those guys.

71
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.170
If I don't have control and run, I feel like I don't have control of my body.

72
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:41.050
My thoughts was going on. I kind of gathered anxiety.

73
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:42.970
So I kind of started going to the panic mode.

74
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.450
And so I'm sitting there on the couch and these guys are looking at me and I

75
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:50.440
look left to these guys. I'm like guys, some said, something's wrong.

76
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.740
Something's wrong? Something is wrong. Something's wrong.

77
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.790
I don't know what's going on.

78
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.370
I was just trying to talk to my brother and I forgot everything I was,

79
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.170
I was talking about something's wrong?

80
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.240
And they're laughing hysterically. They're laughing at me bad.

81
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.860
And I, and then now I'm like, okay, no, I gotta be cool. I gotta try to be cool.

82
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.960
I gotta control this. Happy. Cool, happy. Cool.

83
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.970
But the biggest thing is I couldn't control what was going on.

84
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.650
The fact that I was feeling what I was feeling, I couldn't shut it off.

85
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.190
That was it for me. I was like, yeah, I can't.

86
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.470
<v 1>That's too much though. That's not what you're supposed to do. Oh.</v>

87
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.303
<v 0>I did it wrong.</v>

88
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.320
<v 1>There's also a thing that happens when you cough. Like I don't know.</v>

89
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.460
<v 0>Why deeper.</v>

90
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.360
<v 1>I don't know if the science behind that. Is there any science behind that?</v>

91
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.080
Is that real? Like coughing gets you more high? Cause it is for me when I, when,

92
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:47.620
if I'm smoking pot and I cough, I go, oh no, what have I done?

93
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.850
I open up the door.

94
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.200
<v 0>It gets inside. Yeah. They say, they say, well, from what I've heard, they say,</v>

95
00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.990
oh, it makes it worse when you cough and it gets deeper into your lungs.

96
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.350
I've heard.

97
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:57.183
<v 1>That a bunch of times.</v>

98
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.420
<v 0>I've heard that a bunch of times. I don't know if it's,</v>

99
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.020
I don't know if that's real though.

100
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.010
Or maybe you just really high and that's why your coffin. No,

101
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.280
maybe it's a smoke.

102
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.230
Cause I'm not used to having smoke in my lungs because even now,

103
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:11.990
if I walked through casinos, I'm sick for awhile.

104
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.310
<v 1>With pot. You just want to, if you're not, if you're a rookie V not a veteran,</v>

105
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:21.200
you don't do it a lot. You want this ready? That's it. Stop.

106
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.250
Stop right there. Wait.

107
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.590
<v 0>We have some time which reminds me. Oh,</v>

108
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.720
I smoked again after that,

109
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.270
I think a couple of years ago. But I, I, it was like almost like peer pressure.

110
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.080
He didn't pressure me, but it was like, oh, he's doing Rashad

111
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.980
[inaudible] he did a peer pressure me, but it was like, I'm with her satisfied,

112
00:06:44.981 --> 00:06:49.190
my brother, if he's doing it, I, I gotta try it. You know? So he's like,

113
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.700
he knows how to do it. Like for him, it's like medicinal at night now. It's,

114
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.710
you know, he, so I, uh, we were at a cooler, going to a comedy show.

115
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.960
The country Wayne is the comedian comedian and we're going to see him

116
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.280
and uh, funny guy [inaudible] Wayne. Yeah.

117
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:11.360
He's a big following out and on the south. And I don't, he does his whole show.

118
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:14.540
I don't think he curses at all really funny guy.

119
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.300
If you look him up very funny guy. And um,

120
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.920
so we're at the show and for the show starts and he's like, let's take a walk.

121
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.220
So we're walking in, in the Rashad. It's like me and him,

122
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:29.030
like the wisdom that he passes on to me, it's crazy. I love being around him.

123
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:32.750
I love spending time with him. And so we're walking in and you know,

124
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:36.560
and then he whips it out and he smoke. And I'm not sure. I've always heard,

125
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:39.800
like you keep people. If things get funnier, when you smoke weed,

126
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.270
I'm like, oh man, it's going to be the best comedy show ever.

127
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.280
Cause this guy has already funny. I think it's funny.

128
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.510
And this is going to make it funnier. All my guys had good idea.

129
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.390
So I take it on, but I'm like I learned from last time,

130
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.190
I'm not going to hit it like that. Just light hit, you know, once, maybe twice,

131
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:05.750
but that's it. So I hit it. Boom. I cough a little bit,

132
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.160
but not as bad, you know, coffee's a little bit and I'm okay.

133
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.210
And so we're still walking and then I hated again, light this time.

134
00:08:14.211 --> 00:08:17.390
I didn't cough. I'm like, hi, that should be good. I should be perfect.

135
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.890
This show's going to be phenomenal.

136
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.030
So we get in now we're sitting in and we're sitting in cars. You know,

137
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:26.630
those improv comedy clubs are very, very tight, you know, especially the big,

138
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:30.140
nice ones, but the VIP tickets you're right there on the floor next to them.

139
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.930
So we're like maybe three seats away from the stage.

140
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:38.780
So we're there and it's a packed house. It's, everything's sold out and um,

141
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.200
we're watching him and watching him. We're watching him. And uh,

142
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.400
I remember like now I start feeling something

143
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.240
I'm getting, I'm like paranoid now. I'm like.

144
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.390
So I'm, I'm talking to Rashad. Well, in my head, I think I'm talking to him.

145
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.410
So I'm thinking I'm trying to whisper because I don't want to interrupt the show

146
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.710
because I wanted to comedian because I've heard comedians would go,

147
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.520
go after you. So I'm like trying not to interrupt the show. I'm like,

148
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.290
I'm thinking I'm like Rashad, Rashad. I'm really like,

149
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.310
and, and I'm, and I'm one of my, why is he not paying attention to me?

150
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:25.020
Why is he Rashad? I'm looking at him like Rashad, something's wrong.

151
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:30.450
I mean, I would try to signal him. I'm using my eyes.

152
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:34.320
I'm trying to signal him like bro, I got to get out. Cause I almost,

153
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:39.210
I was this close to running out of the improv

154
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.044
comedy club.

155
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.630
<v 1>Where would you have gone?</v>

156
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.580
<v 0>I just run out of there.</v>

157
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.690
<v 1>I just, in those cases,</v>

158
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:48.240
you're better off just sitting still and waiting for it to pass. I know. But.

159
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.230
<v 0>I was like, in my mom's side, he said, get out of here.</v>

160
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.530
Exactly what I thought. I'm like, I kind of get out of. I gotta get outta here.

161
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.780
I gotta get out of here now. But Dan and I in my mind and I was like, no,

162
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:07.500
man, what's stopping a punk. Stop being a punk. You can handle this.

163
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.650
So I'm like trying to reel myself back in and my mind I'm like, just breathe,

164
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.390
relax, breathe, and relax. Watch the show breathe. And I'm getting to the show.

165
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:18.840
I'm get into it. But every now and again, it a creep back in your high bro,

166
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:23.400
your high get out of here, get out. But that's it.

167
00:10:23.401 --> 00:10:27.390
That was it for me after that one. I'm like, you know what? We just not, for me,

168
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.730
it's just not, not for me. I've had.

169
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.600
<v 1>Those experiences a hundred times, at least maybe more,</v>

170
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.510
probably more the auntie. Yeah. Like when I'm, I'm never doing this again,

171
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.340
you know, we just get so high. It's just gets ridiculous. But.

172
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.050
<v 0>You still, you still do it. I like it.</v>

173
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.090
<v 1>I always learn something. When I get that high, when I get real high,</v>

174
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.420
if something's bothering me, I'm probably like, well I probably have an issue.

175
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:53.940
I need to take care of it. Like something's bothering me in the first place.

176
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.830
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Like if,

177
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.340
if I get paranoid about something or I feel bad about something,

178
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:02.970
maybe I sad or something, I did this like marijuana.

179
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:04.590
Like if you have something that you're,

180
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.180
you're like maybe pushing in the back of your head, marijuana is like, Hey, Hey,

181
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.000
what the is that? What's that let's turn a light on, click,

182
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.490
put a flashlight on it. It was like, it makes you think.
