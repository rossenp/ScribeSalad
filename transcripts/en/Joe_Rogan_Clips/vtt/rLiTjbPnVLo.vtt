00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.840
<v 2>But my point is that, you know, that's how the CCP operates.</v>

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.080
They will ruin your industry, your business for the slightest,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.640
the slightest offense. This happened, uh,

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.920
two weeks ago with H and M and Nike.

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.280
<v 0>Okay. And it's, and it's because the business is tied to China,</v>

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.790
cuz China does do business with the NBA, huge business, huge.

8
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.863
<v 1>Business, huge.</v>

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.950
<v 0>Business. And you think that this is,</v>

10
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.270
is it because China enjoys having the NBA as an entertainment

11
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.230
entity? Or is.

12
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.750
<v 1>It Chinese? People love the NBA. That's what it's there. The NBAs huge in China.</v>

13
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.500
It's a, it's also, if you think about it from the NBA's per perspective,

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.380
that's their growth, that's their future, right. You know,

15
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:50.820
that's their biggest growing market for everything from jerseys to games,

16
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.580
to you name it. Uh, and.

17
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.220
<v 0>With a lot of sports, that's the case too.</v>

18
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.700
<v 1>And with Hollywood and with the stock markets and with Silicon valley tech</v>

19
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:01.460
companies and with American universities, all of this I,

20
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.730
of American society see the Chinese economic market as a huge lore as well.

21
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:05.890
They.

22
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.770
<v 0>Should. And they do edit films to appease the standards of the Chinese</v>

23
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:11.890
party. Self.

24
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.650
<v 1>Censorship is part of, is the cost.</v>

25
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.410
<v 0>Of doing business. Right. But there's certain things they do like in Dr.</v>

26
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.850
Strange, that Tibetan master was replaced by, uh,

27
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.320
Anglo accent woman. Yeah. This is.

28
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.680
<v 1>My Tibetan face mask. And now you will never be,</v>

29
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.000
this episode will never be aired inside pan lane. China. Did.

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.360
<v 0>I just, just now, well,</v>

31
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:34.880
I think it's probably already not gonna be aired because all the you said yeah.

32
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.000
<v 1>That too, but now this is really, this will really seal it. Okay. Um,</v>

33
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.320
and good. You know what I mean? I will, I,

34
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:44.350
that's not to say we shouldn't engage of the Chinese people. We need exchanges.

35
00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:45.430
We need to have business there.

36
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.390
And this is another sort of conundrum of the us China relationship that I try to

37
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:52.270
take a stab at, at my book in my book, which is that, you know,

38
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.230
we have to engage with the Chinese people. We have to have,

39
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.070
we can't decouple our economies. We can't live in two different worlds forever.

40
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.310
It's not gonna work. Right. But we have to find a way to live with China.

41
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.700
And we have to convince the Chinese government to find a way to live with us in

42
00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:10.700
a way that doesn't compromise our security and our prosperity and our public

43
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:14.220
health. In other words, you know, while we want, we would love,

44
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460
it's not about regime change. It's not about a cold war.

45
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:20.140
These are sort of like bumper stickers that people throw out to dissuade people

46
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.700
from having an honest conversation about,

47
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.330
I deal with a Chinese communist party that is becoming increasingly problematic

48
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.450
in ways that affect our lives. And what I'm trying to say is that, you know,

49
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.810
that we have to be clear that, you know,

50
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.930
this is not about China or the Chinese people. This is about the party.

51
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.130
This is the way the party operates. Do you think that, that, uh,

52
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.410
so there's that company that was airing the chin, the NBA games,

53
00:02:43.411 --> 00:02:46.520
they're making a lot off of that. They didn't wanna stop air NBA games.

54
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:50.040
They had to do that. Cuz the party said, so when Nike, what was it?

55
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:54.000
What did H and M do they put up a statement questioning whether or not the

56
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.000
cotton they were getting from Chiang was made with forced slave labor.

57
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.960
Just so like, Hey, we're gonna look into it for that one statement.

58
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.480
Their entire business in China was crushed. Okay. Nike,

59
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.800
same thing for years, they resisted these companies again,

60
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.160
they're in a tough position. I get it. Uh, Hey, uh,

61
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.720
the cotton that you're sending us is that was that picked by forced labor

62
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.040
slaves. Like are we allowed to ask? Is that okay?

63
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.950
Just for that Nike's business was, was uh,

64
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.630
destroyed inside China propagated.

65
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.150
<v 0>Campaign. How, how so was it destroyed?</v>

66
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.110
<v 1>They, they literally create a, well, they do boycots and again,</v>

67
00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:32.390
it's not like here where like you can, boycot something,

68
00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:34.070
but you have to convince people there. It's like,

69
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.950
if the government says there's a boycot, there's a boycot right.

70
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.460
And then you're, you're, you're your company.

71
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.260
Can't sell anything in China and that's 40% of your business.

72
00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:45.060
You're and it's a pretty big incentive. Right? Mm.

73
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.860
And none of these companies are powerful enough to stand up to the CPR on their

74
00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:48.981
own,

75
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.220
which is why I think they have to work with the us government in some sort of

76
00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:55.940
way, but that's not really going on because politicians just wanna dunk on the

77
00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:59.060
companies or they want to like criticize them for not doing the right thing.

78
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:03.530
But there's positive incentives to say to the NBA, Hey, listen, why don't we,

79
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.930
you know, get together on this thing.

80
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.770
And we'll use our diplomatic pressure and our diplomatic tools to make sure that

81
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.530
American companies and industries don't get punished by the party for, like,

82
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:13.364
like a tweet,

83
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.810
but we're not sophisticated enough in our discussion of China or government

84
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.810
response to China that to actually make that.

85
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.240
But I think that's basically where we have to go.

86
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.160
And which brings up one another inescapable question, which is if Nike's using,

87
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.680
uh, slave labor for their shoes, why are sneakers so expensive?

88
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.880
What's the overhead.

89
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.680
<v 0>It's a very good question. How.</v>

90
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.230
<v 1>Are sneakers $150? But anyway, that's the either here nor there.</v>

91
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.470
<v 0>What would they cost if you paid people? Well, exactly. Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.830
And what's happening? Is it just greed? Yeah. Massive profit margins.

93
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.270
<v 1>Yeah. So anyway, this is a long way of saying that the parties, uh, uh, if,</v>

94
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.311
to understand China,

95
00:04:57.311 --> 00:05:00.870
you have to understand that the parties in control of everything and that, uh,

96
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.260
dealing with that is just the way things are now.

97
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.020
And that doesn't mean that we have to have a cold war or that we have to

98
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:07.860
decouple from China.

99
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:12.060
It just means we have to figure out a new way to first try to convince them not

100
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.940
to do the worst things. And then second to protect ourselves if they insist.
