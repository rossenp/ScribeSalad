00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Power is so scary,</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.260
like that kind of power, the power,

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:10.830
and also the influence and sort of cronyism,

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.010
like being deeply attached to the criminal justice system for many,

5
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:18.120
many years over there being respected and being a part of this investigative

6
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.290
world where they're all the cops and they're all just like they know each other.

7
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:24.360
And you know, they look out for each other,

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.720
the fact that they didn't change their story.

9
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.940
Once they had all the DNA evidence of that Rudy guy,

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.490
and then it was all over it, they didn't go, okay,

11
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:36.180
we've made a mistake instead of they doubled down. And not only that,

12
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.650
but didn't go after him for the murder while they did,

13
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.860
but they didn't convict him of the murder, I should say. So what did they do?

14
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.290
<v 1>So they convicted him of her rape because it was only his</v>

15
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.240
DNA that was found inside of her body.

16
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.020
And they convicted him of conspiracy to commit murder.

17
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.080
So basically taking part in a murder,

18
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.240
but not being the one to actually plunge the knife.

19
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.720
<v 0>But this was a fabrication by the,</v>

20
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.000
this is the prosecutor's idea that he was there with Raffaele and that you

21
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.500
guys held her down.

22
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.630
<v 1>Yeah. So they say that the scenario that my prosecutor</v>

23
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:20.280
painted and he painted a few different scenarios because he couldn't really

24
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.850
like his imagination was going wild. And there wasn't a lot of actual,

25
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.570
obviously there wasn't any evidence to support any of them,

26
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:31.620
but he kept thinking, okay, it's it's near it's the day after Halloween.

27
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.870
So maybe it's a satanic sexual ritual.

28
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.750
We know that there's some kind of sex thing involved.

29
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.680
We know that Amanda is like, well, we know,

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.420
we know that Amanda has sex with people.

31
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.060
So she's probably a sexually obsessed person.

32
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:48.720
And Meredith looked down on her for being a sexually obsessed person.

33
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:53.220
So what is likely to have happened in his brain is that I was hanging out with

34
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.680
Raffaele and Rudy Meredith comes home. She starts scolding me for my bad morals.

35
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.580
And then I'm like, you know what, we're gonna rape you and kill you.

36
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.930
That's that's his scenario. And it's,

37
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.360
it's so unfortunate on so many levels because it's, I mean,

38
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.780
it says more about him than it says about anyone else that he would imagine that

39
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:17.900
that's just how people react to each other.

40
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.840
<v 0>Th this was not his initial idea though, right? Was this initial idea?</v>

41
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.160
<v 1>I mean, his initial idea was that I was involved somehow.</v>

42
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.040
He didn't know how, but he thought that I was involved.

43
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:31.830
Somehow I knew something. I was covering up for someone.

44
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.030
And that's why he interrogated me for 53 hours over five days.

45
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.510
<v 0>Which is really scary that they can do that. Right. It's like,</v>

46
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.860
you can get someone to say a lot of things.

47
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:47.550
If you can get alone with them in a room, scare the out of them and,

48
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.590
and just torture them.

49
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.690
<v 1>Well, I'm glad you,</v>

50
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:53.580
you know that because like a lot of people don't know that you.

51
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.290
<v 0>Can get people to crack. Oh.</v>

52
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.390
<v 1>Absolutely. Like that's, it's.</v>

53
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.110
<v 0>People crack when they get pulled over by the cops for speeding people crack for</v>

54
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.130
all kinds of things, they crack have, have a joint in their glove box.

55
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.480
People crack, you know, when, when authority is scaring,

56
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:12.220
you coming down on you and in your case,

57
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.270
it actually hit you a couple of times that there's, and you're 20.

58
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.063
<v 1>Right?</v>

59
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.660
<v 0>20 Your brain isn't even fully.</v>

60
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.930
<v 1>And my brain isn't fully formed. My friend had just been murdered.</v>

61
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:27.670
I was alone in a foreign country and people were people who I was

62
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.800
interesting. My life and safety too,

63
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.700
were screaming at me that I was wrong.

64
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.370
That I was never going to see my family again,

65
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.770
that I was super traumatized that I had.

66
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.750
I had seen something so horrible that I must have just completely blocked it

67
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:48.550
out. And here's, and here's a scenario that would explain that.

68
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.520
Look, you have a text message from your boss, Patrick Lumumba.

69
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.850
You must have met him that night. You must have seen him murder. Meredith.

70
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.660
Just admit it. Just admit it. Remember, remember, remember,

71
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.350
like he kept telling me like the gross thing about it was they kept telling me

72
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.050
to remember. They didn't even tell me to like, admit it.

73
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.370
They were telling me that I just couldn't remember it. And I had to remember,

74
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.470
or else I was never going to see my family again.

75
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.590
<v 0>Jesus. So we, you thinking the,</v>

76
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.200
you just had to tell them whatever they wanted to hear,

77
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:18.400
just so you could get out of there.

78
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.160
<v 1>Honestly, I started to question my own sanity.</v>

79
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.660
I started to believe them that I must have witnessed something horrible or,

80
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:25.810
and I just couldn't remember it.

81
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:28.780
And that's the only explanation for why they would treat me that way.

82
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.660
<v 0>How long did that take before you think you started questioning your Saturday?</v>

83
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.470
<v 1>Um, so I was, you know,</v>

84
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.490
a few hours into that final interrogation that was in the middle of the night.

85
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.120
I was not prepared to be interrogated at all because honestly they didn't even

86
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:46.750
call me in that night. They called my boyfriend Raffaele. Um,

87
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.410
but I was staying with him and I was afraid to be alone at home because a murder

88
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:54.910
was on the loose. And so I went with him and I was waiting in the,

89
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.090
um, in the lobby, like by the elevator,

90
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.710
waiting for him to come out from questioning. And then they brought me in, um,

91
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:05.530
and just went on and on and on. Um,

92
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.910
and so I cracked eventually. So the thing that cracked me too,

93
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.880
was they brought in an interpreter, right.

94
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.820
Someone who actually spoke English because for a long time,

95
00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:19.270
I was just talking to people in Italian. And I was worried that I couldn't,

96
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.560
I wasn't even comprehensible.

97
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:23.440
I thought that the reason why they were yelling at me was because I was doing

98
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:26.200
something wrong. Like I just wasn't explaining myself correctly.

99
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.420
<v 0>And then they put fluid where you.</v>

100
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.170
<v 1>Fluent, where you, I mean, I'd been there for like five weeks. So I.</v>

101
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.450
<v 0>Was a time before.</v>

102
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.150
<v 1>I had taken Italian for a year before. So I,</v>

103
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.090
I was about as fluent as I like to say,

104
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.370
I had about the fluency of a ten-year-old,

105
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:46.840
but I think that that's even generous because I could speak in certain tenses.

106
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:49.240
My vocabulary was totally limited though.

107
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.630
So there were limited things that I actually had the words to say.

108
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.910
And I remember even when I, um,

109
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.340
shortly after I was interrogated and signed the statements that they had written

110
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:02.390
up for me, I, they finally stopped yelling at me. They left me alone.

111
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.740
I had a moment to just like, be off to the side, quiet to myself.

112
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:10.040
And I was like, oh my God, what just happened? Everything is wrong.

113
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:14.030
This is all wrong. I need to tell them that it's all wrong. And I'd like,

114
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:16.550
I can't just go up in front of a jury right now and say,

115
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:18.590
this is the person who did it. I saw him do it. Like,

116
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:21.860
I don't actually remember that. And I told them, I need to tell you,

117
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:24.620
I need to tell you. And they were like, no, you'll remember,

118
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:27.140
don't worry about it. Like we don't, we don't need to talk anymore.

119
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:31.430
You'll remember just stay over there and keep remembering. And I was like, no,

120
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.100
I'm not remembering. I'm not remembering. And eventually I asked them like,

121
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:36.620
please give me a piece of paper because they weren't listening to me.

122
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.490
So I wrote on this piece of paper, I'm so confused. They were yelling at me.

123
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:44.210
Like, I don't, I don't, I can't actually testify to this. And I gave it to them.

124
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:47.420
And I was like, here's a gift because I didn't have the word for like,

125
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:51.950
here's my Rick recantation. I was just like, I'm giving this to you.

126
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.590
I need you to hear me. And they were like, okay, whatever,

127
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.900
we're taking you to jail, actually,

128
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.400
they didn't even tell me they were taking me to jail.

129
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:01.580
They th they were telling me that I was being taken to a holding place for my

130
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:04.850
own protection. And that I was an unimportant witness.

131
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.860
<v 0>So they didn't tell you that you were being taken to jail because you were one</v>

132
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:11.480
of the people that were accusing.

133
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:16.580
<v 1>No, I was already in prison before I was ever actually told you are being,</v>

134
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.940
you are suspected for the killing of Meredith Crutcher.

135
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.150
I was already in prison. How.

136
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.920
<v 0>Long have you known this Meredith girl for.</v>

137
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.413
<v 1>A few weeks.</v>

138
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.980
<v 0>And you'd met her just because you had all moved there at the same time,</v>

139
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:32.630
I'm sharing a place to go.

140
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.610
<v 1>Yeah, so she had moved in before me. Um,</v>

141
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.200
but it was basically,

142
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:43.220
there were two rooms to let in this little house that was right next to the

143
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:46.640
university and we both happened to pick a flyer.

144
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.310
<v 0>Mm. And did you guys hang out a lot?</v>

145
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.120
Did you know her well? Was she a good friend or she just someone you lived with?

146
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.440
<v 1>Um, she was like a budding friend. Like we definitely hung out.</v>

147
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:03.230
We would go to pizza together. I remember we went to like,

148
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.120
there's this famous chocolate festival.

149
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:09.290
That's improved HSA where they would like take huge refrigerator sized blocks of

150
00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:13.370
chocolate and like carved them. Um, which was super cool. I'm very into that.

151
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.340
And we would go and check that out together. Um,

152
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.140
but we weren't like the best of friends.

153
00:08:18.141 --> 00:08:23.030
Like she had a friend group of other young women from great Britain that

154
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:25.910
she hung out with a lot more than she hung out with me. Um,

155
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.510
but that isn't to say that we didn't go out dancing together or go out to dinner

156
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:30.980
together. We definitely did that.

157
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.700
<v 0>The moment you found out that she had been murdered,</v>

158
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.590
what was that like?

159
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.703
<v 1>Um,</v>

160
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.380
it's confusing because I knew that something

161
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:47.690
was wrong. As soon as I found,

162
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.580
like came home and I found that there was a window broken into and Meredith

163
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:56.910
wasn't answering her phone, but I didn't what was wrong.

164
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.590
I didn't, I didn't know.

165
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.610
And when the police came in and broke down her door and everyone started

166
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:07.320
screaming, I didn't see into her room. I never actually saw her body.

167
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.810
And so I didn't know what was going on.

168
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.210
I didn't know if that was Meredith in the room. In fact,

169
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.850
I remember at the first thing that Philomena,

170
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:18.360
one of my roommates started yelling was a foot, a foot. And I was like,

171
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.360
oh my God, is there like a severed foot in Meredith's room? Like,

172
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.380
I don't know what's going on.

173
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:26.700
She's Philomena is hysterical and I don't know what's going on.

174
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:30.690
Everyone's yelling at Italian speaking really quickly. I don't understand.

175
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.840
So I actually was relying on Raffaele to translate for me,

176
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.480
like what is going on? He was like, I don't know, let me, let me figure it out.

177
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.680
And we were all like shoved out of the house. And finally someone is like,

178
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:45.240
it's Meredith it's Meredith and she's dead. And I was like, oh my God.

179
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.830
Like it was outside of the house that someone was telling me she's her body was

180
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.420
in there. And someone told me that there was all this blood. Um,

181
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.280
I remembered not actually knowing like how she had died until I went

182
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.550
to the police office. And I asked, I was like being questioned.

183
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:05.520
One of the police officers was like, and so like,

184
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.720
I sort of learned over the course of that day, these,

185
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.790
the details of it, but I didn't fully understand, like,

186
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.770
what had really happened. Like as far as I knew, you know, she, she,

187
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.360
some, I mean, it was clear that there was a break in,

188
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.010
like the window had been broken into. One of it was Filomena his room,

189
00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.660
all of her stuff was all over the place.

190
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:32.790
It wasn't clear to me what had happened though.

191
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.260
And it wasn't until over the course of that whole day and piecing together what

192
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:37.831
I was hearing,

193
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.950
that I understood the gravity of the situation that she had been sexually

194
00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:45.120
assaulted, that she had been stabbed to death, but it was a struggle.

195
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.830
Um, it was all, it was all like,

196
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.530
I remember the first thought and it's a guilty thought that I had. Um,

197
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.480
I remember thinking, thank God I wasn't home. Um,

198
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.530
because that could have been me and a part of me,

199
00:11:04.531 --> 00:11:07.380
like over time felt really guilty about that thought,

200
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.130
because I thought maybe if I was home and there had been two of us,

201
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.110
maybe the outcome would have been different.

202
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.980
Maybe we would have been able to fend him off together,

203
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.500
but here's, you know, an athletic guy wielding a knife.

204
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.890
I'm not sure that we would have, and maybe I would have been dead too.

205
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.720
So it's kind of a thought that comes back to mind a lot.

206
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.190
When I think about this, um, and how fortuitous it was, um,

207
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:40.260
that I just happened to be in this like brand new romance and hanging out

208
00:11:40.261 --> 00:11:43.710
with my new boyfriend all the time, every waking moment that I could.

209
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.440
And that's what happened.

210
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.840
<v 0>It's hard for me to imagine the jolt</v>

211
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:57.010
of a 20 year old life where

212
00:11:57.011 --> 00:12:01.360
you are overseas going to school

213
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.930
involved in this new romantic relationship.

214
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.850
And then out of nowhere, boom,

215
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.650
you're a suspect in a murder.

216
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.010
<v 1>Yeah. Well, and what's interesting is, I didn't know, like,</v>

217
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:19.900
I didn't know that I was a suspect is like the boom for me was someone close to

218
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:23.500
me just died and that could have been me.

219
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.960
And now what.

220
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.620
<v 0>And then it was all those things that piled on. They got piling on.</v>

221
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.300
<v 1>Yeah. And then, you know, I'm in jail, I'm thinking, oh my God,</v>

222
00:12:34.301 --> 00:12:37.570
this is all just a horrible misunderstanding. Like the,

223
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.630
I'm sure they're going to figure it out sometime. Um,

224
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.850
I remember like the first two years of my imprisonment,

225
00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:46.720
I was convinced that it was all just a big misunderstanding and somebody would

226
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:49.660
figure it out. And I was convinced, I was,

227
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.700
I was convinced that there was no possible way that people

228
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:56.890
could actually believe that I was involved.

229
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.700
Like even just not because it's me,

230
00:13:00.701 --> 00:13:02.500
but because there wasn't any evidence there,

231
00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.670
like it was so patently obvious to me that like this, this idea of me,

232
00:13:06.671 --> 00:13:09.760
this Foxy Knoxy character that was being constructed and in the courtroom,

233
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:11.020
this Lucifer arena,

234
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.640
like this idea of a person was obviously made up.

235
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.680
It was so obvious to me and yet, and,

236
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.070
and.

237
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.860
<v 0>Yet it didn't seem like the Italian media just ran with it though.</v>

238
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.300
<v 1>Oh yeah. Yeah.</v>

239
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:29.890
And that was one of the big sort of regrets that might,

240
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:33.190
especially my family had, was at the very beginning. Um,

241
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.750
they were advised to not speak to the media at all because they were just going

242
00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:39.610
to make a field day of it. There was, you know,

243
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:42.550
in the same way that there was never going to, once I was accused,

244
00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:46.270
there was never going to be anything that I could do to prove my innocence in

245
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:48.070
the eyes of people. Um,

246
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.090
my lawyers were also worried that there was nothing my family could say,

247
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.800
but that would not be twisted and turned into something that would just

248
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.320
fuel further fuel the scandal mongering.

249
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.510
And what that meant was there was a void, there was a void in which,

250
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.400
who I was,

251
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:10.780
my very identity could be reconstructed or constructed out of

252
00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:12.550
total fantasy.

253
00:14:12.551 --> 00:14:17.530
That was the only thing that was that the only reason why it

254
00:14:17.531 --> 00:14:21.700
was being constructed was to further the scandal and to sell more papers like

255
00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:24.580
that. That was the reason why the,

256
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.570
it wasn't the public interest of the story that kept the sun in,

257
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.690
in Britain reporting on this case. Like they were,

258
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.560
they were reporting like reporting on whether or not I ate pizza,

259
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.690
like the days leading up to my arrest. Like it's just selling papers.
