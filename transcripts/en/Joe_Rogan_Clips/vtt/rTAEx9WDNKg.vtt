00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.390
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So you just assumed in the U S years.</v>

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.850
<v 1>Back decades before there's some,</v>

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.360
some kettlebells were used by some old time strong men, like Zig Klein,

4
00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.450
for example. And there was a company named Milo,

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.550
no relations to the magazine really.

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.730
<v 2>Was about a hundred years ago with Milo.</v>

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.070
<v 1>Milo's the guy who carried the, uh, the calf. So if you'll go, if you look,</v>

8
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.510
um, okay.

9
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:31.430
The progressive overload is usually explained as this legend of Milo

10
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:32.264
of Crotona.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.710
So this guy started carrying a little calf on his shoulders and he would carry

12
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:37.700
the calf every day.

13
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.240
So the calf would grow and eventually a guy became very strong.

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.310
So that's why that name is present in, uh,

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.790
in the strengths game. So back then today, it is a,

16
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:53.480
just one of the finest publications on strength, training, mostly niche things,

17
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:54.680
again like gripping. I.

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.580
<v 2>Wonder if anyone's actually done that, like carry a cow,</v>

19
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.980
isn't it amazing that something can grow physically faster than you

20
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:05.450
can keep lifting? It.

21
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.110
<v 1>Absolutely can, but you know, your typical training plan that people say,</v>

22
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.060
I'm going to add five pounds on my bench press today,

23
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.370
and I'm going to do this every week.

24
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.720
And that by Christmas I'll be the world champion and it just doesn't work.

25
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.020
So the rate of adaptation is such that your body just cannot do that.

26
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.090
And it's cyclical in nature.

27
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:27.830
So you have to do put it in the Milo terms. Uh,

28
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:32.030
you have to, after you carry the calf for a while, it grows,

29
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.740
you have to back off to a lighter calf and start, you know,

30
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.790
start building up again. Why we did not know exactly.

31
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.170
So for some reason that unidirectional adaptation, just in one Newnham,

32
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.690
we're getting stronger at the bench press, or what have you,

33
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.260
or at carrying the calf, he just cannot proceed indefinitely.

34
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.880
There's some fatigue of some and a crane mechanisms, some genetic mechanisms.

35
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.600
We do not know that, but tactically,

36
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.610
we do have a tricks of the trade to beat that,

37
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.690
to work around that. And there's a number of ways of doing that,

38
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.120
the oldest way of doing that.

39
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.190
And it's very smart, still very smart for a lot of people, they would call this,

40
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.420
I think, possibly constant weight training or something like that,

41
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.640
but the soil has described it as step loading. So let's look at your typical,

42
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.870
let's look at your typical beginner, somebody in the gym.

43
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.870
And so the personal starts lifting whatever weight for whatever

44
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.180
reps and the next week,

45
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.840
let's say next week he has five pounds and he does it again.

46
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:49.280
And he does it again while the Soviet has figured out that it's much better for

47
00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:54.230
him to stay at the same weight for several weeks and

48
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:58.820
then make it bigger jump. Hmm. So what's, you're doing pretty much as you are.

49
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.540
The making that uptake is more stable and it just happened in the cellar

50
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:08.620
levels. Members become stronger and so on, but old timers just,

51
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.110
they would say that you are solidifying the gains.

52
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.240
So the way that many old timers trained is they would just stick to the same

53
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:20.410
weight and the staying with the same weight for long time in the beginning is

54
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:23.530
challenging. And then it becomes kind of comfortable.

55
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.680
That becomes almost easy and there were dumped up.

56
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.000
So that just one way of doing it. And today it's not unprecedented either.

57
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:35.590
If you look at, uh, Chris som or his gymnastics coach used that rigidness,

58
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.870
it's very common. I use that tactic with my latest edition of my kettlebell,

59
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:41.740
simple sinister,

60
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.450
because it's much more reliable than just progressive overload.

61
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.420
And also because psychologically,

62
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.430
first of all, it weeds out the impatient people.

63
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.070
So you're told to stay with the same load for a while. Some people automatic.

64
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:02.500
So forget it. I can not do that. Well,

65
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.890
I don't want these people for my stuff anyway. And second,

66
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:10.420
so you're staying with this weight or these reps for some time

67
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.921
in the beginning,

68
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:16.120
they challenge you and then sometime goes by and suddenly they don't anymore.

69
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.560
So just a very much, it was a very clear, clear sense of accomplishment.

70
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.570
So this is called step loading or using the old

71
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.960
timers old Dharma's terminology, that constant weight training.

72
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.880
If you look at the other ways of making progress.

73
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.890
So another approach is called cycling and cycling.

74
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.410
So the one that I just described that would really be,

75
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.040
if we could artificially stop the growth of the calf, like, okay,

76
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.970
stop growing for a while, which we can,

77
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.630
but the cycling, this is where I mentioned earlier.

78
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.390
This is where you go back to a lighter calf.

79
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.850
So the classic American powerlifting, uh, training template,

80
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.840
this is cycling. So the history of cycling is very interesting.

81
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.890
Again, what cycling is cycling is in the simplest possible terms.

82
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.220
You take 12 weeks, you start with lightweights. Uh,

83
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.990
you build up until you go really heavy.

84
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.900
And that was the predominant strength training system in

85
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:22.000
the seventies, in the eighties.

86
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.250
And that was the strength system behind the dominant American

87
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.930
powerlifting team. So lifters like Eddie cone, Kurt Kowalski,

88
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:37.180
lifters, like Dan Austin, who is, uh, or Lamar Gant,

89
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.830
whose death of trekkers still stand decades after the use this

90
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.430
classic cycling. So the classic cycling,

91
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:50.230
you start with the moderate, moderately challenging load.

92
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.920
Then you keep proceeding, go heavier and heavier and heavier. Then you compete.

93
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.580
Then you start over and to give you,

94
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:02.960
um, to give you a very simple tactic,

95
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.080
that's something that your listeners can use in their training,

96
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.510
whether they follow this cycling format where they do

97
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.344
something else,

98
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:17.870
is that Russian scientists discovery that your endocrine system

99
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:22.340
pretty much can take, uh, two, two weeks out of four of heavy loading.

100
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.770
That's just the way it is. There are some exceptions. If you forget exceptions,

101
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.690
generally just two weeks of heavy loading.

102
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.970
And if you look at the classic power lifting cycles by

103
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.870
let's say Marty Gallagher. So for four weeks, you do sets of eight,

104
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.110
four weeks as a five, four weeks sets of three.

105
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.780
And in week one,

106
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.520
you start out with a way that's comfortable in week two,

107
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.030
moderately challenging in week three,

108
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.020
you hit your repeat your previous PR for this reps.

109
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.690
And in week four, you set your new PR and then you jumped in the next rep count.

110
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:06.560
So as you see in this particular template,

111
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.190
you have two weeks, two hard weeks of training out of the month.

112
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.680
And that's just one of the many ways of doing that. Pardon me? I got distracted.

113
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:19.730
So we wanted to talk about the history of cycling. Yeah. So bill Starr,

114
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.810
who was a huge name in the game, he, uh,

115
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.450
he was a former, uh,

116
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.470
top weightlifter in the United States back in the sixties later on very

117
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:33.410
successful coach strength coach and, uh, author.

118
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.470
The strongest shall survive his, uh,

119
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.510
book on strength training for football remains one of the best strength

120
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:45.770
training books and bill starry calls that

121
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.130
American lifters started getting a whiff of some Russian paradise

122
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:52.964
programs.

123
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.280
So was puritization puritization the simplest terms is planning your training

124
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.960
according to certain principles to, and it beak performance.

125
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:07.730
So that's just the really kind of a 50,000 level, 50,000 foot,

126
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.980
uh, definition. And they did not have their full, full information bio.

127
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.920
It was done. So they just decided to do exactly that.

128
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.210
And that was a very successful,

129
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.580
very successful purchase strength training.

130
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.650
It does not necessarily work for everybody. There are some reasons for that,

131
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:31.010
uh, mostly because of your sport competition, if you're an athlete,

132
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.320
but it's extremely a factor as was shown on the platform. And finally,

133
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:40.760
so first we discussed step cycling, step loading,

134
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:44.630
which is concentrating second, we discussed, uh,

135
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.310
uh, wave cycling, which is just cycling, right wave loading.

136
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.980
And the third one would be the variable loading and variable

137
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.140
loadings is extremely unique. It's unlike something else.

138
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.570
So here's how variable loading works in variable loading.

139
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:09.030
You have certain load parameters, like for example,

140
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:13.020
you will know that your average training weights will be

141
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:15.150
75% of your maximum.

142
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.270
You will know that you will perform for example,

143
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:20.040
300 squats per month or whatever.

144
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.230
So these numbers are arrived at experimentally over decades,

145
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.840
and what variable loading does as

146
00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.080
opposed to the traditional methods.

147
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:38.580
Traditional progressive overload is that the jump in volume,

148
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:39.414
for example,

149
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.860
from one training unit to another one day,

150
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.870
one week, one month, and so on, it's at least 20%. So the jumps are really high,

151
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.370
really high. The variable loading was developed by,

152
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.710
I feel Sarah [inaudible]

153
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
, who was a Olympic weightlifting champion, and he was the premier sport

154
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
 scientist. So he argued that in nature, most changes are discreet

155
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
 during a gradual they're discreet

156
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
. So whatever, whatever adapt adaptation take place in your body, the same thing, whatever happens with many physical process, chemical processes and so on. So he concluded that training has to be highly variable. So you understand what I mean? That it's a 20% minimal change. We called that Delta 20 principle. It doesn't mean 

157
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
that's constantly going up. That's just not possible. He'd

158
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
 goes up and down. He just keeps woot

159
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
 blushing. So if we use, if we go back to the traditional cycling as an example, the traditional cycling, so it's a linear 

160
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.710
buildup back up a little linear buildup, back up

161
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.543
 a little in contrast variable overload. It's going crazy.

162
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.500
It's going to lean sane. In fact,

163
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:04.170
this is a little entertaining,

164
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.620
experienced strength coaches, and, uh,

165
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.070
especially people with some sort of a background in mathematics.

166
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:19.260
They're able to dissect and analyze training plans from other coaches.

167
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:23.610
You can look at a plan. You can take an experienced powerlifting coach,

168
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.010
show him a program from another coach.

169
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:31.080
And the coach will be able to tell whether this will work or not who this will

170
00:11:31.081 --> 00:11:32.790
work for and so on, and kind of figure out,

171
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.280
what's figure out what's under the hood right there.

172
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.640
So there's a very clear pattern, variable overload.

173
00:11:39.641 --> 00:11:44.430
So it's like a photograph it's very clear variable overload.

174
00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:48.630
If you start analyzing the pattern, looking at the program. So for example,

175
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.130
buddy, Shane Koa, he's, uh, uh,

176
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.300
he's a former coach of Russian national powerlifting team.

177
00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.340
So he took the Soviet Olympic weightlifting methodology

178
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.290
and directly applied it to powerlifting. So he's blind,

179
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:09.430
so made their way to the west and some lifters use them very successfully.

180
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.230
But whenever he tried to read this plan and try to make any sense of that,

181
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.930
it just drives you crazy because you see like, okay, here's a string.

182
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:19.750
Here's a pattern is going right here in submit his gun.

183
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:25.180
So if traditional cycling's like clear

184
00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:26.020
photograph,

185
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.190
the variable overload makes me think of,

186
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.580
remember in Ferris, Bueller's day off where the kid is looking at. Uh,

187
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.870
so house painting and, you know, want to use their, all these dots right there.

188
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.240
So when you step away, you see something,

189
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.840
when you start getting closer to so a whole bunch of dots, it just disappears.

190
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.790
So what's the story behind that? So the story is this,

191
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.560
this method,

192
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.870
the Soviet Olympic weightlifting method was developed,

193
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.790
uh, over several decades by a number of coaches by number of scientists.

194
00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.450
So it's a very much collaborative effort. So VRBO was one for sure,

195
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.450
[inaudible] Chuck a number of others.

196
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.360
And it was a very brief bite before even

197
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:19.540
dissecting this method. Let me tell you how, how successful this method was.

198
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.220
You can look up the world that weightlifting records in Olympic weightlifting,

199
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.730
and you hear about oldest different records side by this lifter that left her

200
00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:33.690
and so on and so forth.

201
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:39.810
If you few people realize that the international weightlifting

202
00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:44.640
Federation has changed the weight classes at two or three times

203
00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:45.474
since the eighties.

204
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.270
And the reason they did that is to erase the

205
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.340
drug. The record said by the drug taking athletes back then, of course you all,

206
00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:59.220
I'm very happy that as soon as they changed the weight classes,

207
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.320
lifter stopped taking drugs like that.

208
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.170
So if you look at these records, kilo per kilo,

209
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:09.600
pound per pound, and if you charred them,

210
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.590
compared them to what they did then to what they do today,

211
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.470
you will find that while they did catch up.

212
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.740
And if you weight classes and about half of these classes,

213
00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:23.310
the records from the eight is still stand. So for example, what

214
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.730
[inaudible] did in 1980 at a 82

215
00:14:29.731 --> 00:14:30.564
kilos,

216
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:35.040
he totaled 400 kills in the snatch and the clean and jerk that's never been done

217
00:14:35.041 --> 00:14:37.560
before. And unify banana was a wire. He guy,

218
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.510
you wouldn't have been taken for a lifter, just amazing. So first of all,

219
00:14:42.511 --> 00:14:47.250
the system still remains. If we're just take a very large, big picture,

220
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:53.300
50,000 foot look at strength, there are great many ways of getting strong.

221
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.710
Some of them very good, some are mediocre, some very bad,

222
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.470
but historically in lifting sports,

223
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.450
the two systems that have been predominant are the Soviet weight lifting

224
00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:09.920
system and the American classic power lifting system from the seventies and

225
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:14.330
eighties. Okay. So that was a kind of a long detour to

226
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.430
before tell you why the stuff that they figured out back in 1960 is why it

227
00:15:19.431 --> 00:15:22.460
matters just to say it still is the best is still rules.

228
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.450
So what they did is, was very empirical

229
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.560
in, for example, when you're studying endurance, going into the cell, uh,

230
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:37.520
studying the biochemistry of this cell in the body, taking it apart,

231
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:42.830
figuring out how this works is very helpful, very on the other hand,

232
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.300
when you're dealing with strength, that approach has been, uh,

233
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.160
not really effective. So if we talk about muscle muscle training, for example,

234
00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:55.640
hypertrophy, we still have no idea what the hell is going on. So we can,

235
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.580
we know which buttons to push, but that just empirical knowledge,

236
00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.210
that's not the understanding of the cell. So.

237
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.530
<v 2>We really don't understand hypertrophy drilling. No, we do not. Wow.</v>

238
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.250
<v 1>No, and let's, I'll be happy to talk about this, but if you don't mind,</v>

239
00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:13.160
let me just finish on this variable overload in the Soviet weightlifting system.

240
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.470
So what they did, even though they also, you know, they cut the muscle,

241
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:20.390
look at that as well. It just didn't learn as much,

242
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.580
but they coaches program particular lows for athletes and watch what happened.

243
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:31.610
And then they watched how the authors performed and the watch how the top

244
00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:36.260
athletes perform and look for patterns. And there were very open-minded.

245
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:39.230
So they're not thinking like, well, it's got to be just the heaviest weights.

246
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.830
We'll do that. Or it's gotta be the training to failure is going to do that.

247
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:43.903
It's not the case.

248
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.470
So just to give you an example of how

249
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.620
enormous that undertaking was. So typical strength training studies,

250
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:57.830
what six weeks for some untrained college subjects, you know,

251
00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.180
guys who are just on their phones,

252
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.170
but I feel something that the [inaudible] was also world champion.

253
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.600
He studied the training lows off top weightlifters,

254
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:14.480
all the, when they were successful in competition for four Olympic cycles, four.

255
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.170
So we're talking about 16 years and then somebody else to do for another cycle.

256
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.660
And they're just an amazing patterns just emerged. So for instance,

257
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:25.910
I'm going to give you, give you a run down what the patterns are.

258
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:33.410
There are certain optimal volumes, how much exercise you do there,

259
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.940
certain optimal intensities.

260
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.540
So if you follow the variable overload method,

261
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.600
the optimal intensity.

262
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:45.290
So the average intensity would be about 75% of your max,

263
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.310
which for most people will be probably somewhere like eight traps or something

264
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:54.540
you could do maybe 10 and maybe eight. And

265
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.560
you will see that about half of old, the lifts that you do are about 75,

266
00:18:01.561 --> 00:18:05.460
80% now, where do all the rest, the other lifts come in.

267
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.290
So there's a normal distribution. So you'll find that 75,

268
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:14.730
80% are in the top 80, 85, a little bit lower, you know?

269
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.190
So the lighter weights,

270
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.030
like 60% are in the bottom and they have your waist,

271
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:24.870
like 90% in and higher are in the bottom as well. So the figured out,

272
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:28.770
you just have to do most of your work with these average weights.

273
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.780
They're not so light, so you're going to respect them,

274
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.470
but they're not so happy that you're having any question about performing,

275
00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:39.660
lifting them correctly. So,

276
00:18:39.661 --> 00:18:43.920
and then there is another aspect of intensity is just doing some heavier lifts,

277
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:44.754
very,

278
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:50.010
very carefully measured number of heavy lifts in addition like

279
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.780
90% or whatever, or occasionally,

280
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.880
then they figured out the proper volumes. Just to give you an idea,

281
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.170
if you're looking at, uh, let's say in, you know,

282
00:19:01.171 --> 00:19:04.050
you might be doing 30 reps of given exercise per session. What have you,

283
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.610
although there's variability,

284
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.830
but then there's also something else that's very interesting is the optimal

285
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:12.570
number of repetitions with the given weight.

286
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.370
And this is what hurts people hurts. People's hats. If you look at it,

287
00:19:17.371 --> 00:19:20.550
the weights from 70 to 90%,

288
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:26.850
the optimal number of repetitions are

289
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.130
one third to two thirds of your maximum.

290
00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.550
So let me give you an example to the reader, uh, to the listener.

291
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.610
Let's say that you're lifting a 10 rep max weight.

292
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.940
So you go all out as hard as possible.

293
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.780
You can do 10 reps in training.

294
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.360
You should be doing, uh,

295
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.300
you should be doing three to six reps, that's it? That's that's the window.

296
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:57.270
And why is that? And we have no idea, but the scientists,

297
00:19:57.271 --> 00:19:59.280
like in this case that it was, I think it was mud.

298
00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.920
VF was involved in that the father of [inaudible]. I think he

299
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 was one of the scientists they experiment with all sorts of wrap

300
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 ranges. And they figured out that a directs are too low to be

301
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 given a weight. You don't get stronger. If the Rams get

302
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 too high, either the athlete gets hurt or he's technique is

303
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:01.920
 compromised, or he's just unable to perform the optimal volume. So, pretty much roughly you're looking at doing about half of the reps 

304
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.753
you're capable of that's it.

305
00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:32.970
And people can argue with this all they want, like,

306
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:34.620
what's the science behind this? There's no science.

307
00:20:34.621 --> 00:20:36.990
We don't know the science is purely empirical.

308
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.790
This particular method is purely empirical. It worked for decades.

309
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.860
It still does. And as one of the ways you can get strong. So in,

310
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:52.960
we have, uh, we have sorry,

311
00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:56.200
step loading, which is where he stayed with the same way for a while,

312
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.290
where the same reps, whatever, and then make a sudden jump.

313
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.290
That's the best way to train for beginners.

314
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:06.970
Usually we have wave loading or

315
00:21:06.971 --> 00:21:10.900
cycling, which is we build up, jump back and build up again.

316
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:16.360
And we have variable loading, which is almost almost chaotic.

317
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.170
We're just constantly surprised the body with what we're throwing at it,

318
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.720
but who do that within very narrow parameters.

319
00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.040
<v 2>So this method was purely developed by studying</v>

320
00:21:29.041 --> 00:21:32.400
winners and winners is where they.

321
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.360
<v 1>Finally took that. But the studies were done at every level. So for example,</v>

322
00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:40.140
coaches in the field would conduct something called Pell pedagogical

323
00:21:40.141 --> 00:21:44.580
experiments, which is, which is a study. That's not quite as,

324
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.320
um, not quite as scientifically solid, but is too good enough.

325
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.350
So the first would test things out, lower level athletes,

326
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:54.540
and they'll finally take it to higher level athletes.

327
00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.150
So the things that I'm telling you about,

328
00:21:57.151 --> 00:22:02.130
they have been universally effective for athletes above the beginner

329
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:05.940
level. And of course there are some subtle changes as you progress.

330
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.610
There are some subtleties, like for instance,

331
00:22:08.611 --> 00:22:13.290
a notice that I said that you have to use some heavy lifts, like 90%,

332
00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:17.970
95%, but it has to be very surgical about how many. So for instance,

333
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:22.650
beginners do none advanced lifters need to do just some but not many

334
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.770
intermediate lifters can do the most or heavy.

335
00:22:25.771 --> 00:22:28.920
The weightlifters can do not as many lighter ones can do more.

336
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.700
So there are some differences at different levels,

337
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:36.180
but the principles fundamental are the same. And.

338
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.050
<v 2>Do these principles apply whether people are taking drugs or not. They do.</v>

339
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:41.550
<v 1>The differences. In fact,</v>

340
00:22:41.551 --> 00:22:45.390
the [inaudible] made a very strong case,

341
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.100
a very strong case of that.

342
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.870
They use the Soviet euphemism for that. It was restoratives.

343
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.880
And they said, this is universal. Even with restorative was or not.

344
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.720
The difference for this for the drugs would be,

345
00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:03.180
is just that the volumes will be higher. You'll be able to train more.

346
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:07.200
That's pretty much the difference, but the body will still work the same way.

347
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.780
<v 2>Now these principles have they caught on in the United States. I mean,</v>

348
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.450
they've caught on with strong first. I know that you teach,

349
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.850
you implement these and people teach these,

350
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.650
but is this something that's universally sort of accepted or is it still

351
00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:27.180
something that people are cautiously curious about? It's.

352
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.680
<v 1>Definitely not universal in part because people don't know about it in part,</v>

353
00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:36.540
you have to implement this correctly. So right now there's several,

354
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:41.070
there's several areas where you would see that is, um, well, one,

355
00:23:41.071 --> 00:23:45.950
obviously the buddy shake goes power lifting programs that have been imported by

356
00:23:45.951 --> 00:23:50.270
these by power lifters. The other is we have the program called plan strong,

357
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.141
which is when again,

358
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:55.640
this is a very faithful representation of the Soviet weightlifting

359
00:23:55.641 --> 00:24:00.110
system, but applied to general strength exercises like squats, deadlifts,

360
00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:04.310
and so on. And the other thing, what we'll also do,

361
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:09.140
and this is what we do with, uh, with, with the military and so on and so forth.

362
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:14.150
We have some simple programs, very simple programs that are designed,

363
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:15.530
um,

364
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.510
using this Delta 20 principle and using this optimal loads that

365
00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:21.800
they just go out and use.

366
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.880
The nice thing is unlike progressive overload cycling,

367
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.750
if something happens, you've got a problem here or there is some variability.

368
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:33.470
So in summary to say, no, it's not wide. Leno is not.

369
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.180
<v 2>Now in the United States. Yeah. Let's fix it. And</v>

370
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.800
it makes sense. And one of the things that I really like,

371
00:24:41.801 --> 00:24:46.750
what you're saying about is completing the adaptation with your

372
00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:50.770
tendons and your ligaments and all these different things that oftentimes are

373
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.890
injured when you're ramping up your weightlifting.

374
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.300
And you're trying to increase the amount of weight you carry. So this,

375
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:03.220
this principle of maintaining at a similar weight for a long time,

376
00:25:03.221 --> 00:25:07.240
allowing your body to complete that adaptation, that makes a lot of sense.

377
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.790
<v 1>Adaptations need to be stable. And it does.</v>

378
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.860
It's not true just for strength training.

379
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.380
If you're looking at endurance as well,

380
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.050
the adaptations and the mitochondria as well, the,

381
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.920
you can get some acute adaptation. So very short term like, oh, you know,

382
00:25:20.921 --> 00:25:25.240
bigger, whatever guns in six weeks or faster 400 meters, six weeks. Yes,

383
00:25:25.241 --> 00:25:28.120
you can do that, but these adaptations are transient.

384
00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.780
So it takes time for things to really get got solidified.

385
00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:37.030
And also if you're more patient with your progression

386
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:41.590
as while you're going to find that your gains are much more stable,

387
00:25:41.591 --> 00:25:45.910
if you take some time off, which is important for anybody, you travel,

388
00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:49.060
you get sick. Uh, some other thing happens.

389
00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.630
So if you have been training in a manner where you're not forcing yourself,

390
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:52.960
okay,
