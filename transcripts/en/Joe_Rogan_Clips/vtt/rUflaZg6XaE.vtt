00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.440
<v 1>Experience. So at 19 I'm in this comedy club, Greenville comedy,</v>

3
00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:10.880
it's a black room. Chappelle is on stage and he's getting booed.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.200
And his dismount of getting booed is something I've never seen before in my

5
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:19.320
life. It was fantastic. He's like, y'all, I'm gonna be famous.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.750
&lt;laugh&gt; I'm gonna be famous.

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.630
Like he just kept saying that and then just walked off. And when he walked off,

8
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.790
I was like, I was like, oh my God, they booed him. Like in my head. I'm like,

9
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.230
if they booed him, I don't stand the chance in comedy.

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.790
Because like what just happened when he walked by,

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.740
nobody wanted to touch him cuz he had that, that, that bomb on him.

12
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.340
So even I like, yeah, Hey, Hey man. And he, and he

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.300
that's sweet bomb on stop bomb. Yes.

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.540
And he sits down in, in the, in the booth right here and I,

15
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.540
I just can't stop looking at him cause I'm watching, you know,

16
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:04.570
how they say the stages grief, like I'm watching the stages of,

17
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.930
and I keep thinking, why doesn't he leave?

18
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.890
And he's sitting there and Tony woods goes on stage next and Tony woods like,

19
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.690
wow man, God like just kind of a similar cadence.

20
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.530
And Tony destroys got a standing ovation like night and day.

21
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.360
And I I'm just 19, just new, like absorbing this. And I go,

22
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.320
what the just happened? Tony walks off stage. There's a comic.

23
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.320
I'm just kind of like dropping. Like I think I'm five, seven, but I'm six,

24
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:39.600
five, but I'm just trying to like look at what they gonna do next.

25
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.630
And they get up together and they walk out. I kind of follow 'em out thinking,

26
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.870
I don't know what's gonna happen to me, but Hey kid, you wanna hang with us?

27
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.510
I don't know. &lt;laugh&gt; they get in the same car. And, and it's like,

28
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.110
I think it was a hatchback. I'm not sure. And Tony drives off. I'm like, whoa,

29
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:57.470
they came together and I that's, that was all I knew of that,

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.270
of that relationship. And so, and I, and I,

31
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.540
I knew that Tony had been doing it a lot out longer and I knew that Dave,

32
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.981
it's kinda like how,

33
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.980
when Kobe came into the league and was talking like Mike and then Kobe leaned

34
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:16.580
into who Kobe was, became who yes. Speak, you know, I speak Italian,

35
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.340
I'm speaking Italian. I speak like this.

36
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.620
These are the things that important to me.

37
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.850
And so you watched Dave do that separate from, to Tony.

38
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.690
But what I love about what Dave did and this is why he's great is he had

39
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.530
he recognized Tony in his greatest like comedic moment.

40
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.690
Like it's the most honest thing you can do? You know what I mean?

41
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.250
Like most people would be like, I did this all me, but he was like, and,

42
00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.770
and what he said about Tony could not have been truer. You know what I mean?

43
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.930
And so it just like touched my heart. Cause I was,

44
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.640
I was there at the epicenter when I was watching Dave figure it out.

45
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.120
<v 0>So in the same way that a car rusts, uh, or, you know,</v>

46
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:53.600
accumulates junk in the oil or whatever, similarly,

47
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:58.480
the human body does damage to itself. And again, just like a car, an airplane,

48
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.120
the human body is set up to tolerate a certain amount of that damage so that

49
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.960
we can get through to the point where we have kids before we start going

50
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.600
functionally downhill, whether mentally or physically,

51
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.320
but after that evolution doesn't care about us anymore.

52
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.830
And therefore we are only equip to tolerate that

53
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.330
much.

54
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.950
And eventually the damage that's being done accumulates to a point beyond what

55
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:25.990
the body's set up to tolerate.

56
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.510
And that's when things start to go wrong and we start to function less.

57
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.820
<v 2>Well,</v>

58
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.070
what is the difference physically between a younger person and older person in

59
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:37.390
terms of their ability to recover from the damage of just regular everyday life

60
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.100
and exercise and abuse and running around. Yeah.

61
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.520
<v 0>All that.</v>

62
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.700
So that's just one aspect of the difference between a younger person and an

63
00:03:43.701 --> 00:03:47.540
older person. So let me answer that question by stepping back one step. Okay.

64
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.660
So the difference ultimately arises from what the body is made of at the

65
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.100
molecular level and failure level,

66
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.420
the body accumulates various changes that are chemical and by

67
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.770
consequences of what the body has to do to keep us alive from one day to the

68
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:07.170
next, even starting before we're born. And those changes,

69
00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:09.010
the reason I'm using the word damage to,

70
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.010
to describe those changes is because eventually things don't work so well.

71
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.970
So you're quite right.

72
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.450
That recovery from injury is one thing that doesn't work so well,

73
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.080
but so are plenty of other. So whether it's how fast you can run, how,

74
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.440
how fast you can think, you know how strongly you can grip something, uh,

75
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.720
how fast you can walk. Um, you know,

76
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.360
all of these things become progressively less good,

77
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.640
but the point is that the amount by which they become less good is pretty

78
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:38.920
negligible until the age of 40 or 50.

79
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.950
It's only then that the clients start to accelerate.

80
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.630
<v 2>So what do you do in your own life to try to mitigate that acceleration?</v>

81
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.350
<v 0>Yeah. I'm a really bad example of this for two, right? That's.</v>

82
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.110
<v 2>Crazy. But you're, uh, this is your business. So there.</v>

83
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.550
<v 0>Are two reasons why I'm bad at it. Okay.</v>

84
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.430
The first reason is that I'm really well built. I'm just lucky.

85
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.910
I'm just one of those hateful people who I can eat and drink exactly what I,

86
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.900
and nothing seems to happen. And I don't even need to exercise to speak of.

87
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.340
And you know, I'm far biologically, far younger than I actually am.

88
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:08.340
Chronologically. How old.

89
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.900
<v 2>Are you chronologically? Chronologically.</v>

90
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.733
<v 0>I'm 57.</v>

91
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.020
<v 2>How old do you think you are biologically?</v>

92
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.620
<v 0>Well, I'm told that I'm a, a good decade less than that.</v>

93
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.780
And this is what I get told every time I do these tests,

94
00:05:18.781 --> 00:05:22.570
which I've been doing for the past, let me see 18 years. Um, yeah,

95
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:25.810
so that's pretty good news. Um, so you're lucky. Yeah, that's genetically. Yeah.

96
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.170
But the other thing is, you know,

97
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.290
I'm working hard to Hasen the defeat of aging and, um,

98
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.050
maybe it's a net win, you know, maybe the amount that I'm hazing,

99
00:05:34.051 --> 00:05:36.770
it is more than the damage I'm doing myself by, for example,

100
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.050
not getting enough sleep. &lt;laugh&gt;.

101
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.970
<v 3>Here's what I understand about David go is the do stretch.</v>

102
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.840
<v 2>For two hours every night. But every night, every night.</v>

103
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.560
<v 3>I wanna know this routine. Like he, I don't, how could you stretch.</v>

104
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.960
<v 2>For two hours? He just does it. He doesn't have a job. First of all, he made,</v>

105
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.800
I don't wanna say I'm sure. Yeah. I don't wanna say his numbers,

106
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.840
but he made an ungodly amount of money on his book and uh,

107
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.200
he doesn't even own a car. He goes,

108
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.040
I'm a black ju I don't spend no money on no car. So he runs everywhere.

109
00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:10.960
Like his video &lt;laugh&gt; well, his wife has a car and, uh, he doesn't buy a car.

110
00:06:10.961 --> 00:06:15.960
He isn't, he's not spending any of that money. Like, he's, he's the real deal.

111
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.990
Like, like he's not posing. That's that guy all day long,

112
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.030
24 hours a day, you know? And he's honest about every step in the way he goes.

113
00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:26.590
Sometimes I get up and I just look at my sneakers.

114
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.870
I look at my sneakers for like a half hour. I don't do.

115
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.110
&lt;laugh&gt; I just sit there. I feel sorry for myself. Like,

116
00:06:32.111 --> 00:06:36.670
I don't really wanna run, but then it's that? you. You're gonna run run mother.

117
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.740
And he goes, and then once I run, then I feel it. He goes, and then when I run,

118
00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.220
I get mad at myself for not wanting to run earlier.

119
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.740
&lt;laugh&gt; so I run more like he's,

120
00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:49.780
he's honest about like his vulnerabilities and his weakness.

121
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.300
He's honest about who he is, but it's also, there's no, no question.

122
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.810
He's gonna get everything done. Like he's, he's a complex individual.

123
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.770
And I think because of the fact that he's so honest about all that stuff,

124
00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:05.170
it makes him even more intriguing. Like he's honest,

125
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.410
like all the pictures of him when he was drinking milkshakes and he was 300

126
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:12.050
pounds and yeah, he loves showing those to people. He's like, that was me.

127
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.410
He was, that was me. I was a fat. I was a fat. I was lazy.

128
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.520
He's like the first time I went running it, I ran like a quarter of a mile.

129
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.400
And I was gased out. I sit on the side of the road, like,

130
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.840
but do you believe like in that book, he thinks everybody has that in him.

131
00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.800
Do you think everybody to not to that degree, man, cuz that book was insane.

132
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.560
Well, I think it, it depends. I mean,

133
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:38.240
everybody has that in him. If you choose to act the way he acts,

134
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.270
but a lot of that book is insane and you learn. Cause I read the book as well.

135
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.030
You learn from that book and the audio Bush book,

136
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.710
I would actually recommend over the book.

137
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:50.150
It's so good because in between chapters,

138
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:55.190
he talks about all the different things that happen and actually

139
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.380
elaborates in a more extensive way makes you go, holy.

140
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.220
Like his life was hell his father was a monster

141
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.740
and he did not have a happy childhood by any stretch of the imagination.

142
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:10.780
It was horrible. It was, he,

143
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.700
it was filled with torture and racism and strife and

144
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.700
struggle and he felt sorry for himself. And it was terrible.

145
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.610
But all those demons now he has those locked up

146
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.210
pushing the wheel. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you know that iron wheel at cone, dumb,

147
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.290
dumb, they're in his head now pushing his wheel. He's got those working for him.

148
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:37.210
Now those are, they work for him. What was your first deployment? Like? So.

149
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.010
<v 4>My first one was with, uh, a team out in Hawaii.</v>

150
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.240
I where we were doing submersible work.

151
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:48.200
So I drove like a 22 foot mini sub for &lt;laugh&gt; five years. Really?

152
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.040
Oh yeah. And uh,

153
00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:53.200
we were doing some like waterborne activities and then how deep does it go?

154
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:55.680
<v 2>That's classified.</v>

155
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.400
<v 4>Oh really? But yeah. Uh, it, it can go really deep. Yeah. But it's a,</v>

156
00:08:59.401 --> 00:09:02.400
it's a wet submarine. So we're on, we're on scuba.

157
00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.320
It's all like you're you're in the water. Not just underwater. Oh really?

158
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.120
<v 2>Yeah. So you're wearing scuba gear while you're piloting this thing. Yep.</v>

159
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.040
So water gets in there. Yep. Whoa. It's.

160
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.550
<v 4>Like a, you can probably pull up a picture of it.</v>

161
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.230
<v 2>Bro. That's a mind. a top of a mind.</v>

162
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.030
SDV just being in a scuba is crazy.

163
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.510
But being in a scuba gear inside of a submarine with the door shut.

164
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.950
Oh Jesus Christ. So how much air you got in there? Enough. &lt;laugh&gt;

165
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.900
that's what I, it looks like there she is. Oh, that's nuts man. Fast the boat.

166
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.780
Oh, so it's like a convertible.

167
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.860
<v 4>It. No, no, no. So, um, behind those dudes, yeah, those doors are sliders.</v>

168
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.340
So you shut 'em so cuz it can drive relatively fast where like if you had 'em

169
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:50.580
open, like, it'd be like, bro.

170
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.260
<v 2>That looks like something from a James Bond movie that doesn't even.</v>

171
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.810
<v 4>It is like something from a James Bond move. We that's crazy.</v>

172
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.210
When we train in the daytime, it is bananas. It is wild to drive that thing.

173
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.290
I can only imagine. Cause you're landing on the back of a submarine.

174
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:07.850
<v 2>It's 22 feet.</v>

175
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:09.850
<v 4>Long. Ish. I, I mean, that's what I recall.</v>

176
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:14.090
<v 2>They, that looks you can it's looks fake it. Like if I saw that in the movie,</v>

177
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.400
I'm like they don't have one of those. Yeah. That's it? It does. Doesn't.

178
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.320
<v 4>It it's like a human torpedo. Yeah.</v>

179
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.640
<v 2>That's what it looks like. It looks like a missile. It is it's pretty cool.</v>

180
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.720
<v 4>Wow. So that is wild. There's a ton of those things. Um,</v>

181
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.160
that other countries have like they've been using submersibles since the first

182
00:10:33.161 --> 00:10:34.760
world war, you.

183
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.470
<v 2>Know? So when did they first invent sub Marines look the first.</v>

184
00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.190
<v 4>World war. No, no, I think, I think the revolutionary war,</v>

185
00:10:40.191 --> 00:10:44.190
there was a guy that like paddles around in a, uh, in like a,

186
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:49.070
I've seen a Barrel's like a Oak barrel. Yeah. It's like crazy looking. Wow.

187
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.550
<v 2>It's like, I'm just gonna go, well,</v>

188
00:10:50.551 --> 00:10:54.830
imagine the first gangster to climb into a metal Dick and slide it into the

189
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:55.790
ocean. Like I got this.

190
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:59.220
Even the guys that went to deep at us did it like in the thirties or forties and

191
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.580
no one's been able to do that again. Why they did in some like.

192
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:04.020
<v 4>Weird. Yeah really? And they had a window.</v>

193
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.540
It was like four inches across insane. Oh my God.

194
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.260
I think it cracked when they got to the bottom.

195
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:14.460
<v 2>Really? Oh. Oh my God. You imagine what? Cause nobody did it before.</v>

196
00:11:14.461 --> 00:11:17.890
So it's all just calculations up this time. You actually get down there and.

197
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.290
<v 4>Then, then you think like back to your question, how much hair do we got?</v>

198
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.650
Oh my God. I.

199
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.650
<v 2>Guess we have enough. Oh my God.</v>
