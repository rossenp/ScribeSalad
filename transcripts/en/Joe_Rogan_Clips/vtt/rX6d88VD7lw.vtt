<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.560
This was the beginning of this book because I was doing that.

3
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.640
I was looking at all the ingredients that go into Coca-Cola and saying, okay,

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.560
where what's in the drink. First of all, cuz it's from my hometown.

5
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:13.720
That's where it started. I said, okay,

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.840
I wanna find out all these natural resources in the product and you know,

7
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.630
is Coca in the drink. &lt;affirmative&gt; and also caffeine we'll get to that.

8
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:26.590
That's how it connect to Mon. But, um, Coca was the most interesting actually,

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.310
cuz I thought, you know, it's called Coca-Cola so does it have cocaine in it?

10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.310
Um, and so I went back to look at that and turns out yeah. You know,

11
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:39.670
trace amounts back still in the beginning. No, no, no. In the beginning. Yeah.

12
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:43.340
But this is, what's interesting of about the history of, of the drink.

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.260
So this is 1886 back then the Coca leaf was actually seen as

14
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:52.100
something that was medicinal medicinal in innocuous, you know? Absolutely.

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.300
And everyone was using the Coca leaf. I mean there was a drink called VIN Maria.

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.900
It was actually a wine, a, a red wine that was mixed with Coca Leafs. Wow.

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.810
So it kind of had a little kick to it and like queen Victoria of England drank

18
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:10.170
this stuff Uly as grant, our president was like, woo. You know, COA wine.

19
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.930
This is awesome. And uh, and even the Pope actually, and I,

20
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.410
I wonder if communion would've had, you know, been Mariani,

21
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.560
we would all be cap or something, but, um, but so it was really popular.

22
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.480
And this guy, this guy who was down on his luck, John Pemberton,

23
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:29.680
who started Coca-Cola in Atlanta, he wanted to make a Coca drink himself.

24
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.480
And so he made this originally co was actually a wine.

25
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.080
It was like a wine of Coca. It was a red wine mixed with Coca leaves,

26
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.520
exact knockoff of that drink that was really popular. And um,

27
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.790
and then prohibition hit it's Atlanta because we're in the Protestant south in

28
00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:48.070
the 1880s. And so he has to take out the alcohol.

29
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.430
And so he creates this non-alcoholic drink Coca-Cola that has the

30
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.030
Coco leaf in it. They weren't concerned about the Coca.

31
00:01:56.031 --> 00:02:00.870
They were concerned about alcohol. Uh, and it, it remained in the drink, uh,

32
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:05.300
throughout the 20th century. What kind of would it have in it very small,

33
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.980
you know, and this, I think is important. You know,

34
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:12.580
people equate the Coca leaf with, you know, cocaine because yes,

35
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:16.500
you can make cocaine like street cocaine from, you know,

36
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.220
processing all these Coca Leafs.

37
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.820
But if you go to Peru today or you go to certain parts of south America,

38
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.850
people chew cocoa leave, it's, it's a normal practice.

39
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:28.450
It's been going back thousands of years to the Inca even. Um,

40
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.770
and so it's, it's very small amounts we're not talking about,

41
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.490
like in fact you'd probably get a bigger hit from like a, you know,

42
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.610
experience from a cup of espresso from Starbucks. Mm. Um,

43
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.480
but interestingly, the reason that cocaine became taboo white,

44
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.040
it got pulled from the drink,

45
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.960
had nothing to do with national laws in the country,

46
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.920
which was so interesting when I was studying it.

47
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.960
It had everything to do with racism actually in the south,

48
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.960
because there was a concern that cocaine was contributing to black crime in

49
00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:00.730
Atlanta,

50
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.600
which was being of course blown up by segregationist and white supremacist and

51
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.880
ASA caner, who was white guy in Atlanta.

52
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:09.360
Didn't wanna have anything to do with that.

53
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.760
So he decides kind of quietly to take out the cocaine.

54
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.040
But here's the interesting, interesting thing, Joe,

55
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.510
they kept the Cocal leaf as one of their secreting ingredients. Yeah.

56
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.030
It it's so secret ingredient, number five, by the way, cook,

57
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:24.390
doesn't like talking about this.

58
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.990
This is not part of their history that they like discussing. Um,

59
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.510
but it's clear as day in the archives. You can see it.

60
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.150
So it's called merchandise number five,

61
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.150
the fifth secret ingredient in Coca-Cola and I like the name,

62
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.180
isn't it a nice number five. Well,

63
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:44.780
the whole idea is that you name things so that no one asks questions, right. Um,

64
00:03:44.781 --> 00:03:46.140
what's merchandise number five.

65
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.300
Also that that ingredient includes a little bit of the Cola, um,

66
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.300
which is from, uh, west Africa actually.

67
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.700
And it was originally in there cuz it has caffeine,

68
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.220
another kind of caffeine kick, um,

69
00:03:58.221 --> 00:04:01.970
that's where Coca-Cola come from &lt;affirmative&gt; but Cola by the way is with a K

70
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.050
the actual Cola. Anyway, that's merchandise number five.

71
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.330
And it's basically the flavor of the co leaf. Um,

72
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.730
the essence of the Coca leaf and the way it works is these leaves are brought in

73
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.690
from Peru is actually where CocaCola sourced it. And that was crazy.

74
00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.400
I had to track down, okay, where are they getting their Coca Leafs from?

75
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.680
And there's this company called Maywood chemical company today,

76
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.720
the company's called Steppen chemical company. Is that New Jersey.

77
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.800
It is in New Jersey. Exactly. Maywood.

78
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.200
<v 1>New Jersey. Yeah. They're no,</v>

79
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:34.120
they're the ones who process it and they make medical grade cocaine out of it

80
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:37.760
and then use the flavor aspect of it for Coca-Cola.

81
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.710
<v 0>Exactly. And you know, technic at first, as you,</v>

82
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.190
as you put it, most of the cocaine was going for pharmaceutical uses and for,

83
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.630
you know, B lidocaine, all sorts of things like that.

84
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.110
They used for legitimate purposes, but Coke needed actually so much flavoring.

85
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.790
Think about their brand. So big, like wheat.

86
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.590
<v 1>Grass juice, we squeeze a lot. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

87
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.420
<v 0>Exactly a cup. So they had to like, come up with this special. I love it.</v>

88
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.100
You can't make this stuff up. This is why history is fun.

89
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.300
There's a special exemption in our laws for what are called special leaves

90
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.340
from Peru. And if anybody looking at it saying, well,

91
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.260
what the hell are these special leaves? You know?

92
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.100
And they're special because they're allowed to come into the United States

93
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.330
exclusively basically to create the flavoring extract for Coca-Cola.

94
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.330
And a lot of people call it the Coca-Cola joker.

95
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.370
<v 1>How closely do you think they monitor that supply? &lt;laugh&gt; you know,</v>

96
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.410
I mean very closely.

97
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.250
They would have to cause like if a bundle or two fell off a truck here or there,

98
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.930
that could be extremely profitable. Right.

99
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.010
<v 0>I talked to somebody once they said so is there like,</v>

100
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.200
like a pile of cocaine somewhere up in New Jersey, you know,

101
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:48.600
where this is happening and uh, you know, I don't think that's the case,

102
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.120
but here's, here's the crazy part too. This is,

103
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.080
what's fun about tracing these stories of ingredients because they lead you to

104
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.920
places. You never thought you'd go like this book, which we'll talk about. But,

105
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.640
um, it got weird if that's not weird, it got weirder in the sixties. Um,

106
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.640
because Coca-Cola wanted to figure out a way to make

107
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.480
Coca leaves in the United States to grow their own Coca leaves.

108
00:06:12.481 --> 00:06:14.680
They weren't satisfied with this trade with Peru.

109
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.830
And these are declassified da documents at the national archives.

110
00:06:19.831 --> 00:06:23.590
This is not like, you know, two flow hat. Yeah. Uh, something crazy.

111
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.110
You can see it. And actually it's in the book,

112
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.990
but basically they petitioned the federal government to start

113
00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:33.950
growing it. At first, they're thinking like the Virgin islands,

114
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.910
but then they're like, ah, I don't know. There's like all these tourists,

115
00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.880
it's gonna be crazy,

116
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.620
but they have to find a climate in a location geography where they can do this.

117
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.220
And they ultimately go, okay, what about Hawaii?

118
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.660
And they do Joe, they grew Coca leaves,

119
00:06:49.661 --> 00:06:53.340
secretly a totally secret operation called the AKA project

120
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.290
also called AKA. What does that mean? Exactly. Nobody's gonna ask questions,

121
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.570
you know, obfuscate the, the story in Kauai. Oh wow.

122
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.130
And it was done through the university of Hawaii. Uh,

123
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:10.970
they had to sign all these nondisclosure agreements and they wouldn't publish

124
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.330
their papers. Uh, you know that on the study of all this,

125
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.730
the reason the government agreed to it is that Coke said we're gonna create

126
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.640
cocaine less Coca shrub,

127
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.960
like basically breed a plant that doesn't have cocaine in it.

128
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.680
And of course that never really transpires,

129
00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.360
but they do end up growing secretly behind Barb wire fences, COEs for Coca-Cola,

130
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.310
uh, in the sixties. But I'm an environmental histor. I study the,

131
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.590
the relationship between like businesses and the environment. And in this case,

132
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:48.030
the environment matters cuz nature bit back. So in the sixties,

133
00:07:48.031 --> 00:07:52.910
this fungus that's native to Hawaii was like, whoa, this plant,

134
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.430
uh, that's not native and attacks it. And it wipes out the entire, uh,

135
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.940
Coca crop of Coca-Cola so that the supply they had for a very brief time in the

136
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:07.140
sixties is wiped out. They go back to sourcing it from, uh, Peru,

137
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.420
watch the entire.
