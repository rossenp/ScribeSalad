00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.380
one day he stole 12 corvettets, 12 red corvettets and lined him up outside.

17
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.140
And in one of the corvettets it was a briefcase full of cash.

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.370
And he went in and he bought the entire lunchroom lunch. Lunch is on me.

You're not gonna be released. And I went, oh, let me change my clothes.

28
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.880
So I changed my clothes. I went in and I did the show and it was really they.

33
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.630
and this was when Wal Paul was still maximum secur, you know,

34
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.070
I mean the worst of the worst. So we go in and, uh,

35
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.270
I'm with DJ and a couple of people, DJ has it. And I thinkwan how's he doing?

36
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980
I don't, I think there was a cancer thing.

37
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.540
And then he beat that and I got stories about, but Hey, good guy. Oh my God.

38
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.580
Remind me about DJ. I wanna finish this. So I'm on stage. And I'm thinking,

39
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:17.460
Hey man, Bump's in here. Right? Think, and he jumps up on stage and I go B,

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.380
he goes, how you doing? He goes, I'm in here on and assumed name.

41
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.860
I'm in here to Danny. This is 35 years ago.

42
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:27.410
He's in war Paul under an assumed name. I mean, I could that be,

43
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.850
you know, well, anyway, he gets out and then he,

44
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.130
he murders some guy &lt;laugh&gt; and he goes back and he's in for double life.

45
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.490
Now two murders. And I said to him, B why'd you kill the guy. He goes,

46
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.730
he was talking. You know, &lt;laugh&gt; he just a little bit of a guy, but funny.

47
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.640
I mean, he's the type of guy, someone, him to kick his.

48
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.240
You make them laugh so hard. You couldn't punch him. He was that funny.

49
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.720
And now he's in, he's been in for, I got, I wanna visit him, but you know,

50
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.120
they said, it's not a good idea, but I'm gonna go visit him. You know,

51
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.200
I'm not look old now, but he's been, he's been over 30 years now.

52
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.720
But the thing is only thing that I guess.

53
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 2>With me and what I stand on is that I was able to forgive him.</v>

54
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.910
And that's,

55
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.840
that has been the turnaround in my life to tend to make

56
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:15.280
people, people all be wondered about the ear, the earbody. And I said,

57
00:03:15.281 --> 00:03:19.230
but I forgave him. Everybody said, so what's special about that. I,

58
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.630
but everywhere I go around the world with the Muslim,

59
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.430
whatever, and people say, wow, this guy can forgive.

60
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.710
How can you forgive when you already beating the guy? Yeah. I said,

61
00:03:33.711 --> 00:03:38.190
but you know, but it is, it's what it is. What life have to be.

62
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.020
If you going to survive with even your brothers and sisters.

63
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.900
Cause if you don't forgive nobody,

64
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.660
you gonna be a mad person and you gonna find yourself locked up. Right.

65
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.860
<v 0>Right. And it's gonna haunt you. Yes. Whereas if you forgave him,</v>

66
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.540
it took a weight off your shoulders. Yeah.

67
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.820
<v 2>I'm talking I'm I, Mike and I,</v>

68
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.450
we do a lot of things together because the forgiveness part. Absolutely.

69
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.610
<v 0>It's cool to see you two together now. I mean, when,</v>

70
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:07.210
when I have seen things that you've done together, I'm like, wow, it's crazy.

71
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.930
Like after he bit you, those crazy fights and to see you together,

72
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.410
laughing and joking around together, it's, it's pretty.

73
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.050
<v 2>Interesting. Well, I'm telling me when you tell people, you know,</v>

74
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.520
when you don't choose your parents, you don't choose your name neighborhood.

75
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.720
You ain't choose your skin color. You ain't choose to be tall or short,

76
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.160
but you know, this is your statue. And, and two people,

77
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.640
two people who came from the ghetto who box and and box

78
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.120
was the only thing I did real well. Okay. And football. And,

79
00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:42.470
but the thing is that after all that look at how much money we made

80
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.470
doing something that we, by doing it properly, we make money. Yeah.

81
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.070
We make money and we can both, you know,

82
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.790
raise our family in the way that we wanted to raise them.

83
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.550
<v 0>How long did it take after the fight before you forgave them? Uh.</v>

84
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.420
<v 2>By it, I think after about, by the time I,</v>

85
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.660
I got into the locker room and everybody started

86
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.500
complaining, man, I can't believe he did this, this, this, this. I said, look,

87
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.100
I said, did he bite you? They said, no. Oh, okay. I said he bit me. Right.

88
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:20.500
And I said, now I'm going, forgive him. You know what?

89
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.650
Y'all got to forgive me into. Wow. They said, what you mean forgiving? I said,

90
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:29.490
he ain't bite you. I said, bit me. &lt;laugh&gt;. I said, look, I'm a forgive it. Wow.

91
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.410
<v 0>So you Forga him in the locker room right after the.</v>

92
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.490
<v 2>Fight. Yes. Because the thing is, the thing is I, you know,</v>

93
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.250
I was really mad coming,

94
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.600
coming down and people throwing water and people are mad and they upset because

95
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.800
they didn't get a chance to see what they really wanted to see. Right.

96
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.880
Like this. And so they were mad and they were upset. And, and I asked,

97
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.360
you know, me, I figured who in control of God.

98
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.800
So I said, Lord, what is this thing all about it? He said, forgive.

99
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.880
<v 3>Were you outta weapons? Were you outta outta ammo? N so my, no,</v>

100
00:06:03.881 --> 00:06:07.080
he had came up and he started choking me. Um,

101
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.800
I had shot him once before and he, I was trying to pick my buddy do Lee. My, my,

102
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.400
my, one of my closest Afghans dot Lee had been shot. He, he got kill.

103
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:18.310
He had been killed. And I came around this terrace to get him.

104
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:21.790
And I was on my knee and this guy came up behind me. And, um,

105
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.910
so he didn't have a weapon either. He was trying, no, he did. He,

106
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.390
he had a weapon and I ended up shooting him from the ground.

107
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.110
And I thought he was dead when he fell on the ground.

108
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.310
And I kind of moved down and got down with dotta Lee, cuz we,

109
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.030
I was still getting shot at, from this machine gun up on this hill.

110
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.340
And I trying to make myself small as I could. And um,

111
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.540
this guy ends up coming up and choking me. Like I thought he was,

112
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.140
I thought he was dead and he ends up choking me out.

113
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.860
He starts trying to choke me out and eventually led up a little bit and I ended

114
00:06:50.861 --> 00:06:53.500
up getting around him and I just got,

115
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:56.860
we were fighting back and forth and I can remember all of us thinking about was

116
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.850
like, don't let his legs get on me. Like, you know, these guys, their legs are,

117
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:02.410
I mean, they've been crawling up mountains, their whole life. And he was a,

118
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:04.010
he was a pretty big dude. And um,

119
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.970
I just remember getting on top of him finally got on top of him and I ended up,

120
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.850
I, I was rolling on top of him. He didn't have all the gear on I did. And um,

121
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.930
I ended up, I remember getting on top of him, like,

122
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.080
like I was straddling him and I'm just reaching up,

123
00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:22.480
trying to grab for anything I can and I'm holding him and um,

124
00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.520
holding him down with my throat, with my,

125
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.640
my forearm and I'm just grabbing anything I can't.

126
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:29.360
And finally I ended up grabbing a rock and I just started beating this dude's

127
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:32.320
face in and I just started beating and beating and beating. And I remember,

128
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.240
I remember just like finally, like after hitting him, you know, I don't know,

129
00:07:36.241 --> 00:07:39.750
three or four times four or five times, whatever. I remember him,

130
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:43.310
like finally just kind of looking at me and like, just it's it's like,

131
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:44.910
he's like just, I'm just looking him in the eyes,

132
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:49.190
like obviously closer than me to you right now. And you just see all the,

133
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:54.350
you can tell, like he knows where this is going. And I always think about that,

134
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.190
you know? Um, obviously I would kill him a million times over again. Right. He,

135
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.060
he was the enemy. Like I don't feel bad about that part of it,

136
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.900
but I just think about like in that moment,

137
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.660
if I can find a way to relate to him in that moment,

138
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.460
a man I'm taking his life,

139
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.260
we all in America can find a way to connect with each other.

140
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.660
If we don't connect with each other it's cuz we choose not to.

141
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:23.970
I don't care what your differences are. Like.

142
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.890
Don't like find a reason of why we can get along,

143
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.490
not why we should not get along. Right. And, and I,

144
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.770
I always think about that moment, you know, of this guy and you know,

145
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.810
he obviously ended up dying and, and, and it, what it showed me was is that no,

146
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.760
cause that you that's built on hate will survive.

147
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.720
I didn't hate this guy. I didn't even know him, but I was willing to,

148
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.640
to take his life because of what I loved.

149
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.760
He was so cool. Like, everybody liked that guy.

150
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.280
<v 0>And he used to like to get high and go to strip clubs. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

151
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.360
He used to like to get high and go to strip clubs,

152
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.440
get high and ride around in his boat. I went to a strip club with him. Wow.

153
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.120
Do you remember which one? Um, I think it was Bob's classy lady.

154
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.990
I think that's what it was called. I don't think it's around out anymore,

155
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.390
but he had an appreciation for these young ladies

156
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.590
that was like, it was,

157
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:29.390
it was almost childlike, but it wasn't creepy. He was like, God,

158
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:33.670
you're beautiful. You look. Cause he was high. He was like, you look amazing.

159
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:39.220
This isn't incredible. Like he was having a good time. He was a,

160
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.460
he was a really, really unique character. I remember there was a guy who was,

161
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.180
um, some guy was blackmailing him and uh,

162
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.220
some guy had filmed him at a strip club with his wife

163
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.010
and his wife was getting a lap dance and he was getting a lamp dance too.

164
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.410
And the guy was like,

165
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:01.490
he wrote some really creepy letter saying that this is gonna violate the

166
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.890
policies cuz you know,

167
00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:06.650
Phil had had endorsements and commercial deals and he was doing movies and stuff

168
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:09.370
like that. He was just blowing up, got a Ferrari, you know,

169
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:13.130
he was blowing up and um, this guy had, uh,

170
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:18.640
went to his house and nailed this VHS tape and an envelope to

171
00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:22.280
his garage door. And uh,

172
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.400
I was with him on, on a phone call. So it Phil, like,

173
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.600
I'm gonna talk to him right now. I'm come, come, come, come in my room.

174
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.160
So I went in his, uh, dressing room and the guy calls me and say, Hey,

175
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.440
what's going on buddy?

176
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.750
He was talking to the guy like the guy was his friend and they were saying at

177
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:40.230
the guy up and you know, Phil's gonna give him, like,

178
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.270
I forget what the money was.

179
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.310
Tens of thousands of dollars meet me at this place and I'll meet you there.

180
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.910
And he had, uh, these, uh,

181
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.790
for lack of a better term,

182
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.950
he had someone who's a dangerous person meet this guy and let,

183
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:02.260
to know in no uncertain terms that his life was gonna take a terrible turn for

184
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:07.140
the worst if he continued down this path. And, but it was, uh,

185
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.020
it was weird to see like someone trying to exploit him. And the guy was so dumb.

186
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:15.460
He actually met with Phil. Like Phil knew who the guy was like, he,

187
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.930
he saw his face, you know, he was there with the guy and the guy was like, look,

188
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.170
you know, I just need some money. And Phil's like, look, I get it. It's not,

189
00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:25.850
no big deal. You know? It's just,

190
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.930
it's weird when you see someone trying to like prey on, like,

191
00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:32.650
they think that's their way out. Like this is my way out.

192
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.210
I'm just gonna get this guy to gimme some money and then I'm gonna put it all

193
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.440
together. You get it Phil. I mean, I just need some money. He is like,

194
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.840
I get it buddy. No big deal.

195
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.320
But he was just playing this guy along until the dangerous men came and

196
00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:49.440
talked to him. These vegans were set up in front of this,

197
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.520
I guess where we'd get hamburgers. Oh, that big guy burst through the line. Big.

198
00:11:53.521 --> 00:11:53.720
Yeah.

199
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:54.460
<v 4>Big. Yeah.</v>

200
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.000
So when do hunters ever like get confrontational

201
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.560
and violent with people who don't want to eat meat? Right?

202
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:03.463
When does that happen?

203
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.760
<v 0>Well, they think somehow or another by blocking this burger stand that they're</v>

204
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.920
changing the world. They're just trying to be activists. You know,

205
00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:12.950
they're trying to get a message out and most of them will to quit.

206
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.950
They're gonna quit veganism and they're gonna start eating meat again because

207
00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:19.070
their health. Yeah. That's, that's the truth. It's some ridiculous number.

208
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.510
Google. This what number? I, I think they said the number of, uh,

209
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:26.470
vegans and vegetarians that eat meat when they're drunk is something outrageous.

210
00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.150
It's like close to 90%. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.

211
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.270
<v 4>Well not how.</v>

212
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:34.260
<v 0>Many, how many vegans wind to up quitting and eating meat?</v>

213
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.980
What if they've ever done a study on that? This.

214
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.580
<v 4>Is like a big thing, cuz you know, there's been a movement,</v>

215
00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.660
sort of a movement and people have different success rates with being a vegan,

216
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.620
but cam Newton, who is a quarterback of the Carolina Panthers, big dude,

217
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.900
6, 6, 2 50, 2 60.

218
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:57.530
He went vegan and he cannot get healthy. He cannot he's been injured.

219
00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.130
He's I mean the face of the franchise,

220
00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.410
probably a hundred million dollar contract. Um,

221
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.170
I mean made it to the super bowl,

222
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.290
but since just been on a decline and it is like almost

223
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.200
hand hand with this change into vegan.

224
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.080
<v 0>Well, you know that guy, Dr. Sean Baker,</v>

225
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.200
he's the advocate of that connivore diet.

226
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.240
He marks all these people that were in originally in that game changers

227
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:27.680
documentary that James Cameron put out. Yeah. A ton of em,

228
00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:30.640
quit before the movie came out and they had to pull 'em outta the movie because

229
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:33.920
they were vegan and because of health reasons they had to quit. Right.

230
00:13:33.921 --> 00:13:36.150
It's it's an rination movie. Yeah. And it's also,

231
00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.350
it's extremely biased and it's not focusing on all of the

232
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:43.190
various problems that people have.

233
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.830
It's only focused on the positive aspects of it.

234
00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:48.830
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and distorting the reality of those positive messages,

235
00:13:48.831 --> 00:13:52.310
particularly like the strong man who's on a fuckload of steroids. Yeah.

236
00:13:52.311 --> 00:13:54.310
They forget that part. They forget that part. And,

237
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.100
and then all these other athletes like these,

238
00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.820
these we're not talking and even the strong men,

239
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.860
he's not like an elite strong man. Yeah. You're not talking about some,

240
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.660
like when I had Robert ORST in here. Right. He's like everybody eats the same.

241
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.220
He's like meat and rice. Like they eat meat. Yeah.

242
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:10.740
Like all those strong men eat the same thing, the real strong men,

243
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:13.940
the ones who actually win the competitions. What do you got? Jamie? It's.

244
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.450
<v 5>Uh, very controversial, real search that came out. But it's uh,</v>

245
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:22.890
a very repeated number of 84% of vegans and vegetarians end up going back

246
00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.530
to eating meat at some.

247
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.450
<v 4>Level. Yeah. Right before they die.</v>

248
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:36.240
<v 6>Okay.</v>
