<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 2>Well, when you make films like Elysium, you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.340
these dystopian films about potential futures,

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.540
it's got like, sort of sparked these thoughts in your mind.

5
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:16.500
Like how many of these possibilities could we encounter in our lifetime?

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.590
<v 1>Well, at least, you know, I'm was, I mean,</v>

7
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.730
Elisia man district nine are both kind of cut from the same cloth in the sense

8
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:23.931
that I,

9
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:27.060
I do think a lot of that had to do with growing up in South Africa and just

10
00:00:27.061 --> 00:00:31.440
being affected by I'm very naturally interested in

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.870
how society seemed to stratify and how wealth inequality, you know, again,

12
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.910
this is biological programming, right? Like I think,

13
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:42.840
I think that people hang on to resources that they have as much as they can.

14
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.890
And so you end up with, you end up with, with billionaires, um, because it's,

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.950
it's an understandable thing, right? It makes total sense.

16
00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:54.720
You're just hoarding food in your cave to live through the winter and keep your

17
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:59.280
family safe. So, but, but at least I'm really, if,

18
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.480
if district nine was the,

19
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.350
was the sort of racial part of growing up in South Africa and just being very

20
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:05.850
aware of the environment that I was in,

21
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.010
then Alicia is the kind of wealth discrepancy part of it. You know, where,

22
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.570
where South Africa and Brazil and India would be,

23
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.040
would be in first place when it comes to them. And you just see very,

24
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:20.310
you see imagery that's extremely striking, um,

25
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.200
in that country that leaves an indelible mark on you. I think actually,

26
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.820
you know, the inspiration for Elysium entire, the,

27
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.300
the whole thing actually for me was I was shooting commercials in,

28
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.660
um, it was, I was, it was 2005 and I was, I was,

29
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:39.990
I had started directing commercials and I was doing a commercial for Nike and I

30
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:41.070
was in, uh,

31
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.420
San Diego and the line producer that I was working with really wanted to go to

32
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.600
Tijuana and, and I was like, sick. I didn't want to go. And he's like,

33
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.190
we gotta get in the car. And we got to go to Tijuana.

34
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.410
Like now we gotta go down there and get a, get a beer or something.

35
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.750
And I was like, I really don't want to do this. And he's like, let's just go,

36
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.880
it'll be fine. So I went,

37
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.840
we went through the border into Mexico as the sun was going down and

38
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.620
we got there and got on to, you know, we were on some street corner and I,

39
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.790
we bought beers.

40
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.330
And then we were walking around into Tijuana with the beers and these federal

41
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.560
Raleigh's saw us doing it.

42
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.780
And we got arrested like kind of relatively violently where we were, you know,

43
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.310
it was a shakedown from money obviously, but it was like we,

44
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:20.460
we got coughed and thrown in the back of the police car.

45
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.110
And then they started driving out of Tijuana in the darkness.

46
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.940
And, um,

47
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.940
and the producer that I was with kept putting like a hundred dollar bills

48
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.490
through the graded thing to the, to the front seats.

49
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.370
And then once there was enough money that had gone through,

50
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:36.900
they just kind of opened the doors and let us out.

51
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.890
And we had to walk back to where the car was and the farmer's walk.

52
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.220
I don't remember how long we were walking for. It was, it felt long.

53
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:48.060
It felt like 40, or like an hour, maybe 40 minutes somewhere in there.

54
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.850
But the thing that was crazy about it was,

55
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.060
was I could see us Blackhawks flying the border

56
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.170
with like lights on them and, and floodlights on the far on the U S side.

57
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.330
And we were walking through basically favelas with dogs barking.

58
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.360
And like they had dropped us in places that like tourists from the U S would

59
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.194
never go.

60
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.760
So we were walking in basically what felt like a south African shantytown in

61
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.120
Mexico, uh, with feral animals and just like this.

62
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.140
But to see this country that, you know, is, was,

63
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:27.130
was this the sort of global hyper power that everyone from Mexico was moving

64
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.600
into, um, w was trying to get into, uh,

65
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.620
was incredibly striking. Like it was just crazy. I mean,

66
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.180
it is crazy if you think about that,

67
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.940
that level of poverty up against the U S border. And then,

68
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.520
and I think Elisia I'm really was,

69
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.210
was this sort of subconscious part of it was South Africa,

70
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.450
but the conscious part was that I, at, in that moment, I was like,

71
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:53.710
I really want to find a way to turn that experience into,

72
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.260
into visuals that represent these two worlds that live on one

73
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:00.130
another's doorstep.

74
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.860
<v 0>So you were, as you're walking by,</v>

75
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.890
you could see the planes that were flying over the U S.

76
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.890
<v 1>Side, not the planes, it was border patrol, they were Blackhawks,</v>

77
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.810
there were helicopters that were flying the border. And, um,

78
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.650
and just floodlights, there were floodlights like along the, along the fence,

79
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.050
along the perimeter, like, I guess they driven us kind of like, you know,

80
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.100
east of, of where we were. It was weird. It was, it was,

81
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.830
it was very impactful though. Like it had a huge effect on me.
