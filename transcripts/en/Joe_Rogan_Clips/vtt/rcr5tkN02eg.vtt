00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Give you an idea of where my energy comes from.</v>

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.040
<v 1>Let's imagine that you actually believe that males and females are equally</v>

3
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:15.420
intelligent. Okay. Just fishery and equivalents.

4
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.410
Can I say LOL

5
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.980
then your then what would you be?

6
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.630
You'd be fascinated as to why you don't have males and females in an

7
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.450
intellectually, depending in equal numbers in any, in an,

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.930
in a demanding occupation. So you'd start saying, huh.

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.500
If I already assumed that males and females are equally intelligent,

10
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:40.890
I care about different categories. How much of this is about fertility?

11
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:43.170
How much of this is about Kenworth? How much of that,

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.830
of this Sabet structural oppression, how much of this is about path dependence?

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.870
You do some very careful thing in order to understand your

14
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.460
problem. And only when you'd finally understood your problem, would you say,

15
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.530
okay, now I have an idea of how to remediate it.

16
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.190
We need a financial product that transfers money from late life to early life,

17
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.540
because the huge burden that knocks women out of the stem pipeline might be,

18
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.940
uh, that they have to take care of elderly parents or young kids. Bingo. Now,

19
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.570
now you're working in a totally different idiom because you've,

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.460
you've actually come up with a different idea or for example, um, if,

21
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.070
if you make, if you hard coat like Sean Carroll,

22
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.260
I think just had a podcast in which he said something to the effect of well on

23
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.480
the IDW is kind of in to interested in race and IQ.

24
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.720
I have never been interested in race and IQ.

25
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.610
The only time I became interested in race and IQ was when I started hearing.

26
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.170
There is absolutely no variation between groups and, you know,

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.380
in any kind of, uh, cognitive endowment. Well,

28
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.350
certainly there is in terms of height, the ability to radiate heat, melon,

29
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.660
unkind, and attend to the skinny ability to absorb sunlight.

30
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.120
It doesn't pass the smell test that you could be able to say that a priori

31
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.400
it's just, it's not a scientific type statement.

32
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.530
It's something you'd have to investigate.

33
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.290
So in that situation, am I interested in,

34
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:11.130
in some finding that says that one group is smarter and other groups are not as

35
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.350
smart, do I believe that IQ equals smartness? No,

36
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.040
I don't believe IQ equals smartness. Do I believe that there's no cultural bias?

37
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:19.290
I think there is cultural bias. I, you know, I've,

38
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.260
I'm definitely on record of saying, um,

39
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.190
there are ways in which groups that are S are said to, uh,

40
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.080
fare less well in terms of IQ, uh, demonstrate actual intellectual dominance.

41
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.000
This is some rich, weird area I've never cared about before.

42
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:40.560
And the only reason that it becomes interesting to me, um,

43
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.990
is that suddenly we're,

44
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:47.850
we're making these incredible proclamations with certainty. Like,

45
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:51.840
you know, you can't say this word or this is absolutely true. And like,

46
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.870
life doesn't work like that. There's no word in the English language.

47
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.380
George Carlin made this point all the time. There are no bad words.

48
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.030
There's bad intent. They're bad people.

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.250
<v 2>Well, isn't it also the issue being a part of a group say more</v>

50
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.240
IDW is too interested in race and IQ. I'm not,

51
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.900
I'm not who is, I mean, I'm really not. I don't discuss that at all.

52
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:19.140
I understand, but who, who is interest? Sam Harris has discussed it before,

53
00:03:19.141 --> 00:03:21.120
but he discussed it with someone who was studying. I don't.

54
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.890
<v 1>Think Sam,</v>

55
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.460
I think that Sam felt that he had Sam felt the Charles Murray had been

56
00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:29.580
railroaded by him by he Sam Harris.

57
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.260
And then as Sam came to understand what it is like to have a mob turn on you,

58
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.290
Sam said, maybe I'm wrong about Charles Murray.

59
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:41.760
And then as recline made this really interesting point in a really unfair way

60
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.670
against Sam, which was basically like, Hey,

61
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:46.950
you don't know what Charles Murray is. He's a hybrid.

62
00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:49.860
He's not just a social scientist. He's also got an agenda.

63
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.750
<v 2>Right? Is that accurate? I think so. I've never read Mary's work,</v>

64
00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:57.540
but I don't know enough to say either, but I believe polarizing,

65
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.180
I think bell curve,

66
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:04.950
the whole idea about being able to recognize the

67
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:08.850
differences in gender and race and IQ. It's like,

68
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.870
it's a very contentious subject, both analyze all.

69
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.880
<v 1>I mean, look, I have to admit that I don't score that well on certain tests.</v>

70
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.960
So I have a built in total skepticism

71
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.000
of IQ tests, sat, tests, act tests,

72
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.200
any kind of test.

73
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.020
<v 2>Because it's an unnatural examination.</v>

74
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.900
<v 1>It just isn't what is it? It's a proxy. Like there are people who think, oh,</v>

75
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.100
it's a really good proxy.

76
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.430
<v 2>I've never met someone who has a really high IQ though,</v>

77
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.850
that I deemed to be intellectually inferior.

78
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.350
<v 1>Yeah. But I've met people who don't have very high IQs who just blow me away.</v>

79
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.333
Yes.

80
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.820
<v 2>Right. Well, there's absolutely. There's a type of intelligence.</v>

81
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.970
A certain people possess, particularly creative intelligence. Yeah.

82
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.840
There's a creative.

83
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.550
And like there's certain people that men might not score well on sat tests,

84
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.620
but they're capable of producing amazing stuff. Whether it's literature, comedy,

85
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.970
whatever, whatever it is, movies, they can make things. They can do things.

86
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:14.040
They have a genius in their ability.

87
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.220
And that requires some intelligence.

88
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:21.990
It requires some immeasurable that something that you can't put on a scale.

89
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.430
I mean, you know, I said to Jordan.

90
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.140
<v 1>I said, Jordan Peterson. I said, I don't think I have an IQ because the conceit,</v>

91
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.360
we have to remember that a priori,

92
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:33.840
we would always have guessed that I T intelligence was many different things.

93
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.740
It was a composite of like lots of different types of intelligence. Right.

94
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.030
The concede around IQ is you'd think that was true. But guess again,

95
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.950
there's essentially one kind of intelligence. There's one scale.

96
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.730
It's a surprise. Oh, that's, that's really surprising.

97
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.810
Tell me something of the various forms of intelligence is one of the things that

98
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:59.120
you call intelligence processing. Yes. Yes. Processing is very important.

99
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.540
Okay. I don't score well on processing. In fact,

100
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:05.180
I don't think anyone in my family has ever scored well on what do you mean by

101
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:07.640
processing? Uh, some kind of, um,

102
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.680
mechanical process of how quickly and flawlessly you can encode information,

103
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:15.800
play with it and get it out. You know,

104
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.400
like if you're a dyslexic is let's take spelling.

105
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.220
Lots of people on Twitter say, ha ha you misspelled here. Uh,

106
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.150
in fact it's H E R in the case that you meant it really just shows me something

107
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:33.440
about your intelligence that you can't keep track of spelling. Okay.

108
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.730
That's your level of thought?

109
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.110
Do you happen to know how many brilliant people can't, can't spell? Can't write.

110
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.020
<v 2>Well also you're not even thinking.</v>

111
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.570
You're just trying to get the word out and you miss step. Yeah.

112
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.410
<v 1>But like my mind, you know, at some point I got sent home,</v>

113
00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:51.040
I think because I was asked to draw chicken in school and I put two wings and

114
00:06:51.041 --> 00:06:54.850
four feet on it. I'm so non observant. My, my, my handwriting.

115
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.850
<v 3>Sent home. Yeah. Something like this. They sent you home.</v>

116
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.130
<v 1>Yeah. I was like abberant or, you know,</v>

117
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:05.020
I was making fun of the teacher cause it was for like famously Mrs. Buckero in

118
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:08.410
first grade sent me out of the class because I said that a spider wasn't an

119
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:12.640
insect because it had eight legs and that she sent you out of class and because

120
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:16.840
I was well you're correct. In that case, I was in the case of a chicken.

121
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:17.674
I wasn't, but.

122
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.120
<v 2>Well maybe saw some weird Chernobyl chicken. Yeah, yeah. Man. Turn.</v>

123
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.840
<v 1>Chernobyl chicken, chicken Kiev. That's good. That's comedy goal.</v>

124
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.400
My point,

125
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.750
my point being that if you don't have a high confidence in net normal

126
00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:35.620
metrics, the race and IQ discussion doesn't land.

127
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.420
<v 2>So you get back to Charles Martin. Yeah. So Charles Murray.</v>

128
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.060
<v 4>It is it, but it's hard to say he.</v>

129
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.430
<v 2>Wrote the bell curve, right. Uh,</v>

130
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:52.870
was either dismissed as being racist

131
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:57.010
or applauded by people who you would call white nationalists,

132
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.780
who tried out his ideas as proof as measurable

133
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.230
proof that certain races are superior. And you know,

134
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:10.150
we could discuss the [inaudible] online people who trot

135
00:08:10.151 --> 00:08:15.070
those out all the time and they use it to form these weird groups of

136
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:18.730
people that love to hear that. Right. And that smacks of racist.

137
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.200
This is the issue, which is.

138
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.720
<v 1>You have a situation in which he appeared to heavy political</v>

139
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:29.200
orientation, which is that he didn't want money spent in certain ways.

140
00:08:29.201 --> 00:08:31.860
And he wanted it spent in others. There,

141
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.270
there was an political interpretation of why he

142
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:41.440
wanted that bill, which was maybe he's a closet racist.

143
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.420
Then there was facts that will tend to empower people who

144
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:48.010
are actually racist.

145
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:49.450
<v 2>All right. But let me pause you there. Sure.</v>

146
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.520
But then there's the actual data right now in examining the actual data.

147
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.990
If you just at the actual data, is,

148
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:02.580
is it racist to look at the, the real numbers?

149
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.840
Like if you say Nigerians in particular who are incredibly industrious and some

150
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.190
of the more, um,

151
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.540
successful immigrant groups that come over to America also happened to be black.

152
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:17.160
If you wanted to look at Nigerians in terms of like, if you wanted to, if you,

153
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.000
if you, if all, if you, if you wanted to look at them,

154
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:24.360
particularly as a group would be very difficult to be racist, you'd have to say,

155
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:28.440
well, this, these are superior. A lot of superior intellects come from Nigeria.

156
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.790
They also trot out the Asian one, right? That like this,

157
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.010
one of the weird things that people like to show that they're not racist.

158
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.840
Like look at shows. Asians are of a superior IQ. Aye, aye,

159
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:45.210
aye. Puzzle on that one that one's puzzling say more because I

160
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:50.070
think with certain people with certain males,

161
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.420
let's just go with males,

162
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.040
they look at African-Americans and they see

163
00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:00.630
superiority in, in certain ways they see superiority,

164
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.990
athletically, artistically, musically.

165
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.670
You can look at the contributions of

166
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.240
African-Americans culturally across the board in terms of like the real, the,

167
00:10:11.241 --> 00:10:14.720
the Jimmy Hendrix, the speed miles Davis speed of thought.

168
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.850
<v 1>And creativity like analytic.</v>

169
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.330
<v 2>Well, not just that also athletically like the,</v>

170
00:10:21.331 --> 00:10:26.090
the outliers are just so many. There's so many Michael Jordan's, Mike Tyson,

171
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:30.740
sugar, Ray Leonard's there's so many African-American outliers who were just

172
00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:34.010
extraordinary in terms of their accomplishments. Right.

173
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.220
But not that many Asian Americans in that regard.

174
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:39.680
So it's almost like they'll concede,

175
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.620
like they're not doing the things that make me jealous.

176
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.990
Do you see what I'm saying? They're not, they're not creating this insane music,

177
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.100
although there are a few, right.

178
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.720
But overall they're not creating these insane athletic accomplishments that

179
00:10:53.721 --> 00:10:58.010
these white Americans can't keep up with. So we'll say, but look,

180
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.740
they're superior intellectually. So I can't be racist.

181
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.680
I am pointing out that these Asians who I'm not jealous of,

182
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.860
because they don't do the things that I wish that I could do.

183
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.260
But then when it comes to the African-Americans,

184
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.370
you're there pointing out all the things that the African-Americans can do that

185
00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:16.670
they can't do. But they're saying all, but they're intellectually inferior.

186
00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.120
Whether this is proven, oh, I'm not racist. I don't want this to be true,

187
00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:24.200
but it seems to be true. I see. You see what I'm saying? It's like a way of,

188
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.400
it's a way of suppressing accomplishment, right?

189
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.280
While like almost mitigating the impact of the, the,

190
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:33.890
the jealousy that they feel.

191
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.720
<v 1>If you think about, for example, first, does that make sense? I think so. Um,</v>

192
00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.550
first of all, I just, I hate this topic.

193
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.890
<v 2>Yeah. It's a weird topic. Cause it's a weird topic.</v>

194
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.290
It feels greasy even touching it well.

195
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.740
<v 1>But now we have to write like this. I feel like</v>

196
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.670
my wrong view of it is if you'd never brought this thing up,

197
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.020
we would never have had to deal with it.

198
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:02.470
And I no longer believe that's true because we have so much inadvertent data,

199
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.230
right? Like I don't want the data on chess.

200
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.670
We have an idea of how many grand masters there are in which groups like male,

201
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.330
female, Asian, black, you know, various portions of Europe.

202
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.000
I don't know what that data means,

203
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.030
but I can't stop the data because it's going to be generated.

204
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:25.150
Even if nobody comes up with a standardized test because it's a game and it's

205
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:27.820
scored and it has something to do with intellectual abilities. Right.

206
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.030
On the other hand, I mean, I'm a competitive guy and I, I, um, you,

207
00:12:34.031 --> 00:12:37.270
you do comedy. I do some, some amount of music. Uh,

208
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.110
I can guarantee you that both of us have had our kicked at some point.

209
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.880
My African-Americans who Excel in both of these areas. And I don't mean, um,

210
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.560
you know, all God's children got rid of them. I mean, getting out funk, uh,

211
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.250
in a competitive situation, um, you know,

212
00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:58.090
looking over somebody's shoulder on the keyboard and they're thinking so quickly

213
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:01.240
and in so many dimensions, I can't even imagine what the hell is going on.

214
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.150
Right. So therefore I never had a lot of fear about it because I, you know, I'm,

215
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:09.070
I'm in close proximity with somebody who's just kicking my.

216
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.040
And um,

217
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.690
therefore I thought I could leave these topics alone.

218
00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:19.870
I would never have to deal with it the way in which that they come up, you know,

219
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.470
in a way that is really unpleasant is this new thing,

220
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:28.180
which is that all imbalances are all structural oppression. Right.

221
00:13:28.181 --> 00:13:32.860
And which doesn't allow for trade-offs between groups like fins,

222
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.560
fins are good at some things they're not good at others.

223
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.910
Nobody believes in like anti finished prejudice. So we don't think about it.

224
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:45.160
Right. It's just not a, it's not a big issue for us, you know, Finnish humor.

225
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.630
How many finished comedians are there have no idea. Right. Well,

226
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.430
how many do you run into at the comedy store?

227
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.960
<v 2>That's a bad, it's a bad example because you're dealing with America,</v>

228
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.180
America in American comedy.

229
00:13:57.181 --> 00:14:00.840
And also you're also dealing with the highest level of the game. It's like,

230
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:01.951
you know,

231
00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:06.750
the comedy store is essentially like the it's like the Harvard research

232
00:14:06.751 --> 00:14:08.250
labs of stand-up comedy.

233
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.990
<v 1>Yeah. But something like</v>

234
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.830
nobody's worried about anti finished behavior.

235
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.070
We're worried that we're prejudiced against certain groups.

236
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.230
We're worried that we're prejudiced against Jews.

237
00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.050
We're worried that we're prejudice against Mexicans, against blacks.

238
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.120
We have a pretty clean idea of what bigotry we really

239
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:30.060
still need to worry about and we feel guilty about it.

240
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.260
And that's why you say it has this kind of lubricious quality to it.

241
00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:34.880
Like what are you really up to over there? Well,

242
00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:39.450
why are you looking at that dataset? Right. And what my comment is,

243
00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:43.470
is I don't know how to stop this thing. I'm not excited about it.

244
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:44.520
I'm not interested in it.

245
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.750
I definitely think that we have to actually think about the social implications

246
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:49.980
of all of these things. But if your,

247
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.510
if your idea is that we're to stop this at the level of data and analysis,

248
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.410
I can't afford that. I just can't afford that.

249
00:14:57.411 --> 00:15:01.340
We need to have somebody who's able, like for example, microcephaly,

250
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.400
you've got people with smaller heads than the rest of us,

251
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.280
maybe because of the Zika virus. Well, is it,

252
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.680
is it unethical to study what the cognitive impairment due to microcephaly is?

253
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:15.350
Right. I don't know. I don't know what to do,

254
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:17.980
but I know that I want to have a very thoughtful conference. Well, how.

255
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:18.813
<v 2>Can it be?</v>

256
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.020
How can it be unethical to study the cognitive impairment of someone who's in

257
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:27.520
effect affected by a disease? And that could possibly help fund research,

258
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.550
help fund preventative measures with.

259
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.200
<v 1>Smaller heads and cognitive impairment, you know? And like,</v>

260
00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:38.170
what if somebody's like, let's take mosaic down syndrome,

261
00:15:38.171 --> 00:15:42.400
mosaic down syndrome doesn't have the same profile as regular down syndrome.

262
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:46.240
You get much higher functioning people. Right? I mean,

263
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.660
ultimately we're all souls and we have to figure it dignity.

264
00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:54.010
And we have to figure out some system by which we can live with this increased

265
00:15:54.011 --> 00:15:55.690
level of knowledge, but does.

266
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.900
<v 2>Examining impairment. Right.</v>

267
00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.600
But does that really mean that it's a prejudiced? Like what,

268
00:16:02.601 --> 00:16:05.380
what about an examining impairment from people who've been injured?

269
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.140
Should we avoid doing that? Because we don't want to be able list.

270
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:15.490
Um, do you see what I'm saying? Not quick, cause we're talking about reality,

271
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.980
right? We're talking about issues. If you're,

272
00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:22.900
if you're examining someone who contracted the Zika virus and it led to

273
00:16:22.901 --> 00:16:24.310
them developing a smaller head,

274
00:16:24.311 --> 00:16:26.440
which is one of the horrible side effects of that, right?

275
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.870
It is examining that in some way,

276
00:16:28.871 --> 00:16:32.610
some sort of prejudice should be avoid examining their cognitive impairment.

277
00:16:32.611 --> 00:16:33.160
We avoid.

278
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.990
<v 1>Examining it. We might do some damage.</v>

279
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:38.650
If we examine it and publish the findings, we might do D do D I mean,

280
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:39.890
does he want to.

281
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.770
<v 2>Say he might do damage to the people that are infected.</v>

282
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:42.843
<v 1>Look or a flick?</v>

283
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.980
If we don't begin with an idea that ultimately the issue is

284
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:53.050
compassion for ourselves and others and that a lot of

285
00:16:53.051 --> 00:16:57.370
our genetics and our history history predisposes us to bad behavior.

286
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.780
And now that we're living with each other,

287
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:02.560
like we have to start as hippy-dippy as a sound,

288
00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:05.350
we have to start from a place of love and decency. Right.

289
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.860
<v 2>I certainly agree. But I think that we should avoid. Yeah, well that's,</v>

290
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:09.760
this is the thing, right?

291
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.710
<v 1>Yeah. So now I have this other thing,</v>

292
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.880
which is reality is compassionate in and of itself.

293
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.630
Remember when HIV was an equal opportunity disease and it just started in the

294
00:17:19.631 --> 00:17:23.230
gay community and it's going to jump the fire road and it's going to be as much

295
00:17:23.231 --> 00:17:26.770
a heterosexual problem as it was a homosexual problem that turned out not to be

296
00:17:26.771 --> 00:17:27.604
true.

297
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.920
It was an ideological statement that didn't look at the differences between

298
00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:36.430
different kinds of epithelium and different sexual practices between gays and

299
00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:38.440
straights. It was a, it was a,

300
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:43.300
an activist position that started to compete with a

301
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.540
epidemiological position or a biological position.

302
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.660
And so historically we did is we had private expert

303
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:53.790
communication. Um,

304
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:56.910
and it's not always clear that you can trust your experts.

305
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.700
It's not always clear that you should start with the data.

306
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:03.060
What if the data says terrible things like maybe the data on people with

307
00:18:03.061 --> 00:18:05.010
microcephaly, um,

308
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:08.850
says something and you have got a person who's going to be judged by the size of

309
00:18:08.851 --> 00:18:12.620
their head, which is visibly off from the rest of their body. You know, we, we,

310
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.560
haven't taken up the challenge of our time, which is okay,

311
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.240
we've got a lot more information than we wanted,

312
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:20.160
and we have a lot more ability to analyze it.

313
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:21.780
And we know something about ourselves.

314
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.320
We know that we have got bigotry as part of our, our makeup.

315
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.020
And we know that, um,

316
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:33.150
we're not really good at certain ways of integrating information and not,

317
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.700
you know, becoming triumphalist and jerkish about it.

318
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.280
And taking victory laps as if it's a competition,

319
00:18:38.281 --> 00:18:42.570
like my groups better than your group. Right? So that's where we're stuck. Now.

320
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.830
I want to be struggling with other people are saying, look,

321
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.100
I don't know what the answers are. I don't think, you know,

322
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:50.941
as I brought up before,

323
00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:54.450
I don't think east Africans are cheating in the Boston marathon because they've

324
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.570
come to dominate it just because, you know,

325
00:18:57.571 --> 00:19:00.300
suddenly you had a diverse group of people, uh,

326
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.350
replaced by a very tiny group from Ethiopia and Kenya. We are,

327
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.390
we are behaving as you would expect when compassionate

328
00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:13.770
people who recognize that they have been bigoted and structurally

329
00:19:13.771 --> 00:19:17.760
oppressive encounter data, that they can't handle,

330
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:21.420
which the science is giving us more data than we ever wanted on these things.

331
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.200
And we're not answering the challenge of our time. And that's what my issue is.

332
00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:28.290
Social justice is it's not about,

333
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.310
I don't want a better planet or a more inclusive planet.

334
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.230
It's like stop crowding out the really difficult,

335
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.360
interesting open-hearted and hardheaded conversation with

336
00:19:42.361 --> 00:19:46.650
this dime store nonsense about simple answers and simple,

337
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.573
simple truths,

338
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:51.690
because those aren't true and it's not going to work in the longterm. I mean,

339
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:55.260
I guess that's maybe the idea is we're competing with social justice

340
00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:00.690
for the rights to try to come up with a better,

341
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:03.660
more equitable future and the complaint about it.

342
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.440
Isn't you guys are trying to come up with a better, more equitable future.

343
00:20:07.441 --> 00:20:11.430
It's what if you're going to make the same mistake when we said, well,

344
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:15.450
the heterosexuals are as much at risk as the homosexual. Well, that wasn't true.

345
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:20.340
We needed to devote resources to our homosexual community and we did

346
00:20:20.341 --> 00:20:24.480
need to get the heterosexual community interested and we had a problem and we

347
00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:28.080
needed to think about, you know, very thoughtfully, we've got an epidemic,

348
00:20:28.081 --> 00:20:29.510
that's killing people. Okay.
