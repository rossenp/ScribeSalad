00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.140
<v 1>I think one of the problems from the sixties was this idea of, you know,</v>

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:10.170
one dose miracle cure. That's all you need. Yeah.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.440
And I think what we've come to understand is that it's not that way.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.410
Occasionally it can be, but mostly it's not.

6
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:19.290
<v 2>And you need this support afterwards and you need to integrate it.</v>

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.640
And what we've also learned from neuroscience is that you're actually, um,

8
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.020
neuroplasticity that these psychedelics help you rewire your brain in new ways,

9
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:32.580
but you have to reinforce that it's just not automatic. It's not about the drug.

10
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.720
It's about the therapy that the drug helps make more effective and people have

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.190
placed undo, um, confidence. You could say in the drug itself.

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.030
So you need to know.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.170
<v 0>New pathway. Once you've gotten off of your old pathway,</v>

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.770
the psychedelics Juul you into this new realm.

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.470
But if you don't have a new pathway,

16
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.910
then you panic and people fall back into their comfort zone.

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.220
And if your comfort zone is alcohol abuse and doing the same things

18
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:06.090
you've done before and ruining your life and taking pills,

19
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:06.960
and you're going to go right back.

20
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.920
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.360
There's one example of one person where it was like a one dose miracle cure.

22
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:17.340
It's really rare, but I'll just explain a bit. He was a veteran and had PTSD.

23
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:21.180
I talked about, uh, Tony Macy during my, uh, TedTalk,

24
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
but he had the sense that he had been disabled with PTSD for years

25
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.810
because of friends of his,

26
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.130
that had been killed all the violence that he saw when he was in Iraq and under

27
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:33.600
the influence of MTMA,

28
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.860
he had this realization that there was something good about the PTSD.

29
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.200
He was getting a benefit from it, which was,

30
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.280
it was the way that he showed loyalty to his friends who had died,

31
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.060
that he was connected to their memory and that he was suffering.

32
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:50.460
And it was a way to be bonded still with them.

33
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.780
But then he was able to kind of see himself from the eyes of his friends who had

34
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:59.250
died and to realize that they wouldn't want him to squander his life.

35
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.540
They didn't have life anymore. They would want him to live as fully as possible.

36
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.670
And he realized there's another way to honor his friends, which is to, to live.

37
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.190
And he thought, what am I going to do with the rest of my life?

38
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.360
And in that moment, he cured himself with PTSD. Then he said,

39
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.640
I'm taking opiates for pain, but I don't really think I'm taking it for pain.

40
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:25.080
I'm thinking more about it as an escape. I don't need the opiates anymore.

41
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.980
And then he said, I don't need this MTMA anymore. Either I'm done.

42
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.210
I want to drop out of the study.

43
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.260
This was his first of what was going to be three MTMA sessions. Wow.

44
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.670
And he dropped out and we said, sure, it's all voluntary. But if you

45
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.470
will just do the outcome measures, that would help us. And he agreed to do that.

46
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.630
And at the two month, follow-up no PTSD. And then around 11 months,

47
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:51.180
when we have the 12 month follow-up he started thinking, well,

48
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.540
maybe I'd like another MD may experience. And I said, well,

49
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:58.170
we can't quite do that. If you're out of the protocol, you've dropped out.

50
00:02:58.171 --> 00:03:00.430
But at least it's only for PTSD. This study.

51
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:05.350
Let's see what your scores are at the 12 months and no PTSD.

52
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.130
And that was about nine, 10 years ago. Um, I'd been in touch with him recently.

53
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.000
He's doing great,

54
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.550
but it was this realization that he was able to make under the influence of one

55
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.630
experience of MTMA that enabled him to reinterpret

56
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.470
the way he could be loyal to his friends who had died.

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.690
<v 0>That's amazing. And it makes sense.</v>

58
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.920
It completely makes sense that that would be one of the reasons why a soldier

59
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.120
would have PTSD because you talked to soldiers that experienced combat duty.

60
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:38.920
One of the things they say is that there's this insane profound connection with

61
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.240
their fellow soldiers. Yes.

62
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.890
And when one of them is killed and they survive, they have this,

63
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.750
a survivor syndrome to survivor's guilt and it,

64
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.400
it haunts them, you know,

65
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:56.080
and if they could honor the fallen soldiers by living their best

66
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:58.690
life and not being in constant trauma,

67
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.610
