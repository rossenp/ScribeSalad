00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You are really famous in MIMA, right?</v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.160
Like someone told me that your wedding,

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.680
30 million people watched your wedding on television.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.960
<v 1>There. More than that, I think, but yeah, that's insane.</v>

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.640
It was so the story that's like, look, so now we go back to the story. When we,

6
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.800
when I, when I went through over after prison fight, I went to MIMA. Then I,

7
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:21.870
after, after, uh, we didn't even talk about the.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:22.910
<v 0>Prison fight. We kind of Skipp.</v>

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.070
<v 1>Over it. I mean, I, I won like, no, I think the more important is the sway part.</v>

10
00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:27.950
So then I, it just,

11
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.670
I talked about it because that was my connection to the promoter. Oh, okay.

12
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:35.270
Then the promoter got, gets me into a lit way. And then I, I, uh,

13
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.270
I like beat up two, two, and then I get right away challenged my two turn men,

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.580
the open weight. So like the, the, by us in the country,

15
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.540
when you open white champ, you're the best in the world in Lato. Right.

16
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.380
The biggest and the, the, the strongest. So he's a third, four,

17
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.620
five generation LA, his grandfather was LA fighters. Whoa.

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.420
And they were all golden belts, winners. Right. So he's born in, in the, like,

19
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.900
if you look where he lives, it's raw, man. It's the hut.

20
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:02.610
It's in the jungle and he's, he's raised the head, but culture, like,

21
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.290
you know, he's, he's an animal, he's a head hunter.

22
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.010
He just goes for the head and he he's, he has a good right hand. So I'm like,

23
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.770
and I knew right away after that fight with Tutu, I,

24
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.810
he was fighting that night too. So we, uh, I go shake it hand. He doesn't know.

25
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:18.170
Yes and no in English. That's how bad he is. And I, I say, good fight.

26
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.090
And he's like, you just gimme a head knock. And I knew that we're gonna meet.

27
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.520
So we eat. And, uh, yeah. And then where was I going with this? Basically?

28
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.360
What was your question, Joe? You said, no, just gotta, just keep going, fight.

29
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.960
Need him. I bet. With the first fight.

30
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.640
That's I think it's important to talk about this,

31
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.440
cuz I was only my second let we fight ever. Right.

32
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.920
And I'm fighting the best two legends in a row. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

33
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.480
So I'm like, do they want get the like, oh two, two, didn't get,

34
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.190
so let's get to, to, to him up. Right, right. So I go back, I was,

35
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.070
I was at tiger at the time and that was uh, no, we'll go back to this later.

36
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:50.471
But I was,

37
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.310
they were laughing at me because I was doing headbutts on the bags and they

38
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.350
were, it was all a big show. Every time I was doing headbutts right. Like, oh,

39
00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:00.830
look at Dave doing this. Uh, look, I had to teach this guy with 300. My, my, my,

40
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.300
uh, my coach at the time I had hole at time.

41
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:06.020
I had to teach him how to hold pads for headbutts and that's the way I developed

42
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.380
the way to do, you know, jab, cross hook, headbutt,

43
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:11.540
elbow mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; uh, stuff like that. So then they were laughing.

44
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.860
Okay, cool. I don't care. I'm waiting fights. I go there and um, first fight.

45
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.140
That's the hard part, man. Like I, the first round, the first couple rounds,

46
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:24.330
the three rounds, he, I, I, I push, kick his stomach and he grabs it and he,

47
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.330
he sweet smarter leg many times. So I actually sectioned my, the back of my leg.

48
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.650
Um, like it was, I had to do physio, like my nerves,

49
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.770
I think in the back of my right leg was like section sectioned or maybe not,

50
00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:39.610
maybe not sectioned, but like severely damaged. Okay. So, uh, yeah.

51
00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:43.130
Section would be pretty bad. Yeah. So, uh, cause what do you mean by sectioned?

52
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.960
<v 0>You mean like air, like.</v>

53
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.480
<v 1>Tear the like yeah, it was like, and damage.</v>

54
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.480
Is that from kicking the back of your leg?

55
00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.800
Think cuz he did it many times in the same spot. Right? Uhhuh.

56
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.440
&lt;affirmative&gt; on my, the back of my knee. Okay. Which there's a lot of nerves.

57
00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:54.640
So.

58
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.600
<v 0>He's catching your teeth, kicking and then kicking your other leg? Yes. Okay.</v>

59
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.480
<v 1>So then many times and I, I don't, so it's tearing. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.240
And I don't re I'm like what the? Like, uh, cuz I, I want to go inside.

61
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:06.800
I wanna do my elbows and I can cuz I, and uh,

62
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.480
so then adaptation I think is key in life as well. Right. You need to, to,

63
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.480
to adapt and for that. So again, this guy is 70 fights. Uh, you know,

64
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.270
I think he like, uh, all my chaos is just mashing everyone.

65
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.430
And then, um, I, uh, I started adapting. I went,

66
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.350
I went through the leg instead the push kicked through the leg instead of the

67
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:29.390
stomach and that you couldn't catch it anymore. And then it was,

68
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:32.470
it was making buckle up. So that was a big, a big thing in my,

69
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.510
so you're hitting him above the thigh. Hyper extending the knee. Yeah.

70
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.990
And he can't get him. So you he's a bowl. He call him the bull.

71
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:38.751
So he goes inside.

72
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.540
He can can't you can't go inside if I'm pushing his leg too much. Right. Right.

73
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:45.740
So he's arming a hard time and he is gassing out a little bit cuz he's he give,

74
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.300
he usually knocks him out in the first round and he goes far. Right.

75
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.580
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so then I'm like, I kinda, I,

76
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.660
I knocked him out a couple times.

77
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:54.500
Like knocked him down a couple times at the end of the fight.

78
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:56.700
So it was a real draw. Right. It was a real draw.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.330
So we ended up the first fight as a draw, but then right away I rematch,

80
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.850
we fight you again. How long? Two months, two months. But then your leg is up.

81
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:08.370
Yeah. So that, but then was a, was a, it was a, an added sweetener.

82
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.570
That was again I'm I'm very emotional today. I have goosebumps. &lt;laugh&gt; like,

83
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:16.490
cuz it's it changed my life, Joe, like basically it was, if you win this fight,

84
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.800
it's gonna be December, 2011, uh, 2016. If you win this fight, you go,

85
00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:25.240
we're gonna pay for your wedding. And uh it's for the golden belt.

86
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.160
So the other one was only a challenge fight, you know? But when the, when the,

87
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:29.760
like this was actually for like,

88
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.840
you can it's for the title fight mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so I got two draws and now

89
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:37.680
it's like title fight. So I'm like, let's go, I train. And uh,

90
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.550
I train hard and uh, yeah, we, you go, we meet up again. And now I,

91
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.590
I cuz I, I propose the arena. I proposed the arena, uh, after the other fight,

92
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.950

98
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:12.860
but then it makes the news in MIMA. Right? Oh,

99
00:05:12.861 --> 00:05:16.300
Dave got engaged in Bagan so then the promoter calls me. So Hey,

109
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.320
I had a lot of pressure. I had to win. I don't want my wife to,

110
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:52.360

129
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.650
all the way down the ground and have a store for that. Okay. So this actually,

130
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.010
uh, like I don't give you expensive underwear. That's a dollar by the way.

131

But then the store with this and we'll go back to the fight guys.

135
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.560
It's just that uh, people wear that very comfortable. But then when the,

136
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.560
when uh, like war happens, you put it up and it looks like almost like a diaper.

137
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.760
Right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you can kick cuz this, you can't kick with this.

138
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.480
Oh, I see. And put it up and then it show off your, your, your leg tattoos.

139
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:34.200
Cuz they have a big tradition of leg tattoos. Oh, okay. And uh,

140
00:07:34.201 --> 00:07:36.120
that's where you get all your tattoos in your legs.

141
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.590
Does it come from being over there? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It was. I waited.

142
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.270
I waited before having them cuz I wanted to make sure I deserved them, you know?

143
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.510
Ah, interesting. Okay. Got and uh, basically. So I like that.

144
00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:48.870
Cuz when you don't know who's a fighter unless you see on face, but then let,

145
00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:50.950
let's say the, the war was happening. Boom.

146
00:07:50.951 --> 00:07:54.350
Everybody gets their laundry up and they're ready for battle. And you see,

oh he's a fighter. Oh he's a fighter. Oh he's a fighter. Right. Cause the tech,

148
00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.620
the legs are tied it up. Got it. Back in the days everybody had uh,

149
00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.140
every fighter that was fighting into it had the, the to win it's called. Okay.

150
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.900
Anyway, back to the fight. Yes. So, uh, cuz we're doing a big, uh,

151
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.820
1 0 1 about Mer right now everything. So many things to talk about. So, uh,

152
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.900
the fight and then I started, um, I actually had a T uh,

153
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.650
TV following me for that fight. And you usually told me that they usually,

154
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:23.890
when we follow somebody, the, the guy never wins, you know,

155
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.290
but I was like pretty happy. So I ended up, uh, get him like a,

156
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.210
a takedown I'm bloody. I get him with an elbow in the face. He,

157
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:34.570
his head is like open up a pretty big gap in the head. He's bleeding.

158
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.250
And then I get a take down, but I'm using a lot of my teeth this time. And uh,

159
00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:41.920
like he buckles in my up and I think I, I, I, the leg is,

160
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:45.520
their legs are not going too well. And then I do a take down and he like,

161
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:48.520
he falls on his leg and then he has to use his timeout. So yeah.

162
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:51.280
They bring him back and he is, he looks in pain and I tell,

163
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.800
I tell my corner and uh, I'm a bit like I'm,

164
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.320
I'm bleeding cuz he got me to cut too. That's that's also pretty rare,

165
00:08:57.321 --> 00:09:01.720
but I'm and uh, and then I'm, I'm here. I say, which leg is it? Which leg is it?

166
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.360
And uh, my corner, uh, at the time is like, it's the, it's the right leg.

167
00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.320
So I'm like, okay. So I'm like, I, and then he, the two minutes ends up.

168
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.480
He goes back. He's like, he looks limping a little bit. So I'm like,

169
00:09:11.481 --> 00:09:14.320
I'm attacking the right leg. So I try, I try to hit it.

170
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.710
He's and then I do another take down and he's bleeding more than not long after

171
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:22.790
that it was over. He, he, he wasn't able to get up. Right. So, uh,

172
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.110
and actually when he fell down, it is a beautiful,

173
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.830
it was a pretty intense moment. He fells down and right in front of the canyon,

174
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.910
the canyon TV crew and the blood like leaks on the floor and it's pretty

175
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:36.140
intense, like pretty cool. Uh, pretty cool. Uh,

176
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:39.620
cuz I'm excited about this because like there's not a lot of good quality videos

177
00:09:39.621 --> 00:09:41.860

185
00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.223
and then,

186

but then in Myanmar it's just becoming like crazy people and we get married live

187
