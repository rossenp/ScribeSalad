<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 1>Experience. When did San Francisco shift?</v>

3
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:09.320
Cuz I I've been going to San Francisco to do stand up since the

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.440
1990s. And I don't know when I noticed it, there was always homeless people,

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.680
but they, they were not camping.

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.830
Like it wasn't as chaotic as like you're never gonna get away from a certain

7
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:22.350
amount of mental illness. Correct. Right.

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.030
You're never gonna get waved with a certain amount of drug addicts and there's,

9
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.830
you know, it's, it's a thing with cities. When did it get where it is and how,

10
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.350
what were the steps? Right.

11
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.630
<v 0>So you really have to go back.</v>

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.670
So culturally San Francisco has been very tolerant of drug use since the

13
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:40.330
19th century.

14
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.980
It had op DS dens that it was the last to shut down of anybody in the 19th

15
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:47.100
century. But then you really go then the,

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.260
of the sixties and a celebration of drug culture in the sixties,

17
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:52.580
people think of it being psychedelics and marijuana,

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.100
but it also included amphetamines and heroin. I mean,

19
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:58.340
you go back to Janus Joplin in the sixties, she was doing heroin. Do you know.

20
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.380
<v 1>That that's also where the CIA did operation midnight climate?</v>

21
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.410
I'm not surprised. Yeah. That's where they did there,

22
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:08.210
where they would have brothels and they would dose the Johns up with LSD and

23
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:09.770
observe them through two way.

24
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.170
<v 0>Mirrors. I'm not surprised &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. It's it's so as a cult,</v>

25
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.690
a very libertarian culture, right? Yeah.

26
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.290
So it makes sense that it's it's that way.

27
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.490
But then I think you have to go to the 1990s, uh,

28
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.360
with the har which movement that I was involved in and reduction also had at the

29
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:26.480
same time, it wasn't exactly the same movement,

30
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:30.800
but it was also expanded treatment of pain through

31
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.880
opioids. And that's the beginning of the opioid epidemic really begins with the

32
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:39.640
liberalization of opioids so that we just overprescribed opioids. Right.

33
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.560
It's now a famous story in the United States. We,

34
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.710
we just gave them a away to too many people. A lot of, um,

35
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.470
people that probably should have received an antidepressant or maybe some

36
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.590
medicine for ADHD or were just depressed,

37
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.230
were getting opioids and their doctors were encouraged to do it.

38
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.350
Obviously the pharmaceutical industry encouraged it Obama. Then we, we,

39
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.060
we started restricting that around 2010 and then a out of those people then

40
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.220
switch to heroin. And then, and then meanwhile,

41
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.420
in the background really growing from the sixties,

42
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:12.140
but just getting more and more intensified and concentrated is meth.

43
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.140
So you have two separate epidemics, meth and opioids, and they both kill.

44
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.220
Now we're into we're into next generation opioids of, from heroin,

45
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:25.850
which is fentanyl, which is something that you've covered here a lot. Um,

46
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.250
and so that's how you get these just rising. So you basically,

47
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:33.810
on the one hand you get gradually increasing death toll from that 17,000 in the

48
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:38.130
year 2000 to 93,000 last year. But fentanyl also is game changing.

49
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.770
And so it's much easier. Usually heroin, it's harder to overdose.

50
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:44.640
Usually it's because of mixing with alcohol or benzo death Aine,

51
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.480
but you get to fentanyl and it's much easier to just overdose directly on

52
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.800
fentanyl and now the Narcans not working as well against the fentanyl.

53
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.960
So that's basically it. Now the tents,

54
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.000
I tried to answer this question and there's disagreement about it,

55
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.360
but definitely occupy brought a lot of tents into the homeless community. Ah,

56
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.160
interesting. In 2011, I mean,

57
00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:07.560
I remember around in Oakland where I was working at the time,

58
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.160
there were all these occupy tents at the down in front of the city center and

59
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.240
the same thing in San Francisco. Then after occupy ended, the activists,

60
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.270
the anarchist activists just gave the tents to the, and you know,

61
00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:22.430
it's, it seems like a nice thing to do, right?

62
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.150
Like here you have a tent to stay in.

63
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:25.670
It seems like the compassionate thing to do,

64
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.350
but then it basically just grew outta control. And so we, we call, you know,

65
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.550
we euphemized it by calling it an encampment, you know,

66
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:35.350
it makes it sound like it's a happy camp. Yeah. But we know that, you know,

67
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.750
women are raped in those camps.

68
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.420
Mentally ill people are taking advantage of people, overdose and die.

69
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.140
People are killed when you can't make payment for your drugs. The,

70
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.100
the drug dealers stab you with a machete. So these are really violent,

71
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.060
dangerous, terrible places you get hepatitis because of all the feces.

72
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.060
So it just spiraled outta control. So it's hard to,

73
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:58.140
it's hard to pinpoint any single thing, but I think, yeah, for sure,

74
00:03:58.141 --> 00:04:02.010
like occupy 10 and years ago, and then just a, you know,

75
00:04:02.011 --> 00:04:05.930
I mean we even see basically cities and police becoming more liberal around

76
00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:10.690
public drunkenness in like the seventies and the 1980s when

77
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.570
homelessness really emerged. Um, you mentioned comic relief. I mean,

78
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.610
comedians actually did a real disservice on this issue to Billy crystal Whoopi

79
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:19.770
Goldberg, Robin Williams,

80
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.920
by suggesting that homelessness was a problem of poverty.

81
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.360
It was really a result of the crack epidemic, uh, crack and alcohol.

82
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.080
Certainly there were economic forces involved, but,

83
00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:34.320
but progressives have just badly misled people into thinking that this is a

84
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:35.240
problem of high rents.

85
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.440
<v 1>Is this just because it feels good to like rally against the rich and to</v>

86
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.990
say that we need you to be compassionate. And is that what it is?

87
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.790
<v 0>Yeah. I think that if I had to summarize it, uh, I,</v>

88
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.990
I quote this amazing addiction specialist from Stanford, Keith Humphreys,

89
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:52.790
who calls it left libertarianism.

90
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.230
So it's basically this idea and this is where the book ends up going.

91
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.340
Is that to victims, give everything and nothing, you know, that's,

92
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:05.420
it's a combination of a radical left view,

93
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.900
but also combined with the libertarianism. So that's, what's kind of behind it.

94
00:05:09.901 --> 00:05:10.180
I mean,

95
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.260
you interview people and they just think it's imoral to demand anything from

96
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:17.020
addicts or from homeless people. How dare you. Right. You know,

97
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.100
how dare you ask them to change their behavior,

98
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.770
their victims of all these terrible said in a lot of cases they are.

99
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.690
But the whole thing is that nobody to, to,

100
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.130
to suggest that somebody's essentially a victim actually ends up being,

101
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.770
I think, racist, the idea that all black people are victims,

102
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.290
I think is a racist idea.

103
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.890
The idea that all white people are benefit from privilege, also a racist idea,

104
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.440
but that kind of racist, it's a different kind of racism than the,

105
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.880
the type that we're all used to, which was, you know,

106
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:50.800
racism type one was how do we justify enslaving Africans

107
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:54.720
basically? And how do we justify prejudicial policies against, you know,

108
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:58.000
people of color, mostly type two comes out of

109
00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.600
guilt, you know? And so really it starts in the sixties. Um, you know,

110
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.360
at a point where at we passed civil right legislation in 1964,

111
00:06:06.361 --> 00:06:10.280
you get to 1970 and this very famous book gets published called, um,

112
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.343
blaming the victim.

113
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.360
And the idea is that basically any policies that demand summit

114
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.870
accountability and taking a personal responsibility is effectively a kind of

115
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:22.550
victimization watch the.
