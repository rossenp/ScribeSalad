00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 3>The country is not about anything other than money. I mean,</v>

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:09.210
we just abandon every value other than profit

4
00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.210
maximization and the bottom line. And yes.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.670
<v 1>So people need to understand about all this woke. Yes.</v>

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.830
It's really not about changing culture.

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.040
<v 0>Yeah. It's about money. I mean, that's, that's always just, you know,</v>

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.851
it was just like, it's funny.

9
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.560
There's a big article in New York times today about inside an Amazon

10
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:26.520
warehouse, right.

11
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:31.200
And Amazon was the first to say black lives matter and put that banner up

12
00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:32.850
on their page and everything. And look,

13
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.730
I support a lot of goals of that movement,

14
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.790
but you read through this article and you find out, first of all,

15
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.260
the way they treat their largely black and brown warehouse workers, I mean,

16
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:47.550
it's despicable. They intentionally make sure they cannot move up the ladder,

17
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.000
but that's part of their business policies. If you're an hourly worker,

18
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.110
you're not going to get promoted and they try to force you out after three years

19
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.740
because they think you're getting lazy. So this is the company that can,

20
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.730
the surface level say black lives matter because they think that's good for

21
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:07.410
their profit maximization and their brand and their shareholder value. Um,

22
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.460
at the same time,

23
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:12.510
what they're actually doing in real life wildly different than that. So.

24
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.720
<v 1>They specifically target black and brown people. They target.</v>

25
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
<v 0>Their warehouse workers who are, so the warehouse workers are 50,</v>

26
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.760
some percent black and brown management is 50.

27
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:25.860
Some is overwhelmingly white and Asian.

28
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.820
<v 1>I thought the whole thing about Amazon was that you could move up the ladder.</v>

29
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.220
<v 0>Walmart, who I'm also not a fan of,</v>

30
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.020
they actually promote from within.

31
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.150
So most Walmart managers start out as hourly employees.

32
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:41.760
So at least they have a track up. And again, I'm not a fan of Walmart. Okay.

33
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.780
Amazon intentionally. And this is what the New York times revealed.

34
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.750
They intentionally have a system because Bezos said,

35
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:53.730
he believes that these human beings are lazy and that after you know

36
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:55.080
that they're going to do the bare minimum.

37
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.990
<v 1>I.</v>

38
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.823
<v 2>Will. I'll find you.</v>

39
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.500
<v 1>I think there's a difference between lazy and having a job if people need that.</v>

40
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.970
<v 0>But in your abuse, you're treated like a robot and a cog day in and day out.</v>

41
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.330
You're fired. Like if you are a little bit slow on your tasks,

42
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.430
you might get fired by a frickin app. Like.

43
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.390
<v 1>It was explained to people don't understand how it works over there.</v>

44
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.030
<v 2>Does anybody want to? Yeah. I mean, they work in the where, right?</v>

45
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:24.330
So they have phones that are on there. Everything's tracking your movements,

46
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:28.170
steps, bathroom breaks as well. So the warehouses are also very large.

47
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.450
So let's say you're technically have a 20 minute break.

48
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:33.780
It might take you 10 minutes to actually walk to the break room and back.

49
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.740
So you actually have what,

50
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:38.850
like a two minute break while you're in there and the whole thing around Amazon

51
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.840
and why everyone should care is because Amazon under the pandemic exploded.

52
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:47.610
Their stock price went up from, I think 1000 or so to a cup 3000 Bezos.

53
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.300
Personally, his wealth increased by $70 billion.

54
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.230
Amazon is now the second largest employer in the United States.

55
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.190
And this is incredibly important because as more Amazon market happens,

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.370
they are basically going to become the employer of choice,

57
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.910
whatever your grocery store or whatever was in your small town.

58
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.320
These are the rural working class Americans. This is their only job.

59
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.240
So when you have one company which has all of this overwhelming power over

60
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.300
rural working Americans and even suburban Americans,

61
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.230
because this is Amazon strategy, Dayton, Ohio is a good example, Alec McGillis.

62
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.810
He wrote a great book on Amazon. Shout out to him,

63
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.160
talked about how Dayton was like the Silicon valley of America in the 19

64
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:33.850
hundreds of manufacturing middle-class jobs.

65
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.680
Now Dayton's prized economic value comes from the fact that it's

66
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.500
one day's drive from one-third of the U S population.

67
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.480
So it's a great place for cardboard.

68
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:48.070
So everybody there is all just involved in creating cardboard and other Amazon

69
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.770
infrastructure. So the Amazon of vacation,

70
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:55.120
so to speak or whatever of America makes it so that if let's say 30 years ago,

71
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:59.260
you grew up in your town, you may have to go to Walmart. HEB were here.

72
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:01.720
You know, I grew up here in Texas Kroger as well.

73
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:03.580
McDonald's something like that.

74
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.490
Now it's basically like McDonald's dairy queen and Amazon.

75
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.620
And when Amazon is the prime market employer,

76
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.340
they are the sole determiner of market conditions. Increasingly.

77
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.650
So is Walmart and Amazon, which are number two.

78
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:18.910
And we're talking about millions of people who are now working at this company.

79
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:21.700
So people are like, why do you guys talk so much about Amazon?

80
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.880
Because I can see the trends. This company is not going anywhere.

81
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.610
It look props to them like, they're, I love Amazon.

82
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:28.930
Like I order a lot of stuff on Amazon,

83
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.880
but increasingly becoming aware of the price of what it takes to do overnight

84
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:36.010
delivery to your house at 4:00 AM in the morning,

85
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.060
or increasingly becoming aware of the fact that they are basically on this

86
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:45.040
mission to drive price down as much as possible and squeeze as much out of

87
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.440
their workforce. That is where struggle.

88
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.300
What was the furniture thing that we just covered?

89
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.490
<v 0>Well, and did you see their delivery? Drivers have so are so like the,</v>

90
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.970
the demands are so intense. They're having a pee in bottles and and bags.

91
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.750
<v 1>In a bag. That's where I draw the line.</v>

92
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:04.240
I don't really care if a guy has to peanut bottle,

93
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.870
but if a gala has to pay him like a dog bowl, I'm like,

94
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:09.820
this seems wrong.

95
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.120
<v 0>I think I was like, I would like to click the button. That's like,</v>

96
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.520
I'll pay a little bit more. If you can promise me,

97
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:18.880
no driver had to in a bag and over and get this to me tomorrow.

98
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.880
<v 1>We, we kind of glossed over this thing where you said, yeah.</v>

99
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.150
<v 0>So I got the quote. So here's, here's what the New York times says.</v>

100
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:26.080
Amazon's founder.

101
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:30.490
Jeff Bezos did not want hourly workers to stick around for long viewing a large

102
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:32.920
disgruntled workforce as a threat. Um,

103
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.950
this other executive recalled who worked at Amazon,

104
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:39.850
but then left company data showed that most employers became less eager over

105
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:43.600
time. He said, Mr. Bavis Bezos believed people were inherently lazy.

106
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.260
What he would say is that our nature as humans is to expend as little energy as

107
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:51.070
possible to get what we want or need that was embedded throughout the business

108
00:05:51.071 --> 00:05:53.440
from the ease of instant ordering to the pervasive use of data,

109
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:54.670
to get the most out of employees.

110
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:58.640
So guaranteed wage increases stop after three years and Amazon provided

111
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.130
incentives for low skilled employees to leave.

112
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.540
So every year they would offer associates thousands of dollars to resign.

113
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.550
They made sure that any position they gave people sort of the illusion

114
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:12.590
of promotions being available,

115
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.430
but then there'd be one promotion available for hundreds of people.

116
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.400
And they very seldom, um,

117
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.680
higher or higher management from within their own ranks. It's like they view us.

118
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.430
That's totally class stratified is basically the bottom line. And of course,

119
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.830
lower classes in America are disproportionately black and brown.

120
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.590
It's not like they're specifically targeting black and brown people,

121
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.310
but you have one class of people that they see that as worthy of doing the grunt

122
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:38.570
work and in the bag.

123
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.170
And one class of people that they think of is worthy of like actually having

124
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.580
the, the more intellectual jobs and running the place. It's, you know,

125
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.670
it's a really important way of viewing human beings essentially.

126
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:52.640
And so this is part of the, kind of, again,

127
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.300
rot of America that I also think is reflected with the John CNN thing,

128
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:59.510
et cetera. It's like, you're certainly more of a capitalist than I am,

129
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.320
but you can't have a country where the only frickin value is money. Like that's,

130
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:04.430
it's just, it just, you,

131
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.380
you see the sickness of people who have all these addictions and our last year

132
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:13.640
was the worst year on record for overdose set. You see the suicide rates spike.

133
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.270
I mean,

134
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.840
you see people who just feel like they have no meaning and no purpose and no

135
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:22.100
grounding and no community and all the life being sucked out of these human

136
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:24.410
beings in these communities. It's just disgusting.
