00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>So Tommy buns. Yep.</v>

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.350
Tell me about the controversy surrounding your use of the R word in your last

3
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:11.220
special. Oh yeah, that was, cause that, that was,

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.930
that was bizarre.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.730
<v 1>It was a lot, man. Well.</v>

6
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.620
<v 0>It was also what I found interesting about it was people were</v>

7
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:24.060
lying about the bit and they were doing it in articles

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.970
and they were doing it in email campaigns.

9
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:29.160
They were lying about the content of the bit. Yeah.

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.090
Were there were changing what you were saying in the bit and they had to be

11
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:36.090
doing it on purpose. They definitely didn't listen to the bit.

12
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.410
<v 1>Yeah. And I think it took me a while to figure out what was,</v>

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.630
what really was happening was that someone someone's agenda

14
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.610
or idea of what they want to accomplish is to highlight, um,

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.130
a campaign to eradicate saying a word.

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.380
And then they had a channel to pursue by having a

17
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:01.700
comedy bit that did it, that they could be like, let's,

18
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.480
let's go after it like this. Yeah. But it didn't, they didn't go. I mean,

19
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.260
you know, basically what it's funny thing is that like the,

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.390
that joke was something that I worked back

21
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.790
where I did that bit backwards. In other words,

22
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:21.050
I had the end piece of the bit, uh,

23
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.190
was that what I was doing by itself, which was a story about, I saw,

24
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.510
I witnessed a fight in Philly of a white guy and a black guy in the park and the

25
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:33.230
white dude was, you know, screaming and bombs and it was, it was nuts.

26
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.930
So I would tell that story. And then I would,

27
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.680
I worked backwards into getting into the story cause I always try to figure out

28
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:43.400
like, if something funny happens or something, I want to tell a story,

29
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.970
it's always better to figure out why are you telling the story than just to be

30
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:51.070
like, here's a story. Right? So I told the story of like the,

31
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.230
the fight in the park. And then I worked into like,

32
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.820
I figured out right before it I've talked about racial slurs and how, you know,

33
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.450
most racial slurs are not acceptable. And then I figured out, they were like,

34
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:06.110
unless they're like white, racial slurs are totally acceptable.

35
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.500
Like you call people mix and crowds and frogs, Paul locks, Guinea.

36
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.270
WAPs like this whole list of that.

37
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.960
And then I worked before that of just the way into saying that was like,

38
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:19.850
why should talk about words that you can't say that it kind of changed

39
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:23.900
over time? Right. So it was just like, one of those jokes is like, oh,

40
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:28.850
it's helping me get into the bit. You know? So I, I started the bit by saying,

41
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.840
uh, you can't say retarded anymore. That's the, that's the first line of the,

42
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:36.080
of the entire bit, which ended up being like eight or 10 minutes long.

43
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.560
And then people would say to me, like to start,

44
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.750
when I started getting mail about it, they were like, you know,

45
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:45.860
you can't say retarded. And I go, that's the line that I say like, yeah,

46
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.450
that's the line in the joke, but they.

47
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.350
<v 0>Didn't hear the bet.</v>

48
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.450
He just heard that you were doing a bit about the word retarded blue up.

49
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.670
<v 1>Like once it got to a huge amount of, uh,</v>

50
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.780
like when it was an organized, orchestrated campaign, you're right.

51
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.200
There was people messaging me that would say, um,

52
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.280
I heard you want to kill all children with downs and I'd be like, what?

53
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.180
Like where did you see that Facebook somewhere said it. Someone said it,

54
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.270
it does the messages I started again. And how.

55
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.990
<v 0>Many people at the height of it sign this petition to get you like kicked off in.</v>

56
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.290
<v 1>Netflix over a hundred thousand. Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.900
But here's the thing. Here's what, I mean,

58
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.730
I don't want to portray myself as a victim or anything. Right.

59
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:34.050
Like I, I did a bit, I can handle people not liking it or liking it. I mean,

60
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:38.430
a lot of people messaged me that they were into it and I just didn't share

61
00:03:38.431 --> 00:03:40.890
those. Cause you don't want to be like, here's someone that said they like it.

62
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.940
You know, and people and people, even people with, uh,

63
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.930
children and siblings and, and uh, with announcement message me, you know,

64
00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:53.130
I just didn't post those messages, but I dunno, I,

65
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.980
I'm not the victim in this whole thing at all. I learned,

66
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.860
I feel like I learned that when people are super upset about something,

67
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.300
you have to let them just be upset and be outraged. If they want to be outraged,

68
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.610
you know, that's you're right. It,

69
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.650
of course it's uncomfortable to me that you can't get out in front and be like,

70
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:13.890
Hey, you're, you're misrepresenting it. Right? Because people like,

71
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.550
even in the campaign language, it said like,

72
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.380
we want this bit taken out of the, of the joke. We went the, uh,

73
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.550
trailer for the special removed. And I was like, why?

74
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.320
And then I realized that the trailer has a joke that they're confusing

75
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.940
with the joke where I say retarded. Like there,

76
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.550
they think the two are related. What's the one on the trailer.

77
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.320
The one in the trailer is I say, uh, uh, like some, uh,

78
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.160
something's funny. Um, disabilities are not funny, but some are,

79
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.350
and it's a whole bit about obscure things like a foreign accent syndrome

80
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.483
and, oh.

81
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.330
<v 0>Sorry, you just hit on the head.</v>

82
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.780
And then they start speaking in a French accent. That was the setup to that bit.

83
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.650
Right.

84
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.483
<v 1>And they were,</v>

85
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.410
but they were saying they were basically making it where that setup is

86
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.080
about Down's or something. Do you know what I mean? Like that,

87
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.050
but they happen 40 minutes apart. One has nothing to do with the other,

88
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.800
but by not watching it by just watching the trailer, they're going, oh, see,

89
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:15.960
this is like how he's making fun of us. Right.

90
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.231
<v 0>You will,</v>

91
00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:20.430
you shouldn't even have a point where you could say some disabilities are funny.

92
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.270
<v 2>Right. You, she can't do that. Right. Yeah. That's what, that's what I was.</v>

93
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.220
<v 0>Told. It's it's what it is.</v>

94
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.790
Is this new power that people have to complain. I mean,

95
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.110
if people have always complained,

96
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:34.080
but they haven't had the instantaneous access to complaining.

97
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.550
<v 1>Right. Right. And then you can get,</v>

98
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:39.120
and here's the thing I learned about kind of like mob mentality too.

99
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:42.060
That was like kind of fascinating to watch. I mean, I was in it,

100
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.590
so it's different. Once I could step back,

101
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.480
I realized that once you got sign up a certain message out, you know,

102
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.970
people would read the thing that says,

103
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.990
this guy hates people with downs and I'm like, what?

104
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.080
And that's not a hard to get behind. Oh yeah. So then people would just,

105
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.120
they would sign it. And I would also get messages that said things like, uh,

106
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.140
I didn't know, evil, like you existed in this world, you know, things like that.

107
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:12.140
And I'd be like, what? And you're ISIS.

108
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.090
I mean like really crazy stuff, man. And I, I didn't engage nearly, you know,

109
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.020
the, the, the amount of people that, that would contact me.

110
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.000
But I did engage a few. I did like go back and forth with one guy. He was like,

111
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.430
he opened, he was like, you sucking piece of.

112
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.750
I would stab you if I saw you on the street. And I go, what's this all about?

113
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.430
That was my, like my opening thing to him. And he was like, I heard you, uh,

114
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.610
you want to kill like everybody with down syndrome? And I'm like,

115
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.990
what are you talking about, man? And then we had a back and forth about,

116
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.590
about the bit. I'm like, you should go watch it, you know,

117
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.160
just watch it and then get back to me. And then he writes me and he was like,

118
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:57.080
yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry. The way I spoke earlier, I didn't, I was like serious.

119
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.410
Well.

120
00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.680
<v 0>You're not going to stab me. Yeah. He saw me when it killed me.</v>

121
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:03.610
You'd be in jail forever. They'd be like, uh, defendant, please rise.

122
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.700
Why'd you stab us? It's a girl. I didn't see the bits. I didn't watch.

123
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.160
I didn't watch the bed. Somebody told me he was, uh,

124
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.743
saying terrible things about it.

125
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.420
<v 1>In the, and now in, in there. And people's defense who got upset.</v>

126
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:16.300
Some people watched it and they're like, I saw it. And I think it's horrible.

127
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:19.240
And I think, you know, I'm like, okay. Yeah.

128
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.420
<v 0>Yeah. But there's some people that if you just say the word,</v>

129
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.320
say the word retarded, like, that's it. It's all it's over. You can't do that.

130
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.630
It's like so many other words. Yeah.

131
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.880
But it's gotten to the point where you don't even say the word,

132
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.920
like just saying it it's like, well, holy, what are you doing?

133
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.220
People will say the N word instead of it. Right.

134
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.700
And you're not even calling someone yet, but it just acknowledging it.

135
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.370
That that's a real word. It's like a forbidden thing. Part.

136
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.360
<v 1>Of that, this campaign is to refer to it as the R word. Like,</v>

137
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:57.220
don't say it right. You should never say it. I mean, weird man. Yeah.

138
00:07:57.221 --> 00:08:00.700
I mean, you know, people, people were,

139
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.210
some people were very, very upset about it and you know, I,

140
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.200
I get why someone could be upset about it. It's not like I go, like,

141
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.790
I don't even understand how you could be upset. I mean, the natural thing,

142
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.080
I think if you're a comic is you, you want to walk someone through the joke.

143
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:21.430
But what you realize later is like somebody who's, uh, who's,

144
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.300
who's advocating to stop saying a word. Doesn't care.

145
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.110
The details of the joke. I mean, the joke,

146
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.900
here's the other thing that sucks about reading. People would read transcripts.

147
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.400
It's like transcripts have no intent tone. You know,

148
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:38.230
if you just read, people's like,

149
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.470
I know we've talked about what you're closing on now,

150
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:42.940
which we'll probably close out your special.

151
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.230
If you just type that out and give us the one they'd be like, you are like,

152
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:51.520
you're a horrible man, but it's, it's a couple of days. It's like,

153
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.370
it's in the context of a comedy show where there's an agreement between

154
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:59.790
performer and audience. It's the intent? Like what,

155
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:03.420
how did you intend this bit to go tone? I mean,

156
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:06.810
is it said satirically ironically that bit,

157
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.670
what I'm doing in the bit is, is basically lamenting,

158
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.510
but accepting that words are changing, right? Like that's the tone of it.

159
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.470
The tone of it is I'm going, like, can't say retard anymore. That sucks.

160
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.960
But I'm also like, all right, you know.

161
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.180
<v 0>What I mean? Like you're saying, okay, I'm going to do.</v>

162
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.160
<v 1>It. And I make an example. Like,</v>

163
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:29.640
one thing that people got really upset about was, like I said,

164
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.460
at the end of this bit of the retarded part, I say like, you gotta,

165
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.950
now you gotta be like that.

166
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:39.180
Your idea has an extra 21st chromosome. If you ask me. Right.

167
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.160
And then the next part,

168
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.240
the very next line that they would cut out when people were sharing this thing

169
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.220
is I go like, not the same meaning that the example was a purposely bad example.

170
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.260
Right? The joke is that if you were to say 21st chromosome, it's absurd.

171
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:59.730
It doesn't work. Like it wouldn't make there, but people would attack me and go,

172
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:04.080
like you're telling people to start saying that I I'm like no, I'm sharing that.

173
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:05.190
It's a bad idea.

174
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.340
<v 0>I saw someone getting mad at someone calling someone stupid</v>

175
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.550
because they were saying that's ablest do you know what abelist is?

176
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.590
<v 1>Abelist uh, oh yeah, because you have you're of sound. You're able to,</v>

177
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.050
you're able to do it. Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.720
<v 2>Like, uh, if you.</v>

179
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:28.040
<v 0>Are mocking someone who's diminished mentally. Oh,</v>

180
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:30.860
you idiot. That's ablest. Yeah, sure.

181
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.230
<v 2>Which is crazy. Yeah. You're.</v>

182
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.120
<v 0>Able bodied their brain doesn't work so good. You're enabled list.</v>

183
00:10:37.121 --> 00:10:38.510
If you call them stupid. I mean,

184
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.800
it's going to get to the point where if you give up certain words, I mean,

185
00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:44.090
if we keep going like this,

186
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.360
it's going to get to the point where we're just going to have a very hard time

187
00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:48.194
communicating.

188
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.140
<v 1>Yeah. I totally agree. I mean, there's, I don't know.</v>

189
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.530
There's there's and here's the thing that it is an endless cycle. Yeah. I mean,

190
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.120
we just don't have that next unacceptable word. Right. You know,

191
00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:00.500
like everybody knows.

192
00:11:00.501 --> 00:11:04.400
I think a lot of people know that as far as somebody who's, uh,

193
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.680
doesn't have is developmentally disabled,

194
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.720
retarded was kind of the Mo the latest term. That was once acceptable.

195
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.500
It's clearly not now. I mean, that is kind of the point. But before that,

196
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:17.840
you know, moron was a medical term.

197
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 2>Wasn't yeah. Mongoloid.</v>

198
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.570
<v 0>Idiot was what they used to call 'em down syndrome. Children.</v>

199
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.810
That was like a hundred years ago. It was on the birth certificate. Right.

200
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:27.644
But I'm saying.

201
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:32.270
<v 1>You know, people who are saying, you know, just to stop saying,</v>

202
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.860
they're not wrong, you know,

203
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.480
but there is also another word down the pipeline, right?

204
00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:43.460
There's something else that's coming. That's going to be a medical word or term.

205
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:45.320
And then that'll be used to insult people.

206
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.820
But that's the way people use language. Like once we identify,

207
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.760
this is the word people use to label with a developmental

208
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.540
disability, people in the slang will grow from that.

209
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.170
People will start using that. Well.

210
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:05.310
<v 0>What's interesting to me is that when we're talking about words,</v>

211
00:12:05.311 --> 00:12:07.140
you're not going to change the way people think.

212
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.600
So words are supposed to convey intent.

213
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.800
It's supposed to be sounds that we all agree, mean a certain thing.

214
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:18.810
And the more depth, the more access to words you have,

215
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.170
the more you can sort of flavor your conversation.

216
00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:24.990
So I understand what you're saying. Like, if you're saying this guy,

217
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.280
I kind of get it, but you feel like this guy I'm like, well,

218
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:33.330
Tommy's is really mad. I mean that, and to take that out. Yeah. It's like,

219
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.650
I don't know.

220
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:39.660
So sometimes you take those things out when you're like on a television show or

221
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:42.900
something like that, but all television shows because of that,

222
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.850
all censored television shows only exists within a certain band.

223
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.400
Yes. A certain frequency. They'd never get out of that.

224
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:55.020
Like the Joey Diaz frequency is like, ah, there's no roof. There's no fence,

225
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.250
ah, true. This, this frequency that you get on,

226
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:03.510
like late night talk shows or a sit-com this very narrow band

227
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.890
that, that there's no concert in that band. There's no, you.

228
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.620
There's all those things are not in there.

229
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.120
<v 1>I feel like whenever you're, for me, when I'm watching something like that,</v>

230
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.780
part of my brain is always like, go find a somewhere now it's like,

231
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:20.610
you kind of want it. Yeah. Especially.

232
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.820
<v 0>Now we're, we're just, we're so used to being free,</v>

233
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:28.560
especially us because of podcasts and live, say live, stand up, you know?

234
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:30.330
And I was going to bring this up, like your show,

235
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.780
like your show that you do with your wife, your mom's house,

236
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.000
if anybody just wanted to go cherry pick things and write

237
00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:39.834
them down,

238
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.920
write some of the things you guys joke around about where you're clearly joking,

239
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.170
but take it and write it down in quotes. And then Tom said to his wife,

240
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.460
oh yeah. And by.

241
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:55.080
<v 1>The way, 100,000 times worse than anything in life stainable ever said. Yeah.</v>

242
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.410
It said on that podcast, I mean, it's not even comparable.

243
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:02.400
It's so much worse. The content, I think it's like,

244
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.370
we don't go into the show of like, let's be offensive,

245
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.640
but we play in a no rules.

246
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.660
Like have fun environment. Yeah. You know, it's like free flowing,

247
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.270
just say whatever. And that's the fun of the show.

248
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:18.240
<v 0>Yeah. And it's also, everybody knows you're joking around.</v>

249
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.380
<v 1>Yeah. The fan base is like a hundred percent on board with like,</v>

250
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.670
this is UN you know, uncensored, just loose,

251
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.010
fun going for it, going for jokes.

252
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.790
<v 0>Well, what I also found too, is that during this whole controversy,</v>

253
00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:36.810
after your special was released, yeah. You got bigger.

254
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.800
It's like people, they,

255
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:43.980
by doing that campaign and then people who did investigate, they go, actually,

256
00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:45.300
this guy's really funny. I.

257
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.910
<v 1>Mean, I got, I used to, you know, again,</v>

258
00:14:47.911 --> 00:14:51.770
I never publicize these things because it's gross you to be like,

259
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.040
check out this compliment or whatever. Right. But like,

260
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:59.390
I got so many messages from people who are like, I saw this thing on the news.

261
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.890
Cause it was on a lot of local news that there's a controversial Netflix

262
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.760
thing out there. People would message me. And I saw this thing.

263
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:10.910
So I decided to check you out, new fan, just bought tickets to see you at blah,

264
00:15:10.911 --> 00:15:13.820
blah, blah. So I started to get a bunch of messages.

265
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.920
<v 0>Like that. Sure.</v>

266
00:15:14.921 --> 00:15:17.920
Because you're going to get 30% of the people that aren't even going to read it.

267
00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:19.300
They're just going to call you a piece of. Yeah.

268
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.700
But the other people are going to go, what is going on over here?

269
00:15:21.701 --> 00:15:22.421
And then next thing you know,

270
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.180
they're going to investigate and they're going to go, what they're doing,

271
00:15:25.181 --> 00:15:27.760
this guy dirty. And then boom.

272
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:32.290
<v 1>I got a lot of, I got a lot of support that I never, like I said,</v>

273
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:35.020
I never made light of the fact that people were being supportive,

274
00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:36.340
but people were being very supportive.

275
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.520
<v 0>It just seems like there there's different,</v>

276
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.720
there's different rules now for stand up and you got to really cover your.

277
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:49.360
But in your case you did cover your and they disingenuously left

278
00:15:49.361 --> 00:15:52.480
that part out. Like they deceptively left that out.

279
00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:54.190
When they were writing down what you had said,

280
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.470
they didn't put it in the context. It's.

281
00:15:56.470 --> 00:16:01.190
<v 1>True. And I, and then, you know, part of you goes, uh, man, like I don't,</v>

282
00:16:01.191 --> 00:16:06.130
I'm not trying to paint myself as a martyr or, you know what I mean? Or,

283
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.990
and like people who are going down this path of, you know,

284
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.430
they have family or friends with, uh, disabilities. It's like, uh,

285
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.420
I'm not gonna, my whole thing was never to attack them.

286
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.200
So I'm not going to try to make it a, a battle that I have to win.

287
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.630
So it w once, once I saw like, kind of what I thought clearly was happening,

288
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.321
I was like, you know,

289
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:33.940
just let people vent their frustration about if it's about me or about what I

290
00:16:33.941 --> 00:16:37.150
said, just let it happen. And, um, you know, cause I don't,

291
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.040
I don't hold it against them. That they're,

292
00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.460
that they ha that they're upset about this issue. Right. You know,

293
00:16:42.461 --> 00:16:46.420
and even though like you're saying your instinct is, is, wants to go, like,

294
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:51.430
hold on. Why don't you put it clearly? Right. I said, after a moment of it,

295
00:16:51.431 --> 00:16:54.700
I realized that, like, that kind of, wasn't the point for me in that,

296
00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:57.220
in that time I was like, just let people. Yeah.

297
00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.440
Because I also figured out that if people, yeah,

298
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.730
a lot of people were going to read it,

299
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.490
say something and go like this guy's the worst.

300
00:17:03.491 --> 00:17:05.740
And it's kind of feels good sometimes to be like,

301
00:17:05.741 --> 00:17:08.950
you want to know who a bad guy is this guy. And I, you know,

302
00:17:08.951 --> 00:17:12.430
even though you want to be like, Hey, I'm not that bad of a guy. Uh,

303
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.930
if someone wants to just go there,

304
00:17:13.931 --> 00:17:18.610
you just kind of have to let it go and then let the people who were enjoying it

305
00:17:18.611 --> 00:17:21.220
or who were investigating it and finding like, oh,

306
00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:23.650
it's a little different than it's being presented. Yeah.
