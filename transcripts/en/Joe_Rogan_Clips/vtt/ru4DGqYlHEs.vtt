1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>The jerrogan experience, but I think like, you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.400
um, those moments, um, you know,

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.560
I needed that I needed to, to combine our energies, you know,

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.360
because look how that fight ended up going. You know,

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.990
I felt like &lt;affirmative&gt; like that,

6
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.270
that fight before the fight was to prep me for the fight,

7
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.310
you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, and, um, you know,

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.390
going there, obviously I'm a big underdog, you know,

9
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.220
uh, it's in London, Maasi has so much history he's from Amsterdam.

10
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.820
Um, you know, I don't know if any,

11
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.300
anyone out there saw the video that Bellator put out afterwards where I said

12
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:53.900
like, you know, we did it and, and you could see how emotional I was,

13
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.780
this is why, you know, right. Um,

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.020
and fast forward to when we're back backstage,

15
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.130
um, you know, getting ready to go out there. Um,

16
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.170
I always take, uh, my favorite book think and grow rich from Napoleon hill.

17
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.410
I always take that. Why is that? It's just a,

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.170
a powerful book for my life. Um,

19
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.280
I discovered it in 2000, the end of 2007,

20
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.760
um, and it's just such an inspirational book, um,

21
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.680
and really kind of like was the, sort of the,

22
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:37.320
the Bible for self-help books and, um, all the other, you know,

23
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.440
people that kind of came from that, like Tony Robbins and things like that,

24
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:44.990
like, you know, the, the, um, the motivating, you know,

25
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:48.030
like the secret, you know, all those sort of things, um,

26
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.870
think and grow rich was like the first. Mm. And, um,

27
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.790
and anyways, there's so many quotes in there, um,

28
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.830
and things that just have stuck with me throughout the years,

29
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.350
and I love to read certain chapters and,

30
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.420
and Porsche of it when I'm backstage getting ready to fight. Um,

31
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.060
and I have like highlighted sentences and notes in

32
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.740
it and stuff, and I'm backstage. And I open,

33
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.380
I opened the book and I hadn't opened it, uh, up to this point on this trip.

34
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:22.460
Like, it was just with me, I put it in my bag and, you know,

35
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:27.210
I got a couple hours to go out to fight and I always open it up. And, uh,

36
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.650
as soon as I open it, I it's on the, you know,

37
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.530
the flap isn't inside in a chapter already. Um,

38
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.490
in the last place I looked at it or whatever.

39
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.130
And first thing I see is a highlighted, highlighted, uh,

40
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:43.930
portion that says every adversity carries with it,

41
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.800
a seed of an equivalent advantage.

42
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.320
That was the first thing that I saw and it hit me right there.

43
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.200
It was like everything that I went through in this camp to get to this fight,

44
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.080
you know, that is gonna be my advantage.

45
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.120
That is gonna be what carries me through this fight. That that's my power.

46
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.200
I know what I'm here for. That's a great quote. It's the best, you know,

47
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.840
every adversity carries with it, the seed of an equivalent advantage.

48
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.480
Another one of my favorites from Napoleon hill that I've used on t-shirts and

49
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.950
inside Agui before, um,

50
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.230
victory is always possible for the person who refuses to stop fighting,

51
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.230
you know, which is that's martial arts, right? Mm that's.

52
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.550
A black belt is a white belt who never quit, you know? Mm.

53
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.790
As long as you never quit, success is always possible.

54
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.390
Every failure just helps you learn and grow to, to, you know,

55
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.380
get to your ultimate objective, your ultimate goal.

56
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.300
And when I saw that, you know, writing that book down right now yeah.

57
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.140
Think and grow rich. And the point L I tell all my, all my students,

58
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.580
all my competitors, all my guys, I always talk about that book. Um,

59
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.420
and, and that was the first thing that I saw, you know, and, and like I said,

60
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.250
like going into of this fight, all I wanted was that fight,

61
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.730
like trying to get approved. That whole process was just like,

62
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.730
Hey, just give me this one, just gimme this one more.

63
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.370
Don't stop me this short of, of my dream, you know,

64
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.530
my dream to fight for the belt to fight a legendary fighter.

65
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.080
Like massasi someone that's been &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

66
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.120
at the top for so long, that was how I envisioned, you know,

67
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.640
fighting for my first big world title, uh, in MMA.

68
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.360
And I mean, I was going out there, like, that was the last fight of my life.

69
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.200
Like it could potentially be the last fight of my life, you know,

70
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.070
and all this stuff with my health, like know when I'm thinking about my,

71
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.390
my parents and my family, you know, like wondering, you know,

72
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.630
am I gonna get hurt? Is this, am I, you know,

73
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.870
gonna do something where selfishly, where, because I want this, I wanna fight,

74
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:59.990
I want this, this title that something could happen to me. And,

75
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.580
and, you know, um, I'm not gonna be healthy.

76
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.700
I'm not gonna be the same and I'm gonna break their hearts.

77
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:10.100
I had all these emotions and thoughts and, and, you know, I was just like,

78
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.140
like, I was literally kind of, I mean, and it's so to speak,

79
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.700
going out there, ready to die, like ready to just let it all out.

80
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:25.210
Like this is it. Uh, you know, all I wanted was this opportunity,

81
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.130
you know? And, um,

82
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.770
and I could feel how all of that was to prep me for the fight, you know,

83
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:35.250
everything that we went through that fight to get to the fight.

84
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.930
And my dad's in my corner, you know, he's in all my corner for all my fights.

85
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.800
I had have the guys that went through everything, you know,

86
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.120
those that last four or five weeks before the fight to get approved with

87
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.840
me. And when I saw that, I looked around at them and I smiled.

88
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.680
I said, guys, we're gonna do it. We're gonna do it. You know, it was like,

89
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.640
it was destiny. And, um, and I don't know, um, you know,

90
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:04.613
if you've ever seen,

91
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.560
but I I've posted before some clips of my dad who is a professional organist,

92
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.120
uh, or former professional organist, but he still plays the organ.

93
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.910
He's a musician. Um, and when I,

94
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.190
when I walked out for this fight, I, uh,

95
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.790
I had them play a, a clip of my, my dad playing the organ.

96
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.150
And, uh, you know, growing up when I first started training martial arts,

97
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.790
my dad was playing the organ at that time, uh, professionally. And, uh,

98
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.740
that was, that was, I did the time that I spent with my dad,

99
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.500
I was at church listening to him, play the organ,

100
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.260
and then we would go to the academy and, uh, and we would, you know,

101
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.340
we would train, um, or we would train at home and, you know,

102
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.900
my father's in my corner and you know, this is,

103
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.410
this is our work. You know, I am who I, I am because of him.

104
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.370
I'm a martial artist because of him. I have my brothers,

105
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:06.250
the guys I've been training with for over a decade. Um, you know, it was,

106
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.290
it was, it was our destiny, it was family, you know,

107
00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:14.090
we were going out there to fight as a family and, uh, and walking out to,

108
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.440
to my dad, playing the Oregon, um, you know, it just really,

109
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.000
it, it, it, it took me to this place where it's like,

110
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.960
I'm gonna give everything. I absolutely have win or lose.

111
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.520
I'm, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm not gonna stop.

112
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:37.040
I'm gonna do my best, my absolute best. And, and then, you know,

113
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:41.750
the fight went the way it did, came down to the fifth round, you know, um,

114
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.310
that's where that fifth round came from, was, was for,

115
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.750
for them, you know, the, the, the love that they gave me to,

116
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:53.830
to get me even just to get me there, you know, cause I was ready to break man.

117
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.830
I was, I, I, I, I was in pieces so many days, uh,

118
00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:03.380
in that camp. I, uh, you know, it, it was, um,

119
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.540
it was just a rollercoaster of emotions, but having them, you know,

120
00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.860
my father, my brothers behind me, that's where that strength came from. And, uh,

121
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.940
and everything we went through before the fight. But, uh,

122
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.730
that's why I was so in the cage, I mean,

123
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:25.690
you'd be emotional anyways for a title fight, but, um, you know, it, it was,

124
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.450
uh, it was something else just to,

125
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.490
just to get there, you know, and, and have that opportunity.

126
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.380
And you could really outta UCO, I mean, outta UCO, he

127
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.010
he's right there with his hands. Like, it's a powerful moment right.

128
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.530
<v 1>There. Woo. Did it bother you that, uh,</v>

129
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.810
he was, uh, he had a lot of sour grapes after the fight gaygar did.

130
00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.720
<v 0>It, did it, did he.</v>

131
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.240
<v 1>Didn't uh, didn't really credit you for the fight.</v>

132
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.240
He was just saying mostly that you were on steroids.

133
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.920
<v 0>I see my mom. Yeah. Paying her respect, giving him a hug.</v>

134
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.320
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I understand that he felt bad cuz he lost,</v>

135
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.950
but I felt like the way he handled it was uncharacteristic for him.

136
00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.203
He was attbuting.

137
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.070
<v 0>So too, we were so respectful before, after the fight, I went up to him,</v>

138
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.310
you know, before they made the decision, I went up to him, I shook his hand.

139
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.270
I said, man, it was an honor, you know, so much respect for you. Um,

140
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.910
it was an honor to battle with you, you know, I thanked him, thank you.

141
00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.260
And we shook hands and hugged and, and, uh know,

142
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.500
but then he didn't stay after they raised my hand. He, he walked right out.

143
00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:42.780
We didn't shake hands again and then everything else. Yeah. Really surprised me.

144
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:47.060
Um, I, I think it was just hard to, to fathom because you know,

145
00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:50.420
this was my 10th fight he had already had over 50 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he was a

146
00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:54.140
big, he was a big favorite. Uh, I, I just don't think, um,

147
00:09:55.670 --> 00:10:00.610
he, he, they were very confident. They were very confident, um,

148
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.850
leading up to the fight and I don't think anyone imagined me to walk out of

149
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:06.570
there with that belt. Um.

150
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.610
<v 1>Especially with one leg &lt;laugh&gt; he didn't.</v>

151
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:11.010
<v 0>Know about that. It hurt really bad after.</v>

152
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:12.603
<v 1>Um, I'm sure.</v>

153
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.120
<v 0>But uh, you know, I didn't feel it like I that's when the adrenaline's pumping.</v>

154
00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.080
Right. You know, I, I didn't, it wasn't until like an hour later I was like,

155
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:23.040
woo. Right. It's pretty tight.

156
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.280
<v 1>Um, yeah. Why do you think he did that? Why do you, why do you think, I mean,</v>

157
00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:29.200
he's lost before.

158
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.240
I've never seen him just attribute essentially

159
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.390
attribute most of your success. He was is accusing you of taking steroids. Yeah.

160
00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.630
And not a little bit of steroids. You were saying like monkey steroids.

161
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.150
That's what he said. Yeah.

162
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.470
<v 0>I don't know. Uh, you know, his camp had a,</v>

163
00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:53.150
I felt like massasi is genuinely like what I would call, uh,

164
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.950
you know, a real martial artist. He's a,

165
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:58.900
he's a martial artist and doesn't really ever, or, you know, trash talk,

166
00:10:58.901 --> 00:11:03.020
anybody mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Um, and we were very respectful, but you know,

167
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.900
his camp was,

168
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.580
they were saying and doing some things that were a little edgiier I would say

169
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:13.180
when we a little douchier yeah. Yeah. When we, uh, tried to do classy, when we,

170
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.500
uh, were at the press conference and we were going off for the face off, I,

171
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.970
you know, all his camp were always yelling a bunch of things. And, and um,

172
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:27.090
you know, when we were walking up one guy yells up to me, dead man walking.

173
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:31.530
And of course immediate in my mind, I'm like I have this brain disease,

174
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.890
you know, that, uh, you know,

175
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.480
may or may not be an issue here. And a couple days when we fight, you know, and,

176
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.040
and I have my family right there, I'm like, Hmm.

177
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.360
And then I have to look at him in the eyes, you know,

178
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.280
but now I'll never forget that. I thought about that, you know,

179
00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:54.440
dead man walking. And I was just like this guy,

180
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.760
you know? And, um, it was a lot, it was a lot to take in, uh,

181
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.800
to step into that cage.

182
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.240
But I think maybe some of the people he's around, maybe.

183
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.240
<v 1>That doesn't, I mean, that doesn't cause him to say those things.</v>

184
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:12.280
When he was sitting at the di the,

185
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:15.670
the table with the microphone in front of him, did you respond to that?

186
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.630
<v 0>No. I mean, uh, that was right when we were walking the face off,</v>

187
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.510
um, and the press conference was basically done at that point.

188
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.670
So I had nothing to say to that, you know, that, uh,

189
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:31.270
that person yelling that and, you know, no. And I mean, after the.

190
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.150
<v 1>Fight, when he was accusing you.</v>

191
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.900
<v 0>Of steroids, did you ever, no, I never, never had a, a moment to,</v>

192
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:41.340
you know, I, I we'd ever had another, haven't had another fight. Haven't been,

193
00:12:41.341 --> 00:12:41.820
never did.

194
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.700
<v 1>An interview or anybody talk to you about his.</v>

195
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.860
<v 0>Accusations? Um, uh, no. Who was it? I did one Luke Thomas,</v>

196
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:52.780
Luke Thomas, um, did an interview with me. I like that guy a lot. Yeah. Yeah.

197
00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.010
Uh, um, and, uh, I think it was

198
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.090
AF no. Yeah, it was before he fought maeeita it was before he fought Machita.

199
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.450
Um, and he talked to me about it, you know,

200
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:07.770
in an interview about the fight and everything. And, uh, you know,

201
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:10.970
I didn't have too much to say other than I just felt like it was a little sad

202
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:14.320
because it was a great fight, you know? Yeah. It was a really great fight and,

203
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.040
um, a good fight, fight, close fight. He, yeah, super close. Um,

204
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.040
I feel like we kind of, you know, I, I,

205
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.840
he probably thinks that he was under par and, uh,

206
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.560
and I made a lot of mistakes too,

207
00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:29.560
and I wasn't too happy about some of the things that,

208
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.160
that happened in that fight as well. I thought I could have done a lot better,

209
00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.070
but in a way I felt like we kind of brought out the best of each other.

210
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.070
You know, his jujitsu very much impressed me. Uh, he was,

211
00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:44.350
he was a season pro just like always calm. And,

212
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.720
you know, then when he had his moment, he had his moment,

213
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.720
he started taking over, you know, and, uh, and I, you know, I,

214
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.040
it brought out the best in me and the,

215
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:57.190
the heart that I showed coming and back in that fifth round. Um,

216
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.110
and I just felt like it was a great fight and we should be applauding each other

217
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:06.510
for our performances. And, uh, and all this, you know,

218
00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:08.750
trash talking has really taken away from that. Yeah.

219
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:18.500
<v 2>I.</v>
