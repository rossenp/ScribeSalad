00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So were you off when that, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.120
Lucy Kay, uh, recording got released in comics were denouncing it?

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.590
<v 1>Yeah, it was weird. I mean, it's a bummer when people, first of all, people,</v>

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.440
a lot of people were like, these aren't even jokes.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.220
He's not even joking anymore. And you're like, no, no, they're jokes.

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.970
Like I understand if you're, um, don't like it, or you're offended,

7
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:25.430
but you're like, they're definitely jokes. He's onstage.

8
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.780
He doesn't really think that they threw a fat kid in front of them and right.

9
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.310
That's not how he feels.

10
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.670
<v 0>Saying something that's up and funny.</v>

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.000
And it's funny because it's up because you're not supposed to say it,

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.420
which is the exact thing he's done his whole career.

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.620
<v 1>Right. And it's a new bed. It wasn't supposed to be heard outside of this.</v>

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.200
<v 0>And for these people,</v>

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.660
like there's a lot of times you'll say something one way and then you're like,

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.650
ah, it's not working.

17
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.380
And then you'll figure out another way to sneak in through the back door and it

18
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:57.800
works way better. And then if they heard the first way and like this joke sucks,

19
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:59.570
like, no, no, no. I figured out, I'd say it later,

20
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.990
but now it's already on YouTube. You've ruined the material. Yeah.

21
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.590
<v 1>I mean, he dropped the bit, um, cause it's just kinda like.</v>

22
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.130
<v 2>It's too much, but um, hilarious.</v>

23
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.100
<v 0>Line. If you're wanting people to forget about you jerking off,</v>

24
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:16.100
make jokes about kids getting shot. Yeah, it does. It.

25
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.750
<v 1>Does also funny line where he's like, why are you in a suit? Which is funny. Um,</v>

26
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.920
but yeah, and then people were talking about how, um,

27
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.130
now the parents have to hear this and stuff and you're like, well,

28
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:31.640
they weren't going to, you took it and put it out.

29
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:35.930
And then CBS picked it up and put it on CBS. So now they're hearing it.

30
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:36.651
But before that,

31
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:40.010
there was just 180 people in long island hearing it and you know.

32
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.510
<v 0>What it was supposed to be.</v>

33
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.320
But the thing about working on material is if you like comedy,

34
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.020
you can't release people's like that because you're never going to get good

35
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:54.880
comedy because everyone's going to like every time Dave Chappelle does, uh, uh,

36
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.611
uh, you know,

37
00:01:55.611 --> 00:02:00.290
a workout set or anybody you're gonna get these half cooked

38
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.130
bits and then you're gonna release them and it's going to ruin it for you.

39
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.430
It's going to ruin it for you for the people that listen. It's like the,

40
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.980
for the people that are in the room, that's for them. Right.

41
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.270
If you're taking it out, like,

42
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:15.140
and there's been a lot of talk about Louie making this copyright thing,

43
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.590
saying that, you know that there was illegal action.

44
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:23.090
If you print or you do anything to record or do anything to put the material

45
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:25.670
online and someone saying he can't do that, I'm like, well,

46
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:30.050
why can't he do that? The deal, the difference between that and music.

47
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.740
Like if you go to hear someone sing a song and you write down the lyrics go,

48
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.590
oh my God, uh, Gary Clark Jr. Has this amazing new song.

49
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.820
Here's the lyrics that doesn't ruin the song. Right. But if you say, oh,

50
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.620
he's got this hilarious joke. And the twist is, he says this, well,

51
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:49.730
you just that bit up for everyone that's ever going to listen to it.

52
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.960
<v 1>Right? Yeah. It's uh, it's frustrating. It was a frustration.</v>

53
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.600
But then people start being like, he's all right, now he's going to do it.

54
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:57.680
And you're like, no, he's not.

55
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 0>People are. But the comedians that denounced, it were embarrassing.</v>

56
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.840
It's like, do you not know what a workout set is?

57
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.510
Do you understand this guy was out of comedy for almost a year?

58
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.290
Do you know that this guy was doing a hour after being out of Kami for almost a

59
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.640
year? you.

60
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.570
Stop pretending that what you do is different stop.

61
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.910
And so many people were doing it and it's like,

62
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.190
it turned out that they had a bunch of jokes that were awful or about a mass

63
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:28.360
shooting or about pulling your Dick out in front of someone or about anything

64
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.940
along those lines. It's a.

65
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.950
<v 1>Bad precedent to start where I'm like,</v>

66
00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:36.930
do we really want to start publicly on comics? Unfinished bits. Exactly.

67
00:03:36.931 --> 00:03:39.120
That seems like I don't want that. No.

68
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.170
I saw a list at a seller and he's got this hack and you're like, oh,

69
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.510
give me a moment.

70
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.030
Tell me behind the closed doors that like this hacky or something.

71
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.620
<v 0>You're a bit ready before. Like, do you have a comedy central special?</v>

72
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:53.970
You have something? I did it. I have.

73
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.130
<v 1>A Netflix half hour and I did a comedy central half hour.</v>

74
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

75
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.560
So how long did you have to work on those bits

76
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:04.560
before you were ready to put them on comedy central or Netflix?

77
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.210
<v 1>Quite a while. I like to do a bit, at least three months before it's somewhere.</v>

78
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.740
Yeah. At the very least. And it's got a great.

79
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.180
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. And it depends on the bit. Right. Some bits are pretty good.</v>

80
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:18.570
A couple of weeks in and other bits. I've got a couple of bits of my act now.

81
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.600
And I'm like, this needs an overhaul and I don't even know where to start.

82
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.870
<v 1>Yeah. I've had bits that I did. I've done for two years.</v>

83
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.500
And then you finally find a line and you're like, ah, there we go. That was it.

84
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.980
And then you're like, now it's more of a bit because it takes,

85
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.420
it takes time to figure it out. And uh, but yeah, it's comics should,

86
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.660
but I understand people, people hate Lou and they're going to hate them.

87
00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:42.150
So whatever he does or says, I don't even believe they hate him.

88
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.780
I don't believe.

89
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.610
<v 0>It. You know what I think a lot of it is.</v>

90
00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:49.440
I think people are justifiably upset at the idea of him jerking

91
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.940
off in front of women that didn't want him to here's there's a couple of factors

92
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:56.640
that though one is that he asked, you know, yeah.

93
00:04:56.641 --> 00:04:59.040
It's a weird thing to want to do jerk off in front of people.

94
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:01.110
But he asked and a lot of these stories,

95
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:05.610
the way you're getting the version of it, it's like worst case scenario.

96
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.060
It's like he blocked the door, he didn't block any doors, you know?

97
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.790
And they were laughing. Like people were joking around,

98
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:15.690
like it became this traumatic thing years later talking about it after the fact.

99
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.620
But then on top of that, it's like, God,

100
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.890
don't you think the guy has suffered enough? Like when,

101
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:25.240
when is he suffering enough? You,

102
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.140
you see this lack of empathy with people where they don't even want to respect

103
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:29.820
that he's a human being. They don't,

104
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.170
they don't want to appreciate any of his old work. They don't want to,

105
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.480
they don't have anything that he could do that would make them just

106
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:43.110
go. All right. Well, I know you're not going to do that again. And uh,

107
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.220
you seem like a reasonable person. It's like, we like you can't be your past.

108
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:50.840
You're not the guy who. That sneaker. Right. Your Joe list today. Yeah. Right.

109
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.720
Yeah. Nobody.

110
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.630
<v 1>Wants to be remembered for the worst thing they did. It's.</v>

111
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.570
<v 0>And it's, I think it's a thing where they know it's an easy target. I really do.</v>

112
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.830
I think at a certain point in time,

113
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:05.420
people just decide that this is a guy that you can take a free shot at and you

114
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.840
can on him and you can attribute things to him that aren't true.

115
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.080
You can attribute, attribute a bunch of things to him that are not accurate.

116
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.980
Right. And it's easy, like, like calling them outright or saying Lucy Kay,

117
00:06:15.981 --> 00:06:16.910
showing his true colors.

118
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.990
Now Jesus Christ go back and watch his bit about hitting a deer. Okay.

119
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.340
It's a ridiculous, really funny material.

120
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:30.020
And that's what I enjoyed about his act, right? This, that, that bit,

121
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.570
if left alone, I mean, it's an out of his act now,

122
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:35.540
but if left alone in X amount of time,

123
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.180
he would have crafted that into a great bit. I'm sure.

124
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.640
<v 3>Of it. Yeah. I agree. And there's so.</v>

125
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.533
<v 0>There was a bunch of</v>

126
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.640
half-ass comics that came out and were talking trash about it. And I was like,

127
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.120
you guys should shut the up because this,

128
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:53.690
this whole art form is about trial and error.

129
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:57.770
This whole art form is about being able to work with one of the rare things that

130
00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:01.910
we need a crowd to in order to, for these things to come alive.

131
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.500
<v 1>And you have to take chances. I just saw ironically with Louie, I went,</v>

132
00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:10.210
we went and saw apocalypse now during the Tribeca film festival and Francis Ford

133
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:13.510
Coppola was there and he came out and he spoke about the film beforehand and

134
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:16.930
after. And Robert Duvall was off also there. And he came out and went,

135
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:20.920
Charlie don't surf. It was amazing. Uh, and it was really unbelievable,

136
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:24.490
but a couple of was talking after the film. And he was like,

137
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.090
I don't know if you know the whole story about apocalypse now that documentary

138
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:30.010
hearts of darkness, which is amazing. And like,

139
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.980
he put like his house up for sale to like,

140
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.230
or put everything on the line to make the movie himself.

141
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.950
And he was just talking about, you have to take chances with art. He's like,

142
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:43.450
there's no art without taking big chances. And uh, I mean, that's,

143
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.610
you're taking a chance by doing a joke. I mean, I wouldn't do a joke about, uh,

144
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:52.990
the Parkland shooting. I wouldn't either, but, um, but you know, it's a,

145
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.110
it's a risk and it might go bad and it went well, he got.

146
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.450
<v 3>Laughs. It got laughs. Um.</v>

147
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.870
<v 1>But certainly if you take anything outside of, um, uh,</v>

148
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.700
comedy comedy club and put it out in the public,

149
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:05.920
it's not for those people's for the people that bought the ticket.

150
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.000
<v 0>It's also in context of the experience of being in a comedy club,</v>

151
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.790
having a couple drinks of watching a hilarious guy, talk some,

152
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:18.130
especially a guy coming back after a national scandal right now, worldwide,

153
00:08:18.131 --> 00:08:21.580
worldwide scandal, you know? And it's just, look,

154
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:24.370
I wouldn't joke around about them getting shot either.

155
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.990
But one of the things that made that bit work was that yes,

156
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:32.080
it was a horrible tragedy. Yes. Those kids went through that. Yes.

157
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:35.110
They're teenagers. Yes. They're trying to figure out life.

158
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.920
And they're being interviewed on CNN and some of them are changing their

159
00:08:38.921 --> 00:08:42.190
opinions and they're developing and growing as we speak.

160
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.400
But like one of them, like the David hog guy,

161
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:50.080
he broke the patriarchy on his Twitter the other day. Like that was his tweet.

162
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.100
Like not even as a joke, like that's an 18 year old. That's what kids do.

163
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.690
They say. That's why the bit worked because he was.

164
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.180
<v 3>Like, why are you interesting? Right. You know, like, why.</v>

165
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.020
<v 0>Do I have to hear from you? But well, you have to hear from them.</v>

166
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:08.050
Cause their friends got shot. I mean, but no one, obviously like that's not, it,

167
00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:09.390
this is not a conversation.

168
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.960
This is stand-up comedy is an art form and saying things that are funny,

169
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.330
that are up. That's part of the art form.

170
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.520
If you deny that either that's not the kind of comedy you like or

171
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.520
you don't appreciate what comedy is. Yeah.

172
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.710
<v 1>And also it's a weird thing where I'm like, I'm for those kids. I'm like, yeah,</v>

173
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.030
it's great. Like this horrible thing happened. And you're like,

174
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:32.630
we're going to use what power we have. I'm like, I think that's great. Yes.

175
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.510
And they might actually do something. I mean, it's like,

176
00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:38.930
they're making changes and I'm like, eh, that's like power to the people.

177
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.370
God bless you. But I can still laugh at a joke about it.

178
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.250
It's still funny to me to see someone be like, why are you in a suit? You can,

179
00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:47.690
both things can exist.

180
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.700
You can have empathy for murder victims and even be like, rooting for me. Like,

181
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:55.760
wow, that's amazing what these kids are doing. Are they still people?

182
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.380
And still be like, ah, it's funny.

183
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.210
<v 0>It's funny. Just look it's, it's not as best joke, but it wasn't done. You.</v>

184
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.230
And here's the other thing like, do you know Brian Holtzman is?

185
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.140
I don't think so. Got to see him when you're in town. If you can.

186
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.980
He's hilarious. He's a legitimate maniac.

187
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.240
He's a legend in Los Angeles star. When I started the comedy store in 94,

188
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:20.320
he was already there and he's really funny. But he had,

189
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.430
remember when Susan Smith drowned her kids, that lady,

190
00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:27.080
she pushed her car into the river or something and drown her kids. No,

191
00:10:27.081 --> 00:10:27.770
but it sounds,

192
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.150
he was on stage a very short amount of time afterwards going ladies, gentlemen,

193
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.410
I heard those were bad kids. He goes, I heard, they sat that close to the TV.

194
00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:39.230
They never put away their blocks. They always spilling the milk.

195
00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.770
Those kids will not be missed. Yeah. And you were just like, wow.

196
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.830
<v 4>It's not, he didn't really.</v>

197
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.450
<v 0>Think those were bad kids. It's a up thing to say. That happens to be funny.</v>

198
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.240
Yeah. You might not be into that kind of humor. That's okay.

199
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.870
<v 1>As part of, I think what comedy is, or has always been,</v>

200
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:59.300
is saying a thing you're not supposed to say, that's like, to me,

201
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:04.130
the very idea of comedy is you're saying abnormal things,

202
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.020
right? Like you talking about coming in your own.

203
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.240
<v 3>Face and whatever, or someone coming in your fridge.</v>

204
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.590
<v 1>That you're not supposed to express your sexually desires.</v>

205
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:12.740
So it's not a snap that.

206
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.360
<v 3>You really mean that I do not. It's funny. Right. Right. I think so.</v>

207
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.890
Right. Was intended to be funny.

208
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.370
<v 0>It's an art form that is often cited or</v>

209
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.320
quoted as if it's a statement, you know, like he said this, like,

210
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.420
yeah. He said that on stage in a comedy club as a part of a big,

211
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:40.340
giant chunk about this and you're taking it out of context and you do it

212
00:11:40.341 --> 00:11:43.850
in the worst possible way. You put it in print. Of course it looks terrible.

213
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.430
Of course it looks terrible in print because it's not in a comedy club,

214
00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:47.450
but it's not in context.

215
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.950
It's like that has no relationship to the actual bid itself.

216
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:55.510
Your print version. It, it's not it's, it's a lie.

217
00:11:55.511 --> 00:11:59.590
You should go to jail for saying, that's the joke. You're a liar. You're a liar.

218
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:02.560
You're defaming someone. You're taking what they're doing.

219
00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:06.310
And you're pretending that what they were saying is what they mean. Right.

220
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.120
You know, that's not what they mean. Remember.

221
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.630
<v 1>That, uh, Lenny boots and that's in the movie, Lenny, I think we talked about,</v>

222
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.650
they were like reading his act and he's like, but you're not saying it. Right.

223
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.530
Exactly.

224
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.390
<v 0>It's the same thing. It's look,</v>

225
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.650
no one thinks school shootings are a good thing. No one does. No one does.

226
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:34.500
They they're doing jokes about it because we know it's a horrible tragedy.

227
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.020
That's why jokes work. And they don't,

228
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.930
they don't work because you're mean they don't work because you're horrible.

229
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.000
They work because everyone knows you're joking.

230
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.630
If everybody really thought you were a horrible person and you were happy that

231
00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:49.710
people get shot, they wouldn't laugh at a thing. You said, right. That's,

232
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.720
it's a F it's a weird art form. It's a weird art form.

233
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.760
And for it to be dismantled and disrespected, the way it is where people are,

234
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.630
when people break down people's bits and,

235
00:13:02.631 --> 00:13:05.880
and take them out of context like that, it's, it's so foolish.

236
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.800
And the fact that people don't stand up for it that are in the art form itself.

237
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.190
That drives me crazy. It drove me angry.

238
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.590
This is a bunch of people that I won't even talk to anymore. I'm like,

239
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:19.050
I'm not talking to you anymore. Like, this is what you're going to do.

240
00:13:19.051 --> 00:13:22.770
If I do a bit, that's half cooked and you're going to talk about me, right?

241
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.560
Like this, you're doing this for your own favor.

242
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.980
You're not doing this for the art form. You're not doing,

243
00:13:28.981 --> 00:13:30.540
you're not an empathetic person. You don't look,

244
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.410
you don't looking at him as a human being saying, well, clearly the guy up.

245
00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:36.540
He made some mistakes. I bet it was okay.

246
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.170
But look that if you listen to that set, that's a good set.

247
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.980
Especially for a guy who's been out of comedy for almost a year.

248
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:45.420
It's gotten a lot stronger.

249
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.270
<v 4>I'm sure. Yeah. Hilarious Canadian.</v>

250
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:48.841
<v 0>I mean,</v>

251
00:13:48.841 --> 00:13:53.580
he's going to get to a point where he's got a real of an hour and

252
00:13:53.581 --> 00:13:56.790
then someone's going to have to figure out whether or not they're willing to

253
00:13:56.791 --> 00:13:59.400
take a chance and put it on. It's like, you're.

254
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.010
<v 1>Talking about earlier too. I mean, you can also just put it on YouTube.</v>

255
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.470
<v 2>His website or YouTube or whatever this, I hope he does that.</v>

256
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.160
<v 0>Um, you know, I mean, there's this idea that he should be punished for eternity.</v>

257
00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.610
It's like, what do we Catholics? Like, what's going on here? Like, what is this?

258
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.370
Did you know? What did he do? I mean,

259
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:17.640
he did something that caused wound up crossing them $35 million,

260
00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:22.620
a massive public shame still to this day more than it's almost like two years

261
00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:27.240
later. Was it like a year and a half now? Uh, November of 2017. Yeah. Let me,

262
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.200
what the? Like what do you want them to do? You know? I mean,

263
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.620
we're not talking about Harvey Weinstein here and this idea that you're,

264
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.700
you know, you're not even supposed to compare offenders, you know,

265
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.280
you're not supposed to make judgment calls. Well, of course you are.

266
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.380
That's why some people go to jail for life.

267
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.360
And some people go to jail for two years. And this is,

268
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.780
this is the reason why we have lesser punishments. Right, right. Yeah.

269
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:51.770
There's a system in place. If you ask people,

270
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.690
if you can jerk off in front of them and they say no,

271
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.240
and you don't jerk off in front of them. Good for you.

272
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.280
You've got some restraint. If you ask people,

273
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.060
if you can jerk off in front of them and they say yes, and you do it, look,

274
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.510
maybe.

275
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.700
<v 3>It's a weird thing to do, but you're.</v>

276
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.680
<v 0>You're not bill Cosby. Okay.</v>

277
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.400
And D to say that you're not supposed to make these comparisons. It's like,

278
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:11.930
this is a loaded subject too. Right.

279
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.550
We we're talking about this and I see you're nervous.

280
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.870
<v 1>Oh yeah. I'm terrified. Um, but yeah, no, I.</v>

281
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.160
<v 3>I love Louie. I love Louis too. He's a great comic. Yeah. He's.</v>

282
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160
<v 1>A great guy also. But yeah, I understand people are upset. I.</v>

283
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.030
<v 0>Get it. I get it. But I think it's disproportionate. I really do. You know.</v>

284
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.290
<v 1>I would agree wholeheartedly, but yeah. Um.</v>

285
00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.070
<v 0>How long do you think it's going to be before people just let it go?</v>

286
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.860
<v 1>Well, I think, I think there's actually, um,</v>

287
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.140
the group of people that are really upset about it.

288
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.710
I think it's probably like a quarter of a million people.

289
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.080
That's a lot of people, it's a lot of people,

290
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:50.170
but there's like 300 million people in the country.

291
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.660
Maybe it's less than a quarter of a million. It's I, I don't,

292
00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.040
I think it's the minority.

293
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.770
<v 0>So do you think most people like, ah, he did something crazy,</v>

294
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.880
but the other thing is like,

295
00:15:57.881 --> 00:16:00.100
you want to kind of see the guy who jerked off in front of women.

296
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.300
So people want to go see lot.

297
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.870
<v 1>I mean, he's a great comic stuff, but I mean the shows, I mean,</v>

298
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:07.240
I I'll read Twitter and stuff. I sometimes I'll go on,

299
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.450
we'll hang out and I'll just search his name to say like one time we went out to

300
00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:14.530
eat in New York and there was a kid, you know, like a hip street.

301
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.390
He looks similar to me actually. Um,

302
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:20.530
but like a young kid and he stopped and just like stared at us and was like,

303
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.570
I started taking photos and then he left and then I looked up Louis' name on

304
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:28.660
Twitter and I found the kid and he wrote just all caps,

305
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.560
just gave Louis the finger, which he did can give us a little areas.

306
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.340
And then he wrote you signaling. He wrote attention.

307
00:16:36.341 --> 00:16:40.750
NYU students is all caps. Louis CK is in the neighborhood,

308
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.140
make him uncomfortable, exclamation point. We were like,

309
00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:47.530
that's like psychotic you're. Uh, but that's what I was talking about earlier.

310
00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.320
<v 0>That I think he's a target. And I think they just decided,</v>

311
00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:51.610
this is what they're going to do now.

312
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.580
And like that guy was saying that he gave you the finger when he did.

313
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.760
And that's the virtue signaling aspect of it.

314
00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.800
It's one of the weirdest parts about social media,

315
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:04.420
because it's people that ordinarily like in a, in a real world scenario,

316
00:17:04.421 --> 00:17:05.890
you have an opportunity to say something,

317
00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:08.590
if you really feel so compelled the guys right in front of you, you don't say.

318
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.220
And then you get online and tell other people to do it right.

319
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.320
Other people to make them uncomfortable. Well, for the most.

320
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:17.500
<v 1>Right? Yeah. We'll, we'll go around and it is everything is,</v>

321
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.820
it's the weird thing about online.

322
00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:21.700
Most people are much different in person because you realize it's a human being.

323
00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:25.150
I think the natural thing is like, oh, this is a person. Exactly. And then,

324
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:25.541
you know,

325
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:29.740
we'll go to like these kind of hipstery coffee shops where you think that that

326
00:17:29.741 --> 00:17:33.040
kind of person would be, and he goes, hi, how are you? Can I get a cut?

327
00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:34.810
And they go, oh, sure. Yeah. That nobody,

328
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.840
how many people will get dirty looks and stuff. Well,

329
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.710
that's way more online than, than not online, but that's a show.

330
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.460
All the shows are all selling out and there's a few people outside.

331
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.030
<v 2>Um, has he ever talked to these people outside or does he just get in? No.</v>

332
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.690
<v 1>I don't think so. How does he get in? This is kind of a backdoor.</v>

333
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.610
We just went in the back and um, you know, good for them.

334
00:17:56.611 --> 00:18:00.240
I think that they're misguided, like you said, but yeah.

335
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.550
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

336
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.690
I think they want him to be this evil person they should be protesting against.

337
00:18:05.691 --> 00:18:09.500
But I think if you look at it on paper, what he did was just not good.

338
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.480
It's like, it's, it's, you know,

339
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.680
the worst that I had heard was that some people's careers had suffered because

340
00:18:15.681 --> 00:18:18.020
they were talking about it right. At someone.

341
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.760
But I don't know how much of that is accurate. I know. I need to find out about.

342
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.080
<v 1>That. Yeah. I don't, I don't know either. I don't know the whole time. I,</v>

343
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.030
I always feel like I love Louis. He's one of my best friends now, uh,

344
00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.010
which is weird to say, but, uh, we're close,

345
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.070
but I don't really begrudge the women.

346
00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:37.520
I think that two different people can have the same experience and take

347
00:18:37.521 --> 00:18:41.750
different things from it feel different ways. And I understand, um,

348
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.520
sexuality is weird.

349
00:18:43.521 --> 00:18:46.220
So like they could in the moment and his perception might be well,

350
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:47.390
they said yes.

351
00:18:47.391 --> 00:18:50.420
And I think he kind of talks about this a little bit on stage and I don't want

352
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.640
to tell his feelings. There's stories to tell,

353
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.750
but I think one person can be like, I thought they were into,

354
00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.690
I thought they were saying yes. And they're into. And those women can say,

355
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:02.960
can feel, yeah, we kind of said yes,

356
00:19:02.961 --> 00:19:06.440
but we felt up and pressured to people can have the same experience and have

357
00:19:06.441 --> 00:19:09.590
different perspectives. So I don't of course, but grudge, any of the women,

358
00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:14.090
I understand that they are, um, hurt and feel, uh, mistreated.

359
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.720
And I respect.

360
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.460
<v 0>That. You're still, and you see something you didn't want to see like, whoa,</v>

361
00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.880
and then you can never unsee it. Yeah. It's like, it's in your head.

362
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:28.280
<v 1>Yeah. I understand. They're affected by it. But um, but in front of, you know,</v>

363
00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:31.670
I keep asking don't do it. No, no. I asked him to come in.

364
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.520
<v 0>With that. He used to ask first, maybe that's his thing now.</v>

365
00:19:34.521 --> 00:19:37.370
Maybe I initially I blew it. Maybe you have to like probably shy. Yeah.

366
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.830
So you know what? I would hate if you jerked off in front of me silly,

367
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:40.753
like drop hints. Yeah.

368
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.670
<v 1>Yeah. Maybe I will, but he's but he's a, he's a,</v>

369
00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:48.410
he's a good person and I'm a great dad and I, I love him. I love him. Yeah.

370
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.980
Everybody wants.

371
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.930
<v 0>To erase everything he's ever done. It's so like, they didn't FX,</v>

372
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:57.290
like not just cancel it, but they made the show unavailable. Yeah.

373
00:19:57.291 --> 00:19:57.950
I think you can get.

374
00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:01.310
<v 1>On iTunes, but yeah, it's done. And then, um,</v>

375
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.640
I think he's still on Netflix though. Yeah. I still see it, but yeah, you.

376
00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.700
<v 0>Can still see, but they canceled the new one that, yeah. So.</v>

377
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.510
<v 1>Let's do this and then pets too. Uh, they tried, he got rid of them. Yeah.</v>

378
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:16.010
So it was a, it was a bummer, but it's weird when people, I mean,

379
00:20:16.011 --> 00:20:20.510
shouldn't we be empathetic to all people. Yes. I think we should.

380
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.390
<v 0>I think we should. And I think, you know,</v>

381
00:20:23.391 --> 00:20:28.220
maybe it would serve him if he went out and talked about it extensively,

382
00:20:28.221 --> 00:20:31.970
like had a conversation about like maybe videotaped it or something. I mean,

383
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.120
I don't know, like if people had his take on it,

384
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.970
other than that little letter that he wrote right after it happened. Yeah.

385
00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.350
Maybe that would help. Yeah.

386
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:43.700
<v 1>Which I thought was a good, um, apology, a good statement. I thought,</v>

387
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.743
yeah.

388
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.910
<v 0>Some people will never be and some people were happy with it.</v>

389
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:52.120
And some people just felt like it wasn't enough that, you know,

390
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.870
he didn't specifically say, I am sorry. You know, I feel horrible.

391
00:20:55.871 --> 00:20:58.240
I'm sorry I did this. He basically said he did it.

392
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.340
And those stories are true and that he up and he thought that they, you know,

393
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:08.080
he thought that by them saying yes, that that was okay. But meanwhile,

394
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.910
he took advantage of the fact that they admired.

395
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.070
<v 1>Him. Yeah. And he's very, yeah. He expressed regret. People are like,</v>

396
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.500
but like you said, just going, people are going to be unhappy no matter,

397
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.330
no matter what, no matter what. And even if he said.

398
00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.790
<v 0>I am sorry, that's not good enough. You're only sorry, because he got caught.</v>

399
00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:22.290
Like people they're always going to have,

400
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:26.220
there's some people that are just not empathetic. And um,

401
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:33.050
this is what, what I really got very angry about with the, the,

402
00:21:33.051 --> 00:21:37.500
the leak of the recording. My cats. Not as best material. Of course. It's not,

403
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.570
he's even, hasn't done comedy in 10 months.

404
00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:42.390
Like when I was hearing it from other comedians, I'm like, do you, how do you,

405
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.230
how do you do this? Right. Don't you do the same thing we do, right? Like,

406
00:21:46.231 --> 00:21:47.064
what are you doing?

407
00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.300
He's a person is a human being.

408
00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:56.010
He's a year and a half of him being stared at everywhere.

409
00:21:56.011 --> 00:22:00.550
He goes and with. He gets it and losing friends. Yes.

410
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:05.410
I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah. But he, those friends, if he lost some friends,

411
00:22:05.411 --> 00:22:09.940
he's better off. If you lost friends. Because of that, like, if that was Ari,

412
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:10.983
I would call them up.

413
00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.720
Like if there was a New York times article about RA jerking off in front of

414
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:17.260
people, I be like, bro, I'm a little hurt. He never jerked off in front of me.

415
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.830
Like, I feel like I'm waiting. I would, if he's I got up,

416
00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:24.340
like I've had conversations with Ari about things where, you know, he's like,

417
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.120
oh, I up, I shouldn't have done that. It was a move. Like, he'll tell you. Yeah.

418
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.200
You know, like you can't do anything. Like if, once you're my friend,

419
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:33.311
like let's,

420
00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:36.130
you're out there murdering kids or something or doing something really over

421
00:22:36.131 --> 00:22:39.790
actually raping someone. Yeah. Any friends at Louie loss for that, like,

422
00:22:39.791 --> 00:22:43.000
come on, man. What did you think?

423
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.000
Did you think it was a perfect person? He's a nut.

424
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:50.330
He's a maniac professional comedian. Right? Right. Yeah. Yeah.

425
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:55.190
We're flawed people. Yeah. That's how it all comes out. Good. It's like,

426
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.900
there's gotta be something up about your head where you can

427
00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.280
come up with these.

428
00:23:01.281 --> 00:23:06.110
And another one that drives me crazy is these guys who, you know,

429
00:23:06.111 --> 00:23:09.230
are freaks and they're out of their mind off stage.

430
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.620
But on stage they have like sort of a more squeaky, clean thing.

431
00:23:12.621 --> 00:23:16.130
And their public thing is more squeaky clean and they're judgmental about it.

432
00:23:16.131 --> 00:23:20.540
I'm like, oh my God, like, please stop. You're crazy. As anybody,

433
00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:22.550
you just have a good squeaky clean act.

434
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:23.901
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

435
00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:27.560
Sometimes I think the people with the cleanest acts of the wildest animals,

436
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.420
it's often the case. Yeah.
