WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 0>Do you have your absolute dream job between, I mean, you do a few things,</v>

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.920
but like you, you get to talk UFC. You're a black belt under Eddie,

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.320
right? Yeah. And so like, you've kind of found the perfect job for yourself.

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.560
It's a great job. Cause you just, I can tell when you talk about,

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:19.920
you just love it so much. Like I love surfing, you know, I just, I live,

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.870
eat and breathe. Sure.

7
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.430
If every day I wake up and the first thing I do is look at where's waves in the

8
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:24.264
world. Where.

9
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.750
<v 1>Do you think when you retire, you'll do commentary.</v>

10
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.590
<v 0>Uh, maybe a little bit. Yeah, maybe a little bit, but I don't want to,</v>

11
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.470
I don't really want a job. &lt;laugh&gt; when I retire, you know, I've been, look,

12
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:38.350
I've been, I've been on pro tour pretty much since I was 19 and 46,

13
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.950
I took about three years off, but I would still compete a little,

14
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.100
little bit those years. What.

15
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.580
<v 1>Are the, what is the high end of the age limit in terms of like,</v>

16
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.700
when I can really compete.

17
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.420
<v 0>Like right now? No, I'm no one's ever been my age on tour. Really? Yeah. No,</v>

18
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.220
I think the next oldest guy on tour is 38 and he's retiring this year. Wow.

19
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.180
When I've got on tour, the oldest guy was 28 years old. Holy. Yeah. It was like,

20
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:03.530
there was a real, you know, I would say in, in the eighties there wasn't like,

21
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.570
it didn't look like you could make some money and if you were the top five guy,

22
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.610
but it didn't look like you could have like this crazy career. So guys,

23
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:13.090
weren't thinking longevity, they're like, let's go have a fricking good time.

24
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.610
Right. Travel around the world and get paid for it for a few years.

25
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:16.810
And then we'll figure out a job after,

26
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.370
or maybe we'll have enough money to kind of live real humbly. What is.

27
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.720
<v 1>The difference between how prepare and other guys is it your diet,</v>

28
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.200
strength and conditioning? Like.

29
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.560
<v 0>What is it? Um, I don't overexert myself very much. So my,</v>

30
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.360
my training aside from surfing, isn't a lot. Um, I retain,

31
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.040
I feel like I retain enough strength to be good at what I need to.

32
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.110
So don't burn yourself out. I don't burn myself out, you know, cuz like I,

33
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.150
the oldest people in the world, world weren't athletes, you know, mm-hmm,

34
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.830
&lt;affirmative&gt;, they're kind of people who didn't burn themselves out too much.

35
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.990
Right. So I, my theory on longevity is like, don't overdo it. I don't know,

36
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.630
need to necessarily be overtrained for what I do. A lot of the skill,

37
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.990
a lot of the, the,

38
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.100
the winning that I do competitively is from a skill it's not so much from being

39
00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:06.500
super strong, having crazy cardio mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

40
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.100
it's making a choice about which wave,

41
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.220
how I'm gonna approach and ride that wave.

42
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:13.580
And I have to get two scores every 30 minutes when I compete. So it's like,

43
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.940
I got this 30 minute window I need to be ready for.

44
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.860
I don't need to be like in crazy, crazy shape. Cuz. So what is it.

45
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.860
<v 1>That held other guys back in the past? I, I.</v>

46
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.850
<v 0>Think there's a number of, I think, um,</v>

47
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.170
you have to naturally be really competitive, like in your,

48
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.730
when you were born in your home, somehow you had to,

49
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.690
maybe you needed something to prove, you know, I, I was kind of like,

50
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.210
you know, growing up, I, I sort of looked back at it and kinda laughed.

51
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.730
Like I maybe I couldn't get the girl.

52
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.770
I liked cuz she liked an older guy or you know, I didn't have,

53
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.000
we didn't really have any money in my family. So I wanted to make some money.

54
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.280
I had an older brother who kind of picked on me,

55
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.240
but I hung out with him and played football with his friends that were all three

56
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:53.160
years older than me. So I had to be strong, you know,

57
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:55.000
I had to be tough and fast. I had to be smart.

58
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.000
<v 1>That's the case with a lot of guys, older brothers. Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:00.640
Older brothers that they couldn't really compete with and like this.

60
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.520
And so every night it would just eat.

61
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.600
<v 0>Away at them. Yeah. I think it, I think it did. And there was always that,</v>

62
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.120
you know, my brother and I have, I,

63
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.480
I think we have a pretty good relationship now and I don't think he would, um,

64
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.440
disagree with me that we kind of didn't get along for 20 years or more &lt;laugh&gt;

65
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.950
we sort of hate each other. That's a long time. Yeah. But you know,

66
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:23.350
from the time we were teenagers, we kind of grew apart. You know, I,

67
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.990
I sort of started doing real well competing on the world stage and he sort of

68
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:32.710
stagnated and we just, you know, people and families have different, uh,

69
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.950
dynamics, you know, each child has a different dynamic,

70
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:37.950
whether the first or the I'm in the middle of three, all boys,

71
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.340
our younger brother was three, six years younger than me.

72
00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:44.300
So he was kind of out of the loop when we're teenagers, he's still a little kid,

73
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.340
so we weren't really competing with him,

74
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.220
but he saw us competing against each other in maybe a few ways.

75
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.060
And it kind of turned him off the surfing.

76
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.620
So he didn't start surfing until he was a teenager. Oh wow. And when he did,

77
00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:02.490
he rode longboards and we all, we're both up borders, like, you know, more, um,

78
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.810
competition kind of guys. And he loved kind of the old throwback,

79
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.250
the sixties and seventies surfers on long boards or on single fins,

80
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:14.410
which is like not a modern board at all. And um, why would someone.

81
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.410
<v 1>Choose one or the other.</v>

82
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.570
<v 0>Long boards or short boards? Yeah, it's a, it's a real different skill. Um,</v>

83
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.880
long boards are kind of easier to just get up and ride a wave, but the,

84
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.920
the skill you have on a long board is more, it's, it's more ballet than it is,

85
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.200
uh, gym or something, you know, it's not like big maneuvers. Mm-hmm,

86
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.000
&lt;affirmative&gt;, it's more like gliding on the wave,

87
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:38.280
looking like you're not trying hard. It's, it's more of a, a dance, if you will,

88
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.110
than it is like a, so them kind of an athletic skill and you know,

89
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.950
short boarding is just, you know,

90
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:49.230
you're going for aerials and lots of different sort of fast maneuvers,

91
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.790
really riding in the pocket of the wave. Whereas long boarding,

92
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.430
you're looking for a different kind of you,

93
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.270
you ride a different kind of wave altogether. You really don't.

94
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.790
Most of the waves we ride for modern short boarding and competition aren't

95
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:02.900
waves. You who would ride on a longboard, cuz they're too hollow.

96
00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:06.740
They're too quick and fast and you can't fit a longboard in the same way.

97
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.450
So your brother.

98
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.100
<v 1>Just kind of took it up more for the fun of it and the.</v>

99
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.820
<v 0>Aesthetic of it. Yeah. He literally was at the beach one day, his story,</v>

100
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.060
he was about 14 or 15 and we always tried to get him to surf.

101
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.780
And when he was about eight or 10, I took him surfing one day at our local, uh,

102
00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:24.490
break at S in Florida. And, and I pushed him on this wave and he,

103
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.890
he ate it and was underwater a long time. It kind of freaked him out,

104
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.530
not a long time. I mean, long time for an eight year old,

105
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:32.410
like maybe 10 seconds or eight seconds, you know, when you're out of breath,

106
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.490
a little freaky, like you don't know which way's up and he kind of quit surfing.

107
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.610
And then when he was like 14 or 15, he's at the beach and this guy, he,

108
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.200
he really respected this kind of older guy, like, Hey,

109
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:45.000
I'm gonna run somewhere where we watch my board.

110
00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.920
He had a long board and he said, you watch my board. And Steven said, oh yeah,

111
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.960
watch it. And the guy said, you can go use it if you want.

112
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.320
He paddled out and caught a few waves.

113
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:56.040
And he just sort of fell in love with that minute with surfing.

114
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.480
And it was something unique for him cuz we didn't long board. So it was like,

115
00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.600
it was that beach life and thing we love, but it was different, you know? Right.

116
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.600
He got his own thing. Yeah. Yeah. And then me and my brother, we, you know,

117
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.080
I got more and more into competition and getting sponsored and stuff and,

118
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.240
and he sort of, he,

119
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.430
he just kind of started fading out of doing a competition full-time and stuff

120
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.350
and, and uh, and uh, then when I was a teenager,

121
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.590
when I was in a ju a freshman in high school, this guy moved into town, uh,

122
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.830
this kid named drew and he had sort of got kicked out of a couple schools

123
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.030
elsewhere and uh, got himself in some trouble.

124
00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.980
And when he came to came over to the B, he was kind of in these inland schools,

125
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.700
but he was good at football, good at baseball.

126
00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:44.900
He was kind of a really good athlete. Uh,

127
00:06:44.901 --> 00:06:48.020
he became the quarterback on our football team. He was a baseball player,

128
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.580
all this kind of stuff. So he was, he was a total jock, not a surfer at all.

129
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.660
And somehow he and I became best buddies. And uh, you know, I liked,

130
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.970
I liked all the sports. I grew up of football, basketball, baseball,

131
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:03.850
little bit of tennis. Um, and, and he and I ultimately,

132
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:08.410
where we got to was he sort of became my big brother competitively and we used

133
00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:11.050
to battle and it didn't matter whose feelings got hurt. You know,

134
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.930
like we competed at absolutely everything from horseshoe to bowling

135
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.200
to pool &lt;laugh&gt; on my birthday every year on my birthday,

136
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.520
we made it a pact to where we'd go play every kind of game we could possibly.

137
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.800
And we keep a tally of who won what it was many. It was putt, butt golf.

138
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.040
It was go-karts, it was basketball. It was shuffle board.

139
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.560
It was like literally everything, air ho you know, everything we could think of.

140
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.000
And uh, we'd just keep a tally. And we,

141
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.990
we used to bet in the millions of dollars, really? Yeah. Well, yeah,

142
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.550
of course we, so, you know,

143
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:46.790
at some point somebody owed somebody hundreds of millions of dollars &lt;laugh&gt; but

144
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:50.630
you never paid. No, of course. I mean, when it came down to like actual money,

145
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:55.310
then it was like five bucks, you know &lt;laugh&gt; and, and at, at one point he,

146
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.683
he was, uh,

147
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.940
he got really into horseshoe and he called me me out one day and he's like,

148
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.980
you meet me at the beach. We're gonna play some horseshoe. I'm like, all right.

149
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.780
I'm like, but I'm not playing you unless we're betting some money,

150
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.340
like some real money. And he's like, all right, bring some money.

151
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.660
And at the end of the day, he ended up owning me about 160 bucks.

152
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.660
&lt;laugh&gt; and he's like, you tell my wife, I owe you. I'll kill you. Now.

153
00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.980
I'll never pay you. &lt;laugh&gt; he's like, I don't have the money.

154
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.500
I can't pay you that. He's like,

155
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.450
so I'll pay you like 20 bucks here and there as we go. But drew used to,

156
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:25.970
he beat me at everything. He was better than me at basically everything.

157
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.410
And so it was like that at ping pong too, on my 18th birthday

158
00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.730
that I like to call it the night of upsets because it was the night that Mike

159
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.650
Tyson lost the bus of Douglas. And it was, it was, uh,

160
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.840
the night of February 10th, my birthday's in the 11th on the 11th,

161
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.600
but they were in Tokyo. So they were on the 11th fighting Tyson,

162
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.160
lost drew shows up in my house with a ping pong table. And he says,

163
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.280
it was like my birthday gift. All my friends bought me this ping pong table.

164
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:57.440
My mom, my three buddies and drew beat me 17 straight games in a row.

165
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.440
And I started crying &lt;laugh&gt; and, uh,

166
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.160
I think he ended up letting me finally win the last game so we could go to bed.

167
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.440
And it was like two in the morning. And man, I've never been I've really,

168
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:11.881
honestly,

169
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:15.470
never been so frustrated and just outright beaten by somebody at anything.

170
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:16.590
And he just owned.

171
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.070
I just knew he owned me and he would just tell me where he's gonna hit the ball

172
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:20.350
on the table and beat me, but.
