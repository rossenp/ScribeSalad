1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.280
<v 0>That's fascinating now, um, another,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.840
I really wanted to talk to you about is something that you brought up, uh,

3
00:00:05.841 --> 00:00:10.400
when you sent the notes to Matt, uh, was, um, censorship and that,

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.960
and, and, and self censorship, which is going on apparently in writer, groups,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.973
and,

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.070
and groups of people that are deciding that certain words eliminated

7
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:23.190
from a vocabulary and from vernacular,

8
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.870
and that you shouldn't discuss certain things anymore.

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.190
These things are it's harming fiction and harming literature that

10
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:32.830
you can't explore the darker ideas.

11
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.630
<v 1>You know? Oh, you wanna see me crucify myself right now?</v>

12
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.460
Yeah. Okay. &lt;laugh&gt; this is kinda the career ending moment

13
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.020
for, uh, for several years, I was in a writer's workshop and,

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.620
uh, the core group of us had been meeting since 1990.

15
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.220
So this is a workshop that was almost 30 years old,

16
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.140
and gradually people

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.290
were asking each other, not to use certain words. Uh,

18
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.690
first, you know, nobody really used the N word,

19
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.410
but it was definitely a word you could not bring to workshop.

20
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.650
And then in a story, I used the word and a very good friend of mine said,

21
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.250
you're not bringing that word into workshop.

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.400
You're not writing anything with the F word. And,

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.480
and it just became more and more tightly stricted that way.

24
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.080
And so eventually I realized we were kind of writing to him,

25
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.880
make each other happy instead of, to kind of confront each other.

26
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.120
And, uh, one of the writers in our workshop is a writer named Cheryl Strait,

27
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.510
who, who had written book called wild, which was a hugely successful book.

28
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:50.510
It was chosen as an Oprah book and it will be on book store shelves for the rest

29
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:54.750
of history, Cheryl's book wild. But while she was writing it,

30
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.070
she had written a segment about how, as a child,

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.660
she would be sat on the sofa with her and father and her

32
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:09.180
grandfather taught her how to him. And so as a child,

33
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.900
she would her grandfather until he achieved orgasm.

34
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.260
And then later she would find these featherless

35
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.770
featherless birds that had fallen out of a nest and she picked

36
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:27.050
one up and she knew it would die.

37
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.490
So she crushed it between her bare hands. This is a very small child.

38
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.370
And she wrote how as that bird died crushed between her

39
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:40.770
hands. It its death rows,

40
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.440
its spasms of death felt exactly like her grandfather's penis

41
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.440
in her little hand. Whoa,

42
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.680
that was the best thing she ever wrote.

43
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.640
And her editor at Koff said that is not going in this book

44
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.160
because we want this book to be a big book.

45
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.360
And if we see you jerking off your grandfather and then killing baby birds,

46
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.440
that is not gonna make Oprah Winfrey happy.

47
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.600
So it was a magnificent piece of writing and a magnificent kind of parallel

48
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.950
awareness for a child to have.

49
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.190
And this juxtaposition of sexual abuse and death was magnificent.

50
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.750
Oh my God, it worked on every level. But the publisher said,

51
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.470
this is not gonna be in the book.

52
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.310
<v 0>Did she send it to you? Or did she show.</v>

53
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.550
<v 1>It to you? She brought it to workshop and she read it.</v>

54
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.110
And there was even a newspaper reporter pre uh,

55
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.740
present her and we all realized it was fantastically powerful,

56
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.980
but then she said, uh, they won't take this, this can't go in.

57
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.420
<v 0>Wow. Did she do anything with it? Did she publish it online or.</v>

58
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.860
<v 1>No? And there were so many parts of that book.</v>

59
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.450
There were so much better than what the, they actually did publish really.

60
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.930
And so it's that kind of censorship where you're trying to reach

61
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.010
a reader standing in line at Starbucks. And this has gotta go in that,

62
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.770
uh, point of purchase stand and it's gotta be a face out.

63
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.600
And I understand for a long time, if you wanted a face out yet, uh, Barnes,

64
00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:24.840
a noble, especially on the discover new writers face out stack,

65
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.280
you could not have the word on the first page because they did not want people

66
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:34.760
picking up that book and opening it and seeing the F word that,

67
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:39.320
that just did not fit their corporate culture. And so, you know,

68
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.870
so much of the censorship is because people really wanna reach the largest

69
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.790
audience, uh, without offending people.

70
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.960
<v 0>But there's giant problems with that. Right? I mean,</v>

71
00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.360
one of the more fascinating things about books is that the story plays out in

72
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:01.194
your mind.

73
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.470
<v 1>It exactly the nature of consumption makes it about the only medium,</v>

74
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.630
which in which you can go to those places.

75
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.190
<v 0>Yeah. Literally you, you couldn't,</v>

76
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.110
there's no way you would be able to find,

77
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.790
to put that in a book, her story about a grandfather and the bird.

78
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.420
Maybe you could put the bird in, but the grandfather part there's no, no way.

79
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.740
<v 1>Yeah. And I, I, I, I feel like I'm telling stories outta school,</v>

80
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.820
but it's such a perfect example of that kind of self censorship. Uh,

81
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.420
and it's also something so magnificent that I feel it should come out.

82
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.770
It should sort of be stated, uh, I don't wanna steal her thunder. I,

83
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.490
I wanted to honor the story, but it's like so many stories that people tell me,

84
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.770
uh, I'm kind of seen as a safe person, you know,

85
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.530
kind of a degraded monster maybe,

86
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.480
but as a degraded monster with no self-esteem whatsoever,

87
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.440
they feel safe telling me these things because in a way they,

88
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:06.920
they probably feel a little morally superior to me. &lt;laugh&gt;.

89
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.160
<v 0>Um, why do you think people would consider you a degraded monster? Because I.</v>

90
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.200
<v 1>Can read a story like guts that is so</v>

91
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.990
completely humiliating because as I read it, it's in the first person.

92
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.510
So people more or less assume that it's my story.

93
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.070
Even though it's story garnered from many different people,

94
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.270
but the fact that I'm presenting,

95
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:33.310
it means that I'm the person that is this losing face.

96
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.340
And afterwards people feel like they can risk losing by telling me their story.

97
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.860
That's very much like, uh, the gut story. So.

98
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.620
<v 0>When someone is writing something that's deeply disturbing like that. When you,</v>

99
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:49.940
when you, when you hit those parts of your mind and you come to this pathway,

100
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.460
do, do you consider, do you say, well,

101
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.100
no one's ever gonna allow this to be in a book. No one's ever.

102
00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.170
Do you consider those thoughts or do you just go through with it

103
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.090
first and then review it or do you not do that at all?

104
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.050
You.

105
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.010
<v 1>Know, I, my formative years with a punk years, the seventies into the eighties,</v>

106
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.410
and we always used to have a saying, people would say, uh,

107
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.970
don't hit the break until you hear a glass break or don't stop until you hear

108
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:18.983
last break.

109
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.680
And so I always think the point of writing is to coach yourself

110
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.560
to that point that you would never have gone voluntarily

111
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.120
and also to coach a reader to a point where the reader would never have gone

112
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:38.080
voluntarily in a story like guts. You know, it's very funny on the front end.

113
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.590
And if you told people on the front end where it was gonna go,

114
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:42.790
they'd never read that story,

115
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.870
but it's very funny and charming and well-paced on the front.

116
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.910
And then once people realize where it's gonna go,

117
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.270
they're already trapped &lt;laugh&gt;. And so in a way, it's,

118
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:55.830
it's a way.

119
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.950
<v 0>You seem to enjoy that though.</v>

120
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.990
You like the way you said they're already trapped,

121
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.580
you seem to take some satisfaction in that.

122
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.780
<v 1>But in writing it,</v>

123
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.380
I'm also sort of springing the trap on myself. Mm.

124
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.380
Starting down a path that I have,

125
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:13.460
no idea is gonna be so humiliating or so, uh,

126
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.860
emotionally upsetting or so dark. Because if, if I did,

127
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.930
I would never go go down that path.

128
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.770
<v 0>When you write a story like that, how much of a do you plan out in advance?</v>

129
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.000
<v 1>I might plan out up to the, the end of the second act, you know,</v>

130
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:38.080
at the moment of greatest crisis, this will happen, you know, in fight club.

131
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.350
The moment of greatest crisis is gonna be when everyone in the support groups

132
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.310
figures out that this guy is lying to them.

133
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.350
And they're all given the choice of either accepting him for his

134
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.070
transgressions or rejecting him, same thing in choke.

135
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.280
There's gonna be that moment in, uh,

136
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.280
when people realize that he has faked choking and that he's made them

137
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.120
into a fake hero and they're gonna either kill him or

138
00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.613
accept him.

139
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:13.680
And so I typically know that the second act is gonna end with a

140
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:16.950
transgresion being revealed. But beyond that,

141
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.750
I don't want to know because I want the story to complete itself with its own

142
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.590
momentum at that point. And if it doesn't surprise me beyond the second act,

143
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.670
then it's not gonna surprise the reader.

144
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:31.870
<v 0>Do you write, do you have like a storyboard laid out and do you,</v>

145
00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:35.300
do you use like index cards or anything to figure out where things are going or

146
00:09:35.301 --> 00:09:36.740
do you just kind of no.

147
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.980
<v 1>No. You know, that's part of the glory is that whenever I get stuck,</v>

148
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.660
I go to the gym and I say, okay,

149
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.860
this I'm working on this scene where this happens and this happens.

150
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.460
And this happens. And my friends will say,

151
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:54.500
they'll always be somebody there with a really fresh take and life experience

152
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.130
who can say, have you thought about this happening?

153
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:03.170
And it will take the story in a direction that is so unexpected because it's

154
00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:06.130
not from my experience and that that's the glory.

155
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.290
And they feel like they've contributed they're, they're so happy. And, uh,

156
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.570
and I'm happy to spend time among people.

157
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:16.360
And I'm happy to have the story complete in a way that I never,

158
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.640
ever could have anticipated.

159
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.600
<v 0>That's fascinating. So you do it at the gym.</v>

160
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.600
<v 1>Yeah. The gym is really great because you're around people and you have these</v>

161
00:10:25.601 --> 00:10:28.400
recoveries between sets. So you have a little time to talk.

162
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.560
And at the same time you have during the exercise itself,

163
00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.800
you have time to think.

164
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.550
And so it paces the talking versus the thinking,

165
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:43.390
and it's also kind of highly oxygenated and it's physically active.

166
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.270
And your mind is kind of, you know, mind is not engaged with something else.

167
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.950
Your mind is kind of disengaged like it is while you're taking a shower. Yeah.

168
00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.870
<v 0>A lot of people like to walk, they like to read, uh, write,</v>

169
00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.660
read a little bit of it and then walk and bring a recorder or their phone to

170
00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:03.540
record on think probably along the same lines. Charles.

171
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:08.260
<v 1>Dickens walked somewhere between 12 and 20 miles a day,</v>

172
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.500
as he wrote whoa. And the, uh, the Lakeland poets walked constantly.

173
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.260
I mean, walking is a big part of writing.

174
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.930
<v 0>Anything physical, right? Like anything you're forcing your body to move,</v>

175
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:19.750
forcing the blood.

176
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.610
<v 1>To flow and, and also mindless mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

177
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:25.250
So it allows your mind to wander. Yeah.
