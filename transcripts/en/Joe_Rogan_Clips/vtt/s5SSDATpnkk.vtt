00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.940
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So what, what are you doing? You run for president?</v>

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.930
Uh, yes. What made you decide to do that?

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.690
Aren't you busy enough clothing company,

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.540
successful rapper family, man.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.890
<v 1>Uh, it was something that God put on my heart back in 2015, uh,</v>

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.150
a few days before the MTV awards, it just, it hit me in the shower.

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.400
And when I first thought of it,

8
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:32.900
I just started like laughing to myself and

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.150
it like all this, like joy came over my, over my body,

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.890
this through, through my soul. And I could just, I just felt that energy,

11
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:46.070
I felt that spirit. So then two days later, I, uh,

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.900
accepted the Michael Jackson video Vanguard awards at the, uh, MTV awards. And,

13
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.440
um, I, instead of performing, you know,

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.220
my array hit songs, you know, I gave,

15
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.000
uh, just my perspective on award shows,

16
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.220
but always I knew at the end I was going to tell people I'm running for office,

17
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.260
I'm running for president in 2020. And, you know, just to have the,

18
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.870
it even took heart to say it in that context.

19
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.230
And people were just like, oh, like their, their minds are blown.

20
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.660
And then I was hanging out with different,

21
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.100
I had different friends that were, you know,

22
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:31.310
some people in the music industry, some people tech, elites,

23
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:34.760
different things like that. And they would, um, really,

24
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.840
you know, they just really took it as a joke.

25
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.160
And they're telling me all these millions of reasons why I couldn't run for

26
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:47.210
president. I remember running into Oprah two days or one day after that.

27
00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:50.030
And she's like, yo, I want to be president. And, you know, people just,

28
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.220
you know, thought projecting putting this on you. And I remember saying,

29
00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.710
uh, one of my responses to one of the people that one of the naysayers was

30
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.750
well, I'll definitely be a billionaire by that time. Uh,

31
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.260
and not that that's a reason why someone should become president,

32
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.670
but it's to say, you know, at that time I was,

33
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.260
uh, 50, around $50 million in debt.

34
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.540
And I knew I had the confidence that I would be able to turn that

35
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:27.350
around. And now, you know,

36
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.410
just going into, I want to just give you a, uh,

37
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.390
that that's a clear answer.

38
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.060
<v 0>I know what you're saying. I don't, I don't want to go off on two of them. No,</v>

39
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:36.860
it's okay. It's yeah, we will. You basically saying,

40
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.840
as you know how to set goals, you know, to achieve them,

41
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.680
but what was Oprah's rationale when she said you don't want to be the president?

42
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:43.514
Like, what was she saying?

43
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.090
Because remember when people were saying that that's our next president,

44
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.350
remember when Trump got elected, you know, they showed Oprah and they were sat.

45
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.580
There was, I believe it was like NBC tweeted it. This is our next president.

46
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.120
Like they, a lot of people wanted Oprah to want to run.

47
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.960
They felt like if Trump could win, Oprah could win.

48
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.750
<v 1>When I saw Trump win, I was like, see, you can win.</v>

49
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.370
I was I'm you can win. If you're coming from outside of politics.

50
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:14.730
I was young when Ronald Reagan was in, was president. I don't remember.

51
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.400
<v 0>Reagan was the governor of California before he was the president.</v>

52
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.590
He'd actually proven himself as a politician.

53
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.170
<v 1>Which is an idea that people have thrown out at me too,</v>

54
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.790
to be governor of California, to be governor of Califia.

55
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.150
<v 0>So anyone's better than this guy. Just do this. Go ahead,</v>

56
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.760
start there. Yeah. In the shot, open things up again, man.

57
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.630
<v 1>But I think, I think my calling is to be, uh, I,</v>

58
00:03:40.631 --> 00:03:45.390
I believe that my calling is to be the leader of the free

59
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:49.890
world. Not, not, I mean, if it's in God's plan,

60
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:53.850
that part of my path is to be the governor, then that's fine.

61
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.290
But my calling is to be the leader.

62
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.520
<v 0>So when you say this,</v>

63
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.510
like when you say your calling is to be the leader of the free world, what,

64
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.650
what does that mean to you? Does that, does it mean,

65
00:04:01.651 --> 00:04:05.400
do you have a plan that's different than the plans that have been implemented

66
00:04:05.401 --> 00:04:08.670
before? Does it mean that you have ideas kind of plan,

67
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.170
like the plan to be the leader?

68
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:13.470
Like what would you do if you were the leader of the fleet of the free world?

69
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.890
Like what would be different about the way you would handle things? Like,

70
00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:20.490
if that's your plan, like, what is it about that, that, that is your calling?

71
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.370
Like why, why would you want to do that? Like,

72
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:26.100
what do you want to do differently if you were the leader of the freeway?

73
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.400
<v 1>Well, um,</v>

74
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.360
well there was a couple of questions in there and you said, why is, you know,

75
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:37.380
why is that your calling there's people who will say to me, you know,

76
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.150
they'll say, well,

77
00:04:39.151 --> 00:04:43.770
music is bigger than politics are more influential than politics or celebrities

78
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.120
are more influential. And, uh, I thought of it,

79
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:52.290
like if I was a pastor of a hundred thousand person church,

80
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.940
but then I was also a, uh, a captain, a sailor,

81
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.140
and then we went to war and I said, I'm gonna man,

82
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:06.000
this ship that has a thousand people, a thousand soldiers on it,

83
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:10.380
because God is calling me to take this

84
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:14.760
position, even though I'm the pastor for,

85
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.370
you know, however big my audience is in hip hop, uh,

86
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:24.690
in a music or as a, just an influencer celebrity, uh,

87
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.670
or just as a dad and a husband and my house,

88
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.550
the world is like,

89
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.730
there couldn't be a better time to put a visionary in the,

90
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.820
in the captain's chair. Um,

91
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.500
and that's not to say we haven't had visionaries B uh,

92
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.480
before I'm not coming here to down any of the other, uh,

93
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.380
I'm not here to down Trump down Biden. Uh,

94
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.180
I'm just here to express why, um,

95
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.650
uh, why God has called me to take this position.

96
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.400
<v 0>Sure. When you say a visionary, you, you think of yourself in terms of like,</v>

97
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.320
as an artist, as a creator, as someone,

98
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.300
someone who has these thoughts that they manifest in terms of music and

99
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:21.090
art creation, design, the things that you do, that's why you,

100
00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:24.140
you think you're different as a, as a visionary.

101
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.840
<v 1>Yeah. I think that, I think I'm different from,</v>

102
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.770
I mean, we're all different, so I'm definitely different from everybody.

103
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:35.510
We're all different from each other. I mean,

104
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:40.340
I do bump into people that seem to be like the same character inside of

105
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.690
it. It's like, I've seen people before. Yeah. People play the same role roles.

106
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.920
Like, Hey, I just met you before.

107
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.170
You're just like the head of this company over here.

108
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.340
And you're the same kind of person. Um, yeah. You know, I mean,

109
00:06:52.341 --> 00:06:55.670
I manifest, I see things, uh,

110
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.380
I'm a great leader because I listen and I'm empathetic and

111
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.240
I feel the entire earth. And I feel us as a,

112
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.100
as a species, as the human race, like I do. Sometimes people think that,

113
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.530
uh, utopia as almost like a negative word that's, that's like,

114
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.670
we couldn't have that, but I do believe in world peace.

115
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.540
Like the people hit me with the, one of the things Oprah said is, she said,

116
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.170
you gotta bone up on your foreign affairs. I remember this like,

117
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.160
cause it's Oprah talking.

118
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.650
So I'm gonna remember a lot of what the conversation was,

119
00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:34.580
but that's the first thing she said was, you know, uh,

120
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.210
foreign affairs and foreign policies. Like just,

121
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.590
I think the reason why I say leader and not politician or not even

122
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:46.700
specifically a president is, uh,

123
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.860
this is the time, you know, when, when the constitution was written,

124
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.600
that was an innovation.

125
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.610
Now the world is innovated all

126
00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.640
around our political system.

127
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.340
