00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Was Michael Landon Aqua man ?</v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.180
<v 1>Patrick Duffy. Patrick Duffy was man from Atlanta, man from Atlanta.</v>

3
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:13.040
I saw the first thing did the first time I ever saw

4
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.960
something being filmed in California.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.790
I had just come out from Ohio. It was 1976,

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.460
and traffic was all blocked off with the Malibu pier and it got out of my eye

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.310
and I saw the lights. It was in the data. It was, it was so long ago.

8
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:33.260
They still had lights for daytime shooting and they were about to do

9
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:35.150
a stunt where Patrick Duffy is,

10
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:38.240
the man from Atlantis was going to jump off the Malibu pier.

11
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.120
And I was so excited. I.

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.460
<v 2>Used to try to swim like him. Cause remember the man.</v>

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.340
<v 3>He was swimmer. So something like apartment. And.</v>

14
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.440
<v 1>My favorite thing was what made him from Atlantis.</v>

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.470
<v 4>Was this part of his body had a web. Yes,</v>

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.170
this is it right here. That was all I had. And couldn't he breathe under water.

17
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.060
He could breathe and water, but this made.

18
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.110
<v 1>That was all they could afford with the special effects of webbing between his</v>

19
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.910
thumb and forefinger. I'm so into Atlanta,

20
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.150
I'm not going to get Lance sky anywhere. Oh yeah. I love it.

21
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.590
I'm trying to figure out where it was. Do you.

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.850
<v 2>Think they found it?</v>

23
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.350
They think they found something that represents exactly what the depictions of

24
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.160
Atlantis were like these, these rings concentric rings.

25
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.020
They think that there's some place, oh God. I want to say like,

26
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.860
I want to say off of Spain of the coast of Spain, isn't.

27
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.430
<v 1>Our guy Graham saying the basic Atlantis was the civil,</v>

28
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.960
the pre-existing civilization. And it was not an island or one place.

29
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:37.160
It was all of it.

30
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.030
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. That's what they think. But you know, it's all speculation,</v>

31
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.420
but whatever it was, you know, there's,

32
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.640
there's so many different versions of that.

33
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.800
So many different versions of this like spectacular sea port civilization that

34
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:56.480
was destroyed in the flood, like, um, the flood of the Bible,

35
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.540
like Noah's Ark, there's also, there's uh,

36
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.180
an ancient story called the epic of Gilgamesh.

37
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.110
And that in that story is a very similar story about a flood.

38
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:08.990
And this is one of the things that Graham Hancock points to that there's all

39
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.400
these civilizations that talk.

40
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.670
<v 1>About. Yeah. They had no, no interaction with each other in theory.</v>

41
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:15.560
And yet they all have the same oral histories.

42
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.390
I did a show with my boys called the low files and it's,

43
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.920
it was basically, um,

44
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.990
it was an excuse for my boys and I to run around in a souped up Raptor around

45
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:31.400
the country and explore urban legends. Oh wow.

46
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.210
And, and it was, it was Anthony Bordain meets Scooby-Doo.

47
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.370
<v 3>Turtle wise. It was a dream come true. That sounds awesome.</v>

48
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.700
It's a dream come true. What, what network was this for? And they.

49
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.140
<v 1>Were great that they let us do it, but it couldn't have been a worse fit. Um,</v>

50
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.960
the, when they put us with ancient aliens for one night,

51
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.270
we blew the roof off the place. Really?

52
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.070
And we got to look for the wood ape. We got to look for Bigfoot.

53
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:00.850
We did Poulter guys. Hello files.

54
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.680
See if you can find the opening credits for, for, for, for the low files.

55
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.600
That's one of my proudest. Yeah. What year is this? Like four years ago.

56
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.360
<v 5>Let's see if they give me some volume on this spooky legends and scary</v>

57
00:03:18.361 --> 00:03:19.194
mysteries.

58
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.490
[inaudible] I didn't see my homage.

59
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.070
<v 1>The very, very end. My homage to Hawaii.</v>

60
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:28.770
Five-O it's a very last 30 seconds of the clip.

61
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.610
You have to see it because I'm sure you remember this great shot from Jack

62
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.710
Lord's credits. [inaudible] is it it's right at the end?

63
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.020
Go from here right here. Right here comes.

64
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.940
<v 4>Do you remember that shot balcony? That</v>

65
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.020
that's hilarious. I know I did. I designed.

66
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.600
<v 1>That whole credit sequence. I got the song. I did the whole,</v>

67
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.870
the whole that's one of my favorite things I've done. Blue oyster cult.

68
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.340
Don't fear the reap at its best.

69
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.600
<v 2>It's a great song. So w w w w what are the subjects you went for Bigfoot?</v>

70
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.460
<v 1>We did big foot twice. We did big foot up in, um, in Northern California in,</v>

71
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:12.540
in Walnut Creek. The fam Patterson Gimlin film was shot.

72
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.120
We did the turns out.

73
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.670
<v 6>The wood ape of.</v>

74
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.660
<v 1>Arkansas.</v>

75
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.210
Oklahoma is the most active place. And that was where we really,

76
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.080
where we had some really radical experiences where I heard stuff.

77
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:31.590
And you heard Matthew? Oh yeah. I heard like lip popping, like,

78
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.530
and the chest beating.

79
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.350
<v 2>Really? What? You really think it was real. I, I heard chest beating. Right.</v>

80
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.270
You know, who made a great Bigfoot movie Bobcat? Goldthwait what? Yup.

81
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.800
He made a great big foot move. Scary Bigfoot movie. What was it called again?

82
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.090
Do you remember him? Willow Creek. Willow Creek? Yeah.

83
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.600
<v 1>Yeah. Did you remember, um, ever seen, um, I'm a mum. I'm a mum. Okay.</v>

84
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.990
What is this?

85
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.820
<v 2>He did it like a Blair witch style.</v>

86
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.080
<v 1>I'm writing that down. I love that. It's good, man. We had,</v>

87
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.120
we had a great time and then it's all the,

88
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.820
with all these guys who are like real legit people,

89
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:08.730
they're like regular people and they spend their time out in the woods and

90
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:13.170
they've know how many are out there. And it's, it was crazy.

91
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.890
Matthew,

92
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.820
my youngest sons to the thermal imaging som hiding by like doing the thing with

93
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.390
the high by the tree. I don't know. I mean, here's a thing.

94
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.910
Like I like the slogan for the low files was it's more fun to believe.

95
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.620
<v 3>It definitely is more fun to believe. And that's.</v>

96
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.650
<v 1>Really where I come down on it. It's like I don't have a dog in the fight,</v>

97
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.360
but it's way more fun.

98
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.730
<v 2>For sure. Way more fun. I want it to be, I want Bigfoot to be real.</v>

99
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.950
I've always wanted it to be real mom.

100
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.570
The problem is the people looking at it also want it to be real. I, yes,

101
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.350
they're, they're trying so hard. Th they see shadows.

102
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:52.140
They think that our big foot, there's some interesting things.

103
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.020
There's some interesting things in terms of like dermal ridges,

104
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.010
they've found on footprints and.

105
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.673
<v 1>There's there,</v>

106
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.060
there's a lot of hair samples and that come back and they don't know where that,

107
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.894
what they got 'em from.

108
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.070
<v 2>Really, really? Yeah. I looked into that. Tell me how it did.</v>

109
00:06:06.071 --> 00:06:07.750
I did a show called Joe Rogan questions,

110
00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:11.860
everything for Spotify and me and my buddy Duncan went up to the Pacific

111
00:06:11.861 --> 00:06:13.570
Northwest and we did,

112
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.190
we brought stuff to real biologists and we actually had samples analyzed.

113
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.220
They're all bare. And, and then when,

114
00:06:21.221 --> 00:06:24.820
when they say that there's some human or primate primate DNA,

115
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.290
it's always contaminated. It's like the,

116
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:32.170
the chain of custody between the actual piece of hair and getting it to the lab

117
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.960
is always contaminated, right? Yeah. There's no one just stops.

118
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.840
<v 1>It's next to their granola bars and their backpacks. And they're taking out.</v>

119
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.650
<v 2>If you touch something and you get your sweat on and it can show up as human DNA</v>

120
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.850
or animal DNA mixed with human DNA. It's the,

121
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.680
the problem is the people that are into it. The real,

122
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.220
the real problem is they want to believe so bad that they,

123
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.520
they just have this crazy confirmation bias. And they, they,

124
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.170
they only look at the good things.

125
00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.530
<v 1>Are FA my favorite episodes of the low files are the ones where we didn't find.</v>

126
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.200
They were my favorite. Cause that's fun.

127
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.100
Cause it's just a dad and two idiot kids, you know, having a blast.

128
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.030
<v 2>The thing about Bigfoot that's interesting is native Americans had more than a</v>

129
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:13.810
hundred different names for that animal and they don't have names for other

130
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.510
mythical creatures. And then on top of that,

131
00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.120
there was an actual animal called the gigantic Gus.

132
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.770
And it was a huge ape ape-like creature that stood on two legs and

133
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.780
walked up. Right. And it was probably some sort of looked like Orangutang like,

134
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.800
it probably looked exactly like what we think of as big foot. It was an actual,

135
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:34.870
real animal. Have you ever seen the images of that?

136
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:36.281
<v 1>It's funny.</v>

137
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:40.930
There's the deep connection between native Americans and that legend is really,

138
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:44.430
really profound. Like I've had in, in the,

139
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:48.070
in one of the episodes that we did. We, we talk with with the,

140
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.010
some of the elders and they will say, no,

141
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.850
I one reached through the window and touched my chest. And like, it's like,

142
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.060
you're like, this guy is not crazy. This is not a crime.

143
00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.350
I'm not talking to a crazy person.

144
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.190
<v 2>Right. But they also have payoti well, that's true. Americans have other.</v>

145
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.610
That's true. I would let you see Bigfoot. Maybe that's, that's the thing.

146
00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:09.490
Like you only see big Bigfoot's real, but he's interdimensional.

147
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:11.980
You only see him when you're on drugs. That could happen.

148
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.880
That that absolutely could be real. Like if you get on the right psychedelics,

149
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:16.300
you'll meet him.
