00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:07.680
That the stories are horrible of them leaving. You know, that it's.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.680
<v 1>Just night. Like</v>

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.633

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.160
I chin

6
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.070
what's.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.903
<v 0>Peter pan.</v>

8
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.630
Oh, I didn't know that one. So what did he say? No,

9
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.470
we're talking about the different Exodus that you talk about. Like the,

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
the pain that all the races had, the Chinese and all that,

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.660
but one of the big struggles is that Cuban one that they,

12
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.980
they leave and like he left the son in Cuba. Ah, you know,

13
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:53.780
his parents are in Cuba, you know, but then again, I mean,

14
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:58.340
that's the story of the immigrant. Your grandfather left his brother in Cuba.

15
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.130
Yeah. And, uh, Sicily, you know, to make a, to send checks to, yeah.

16
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.210
That's their plan, you know, you're gonna go to, you're gonna go there.

17
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.250
Send us checks until SU for Melia in

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.770
his family lives. Well in Cuba because of his success, you know, I'm.

19
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.210
<v 2>So you can send money back to Cuba.</v>

20
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.920
<v 0>To, if you send $10, they give you eight.</v>

21
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.440
<v 1>O uh.</v>

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.600
<v 0>If you send a hundred dollars. Yeah. [inaudible] they'll give them $80. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.080
<v 2>So they take a.</v>

24
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.960
<v 0>Little piece. He met Fidel, by the way.</v>

25
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.320
<v 2>Really? You met Fidel.</v>

26
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.390
<v 0>The way you're sitting next. Wow.</v>

27
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.950
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; Was that weird?</v>

28
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.290
<v 0>No.</v>

29
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.270
<v 1>You know, um.</v>

30
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.660
<v 0>He's had two heroes in his life. God and his father.</v>

31
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.340
<v 1>When.</v>

32
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.130
<v 0>He see is a human being, he sees a human being. He treats him like.</v>

33
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.963
<v 1>A human being.</v>

34
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.730
<v 0>God gives talent to people like Matt brown said, they're very talented.</v>

35
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.570
He celebrates the talent of the human being, the human spirit.

36
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.600
But he sees a, everybody like a human being, you know?

37
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.880
<v 2>So you just saw Fidel as a human being.</v>

38
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.653
<v 0>He was the president.</v>

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.390
We don't know what grandpa Rogan did. I don't know what grandpa Rogan.

<v 1>Many people yo lose the life.</v>

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.020
<v 1>Know, they.</v>

73
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.050
<v 0>And he was lucky that he didn't have to do that raft, right.</v>

74
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.040
To go like the picture from the Yankees that had to go to the making Republic.

75
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.120
They had to SMU 'em out. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to some Columbia, Columbia,

76
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.840
and the Yankees had to sign them.

77
00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.080
And that's the only way Tyre showed up with an envelope.

78
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.400
And then nobody knows nothing.

79
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.640
He's happy that he went to Germany and he had a plan, you know?

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.740
<v 0>He sees something, not normal.</v>

90
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.900
A guy and a couple walked in to Walmart.

91
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.060
They were arguing.

92
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.330
<v 1>He's.</v>

93
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:05.210
<v 0>Putting this in his trunk. He hears the Cuban accent.</v>

94
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.970
They had some problem.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.940
<v 1>No, no, no, no, come, no.</v>

110
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.740
