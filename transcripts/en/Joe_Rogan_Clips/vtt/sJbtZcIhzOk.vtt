00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.320
I saw that conversation with that dude about the svix mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I

3
00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.560
think he said it was like 9,000 BC or something. Well.

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.520
<v 1>This is Graham Hancock. Yeah. And, um, or Robert shock, Robert shock.</v>

5
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:16.520
Who's a geologist at Boston university is actually taken, uh,

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.030
the time to examine the erosion around the outside of the fixky.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.550
The fix itself has been worked on a lot. There's been a lot of, uh,

8
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.670
rehabilitation of the pause. They've sort of rebuilt it,

9
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.390
which is kind of a shame, but it's, it's made out of a, sort of a soft stone.

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.510
Yeah. And it's eroding and falling apart.

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.910
And when they found the fix,

12
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:42.660
like when Napoleon found the fix, it was, it was buried underst sand.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.860
So this is the thing that had been buried. And,

14
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.380
and reexposedd like many times they think throughout history and what Robert

15
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.260
shock had found in discovering this, the, uh,

16
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:56.940
temple where this fix was carved. And the,

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.810
the area that surrounds this fix was this deep fisures in the walls that at

18
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.730
were indicative of thousands of years of rainfall.

19
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.490
The problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile valley was

20
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.050
9,000 BC. Right. Right, right. So they're dealing with like, and, and,

21
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:18.370
and you have to go back thousands of, or 9,000 years ago, it might be 7,000 BC,

22
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.760
but you have to deal with thousands of years of rainfall prior or to that,

23
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.620
to create this.

24
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.240
So that means that this was something that was clearly carved by man has

25
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.240
thousands of years of rainfall that eroded it.

26
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.480
And you're dealing with a time period where the last time they had this rainfall

27
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.920
in this area was thousands of years before they think people

28
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.430
were even capable building things like this. Maybe it.

29
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.750
<v 0>Was a lizard. People, you go do David Icho bro. Do you know? You know,</v>

30
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.990
that theory about, uh, the super intelligent dinosaurs that fled underground?

31
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.083
Oh God.

32
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.870
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; no, but it's funny. Like there's so many wacky theories. It's funny.</v>

33
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:57.910
Like what I'll roll my eyes at. Isn't.

34
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.110
<v 0>It even slightly, even tiny,</v>

35
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:05.060
tiny bit more likely that humans came from a planet and after they destroyed it

36
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.420
and then receded and we lost our way of life.

37
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.780
<v 1>Yeah. It's possible. Look, if we're gonna go to Mars, like,</v>

38
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.260
what is the origin tale gonna look like a hundred thousand years from now?

39
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:16.140
Once we go to Mars.

40
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.260
<v 0>Let's take the, the, the, the climate change, you know,</v>

41
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:22.820
global warming stuff to its logical conclusion of rising tides in a greenhouse

42
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:25.690
runaway, greenhouse of fact. Right? So we, we built one ship.

43
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.370
Elon Musk builds one ship with a very small crew of, you know,

44
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:31.370
how many people are gonna be on that. Do you know on his, my.

45
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.970
<v 1>I donion. I D gotta have some chicks though. Yeah. I think I read,</v>

46
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:37.330
gotta repopulate the earth. Right? So it's gotta be men and women,

47
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.650
and the people are gonna have to be, boy,

48
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.010
heterosexuality's gonna be favored because you're,

49
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.040
you can't have gay people that aren't gonna breed on a, you know,

50
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:51.840
you have two lesbians, like, oh, we need to have it only populated by lesbians.

51
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.240
Well, there's no more. Do you have, do you guys have buckets of sperm and a,

52
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.113
a Turkey based here?

53
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.200
Because how else are you gonna make people when you're over there?

54
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.080
<v 0>I was reading that they're gonna go with people.</v>

55
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.520
<v 1>Who are already coupled, ah, and they're gonna, you know,</v>

56
00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:05.160
with like 10 couples or whatever, I don't know about Elon Musk specifically,

57
00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:07.400
but that was like our wife swapping going on in space.

58
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.600
<v 0>They did talk about that too. I was reading like the,</v>

59
00:03:09.601 --> 00:03:13.760
the most optimal theory for colonizing Mars would be like polyamorous people,

60
00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:18.240
something like 10 people already, coupled, not that they're polyamorous,

61
00:03:18.241 --> 00:03:20.670
but spec there's gonna be, com-mingling eventually.

62
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.110
<v 1>Expect commingling. Oh, so it's burning man and space. But, but,</v>

63
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.670
but check it out.

64
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.630
<v 0>Let's say, let's say we sent a, a Mars expedition, you know, uh, 10 families.</v>

65
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.430
We've got, you know, two of each, they start having kids. They,

66
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:32.350
we send cargo there. We,

67
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.470
they start building and then earth wipes itself up runaway greenhouse.

68
00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:38.710
We can't get a control things, nuclear war, whatever. Right?

69
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.980
The planet becomes a, a desolate wasteland.

70
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:44.860
There's no more communication to those who are on Mars. So the last remaining,

71
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.020
you know, a hundred or so people who are now on Mars,

72
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.220
the adults who remember earth write down a book, here's everyth. That happened.

73
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.620
Here's what you should and shouldn't do. Mm here's how we lived.

74
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.100
And they give to their kids. Now, their kids never experienced earth.

75
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:57.500
They know nothing about it. In fact,

76
00:03:57.501 --> 00:04:00.490
those kids only have a fleeting image of the 10 technology that they once had.

77
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.450
Now got two more generations down. The old tech where we use to colonize.

78
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:06.770
Mars is now decaying and falling apart. They have no idea to fix it.

79
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.930
The original colonists are dead. Go down three more generations.

80
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.890
Now you've got a few thousand humans start moving off, looking for resources.

81
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.490
And no one has any idea. Earth even was a real thing.

82
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:18.930
Other than the stories they heard about the military leader in the, in the,

83
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:21.400
in the orbitals orbitals bay station, who long since died.

84
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.080
So now they have this book.

85
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:25.480
They don't fully understand their language is now changing.

86
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.920
As they separate from each other and find different areas of the planet now,

87
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:31.640
English or whatever language they were speaking becomes 10 different languages.

88
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.920
Now they're translating the book. Now it's a thousand years later,

89
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:36.000
they don't even know earth existed.

90
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.960
And they have this weird book about the way things used to be.

91
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.150
And now of the billions of, you know, now we're 10,000,

92
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:46.070
20,000 years in the future. And they find, you know, these old ancient relics.

93
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:46.990
And they're like, I wonder what if.

94
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.590
<v 1>You don't even smoke pot, do you? No, man, I don't smoke pot.</v>

95
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:52.710
Imagine if you did, &lt;laugh&gt; imagine you did.

96
00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:55.590
You'd have so many more of these theories, but that's a good one.

97
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.110
That's a good theory. But I that's.

98
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.310
<v 0>To me, that's the logical conclusion.</v>

99
00:04:58.311 --> 00:05:00.310
That's why I like the story of like humans came from Venus,

100
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.660
not saying it's true. You.

101
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.340
<v 1>Know, that there's a, there's a, a,</v>

102
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:08.700
there's a group of people from Africa that actually the,

103
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.660
the Dogan, the dojon people, is that what it is, Dogon people.

104
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.380
And they, they talk about, uh,

105
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.380
the very specific area of Mars where human being

106
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.850
came from. And they have a,

107
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.930
a really weird understanding of cosmology. Like they,

108
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.210
they know some things that they're like, Hmm, where'd you, where what,

109
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.931
and their,

110
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.530
their origin story is that people were living on Mars and that they destroyed

111
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.650
Mars and had to escape Mars and come to earth. There you go. So it's sort of a,

112
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.440
a very similar version of it.

113
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.400
And now when you add that to what they know about Mars,

114
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.120
that Mars used to be like a, a hospitable place to,

115
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.760
to large maybe.

116
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.240
<v 0>Water. Yeah. Well, think about it this way too.</v>

117
00:05:53.241 --> 00:05:56.800
Let's say that we had an orbital space station over the new planet where

118
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.680
terraforminging mm. What kind of a government would exist?

119
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.280
Let's say earth is wiped out, right?

120
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.200
The only survivors on an oral space station,

121
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.240
over Mars with a small co in the base, it's gonna be a military dictatorship,

122
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.920
not intentionally, not from this evil perspective,

123
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.320
but from a you're the general you're second command.

124
00:06:15.321 --> 00:06:18.030
We've always operated this way. It's a military mission, right. You know,

125
00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:19.110
the person who's in charge is in charge.

126
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.950
And then eventually you build up the colony to a certain point where second in

127
00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:25.830
second in command, or one of the favorite lieutenants says,

128
00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:29.270
it's time to enact democracy. And the general says, no.

129
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.950
And then a civil war breaks out in the heavens people on the ground,

130
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.350
watching the, the ships shoot at each other and blow each other up.

131
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.630
And then all the technology gets wiped out.

132
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.100
<v 1>You should really start smoking pot. Nah.</v>

133
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.740
<v 0>No, you know what I want, you know what, but there's a,</v>

134
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:45.060
there's a lot of ways to interpret like, uh, various ancient, spiritual,

135
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.060
religious texts in a science fictiony kind of way. So I actually,

136
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.900
you know, talked to my friends about this and we like kind of, what if,

137
00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:54.540
what if the Bible and, and, you know,

138
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:57.140
the old Testament were viewed from a science fiction perspective,

139
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.470
not to be disrespectful.

140
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.450
I'm not trying to disrespect anyone's religion or anything like that. But like,

141
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.490
what if we tried to apply a lens of,

142
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.930
from a futuristic perspective of our understanding of technology to how they may

143
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:09.250
have viewed what was going on back then? Mm. So,

144
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:12.290
so you know what the cargo cults are. Yes. For those that don't, it's, you know,

145
00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:14.970
these natives on these islands saw planes didn know what they were.

146
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:18.800
So they built EFS of the planes, like I guess, hoping they'd or whatever. Right.

147
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.640
So when I saw that, I wondered, you know, a lot of people ask that question.

148
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:24.480
What if we did the same thing with aliens?

149
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.000
And the other question is what would we do if we destroyed our own planet?

150
00:07:28.001 --> 00:07:30.720
Like people say we are, and how would that, how would that, you know,

151
00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:32.640
result in a government? How would that result in stories?

152
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.800
<v 1>It would be so funny if we destroy this planet,</v>

153
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.800
we'd go to Mars and repopulate Mars and fix it up.

154
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.830
And then away that place back, back to earth after we're done, cuz like,

155
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.110
look at what's going on right now during this pandemic,

156
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.510
the skies are clear than ever before the Venice canals in Italy have dolphins

157
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:51.110
in. Now you could see the ground jellyfish. You realize how disgusting we are.

158
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:54.550
Yeah. And how we're we're gross. Like what we've done to Los Angeles is amazing.

159
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.580
And in just a month and a half, the air is pristine. Still clear.

160
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.340
You could see forever. It's a different world.

161
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.340
Now imagine if that's what happens. If we go to Mars, we that place up,

162
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:08.500
come back to earth, look, it's fixed. We're back.

163
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.060
<v 0>You know, I guess if we can sustain our technology.</v>

164
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.500
<v 1>Yeah. Did you find that Dogon tribe find that? Yeah, but it's it actually said,</v>

165
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.420
it's talking about sir Siri, right? Not a Mar,

166
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.970
but didn't they have something about Mars as well. I,

167
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.850
I typed literally that and Mars and that just took me to serious stuff instead

168
00:08:25.851 --> 00:08:30.650
of Mars serious. Yeah. The, the star, the star serious, but they,

169
00:08:30.651 --> 00:08:34.330
they understand they have a pull, pull up a, a story out on it. If you can.

170
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:37.290
It's a, it's a weird thing in terms of like the cosmology,

171
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.570
like what they understand. And this is, you know,

172
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.480
relatively primitive tribe that has this, uh, origin story.

173
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.000
<v 0>Well, it's like the end of, uh, battle star. Isn't.</v>

174
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.820
<v 1>Very good at all.</v>

175
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.560
<v 0>Oh the end of Battlestar galaecica they, they find earth.</v>

176
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.440
<v 1>The new battle star gala galaica is so good. Isn't it? Yeah.</v>

177
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:55.960
It's one of the most more recent raid. Yeah. The, the more recent one,

178
00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.520
one of the most underrated science fiction series ever, it was.

179
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.440
<v 0>So good. Well, not, not to act like my ideas are original. The,</v>

180
00:09:02.441 --> 00:09:06.040
the series ends with them discovering a habitable planet. Yes. With, with, uh,

181
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.600
uh, um, what are they, spoiler alert, spoiler alert with a, um,

182
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.960
a species that's compatible with them. Yes. They find primitive humans.

183
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.430
And so if that story, you know, that's an interesting story. Yes.

184
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:22.630
We would lose all knowledge of the previous planets and technology. And well.

185
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:26.910
<v 1>Imagine if we flew to another planet for the first time we landed there and it's</v>

186
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:29.030
like 1940s America, &lt;laugh&gt;.

187
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.350
<v 0>They're like, whoa.</v>

188
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:33.510
<v 1>Or maybe do if we could, we could them. You know, they'd,</v>

189
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:35.260
be'd so impressed with you. Well.

190
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:35.461
<v 0>What if,</v>

191
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:38.300
what if we find a spaceship underground with ancient tech and we don't know what

192
00:09:38.301 --> 00:09:38.900
it is and it turns.

193
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.140
<v 1>Out it's ours, the Dogon tribe,</v>

194
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.060
the NoMo and their fascinating cosmic knowledge deep in Northwest Africa,

195
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.220
more precisely in Mai, we find one of the oldest,

196
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.300
most fascinating ancient cultures to develop on earth. Um,

197
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.330
so the ancient Dogon tribe is known for the religious traditions, ritual dances,

198
00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:00.610
their massive ritual masks, their wooden sculptures and their architecture.

199
00:10:00.611 --> 00:10:01.160
However,

200
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.770
they're also known for their incredible astronomical knowledge and their

201
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:07.050
fascinating mythological accounts.

202
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.090
The Dogan have a compelling ancient tradition.

203
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.370
They mention myths and legends that go thousands of years into the past

204
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.000
predating, possibly even their own history. Some authors like Robert shock.

205
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:20.720
Who's also the guy from Boston university. Um,

206
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.760
he's the geologist that talked about the Springs argue that the Dogon were

207
00:10:23.761 --> 00:10:24.960
people who originated in Africa,

208
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.840
but who had been forced to leave ancient Egypt due to their religious

209
00:10:28.841 --> 00:10:30.800
persecutions. Uh,

210
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.840
it is in his opinion that the Dogon may preserve ancient Egyptian

211
00:10:35.841 --> 00:10:40.590
traditions, myths that may even have been carried into the present age,

212
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.870
claiming that the Dogon have a powerful cosmic connection I can go on for this

213
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:49.070
will take too long to read. Yeah. Cause I'm just gonna just blah, blah.

214
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.990
<v 0>Blah. So what does that coincidence ancient knowledge. Well.</v>

215
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:55.950
<v 1>It's just, they understand the, the cosmos and you could,</v>

216
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.900
you'd have to go to the story, but it's a, it's a weird story.

217
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.420
It's a weird like, oh, how do they know this? Like what, what a weird origin.

218
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.180
<v 0>Story, but you've seen zegeist the original. Yes. Yes. Where, where, you know,</v>

219
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:06.500
in the first,

220
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.900
I mean he talks about the three Kings of Aions belt pointing to the star in the

221
00:11:09.901 --> 00:11:12.500
east mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to where the sun rises and the third day. Yeah, yeah.

222
00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:15.540
Maybe, maybe their stories are just, just that, you know, we, what,

223
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.170
what could we do, but stare at the sky and that's.

224
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.970
<v 1>A good point. Yeah. Yeah. When you stop and look,</v>

225
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.730
if you were traveling across the country, as you were,

226
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.570
did you get a chance to stop and look in the middle of nowhere at the,

227
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.410
at the sky? Of course. amazing. Yeah. Isn't it ridiculous?

228
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.290
Isn't it gross that were robbed of that.

229
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.370
<v 0>Yeah. And it wasn't, it, there, there was a story that I think in Los Angeles,</v>

230
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.291
the power went out,

231
00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:38.280
this black out in the nineties and the police got tons of calls from P people

232
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.120
who didn't know what they were seeing in the sky. It was the Milky way. Galaxy.

233
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.040
Those.

234
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.520
<v 1>Are the same people that are injectinglysol right now. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

235
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.440
<v 0>They aren't though. I know, you know?</v>

236
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.840
<v 1>Oh, somebody might, there's probably a few.</v>

237
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.120
<v 0>Yeah. Well, you know, if you're going to.</v>

238
00:11:58.830 --> 00:11:58.950
<v 2>I.</v>
