00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 1>Experience, now that it has a difference. And then, you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.420
if you want to go further and talk about the ghosts that show up definitely goes

4
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.220
to Denver, show you the picture of my ghost.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.260
<v 0>You have a picture of a ghost.</v>

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.780
<v 1>Didn't I show you that. Did I ever show you that Jamie?</v>

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.250
<v 0>No. You have a ghost. I have a ghost. Where are your house?</v>

8
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.930
<v 1>I apologize if I'm repeating myself.</v>

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.910
<v 0>I don't know if you are. I don't remember this, but.</v>

10
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.720
<v 1>I got one of those nest cameras. Oh.</v>

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.490
<v 0>The nest cameras captured a ghost.</v>

12
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.460
<v 1>Yeah. And I was at the comedy, works in Denver.</v>

13
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.200
<v 0>And it goes, comes with you, Jennifer.</v>

14
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.410
<v 1>He opens for me, you know, you want an opener that you can trust.</v>

15
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.910
And I got an alert on my email the first time. Like if you,

16
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.770
if it senses movement, it alerts you. And I open it up and there's my dog,

17
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.810
Bella, just in the thing. I'm like, this is so cool. I'm just like, I mean,

18
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm in Denver and I'm looking at my office and I thought,

19
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.040
wouldn't that be a cool beginning of a horror movie.

20
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.570
If you get an alert on your phone and back at home,

21
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:11.220
there's a guy to staring in the camera. Right?

22
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.460
That's a good premise for a movie. So then I,

23
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.330
as I'm saying that to my opening act who wasn't a ghost,

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.360
I get another alert and then this comes up.

25
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.940
Oh yeah. You can see it up there.

26
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.580
<v 0>Do I, do you have a picture of crystal Lee on your wall?</v>

27
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.530
He's obsessed with crystal. Leah. We just found out, look at that, bro.

28
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.900
That's Deleah Chris, keep away from Tom something.

29
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:40.734
You might not know.

30
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.810
<v 1>Love to Leah, but that's George Carlin.</v>

31
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.550
<v 0>That's a man with a wrench.</v>

32
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.250
<v 1>Yeah. Or a man in a trench coat with an Uzi. This is 10 o'clock at night.</v>

33
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.450
The only people home or my wife and my daughter. This is on the second floor.

34
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.890
There is no shadow coming in the thing. It's a ghost.

35
00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.790
That's.

36
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.810
<v 0>A legitimate, that's.</v>

37
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.530
<v 1>A person. That's not a person for sure. My wife was the only one in the house.</v>

38
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.263
Hmm.

39
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.050
<v 0>And you think that was a gun? His hand could be a clipboard.</v>

40
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.150
Maybe he's just a really annoying surveyor from the dead.

41
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.460
He's just like a few moments of your time. This report.

42
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.920
<v 1>Was it moving or something? No,</v>

43
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.840
but I have a video of another thing in the same office. So.

44
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.870
<v 0>I could show you, this.</v>

45
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.703
<v 1>Is weird.</v>

46
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.573
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.590
It looks way different in this picture when it's small than it does when it's

48
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:35.190
large. W which is scarier. When it's large, it looks more like a person.

49
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:39.030
Can you make it even bigger? Jamie, can you make his image larger? Hmm.

50
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.930
<v 1>I have a ghost in my house. And then we hear things like.</v>

51
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.490
<v 0>Yeah, see, it does seem, it seems like, you know, the light is behind him,</v>

52
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.090
right? Like, yeah. He like you, the outside right.

53
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.970
Edge of it is sort of highlighted. Like there's a light behind him.

54
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.440
It doesn't look very gun though. It is weird. I mean, it could a gun.

55
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.660
<v 1>And then I got this video. It could.</v>

56
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.410
<v 0>Be a saws all over here. Ready to say.</v>

57
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.980
<v 1>Looking for bread. He's got to fix her big. Britain's got.</v>

58
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.870
<v 0>Electric cerated. Chef's nice, man. Chop up some bread, bro.</v>

59
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.130
So have you ever had an experience that you could say you think is

60
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.690
probably a ghost car?

61
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.100
<v 1>Everybody in the house has had a little something. Is your house old?</v>

62
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.740
It's not old, but like Poltergeist.

63
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.410
<v 0>Right? It's all over in Indian burial ground. You.</v>

64
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.160
<v 1>Never know. You never know what. Look at this video.</v>

65
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:38.560
In the same office from the nest.

66
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.410
<v 0>You got a video. Let me see what's going on.</v>

67
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.063
What am I looking at?

68
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.700
<v 1>Yeah. Did the thing move? No. Can you press play again? Okay.</v>

69
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.350
Same camera. What's that? So bug.

70
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.290
<v 0>Bro, it's a bug. A hundred percent. That's.</v>

71
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.123
<v 1>A bug.</v>

72
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.550
<v 0>It's a bug because it's a bug. It's moving in front of the camera.</v>

73
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.690
It flies around doing loop de loops. That's a bug. It's probably a moth.

74
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.640
Oh my God. You're a little fruitcake. I'm not afraid.

75
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.400
<v 1>That is not, that's not bug. You're a crazy person. Look how it's sailing.</v>

76
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.200
<v 0>Is that what they call is a fruitcake crew cake is not, that's a gay person.</v>

77
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:23.320
That's a gay person, but you can call someone a fruitcake of their nuts too.

78
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:24.154
Right? Isn't it.

79
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.200
<v 1>Nuttier than a fruitcake. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. What kind of that look how that go.</v>

80
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:30.700
That's no bug. Look at that.

81
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.970
<v 0>It's a hundred percent of bug you're out of your mind. That's a bug.</v>

82
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.930
Do you want to see?

83
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.763
<v 1>I would bet.</v>

84
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.843
<v 0>Drop it to me real quick.</v>

85
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.953
<v 1>All right. Airdrop.</v>

86
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.760
<v 0>To you. I would be all in the that's a bug. All right. That's not a ghost.</v>

87
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.100
It's Tinkerbell. That's what it is. Your house is invaded by fairies.

88
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.580
<v 1>But that goes to my, I believe in ghosts. Really?</v>

89
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.550
And yeah, I do. And then, uh, my wife. Yeah,

90
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:03.370
we've all had little things go on in the house. Kind of a little thing.

91
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:06.250
My wife thought someone was standing right behind her. She's doing the laundry.

92
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.130
She thought it was. My daughter turned in. There's no, there was a bug.

93
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.120
<v 0>So. Thanks Jamie. Let's watch this. What's watch us.</v>

94
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:17.980
Everyone at home can laugh and crazy. Tom. Papa is here we go.

95
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.570
Well, if you first the bug.

96
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.300
<v 1>Oh look. Oh yeah. A flat paper. She's a paper.</v>

97
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.940
All bugs. Look like a fortune cookie.

98
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.370
<v 0>It's a bug. Listen to me. There was,</v>

99
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.340
there's a thing that I got sucked into this. Stop.

100
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.510
<v 1>Any bug that's.</v>

101
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.380
<v 0>On video artifact. This because it's moving very fast in front of the screen.</v>

102
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.460
There's a precedent to this low resolution camera. That's in front of your desk.

103
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.160
This is a security camera, low resolution.

104
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.930
Doesn't take a lot of frames per second.

105
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.470
The reason why it's so elongated is because it's passing by this camera.

106
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.850
And the thing is taking multiple exposures while, while it moves through.

107
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.400
There's a thing called, um, is that George Carlin behind your desk?

108
00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:59.250
Is that what it is? That's the.

109
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.550
<v 1>That's the crystal, Leah. It moved.</v>

110
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.040
<v 0>To the other side. George Carlin. Is that who it actually is?</v>

111
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.940
It's George Carlin. That's pretty cool. You got that of your desk. Yeah. Um,

112
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.340
the there's a thing called Roswell rods. See how it looks all long like that.

113
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.800
And Roswell rods.

114
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.750
There was this guy that me and Eddie Bravo back in the

115
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.840
smoke too much weed every day days. Uh,

116
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.550
we were convinced that there were these things that were

117
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:30.860
moving too fast for the human eye to see.

118
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.210
And there there's gelatinous jellyfish, like creatures,

119
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.270
they're shaped like a tube. That's how these ideas see how they look,

120
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.890
see those things. Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.030
<v 1>Where'd you get the idea.</v>

122
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.780
<v 0>You'd see, seen a video. See that one, that black and white one where it shows,</v>

123
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.500
right, right above your cursor, Jamie to the right, right there.

124
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.530
Click on that one. Yeah.

125
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.450
That sort of iconic image of the Roswell rod had me convinced

126
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:55.370
like, oh my God, there's these things in the sky.

127
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.890
And the only way you can capture them was with video cameras.

128
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.790
So it set these video cameras up and they would get these things on video.

129
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.570
And this guy made this documentary. I think a couple of documentaries.

130
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.290
I think if you go to Roswell rods.com a whole website dedicated to it,

131
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.530
it is nothing but a video artifact.

132
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.530
Once there's a show called, um,

133
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.420
one of those monster shows one of those history channel shows or discovery

134
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:23.270
channel shows he, uh, and they solved the mystery.

135
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.250
They set up two cameras in front of this fireplace or found this, um,

136
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.030
campfire. Yeah. One of them was at a campfire. No,

137
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.790
I think it was actually a lantern. What, whatever it was,

138
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.230
they set up these two cameras.

139
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.800
One of them was standard resolution and the other one was HD.

140
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.220
So one of them captured multiple frames per second, like many, many,

141
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:47.900
many frames per second, very high resolution. And in that one,

142
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.490
you clearly see bugs.

143
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.470
Clearly you see a very easily defined bug in the other one.

144
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.160
That's low resolution and it doesn't capture as many frames per second.

145
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.190
All those images are stretched out and it looks like tubes.

146
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:06.740
So in the exact same place at the exact same time with two

147
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.890
cares right next to each other, two very different images.

148
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.130
One of them is all stretched out from the low resolution camera.

149
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.780
Like your security camera. The other one is high resolution.

150
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:21.920
You can see it's clearly a bug. I guarantee you 1000000%. That is a bug.

151
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.640
All right.

152
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.810
<v 1>By that one, see if you can find that I'm convinced, but that other one.</v>

153
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.263
<v 0>Ghost lover, bro.</v>

154
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.830
<v 1>I am a ghost lover. I love all of it. I love being in a spooky old house,</v>

155
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.020
a nice old church theaters.

156
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.050
<v 0>The comedy store belly room scares me sometimes. Yeah.</v>

157
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:40.610
I've taken people up there and go, let's just,

158
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.840
just stand here and tell me if you don't feel weird in the belly room,

159
00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.820
there's something about the belly room. I go above those stairs. It's just like,

160
00:08:46.821 --> 00:08:49.160
there's something about that room, especially when there's no show going on.

161
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.030
It just feels like your body's telling me you get the out of here. Right?

162
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.050
Let's get outta here. What is that? You're a.

163
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.530
<v 1>You're in the stairs. Not me.</v>

164
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.800
<v 0>Me. I'm a. I'm talking to myself.</v>

165
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.870
<v 1>The back one off the main room, the dressing area.</v>

166
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.300
Whenever you're back there by yourself. That's a weird feeling.

167
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.150
It's a sketchy spot. Yeah. That's a really weird feeling. Isn't that?

168
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:13.520
Where Kennison said he saw like a didn't he see like a quarter moving the air,

169
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:14.240
something.

170
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.750
<v 0>A pound of cocaine that night</v>

171
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.640
guys snorted so much Coke. Who the does what he.

172
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.830
<v 1>Saw? He's not a good, uh, no.</v>

173
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:25.410
<v 0>What Carla Bo,</v>

174
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.120
who was Kinnison sidekick had a great story about getting kicked out of the

175
00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:30.661
common store.

176
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:34.740
And he told it on stage one night that he got kicked out of the comedy store.

177
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:38.340
Excuse me, kicked out of his home. Uh, got in a fight with his wife, you know,

178
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.220
get out, you. You know, I'm, I'm going to the comedy store.

179
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.050
So he went to the comedy store to,

180
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.350
cause I think he was working security at the store. So he had keys. So he said,

181
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:48.420
I'm going to sleep on this stage. I'm going to make it one day.

182
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.630
I want to be a big famous comedian. Almost. This is my stage.

183
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:52.464
I want to sleep here.

184
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:57.510
So he slept there dark main room in the dark and he hears something

185
00:09:57.511 --> 00:10:01.140
in the background and he hears like a door, click click,

186
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:06.660
and he picks his head up. Pitch-black can't see. Hello.

187
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.400
It's Carl. Hey, uh, I got kicked out of my house. I'm sleeping here.

188
00:10:11.401 --> 00:10:15.450
If anybody's here wondering, and then he hears chairs, movement, clink, clink,

189
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.230
clink, clink. And he's like, what the is going on? Hello?

190
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.190
And then something grabs him by the ankle and pulls him off the stage into the

191
00:10:23.191 --> 00:10:23.940
crowd,

192
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:28.320
into where the seats are crashing into the chairs and then boom,

193
00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:31.230
the door shuts and boom, another door shuts. And it's gone.

194
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.330
And he's laying on the ground in the middle of the main room with a bunch of

195
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:37.200
knocked over chairs.

196
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:40.750
Something had grabbed his ankle and pulled him off the stage. Or,

197
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.980
or he did a lot of Coke with Cason. He was.

198
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.630
<v 1>Right. And he was another one. Yeah.</v>

199
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.360
<v 0>But it's a great story. That is a great story.</v>

200
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.150
He told it on stage one night at the store. Holy.

201
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.860
<v 1>Yeah. That's a good question.</v>

202
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:55.500
I've never asked the audience if they feel weird in there.

203
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.530
<v 0>No, I don't think they do. They're drunk. They're drunk.</v>

204
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.270
<v 1>And they're watching a show having a good time.</v>

205
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.370
<v 0>Yeah. They're having fun.</v>
