00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.590
So how did you get involved with turbocharging? Ferrari's like what,

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.360
because that's a, no-no in the Ferrari world, right?

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.730
<v 1>Definitely the Porsche.</v>

5
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.660
<v 0>World, they sort of have always encouraged, uh, modifications of the cars.</v>

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:18.390
Even from the early days, people have hot rotted Porsche's,

7
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:21.840
but when you around with a Ferrari, people get really upset at you.

8
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.580
<v 1>So my path through the cars is interesting. Where I, as a younger kid,</v>

9
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:28.080
I was not a car guy. You know,

10
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.720
I had a stepbrother with the Lamborghini posters and all of that,

11
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:35.160
and I just did not care. I was all about computers. I knew what I wanted.

12
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:37.950
I would much rather have, you know, a new apple.

13
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.740
Then I look at a Porsche or something like that.

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.060
And my first car was this very boring Volkswagen Jetta. And I was like, Hey,

15
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:48.600
it drives me around. I was just fine. Somebody req, uh, you know,

16
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:53.370
ran into it and looking around for the next car. Uh, my,

17
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.730
I wasn't like uncle in law or something had I,

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.320
I worked on cars and he had an old, British MGB in his garage, you know,

19
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:04.530
familiar with British sports cars. And, you know,

20
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.680
in many ways they're just terrible, terrible cars, but I fell in love with it.

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.920
It was just beautiful. And I, and I started,

22
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.080
I had to learn all about cars at that point,

23
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:16.800
because know the clutch master cylinder broke the very first day that I had it

24
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.590
and just everything's breaking all the time. And it's a pathetic,

25
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:21.150
weak little engine, but you're like, oh,

26
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:24.690
I can make it a little bit faster by doing some of these different things.

27
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.930
And I went through the, like many other things that I've had in my life.

28
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:31.110
I go through sort of this larval learning stage where I start reading the hot

29
00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:34.290
rod magazines and graduate to circle track or something. And again,

30
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:37.740
this is Midwest, Missouri, where I grew up. I,

31
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.790
so I learned all the basic ins and outs of the cars there I am.

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.691
And then I go on,

33
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:46.920
I started software and start getting successful and I do the sort of natural

34
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:51.150
upgrade from an MGB after it. I, after it gearbox eats itself,

35
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:51.984
I buy a Miata,

36
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.350
which is sort of the modern slick version of a British sports car.

37
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.490
And that was going along. I, you know, okay for me, I enjoyed it,

38
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.320
but almost on a whim.

39
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:06.120
One time I went into the Ferrari dealership in Dallas and here I am at I,

40
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.990
so it was like Wolf and Stein days. So I guess I was a 20 years,

41
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.830
20 years old or something, and I'm in a t-shirt and ripped jeans.

42
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.040
And I walk into the Ferrari dealership and say, kind of sell me or Ferrari.

43
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.270
I am. And they humored me and they, I kind of walked around. I, you know,

44
00:02:21.271 --> 00:02:23.010
we looked at the different things and a lot of the,

45
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.690
the Ferrari's at that time in the early nineties, I'm I am, you know,

46
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:32.070
three 40 eights and Mondelez. I didn't really like all that much, but, uh,

47
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:36.300
one of the ones in the back Haraj they had a four, a 3 28, which is kind of the,

48
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.170
you know, the fancier version of the, the Magnum PI car from the earlier days.

49
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.560
And I thought it was just the most beautiful car. I am, you know, this is,

50
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.220
I really wanted to get it. And when I wound up buying it,

51
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.030
it was interesting because the salesman gave me a little bit of a talk where he

52
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:52.170
said, you know,

53
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.950
if someone in the Corvette pulls up next to you and a kind of register engine,

54
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.810
just kind of hang your hand out the window.

55
00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.890
Like you got a thousand horsepower under the hood,

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.190
and that didn't sit well with me. That was like this idea of like,

57
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.810
he kind of knew that those cars weren't actually as fast as they looked or I,

58
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.880
you know, or their reputation would have.

59
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.260
And that there's this play that you would do to just kind of not get into a

60
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:18.880
situation where it doesn't hold up to its looks. And I was like, no,

61
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.230
I don't like that.

62
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.120
And so I wound up kind of calling around to all the different shops in Dallas

63
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:27.610
where it's like, okay, I've got a Ferrari 3 28.

64
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:28.750
I want to make it a little faster.

65
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.330
And I had done all this stuff on my MGB back in the day.

66
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:35.530
So I know the things that you wind up doing with intake and exhaust and cam

67
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:39.850
timings and, uh, the options there, but they were all basically horrified.

68
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.040
Like you just don't do this to a Ferrari.

69
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.500
And like the only suggestion that came out was, oh,

70
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.380
we can put an Italian Tubi exhaust on it. And that'll, you know,

71
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.551
I'll make it sound better.

72
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.830
And maybe it's good for a couple horsepower or something.

73
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.640
Those are things that people largely do for the aesthetics, you know,

74
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:58.570
whether it's oral or visual with it. Uh, and that's not a big move.

75
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.700
And right at about that time, John Romero at the office had, I picked up,

76
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.430
there was a copy of turbo magazine back in the day.

77
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.570
And there was an article about an old replica, um,

78
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.100
kind of race car and done by a local company in Dallas called Norwood auto sport

79
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.000
or Norwood auto craft. And I thought, well, he's right here. I'll call him up.

80
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.350
And so I call him up,

81
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.260
I get Bob Norwood on the phone and I start going through my pitch.

82
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.620
I've got a 3 28. I'd like it to be a little faster. What do you think we can?

83
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.190
And before I could even finish, he said, we'll put a turbo on it. Like, yeah,

84
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.000
now we're talking. And that was the beginning of,

85
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.020
I am kind of all the science project experiments. What does the 3 28.

86
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.370
<v 0>Have standard horsepower?</v>

87
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.210
<v 1>I think in the best, probably the European trim, you know,</v>

88
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:45.340
it was probably around 300 horsepower in the woods.

89
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.720
<v 0>You get it up to with the turbocharger.</v>

90
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.710
<v 1>So we went through a number of steps of this, and this is all a swapping out,</v>

91
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.220
uh, all the computer electronics I'm different turbos.

92
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.400
And eventually I melted the engine in it when it was at, uh,

93
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.530
like 500 or so.

94
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:02.920
And I went through a long history of melting many pistons in the different

95
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:05.140
devices, in different cars,

96
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.030
but that wound up being this decade long set of interesting experiments there,

97
00:05:10.031 --> 00:05:13.780
that was my gateway drug into working on this. And we're like, okay,

98
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.600
we've made all this power in this system. I,

99
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.050
we know it's kind of at the limits of a lot of things in the chassis after we

100
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:22.840
melted the engine there, we tuned it back down a little bit.

101
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.330
And that's the way so many engineering things wind up going,

102
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.560
you go it until it breaks,

103
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:29.020
then you dial it back a little bit and you stay there.

104
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.530
<v 0>Radically fast for a 3 28. It's very light, right.</v>

105
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.480
<v 1>Curb weight. Uh, well, it's not super light. I think it was like 3,200 pounds.</v>

106
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.220
And, uh, but yeah, it, it,

107
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:43.570
you could really feel it rear back when you went into it and I'm at high speed

108
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:47.800
is a little bit Dardy. If you start getting up in 1 54 miles an hour for that.

109
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.450
So we thought, well, what's the next level? Where do we go from here? So I,

110
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.290
he had done a twin turbo job on a Testarossa before, which is a much wider car.

111
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.460
I, you know, stock, they would go 180, 190 miles an hour, uh,

112
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.560
with normal Ferrari trim. And, and it was a bigger five-liter flat 12.

113
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.010
So there's a lot more possibility for doing things there. So I got,

114
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.100
I got a Testarossa and we said, all right,

115
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:17.090
we're going to do the twin turbo job with intercoolers with the new, you know,

116
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:18.920
the new engine management systems.

117
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.850
And we went through this long string of upgrades through this,

118
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:25.730
which generally was like, okay, we melted the pistons.

119
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:28.580
We broke the input shaft all these times,

120
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.690
but at its top form in peak, I still have the dyno sheet for,

121
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:35.600
it was like 1,009 horsepower at the rear wheels.

122
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.020
None of this crank horsepower talk. This was, I, you know,

123
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.560
over a thousand horsepower at the reel reels. And it was amazing.

124
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.710
That sounds ridiculous. What does standard horsepower with those?

125
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.570
It was like three 80 or something. Oh my God. So it was a huge, huge difference.

126
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.490
And you had all these things like, you know,

127
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.060
he couldn't launch like a dragster for our gear shifts or, you know,

128
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:59.210
really gears in a blender sorta thing. And you've got a dog leg first,

129
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.480
so it would not do a really fast zero to 60,

130
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.100
but if you were on the highway, I am, and you could just downshift to forth.

131
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.850
You could go from 50 to 150 faster than anybody's business.

132
00:07:10.851 --> 00:07:15.290
It was with that much horsepower. I, you know, I would run down super bikes.

133
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:19.190
It would, uh, it would just be faster than anybody. It was shockingly fast.

134
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.330
How does a handsome really pretty well? So we had bigger tires,

135
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:27.620
some stiffer suspension on it. It was not designed to be a, a super track car.

136
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.320
I had taken all of my Ferrari's to the tracks, but I was no,

137
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.590
no pretensions about being any kind of an SCCA champion or anything,

138
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:37.010
but I could wing, I could move him around the tracks reasonably well.

139
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.300
But the main thing about this was this just ungodly amount of power.

140
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:44.570
It was this sea Jesus effect when somebody dies,

141
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.450
takes a ride in it and you're like, okay, we're going, you ready for this?

142
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.980
And you have enough space. And for all of those years that did software,

143
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.280
our building was positioned. I off of this,

144
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:58.070
we had this long highway access road that led down to it.

145
00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.260
And I mostly more often than not,

146
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:04.430
I was working kind of night owl hours and this car was so loud.

147
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.700
I am kind of obnoxious in retrospect, but I am,

148
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:11.810
I had this personal drag strip basically every day when I would go there.

149
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.120
And everybody in the building could tell it's like, oh, John's coming,

150
00:08:14.121 --> 00:08:16.670
which was sort of the signal better get to work and look busy by the time he

151
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:18.350
gets up here. I,

152
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.040
but it was especially in the early days before we got some traction control

153
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:22.401
dial,

154
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:27.110
then it get really squirrely just because when the boost would come up fast

155
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:31.190
enough on there, it would tend to throw the car a little bit sideways. And I'm,

156
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.980
you know, I'm happy that I can look back and say, I, you know,

157
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:37.400
I never spun a car on the, uh, one of the big cars on the streets.

158
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:41.540
I did spend my little MGB. I, when I was learning how to drive as a teenager,

159
00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:44.450
but I never did that with the big Ferrari's on public roads.

160
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:48.410
Although there was one time at the motor sports ranch when I pitched my F 50,

161
00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:51.590
like through the infield, just spinning it around, over and over.

162
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:55.770
And we're like, well, there's the world's most expensive lawnmower now, what.

163
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.850
<v 0>Did you do with those cars?</v>

164
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.210
<v 1>So the first one I gave the 3 28,</v>

165
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:03.420
I gave away for the red annihilation tournament. So that was I,

166
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.160
that thresh one that was, so now he wound up, uh, that was,

167
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.130
there were some pictures of that going around recently where it was a little bit

168
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:14.670
weird sketchy because I, it was a turbocharged there's,

169
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.050
it really wasn't technically legal in Dallas. Most of the time, I, you know,

170
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:21.000
we would make it legal sometimes,

171
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.690
but much of the time it probably wouldn't have passed an emissions test and it

172
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:28.020
really wouldn't have passed a California emissions test. So, uh,

173
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.830
he wound up using it as he had it sort of in the lobby of his company, uh,

174
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:35.190
for a while as kind of a conversation piece. And he did, I think,

175
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:36.450
eventually wound up selling it.

176
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:40.530
I think I got a message from someone last year that still had it.

177
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.300
So it's still functional at this point,

178
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.440
which is saying something because it had a, an early, almost one-off POL tech,

179
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.670
uh, engine control system that probably no one can do anything to right now.

180
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.230
And you'd probably have to completely replace it.

181
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:55.770
If something went wrong with it, the Testarossa, uh,

182
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:58.890
we eventually detuned it a little bit down to, uh,

183
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.380
six or 700 horsepower or something.

184
00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.360
And somebody bought it from me and I felt he might've been buying more

185
00:10:06.361 --> 00:10:09.900
cars than he should have at that point. Well, basically,

186
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:14.010
it's going to break again. It's going to have problems. I know he wanted it.

187
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:16.530
And I think that he got some great satisfaction out of it,

188
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.820
but I know it broke again on him later. And I,

189
00:10:19.821 --> 00:10:23.490
and I think he had to get rid of it. I, you know, after that, then I had, uh,

190
00:10:23.491 --> 00:10:26.820
I had a Ferrari 40, which is beautiful, beautiful car,

191
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.330
and that was the only car that I didn't really modify. I am.

192
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.420
All we did was turn the waste gate and close, you know, lock that off.

193
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:36.210
So it was making all basically race trim F 40 there.

194
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:41.310
And the 40 is an interesting car in that. It has I, in those early days,

195
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:44.640
the turbos weren't nearly what they are right now. It was a small engine,

196
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:48.420
2.8 liter because it was specked for racing. It really was sort of a race car.

197
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.930
And if you didn't ring its neck, it was a pretty slow car.

198
00:10:51.931 --> 00:10:55.980
If you just like idled it off, it felt like a Honda civic. It was terrible.

199
00:10:55.981 --> 00:11:00.130
At the low end, you had to really rev it up and slip the clutch out,

200
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.460
get it up on boost. But it was a,

201
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.360
it was a great car because it was like this amazing race car that you're driving

202
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:07.290
around on the road.

203
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.750
And that was still where it didn't even have internal door handles.

204
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.060
It had a little pull cord inside there,

205
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.690
which led to the point where there was one time I was getting it valet parked.

206
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.110
And you could tell the valet that had to go get the car for me. It's like,

207
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:19.860
this is okay.

208
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:23.730
Highlight of the week he gets to go drive a Ferrari [inaudible] and he pulls it

209
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:26.880
up and he can't figure out how to open the door. So all of his friends,

210
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.061
you know,

211
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.580
everyone else working with them are just kind of looking at him and I had to

212
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:31.620
come over and tell him how to get it out.

213
00:11:31.621 --> 00:11:35.730
So that went from the highlight to like the worst day of his time there.

214
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:36.960
Do you.

215
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.990
<v 0>Still do that? Do you still have cars like that?</v>

216
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.560
<v 1>So, no, right now I am all about the Tesla where I have,</v>

217
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.820
I have a P 100 D and I think it's the best car I've ever owned by far.

218
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:51.450
So I've gone through all of these hyper exotics and I love my Tesla.

219
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.340
<v 0>I have the same and it's as, as anything,</v>

220
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.200
it's the fastest car I've ever driven in my life.

221
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.320
<v 1>So compared to my, you know, my super cars there,</v>

222
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:01.450
that the Tesla is much quicker off the start,

223
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.630
which most of the time that you're driving is, you know,

224
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:09.010
my point about the talk about how anti-social the old cars were, where I did.

225
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.940
You could not just go use this. You would have to plan ahead where, okay,

226
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:14.920
you make sure that you've got enough room.

227
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:16.570
If you have a traction issue going here,

228
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:19.630
you're going to cover a huge amount of distance. It was so loud.

229
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:21.910
You really wouldn't want to do it in most places.

230
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:26.530
But the Tesla is so magical where I had one of the first Roadsters and one of

231
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:30.130
the, when I was letting some other people take it out for drives, they said,

232
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:32.560
you're driving a rail gun, which essentially you are,

233
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:35.770
it's this electromagnetic pull on the car and you just push,

234
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.310
push the throttle down. And it just goes, and it's this amazing feeling.

235
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.430
And it's not, anti-social every stop sign you stop at.

236
00:12:42.431 --> 00:12:44.800
You've got traction control. It's not burning rubber.

237
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.190
You could just floor it every time you stop. And it's amazing.

238
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:51.250
It just brings a smile to your face. It is this happiness machine.

239
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.230
<v 0>Well, the stunning acceleration is so confusing to people.</v>

240
00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.460
I've like, my wife hates it. My I've had people in my car and I go,

241
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.660
are you ready for this? And I stomped the gas and then just go, geez. Yeah.

242
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.890
Cause it doesn't seem real. It doesn't seem like a car that looks like, uh,

243
00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:12.400
you know, a nice four-door sedan should be able to do that.

244
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:16.780
<v 1>Yeah. So that launch is definitely really something. But I am compared to like,</v>

245
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:18.850
if you're, if you're already moving the,

246
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:22.810
the old Testarossa with a thousand horsepower was a very different beast where

247
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.510
that Jesus' sense that you get at the very beginning.

248
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.540
It's that magnified extended for quite a while.

249
00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.790
As you're running up through 150 miles an hour,
