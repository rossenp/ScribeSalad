00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Dude, I didn't know. I was listening to your podcast.</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.880
I didn't know that you were involved in the rescue of Jessica Lynch.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.080
That was the second target that we hit in the first invasion of my rack.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.520
That's crazy. It was an odd series of events. The, you know, we went over there.

5
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.200
Um,

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.150
I had just finished the selection process for the east coast command and they

7
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.190
actually, uh, there are what would be the best way to describe it.

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.590
There are multiple squadrons inside of that command,

9
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.030
all tasked with, they all have the same skillset, but you need multiple.

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.590
So one can be deployment while another one is training.

11
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.820
And the other one is resting. You wanna get into a, you know, rotation cycle.

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.180
So at the end of selection,

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.220
an X number of people get partition off to each one of those.

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.940
And it takes time to get up to speed because the selection tactics and the way

15
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:54.060
that you train are they're good,

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.780
but you get better as you were working with the guys with more experience,

17
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:59.740
specifically the real world experience.

18
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.650
And so they pulled us outta selection about a month early and sent us over to

19
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.570
augment the cars, eye detail in Afghanistan at the very tail end. I mean,

20
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:08.770
nothing happened. We basically, you know,

21
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:11.570
you're a deterrent at that point and it's one of the worst missions because you

22
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.490
can't, it's very reactive security, detail stuff.

23
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:16.810
You can't really do anything until somebody else does something.

24
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:19.530
So you're already behind the power curve. It's my least favorite mission set,

25
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.240
I think. But we came back from that and then in the Intel started, um,

26
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.160
kicking off for Iraq and they sent us over to Saudi Arabia and we were there for

27
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.160
probably somewhere between seven to 10 days.

28
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:34.960
That's where I watched Bush give the speech you knowsal Husein has,

29
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.960
I think it was 24 hours to comply or turned himself in whatever it was. And, uh,

30
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.870
we had already taken get,

31
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.710
we knew before going over there that there were two or three, uh,

32
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:47.990
objectives that we were gonna look at.

33
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.350
So we had already basically planned missions that we were gonna do while we were

34
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.870
in Virginia Beach. We were planning for stuff in Iraq.

35
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:57.870
So we continued the planning in, uh, Saudi Arabia and the number one, uh,

36
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:00.710
the first target we hit was the number one chem bio target in Iraq.

37
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.820
So to do that, you have to get all your two on this. It's called mop gear,

38
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.660
mission oriented, protective posture. It's like a chemical chem, bio suit,

39
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.140
gas mask, which compounds a lot of stuff. You have all your normal on.

40
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:14.730
Anyway,

41
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.700
like there's guys carrying quickie saws in a hazmat suit with a gas mask on

42
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:21.820
breathing through a blower on their back, overworking the blower.

43
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.490
And it's amazing. Close to suffocation.

44
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.730
I've actually come inside of those gas masks.

45
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.970
It's the worst feeling ever like you're sucking so hard for air that the mask is

46
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:33.730
like sticking up against because you're not supposed to be physically exerting

47
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.170
yourself while you're wearing that thing. There's idea. A li it's just,

48
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.210
it's harder. It's be like putting the, uh,

49
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.650
cuz there's a canister on the side and how much weight do you carrying around in

50
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.280
those days? It was probably body weight plus 8,200 pounds. Jesus Christ.

51
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.183
That was about average.

52
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.520
And it trimmed down after that because the actual amount of real world

53
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:54.400
experience at that time was low and it drastically increased.

54
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.240
So you'd be like, you know,

55
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.320
I think I need this pocket and then you wouldn't need it for a month.

56
00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:58.561
You're like,

57
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:02.360
I need to get rid of this pocket because it carries sweat and like backpack,

58
00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:03.880
hunters, same kind of thing. Oh yeah.

59
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.920
The gear that I wore towards the end was substantially different than the gear

60
00:03:06.921 --> 00:03:09.040
that I wore towards the beginning. I trimmed. I mean,

61
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.000
I think I probably had 10 magazines on me like that first target.

62
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.040
I think the last deployment I did, I would carry four,

63
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.710
four and one in the gun and no pistol. So it things changed over time,

64
00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:21.990
but this just for weight, just for weight and for ability to move,

65
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.150
cuz then I would need less food and I would need less water and I'd actually be

66
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.190
mobile, but on this target.

67
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.310
So it was a four hour helicopter ride in we're sitting there.

68
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.430
We have all of our Mo gear on, but not our masks.

69
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.830
And we're doing a midair refuel on a C one 30. So you had a 47 double, you know,

70
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:41.460
the big double, uh, uh, uh, not propellers. It'd be, uh,

71
00:03:41.461 --> 00:03:42.700
rotor blades on top of the helicopter.

72
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:47.500
They're hooked up next to a C one 30 inflight refueling missile goes underneath

73
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:50.620
the C one 30 is like, see you boys later, the hums out.

74
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.660
And it like how the C one 30 bailed when the missile flew in. Oh. Yeah,

75
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:59.220
I don't blame 'em for that either. They're literally a flying fuel tank. Uh,

76
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:02.610
but they had gotten enough gas and we had to hit the tanker on the way back as

77
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:06.050
well. But so you're just sitting there waiting for three and a half, you know,

78
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:07.930
three and three quarter hours. And about 10 minutes out,

79
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:09.690
you start getting your gas mask and stuff on.

80
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:13.930
Cause you get a stuff that drappe and you know, night vision goggles.

81
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:15.530
Have you ever looked through a pair night? Vision goggles? Yeah.

82
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.010
Your field of view sucks. It's terrible. It's weird.

83
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.200
Which is why you notice when people who are, are actually using them.

84
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:24.280
They will all constantly have movement in their head because they're increasing

85
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.720
their field of view and up and down.

86
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.080
And that's when you can orient them to a good offset to your eye.

87
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.120
Now imagine putting a gas mask in between your eye and the lens of the night

88
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:36.160
vision Goggle. Oh Jesus.

89
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.320
So you're taking already a limited field of view and putting it into a soda

90
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.990
straw. So &lt;laugh&gt; and mind you,

91
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:47.150
this is the first combat target I've ever been on. So &lt;laugh&gt; and you're 18.

92
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.350
Oh no, no. This 22. No, I went through, how old are you me? 42. I was in my,

93
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:56.270
no at the time this was in 2003. It was 25. Okay. 25.

94
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.310
Um, but you, you enlisted when you were really young. I was 17,

95
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.980
17 junior in high school. I signed paperwork when I was in junior.

96
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:04.700
In high school. You, I didn't, you still gotta graduate and then, you know,

97
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.500
continue on. But, uh, and I was in like the third or fourth, uh,

98
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:12.740
47 that went in. So you finally get all your stuff on, you know,

99
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:14.060
and you have a blower on your back.

100
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:17.060
So there's ways that you can help the canister.

101
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.660
If you just have the canister on your mask,

102
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.650
it's a lot like breathing through a fuse. Raws shoved in your mouth.

103
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.410
If you maintain a low enough heart rate and you're totally chill, you're fine.

104
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.130
But as your heart rate goes up and your demand, you know, for oxygen goes up,

105
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.890
you're really limited. So they have, you know, you can put 'em on your back.

106
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:33.440
It's a blower,

107
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.090
it's a battery powered blower that will basically push air into the mask.

108
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.130
And it gives you, I would say more buffer space.

109
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:41.970
It's like almost like a positive pressure. And if you're not doing much, it's,

110
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.280
you're really nice. It's just GM and aired in your face and it works well.

111
00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:48.720
Unless you put your weapon sling over the top of that tube,

112
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:51.320
which is exactly what I did. Oh, which is awesome. Oh, it was great.

113
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.160
Jesus Christ. Great first experience. I lost my nods on my first target ever.

114
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.680
I went back and got 'em, but it was a show. What's nods, ni vision goggles. Oh,

115
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.280
okay. Things that you need to see at night and we'll get in trouble for,

116
00:06:02.281 --> 00:06:04.880
if you lose like a &lt;laugh&gt;. It was terrible.

117
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.400
So we come in number one, chem bio target in Iraq.

118
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.200
And we had looked at it from the perspective of like air conditioning

119
00:06:13.201 --> 00:06:16.440
specialists and, you know, from architects to what we,

120
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.670
we could encounter on the ground, potential threats,

121
00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.350
satellite imagery of historical stuff, and we'd get there.

122
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.030
And by the time I even got on the ground,

123
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.790
there was already a firefigh going on.

124
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.910
The helicopter that I was in had 27 rounds come through the helicopter,

125
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.950
not a single person was hurt. Wow.

126
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:35.870
Like guys were like reaching up to like scratch their and like a round would

127
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:39.660
come through and MIS miss everybody. Jesus Christ. I, well, I take that back.

128
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.580
Uh, the door of understanding next to me got shot right in the head met about a

129
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:46.420
minute out. That was my first exposure to combat just over and wow.

130
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.100
Helicopter lands. And you go,

131
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:52.020
and by the time I got to the front door of that structure,

132
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.180
I was probably as close to be an unconscious

133
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.650
thisphyxiation is I often am doing, jujisu getting choked out.

134
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.610
Like the world is just coming down and instantaneously.

135
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:08.770
We could tell that it was, was a agricultural school.

136
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.770
Like the intelligence was so horribly and incredibly off when it came to that.

137
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.530
So I just ripped my mask off at some point,

138
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:17.770
cause I would've rather died from whatever horrendous disease could have been in

139
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.280
there then suffocate. And then, you know,

140
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.880
we cleared through it and I knocked my night vision goggles off with a

141
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.480
sledgehammer. I had to go back. It was a show.

142
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.680
So we get back from that the next morning we wake up and uh,

143
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.320
I remember having a cup of coffee with a buddy in mine. &lt;laugh&gt; I was like,

144
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.720
Hey man, I don't think we're gonna get out of this. If things keep going.

145
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:39.710
Like they did last night. And shortly after they out a few days after that,

146
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.870
we got word that, uh, Jessica had been captured.

147
00:07:42.871 --> 00:07:47.470
So we forward staged and went up to uh Nazare. And

148
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.070
the information that we had going into the hospital is that it was a fetain

149
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.390
hotbed, like 50 to 500 people was the expected, uh,

150
00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:58.990
amount of resistance that we could have. And we,

151
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:00.820
it could fit 27 people in the helicopter.

152
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.540
So that's what we launched with in the back of our head. And, uh,

153
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.940
fortunately we didn't meet any resistance inside of the structure and it

154
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.860
actually was kind of business as usual, looking back,

155
00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:14.380
like there was nothing exciting about that target, uh,

156
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.180
whatsoever people in the modern day,

157
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.850
if they were to action that target now with the experience that they, they,

158
00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:23.210
they wouldn't even register on the radar scope, the amount, the little,

159
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.890
or the little amount of resistance that was encountered outside of it just would

160
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:30.530
be another day at the office. But there, there was a public story of that.

161
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.730
And then there was a lot of dispute about whether or not there that that was

162
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.770
accurate. There was a, a, like I remember she actually took some,

163
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.690
she cleared up a lot of it. She, well,

164
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.600
she was not responsible for a lot of the things that were said, right.

165
00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:46.440
Because she was deep into the repatriation process into, I mean,

166
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.320
her she's up to this day. When I met sat down,

167
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.400
I finally get to sit across the table.

168
00:08:50.401 --> 00:08:53.200
She had never sat down and talked to somebody who was there. It was.

169
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:55.320
So when did you meet her? I went and had her on again. Yeah.

170
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.680
I had her on your podcast podcast when, uh,

171
00:08:57.681 --> 00:08:59.640
it was one of the earlier episodes I went where she,

172
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.640
I didn't listen to though why didn't even know you had her on.

173
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.120
So she told her side of the story.

174
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.560
I told my side of the story and we were able to like fill the gaps and we sat

175
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.360
across the table just like this. And she still wears a brace.

176
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.800
She came and gave me a huge hug. I mean, I didn't know what to expect,

177
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:17.670
what happened to her physically. Um, man, I don't have the exact details,

178
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.510
but from my understanding,

179
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:25.030
the vast majority of her injuries came from when her Humvee wrecked. Um,

180
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.710
I do not believe she was buckled or strapped in, so she got just pounded. Um,

181
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.230
and she was not treated well. Um, you know,

182
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.750
it's got, eyes are gonna get the same, uh, I mean, bottom line,

183
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.630
you're gonna get raped if you're a male or a female. Um,

184
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.430
really? Oh yeah, for sure. And uh, if you get captured, oh yeah. You're,

185
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:49.550
you're going to, for sure. If you're a male or a female,

186
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.190
if you're a male or a female you're you're,

187
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.550
you're not gonna have a good Govet for sure. And, uh, again,

188
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.820
I'm not an exact expert on what happened specifically with her,

189
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.620
but from my understanding, she experienced that as well as, uh,

190
00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:04.300
all the other medical issues. But when we,

191
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.460
she was in bad shape when we pulled her out of the hospital, for sure.

192
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.420
But the so, and I remember, um,

193
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.540
there were two people with us that were carrying video cameras and there was a

194
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.210
little bit of footage that was taken from that,

195
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:21.170
like when she was in the hospital bed, in the hospital and a lot,

196
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:24.610
the rest of it was from the cameras on the helicopters and some, you know,

197
00:10:24.611 --> 00:10:27.410
the sensors overhead, but the narrative from that,

198
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.410
not a word was said by anybody that was there executing that objective or from

199
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.810
her. And I think my hypothesis is, you know,

200
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.560
we were a month in into that war. A lot of that war was based on,

201
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.080
we need to go rid this country and this dictator of their WMDs,

202
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.880
we hadn't found any from a PR perspective wise,

203
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.480
it wasn't probably gone as well as they wanted it to do.

204
00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:54.720
And they wanted to have a PR victory, but the stuff that was said,

205
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.870
the stuff that made the news, all the stuff that got blown and on a proportion,

206
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.710
none of that came from the people that were actually there, what it came from,

207
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.590
all the layers on top of it, what was Bon? Cause I'm trying to remember.

208
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.310
I remember some of the first reports they were saying that she was gonna be the

209
00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:09.430
first female medal of honor recipient that she had fought until she had her,

210
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:09.770
you know,

211
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.350
she expended her last round and then was finally overtaken and you talked to her

212
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:17.350
and she, she never even loaded her weapon, her weapon jammed. She,

213
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:18.900
she never said that she fought, you know what I mean?

214
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.100
I remember people talking about, she never said any of that.

215
00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.660
So what do you think was doing that was that the government's PR I think people

216
00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.020
are often in rush to talk in an educated manner about things they know nothing

217
00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:32.660
about. Mm. I mean, it takes time to,

218
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.060
to understand the details of what happened. She was not in a,

219
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.330
in a head space to give a debrief. You know,

220
00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:43.170
she was literally being flown probably to Germany for her first round of

221
00:11:43.171 --> 00:11:45.690
countless surgeries. Um, and,

222
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.530
and she's gonna need to spend time with a therapist and a counselor.

223
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.210
I would assume she would, obviously I can't speak for her, but they're gonna,

224
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.440
you know, they're gonna wanna do a robust medical treatment.

225
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.160
And that's really not the time to dive into the details of her exact actions.

226
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.280
And we left the next morning and flew into Baghdad like three days later.

227
00:12:01.281 --> 00:12:04.480
Like it was just another day on the job and you were off and running.

228
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:08.080
You just had, it was cool because, uh, it was the first rescue, uh,

229
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.840
U S P O w since world Wari.

230
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.990
And so the rescue of her was she was rescued from the hospital. Correct.

231
00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:17.670
And so they had abused her and then taken her to a hospital.

232
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.230
I get a little granny on the details of what happened in between the wreck and

233
00:12:22.231 --> 00:12:26.430
when we picked her up, because there are conflicting narratives. Um, there are,

234
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.430
there are, I dunno, what the correct word would be stories,

235
00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:35.300
or there are reports that they attempted to put her into an ambulance and bring

236
00:12:35.301 --> 00:12:37.940
her back to us forces. But at that same time,

237
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.540
the fedein were using ambulances as basically military fighting vehicles.

238
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.700
So they said that when they tried to do that,

239
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.020
the ambulance was shot at which makes sense. If there was a,

240
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.220
a trend of people using ambulance as a military vehicle,

241
00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:51.820
that would make sense and they would get turned around.

242
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.330
So they might have tried to back, um, you know,

243
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:59.370
that hospital was being used as a fetaan staging point because they're, I mean,

244
00:12:59.371 --> 00:13:00.250
they're not dumb people.

245
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:03.850
They understand we're not gonna likely bomb hospitals or religious structures.

246
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:08.490
So use them to their military advantage. Wow. Wow.

247
00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:13.050
And this is your second, your, your second real. Yep.

248
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.400
Wow. Crazy. It's crazy.

249
00:13:17.401 --> 00:13:21.120
That mean that story was a, a giant story. Yep. Uh, in,

250
00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.200
in the media about the war and people trying to sort out what was true

251
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:29.920
versus what was the, you know, the publicity narrative,

252
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.880
I would say on average, take 90% of what you hear off the top 90%.

253
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:44.630
<v 1>So.</v>
