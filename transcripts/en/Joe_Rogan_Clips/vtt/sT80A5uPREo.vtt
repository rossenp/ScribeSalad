00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The general good experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.620
Can you describe what's going on with these M RNA viruses and how they

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:08.550
differ, excuse me,

4
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:12.960
M RNA vaccines and how they differ from a regular

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:16.200
vaccine and what what's coming down the pipe from Pfizer.

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.420
These are M RNA vaccines.

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.180
It's different in that it doesn't actually contain the virus,

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.660
but it boosts your body's ability to fight off the virus.

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.080
<v 1>Yeah. So, um,</v>

10
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.660
so there are many different ways of developing vaccines. Uh,

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.470
and the idea, the general idea behind a vaccine is,

12
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:38.150
is that we want to give you kind of an earth PSAT's infection.

13
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.860
We want to expose you make it as if you had been infected,

14
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.760
but without the risk of getting the disease to trick your immune system,

15
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.540
into mounting an immune response so that your body is then prepared.

16
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.150
If it gets the real infection to fight it off.

17
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.460
And one of the simplest ways you can think about it is so-called

18
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:02.750
live attenuated virus. This is an old technology where you,

19
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.700
you take the virus to the laboratory,

20
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:09.560
you culture it hundreds of times and hope for mutations that weaken the virus's

21
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.140
ability to make you sick. But nevertheless,

22
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.740
keep the virus able to elicit an immune response.

23
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:19.490
And then we give you that strain as a shot. And you have,

24
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:20.720
let's say a mild illness.

25
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.870
You develop antibodies and immunity and it's sustained,

26
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.020
or you can have inactivated virus, like one of the Chinese, the so-called,

27
00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:33.440
the Sinovac vaccine that's enact was one of the first to start, uh, which was,

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.540
uh, out of China is a, is a live attenuated virus. So that is, uh,

29
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.720
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say live attenuated already? I can't remember. But anyway,

30
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:46.100
the sign of back vaccine is a virus in which they, they take the virus.

31
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.560
I'm sorry. No, it's not like the previous example. In this case,

32
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:50.330
we take the virus and we treat it,

33
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:54.500
let's say with heat or with chemicals to kill the virus,

34
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.660
but still have it be immunogenic.

35
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.790
And that's another approach and there are many other approaches, a dozen or so,

36
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:06.470
or nine or 10 different approaches. One of which is this MRN a idea.

37
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.880
And here what is done is, um, so, so I'm sorry. Before I tell you about that,

38
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.910
another approach might be to take, take, uh,

39
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.460
the RNA from the Corona virus,

40
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.430
that codes for a very important protein,

41
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.170
despite protein on the surface of the Corona virus and insert that into a,

42
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.680
a really benign virus. Let's say like a cold virus, for example.

43
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:30.110
So we take this other species of virus.

44
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.490
We genetically engineer it so that we insert some, uh, materials,

45
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:37.970
some RNA into it. Let's say that forces that virus,

46
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:41.870
when it infects yourselves to give you a common cold,

47
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:46.460
but also to express this protein as if you had been infected with

48
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.320
COVID or Corona virus,

49
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.950
and then you Mount an immune system to that immune response to that protein,

50
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.090
and now you're immune.

51
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:57.470
So we gave you like a mild illness and we protected you from a more serious one.

52
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.690
The MRNs viruses are, uh, vaccines are sort of like that.

53
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.190
We inject you literally with, with, with RNA. And the idea is,

54
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:09.760
is that your cells take up the RNA and start making the protein,

55
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:12.100
the alien protein, uh,

56
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.830
that your body would have made.

57
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.110
Like if we had infected you with a real Corona virus,

58
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.370
the real code or own a virus, as many people remember from high school biology,

59
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.770
the virus can't reproduce on its own.

60
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:27.400
It inserts its genetic material into our cells,

61
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.360
which then start producing the viral, uh, the virus itself.

62
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.660
But now in a sense, instead of giving you the whole virus,

63
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.420
we give you a little part of it, just some part of his genetic material,

64
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
the RNA,

65
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.610
which in an ideal world does the same thing gets inserted into your cells.

66
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.770
You start expressing this protein,

67
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.940
which then your body attacks and you develop an immune response to it.

68
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.930
And we are amazingly lucky that, um,

69
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.090
that our scientists have been able to develop,

70
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.810
not one but two different vaccines and we'll have many other vaccines using

71
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.100
different modalities. I have no doubt that come out in the next year or two, uh,

72
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.080
but the modern and the Pfizer vaccines,

73
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.770
we're very lucky that they exist and that they are apparently quite effective,

74
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.790
but the S but the story's not over on those.

75
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:15.760
I don't know if you want to talk about that, but, but it's good news,

76
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:19.510
but I don't want people to get over optimistic either because you know,

77
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.190
it's my job to be a bit of a downer.

78
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.510
<v 0>Well, the, this is the,</v>

79
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.080
this is the unfortunate narrative that people keep saying. Uh,

80
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.980
the virus is killing.

81
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.090
It's like the average immune system is 99 point,

82
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:40.020
whatever percent effective in protecting you from the virus,

83
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.030
meaning 99 point,

84
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:46.350
whatever percent of the people who get the virus survive. Whereas.

85
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.630
<v 1>99% Of people overall survive.</v>

86
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:52.530
1% will die of all people who are infected approximately.

87
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.430
And if you're older than 70 or 80, 20% will die.

88
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.710
<v 0>Why, why is the number that people keep talking about far less than that?</v>

89
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.871
Why is the, the,

90
00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:06.720
the reported number of people that get the virus who actually wind up dying?

91
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.300
It's it's not 1%, we're not,

92
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.470
we're not seeing 1% nationwide in terms of people getting the virus and dying.

93
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.330
<v 1>You know, the answer to that question now,</v>

94
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:20.130
I don't think there's any ambiguity scientifically. So, so, um, so in order to,

95
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.840
in order to really compute these numbers, it's not easy. You're right. Um,

96
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.670
we have to look at how many people,

97
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.710
we have to have a way of ascertaining who's infected.

98
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.510
And then we have to have a way of ascertaining of those, how many die and,

99
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.870
and, uh, and that's called the infection fatality rate.

100
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.890
And there was just a recent meta analysis looking at very good data from around

101
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:41.251
the world,

102
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:45.240
multiple studies using different approaches that estimated that the infection

103
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:49.140
fatality rate is between 0.5 and 0.8%.

104
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.600
And there's something called the case.

105
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.230
Fatality rate is the fraction of people who have symptoms,

106
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.150
who go when infected, who, and that number is about twice that,

107
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.840
so about half the people get the virus and have no symptoms at all.

108
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.440
So if you get symptoms, you have a higher risk of death.

109
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.640
And so you can double 0.5 to 0.8 becomes one to

110
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.940
1.6% of people who, um,

111
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.250
who develop symptoms from the disease die.

112
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.220
And there was another very good study that was just released a couple of weeks

113
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:24.140
ago that estimated the infection fatality rate to be about 1%.

114
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.330
So there's a lot of little numbers I've sorted out.

115
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.200
<v 0>Right. But this is just his symptoms.</v>

116
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.210
<v 1>Yeah. But even without symptoms,</v>

117
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:35.530
the infection fatality rate is certainly not less than half a percent and could

118
00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:39.580
be as high as 1%. I would say, it's going to be in that range, the IFR,

119
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:40.600
the infection fatality, right.

120
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.350
<v 0>Isn't there a large percentage of people that get it that don't have symptoms.</v>

121
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.380
<v 1>Half about half. We think that's right. Okay.</v>

122
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.120
Of the people who get it don't have symptoms,

123
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:53.470
but you said 99 point something percent of people who get it survived.

124
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.630
And that point something is, is important.

125
00:06:55.631 --> 00:07:00.370
So I would say that if you said 99.5% of the people who get

126
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:04.480
infected survive, I would say, yeah, it could be, but it's somewhere in there.

127
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.660
Right?

128
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.660
<v 0>I mean, I don't think I gave a number. I think I said 99 point something,</v>

129
00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:11.320
but the point point being that, unfortunately,

130
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:15.430
a lot of people saying this vaccine is 94% effective

131
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.860
or 90% effective.

132
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.890
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. But that, what that means is, is that if you're, uh,</v>

133
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.690
if it reduces your risk of death by that fraction. So for example,

134
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:32.920
in the vaccine trial, in the, uh, Pfizer trial, uh,

135
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.190
these numbers are approximate, uh, in that lead,

136
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:40.510
they had about 43,000 people in the trial. Half of them got the vaccine,

137
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.650
half of them did not. And in the people who got the vaccine,

138
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:49.510
nine people up to nine, let's say nine or 10 got,

139
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.830
even though they were vaccinated, still got Corona virus, still had the disease.

140
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:54.940
The vaccine was not perfect.

141
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.960
And in the people in the arm that did not get the vaccine,

142
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.190
the other 20,000 people let's say 90 people approximately

143
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.470
got coronavirus. So what the vaccine did is,

144
00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:11.050
is it reduced your probability of getting the disease from 90 out of

145
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.610
20,000 people over the time window of the study to 10 out of

146
00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:19.340
20,000 people. So the point here is, is that the, the,

147
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.740
the vaccine is reducing your risk of getting seriously ill if you're infected.

148
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.330
And, um, and it, and it's not, and you're certainly better off.

149
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.700
In other words, you would have had, let's say a 1% chance of dying, uh, before.

150
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.350
And now you have a point, 1% chance of dying 90% lower than that, because we,

151
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.540
you know, we've given you the vaccine. Does that mean.

152
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.090
<v 0>Completely? I understand exactly what you're saying.</v>

153
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:47.050
What I'm trying to say is there's an unfortunate narrative where people are

154
00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:47.440
saying,

155
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.150
I'm not going to take a vaccine because the human immune system is more

156
00:08:52.151 --> 00:08:55.770
effective than the vaccine. See, that's not true.

157
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.240
That's what I wanted to get out of you saying, yeah, go ahead.

158
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.311
<v 1>Well, no,</v>

159
00:09:01.311 --> 00:09:05.840
I'm saying the vaccine the whole way vaccines vaccines work is that it enhances

160
00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:09.180
your, your performance. You know, it's like a, it, it,

161
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.740
it stimulates your immune system to make it even better at fighting the,

162
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.820
the virus. There's,

163
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.470
there's no sense in which you could argue that an unchallenged immune system is

164
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:22.280
superior to a challenged immune system, a system that has been, you know,

165
00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:24.200
been given a vaccine. So, um.

166
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.300
<v 0>This is what's important to tell people, right?</v>

167
00:09:26.301 --> 00:09:30.950
Because this narrative of 99% of the people who get it,

168
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.090
99 point,

169
00:09:32.091 --> 00:09:36.530
whatever your immune system is effective in fighting off this disease.

170
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.660
Whereas with the virus,

171
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.550
it's only 90 plus whatever percent effective in preventing the

172
00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:47.000
virus. So this is not a, that's not a good narrative, correct.

173
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:51.020
<v 1>That's right. And the way to think about it is just to pick some round numbers,</v>

174
00:09:51.021 --> 00:09:54.590
as you were saying, unlike, unlike, uh, like me,

175
00:09:54.591 --> 00:09:57.410
you sometimes use the word virus when you mean vaccine and you used the word

176
00:09:57.411 --> 00:10:01.040
vaccine when you mean virus. I'm sorry. I do that all the time. Yeah.

177
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.620
All the time. It's so annoying. Yeah. But anyway,

178
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.640
let's say for the sake of argument, you have an unvaccinated,

179
00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:10.940
you have a 99% chance of surviving. If you get infected, right.

180
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.800
You have to add to that, the benefit of the vaccine, which is a 90%,

181
00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:16.820
let's say effectiveness.

182
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.620
So it'll reduce your probability from 99% chance of

183
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.350
surviving to 99.9% chance.

184
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:29.010
<v 0>Yes. Thank you. That's exactly what I wanted to get out of you there.</v>

185
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.560
That when, when you talk about the people that took the vaccine,

186
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.220
and we know you have the data between the difference of the vaccine and the

187
00:10:37.221 --> 00:10:38.240
people that got the placebo,

188
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.890
the people that got the vaccine that still wound up getting COVID,

189
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:48.080
did they do health screens on these people and find out what comorbidity

190
00:10:48.081 --> 00:10:52.550
factors they may have had and see if there's anything that would indicate that

191
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.560
there's particular risks.

192
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.500
<v 1>We don't know that yet those results haven't been released.</v>

193
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.530
And also what we don't know. So we don't know the answer to that,

194
00:11:00.531 --> 00:11:03.590
but we will know. And also what we don't know yet, as we,

195
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.950
we don't know how safe the vaccine is. So, first of all, just to be very clear,

196
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:09.620
both Pfizer and Moderna have released interim results.

197
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.340
And we have every reason to believe that the final efficacy results will be

198
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:14.061
about the same.

199
00:11:14.061 --> 00:11:18.230
So as they complete the trial in the coming month or two and more people get

200
00:11:18.231 --> 00:11:22.670
sick in both arms, we don't expect suddenly the vaccine not to work. I mean,

201
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:24.410
we've gotten to a point where it's,

202
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:28.040
we're pretty sure that the vaccine will be effective. And, um,

203
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.830
but we don't yet know the safety of the vaccine is one thing. We,

204
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:32.980
another thing we don't know, and we also don't know something else.

205
00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.930
It's very important for people to understand again,

206
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.850
and since everyone needs to be an immunologist. Now

207
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.610
imagine that you're doing a trial and you're trying to see whether a vaccine

208
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:48.320
works or not. You have to define what counts as works,

209
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.590
what counts as an endpoint. So let me give you three possibilities.

210
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.590
One possibility is we're going to measure,

211
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:58.480
does the vaccine prevent you from even getting infected or does the vaccine

212
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.314
say you were not?

213
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.860
Or do we say the vaccine is not gonna be able to stop you from getting infected?

214
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.900
The virus is going to take root in your body,

215
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.960
but the vaccine is going to prevent the virus from making you seriously ill,

216
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.670
or do we say actually the outcome we really care about is death.

217
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.700
Does the virus reduce your probability of death?

218
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.570
So it's possible that the vaccine, for example,

219
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.520
might just to illustrate this point, prevent you from getting seriously ill,

220
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.300
but not reduce the probability of death. In other words, in the,

221
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.540
in the Pfizer trial that I just described to you with the knife in the,

222
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:35.740
in the vaccine arm, uh, 10 people got sick and in the non,

223
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:39.880
in the placebo arm, 90 people got sick. What if in both arms,

224
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:44.080
one person died. One out of the 10 in the vaccine arm died.

225
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.140
And one out of the 90 in the, in the other arm died,

226
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:51.430
we would say that the vaccine was effective at lowering your probability of

227
00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:55.210
getting ill, which was great, but it had no effect on dying.

228
00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.010
That's possible. It's possible that the vaccine will work at different,

229
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.510
uh, phases of the illness process.

230
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.700
And so the Pfizer trial revealed that there was a greatly reduced

231
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:12.850
probability of people getting infected.

232
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:17.980
The Moderna trial actually showed that its vaccine reduced the probability of

233
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:20.080
people getting seriously ill, which is great,

234
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.530
but it might in fact have no effect on mortality still. We don't know.

235
00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.690
Furthermore, we also don't know whether this vaccine,

236
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.190
even if it works, reduces, reduce it.

237
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.550
Even if it works to reduce your probability of getting sick or dying,

238
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:41.290
whether it works to reduce your ability to infect other people. So,

239
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.230
so maybe we we've started vaccinating the population.

240
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:47.980
We're reducing the individual recipient's probability of getting sick,

241
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.980
but they still can spread the disease. So,

242
00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.800
so this is something else that's not known. So we don't know the safety.

243
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.290
We don't know which outcomes are really being affected.

244
00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.870
And we don't know if it affects infectiousness and all of these things are

245
00:13:58.871 --> 00:14:02.770
things we will soon learn in the coming year, but we don't yet know them.

246
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:05.890
So I just, it's a fantastic news that we have a vaccine,

247
00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.300
but I just don't want people to get think it's a panacea.

248
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.900
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

249
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.020
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

250
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:21.450
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

251
00:14:21.451 --> 00:14:25.170
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

252
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:29.160
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

253
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.990
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
