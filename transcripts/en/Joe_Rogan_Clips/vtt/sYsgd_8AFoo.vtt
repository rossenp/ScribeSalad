00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.160
<v 2>I didn't even get sober for two years after that. Wow. So,</v>

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.000
or a year after, how long after the heart attack did you start partying? Again,

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.441
three.

5
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:15.000
It took about three months for me to like spruce my goose up enough to get nuts.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.360
And that is the turning point. When I, I,

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.440
where I truly believe that I took,

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.310
turned into like a full-blooded like addict,

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.550
cuz then all of a sudden I had an out, you know, I had a safe out,

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.030
you know, I had the story,

11
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.590
I had the love of all my friends were like Maddy we're with you, you know,

12
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.990
so much beautiful support from all of my, my crews deep.

13
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.500
And I was just like so much good love from my friends.

14
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.220
And then all of a sudden I started hiding, going to different places,

15
00:00:45.221 --> 00:00:48.020
different bars, different little drug homes.

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.540
<v 0>I like to call 'em you know, little trap house. Yeah. Little places, little,</v>

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.820
little critter, critter, little homes. Is that a trap house? No, no trap house.

18
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
Where you dance trap house. What happens? You can do trap house. chicks,

19
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.530
trap trap. What happens in trap houses? Like where the, the like the,

20
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.570
you can say it business happens. The drunk business happens.

21
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.530
The business happens and moves and then you go to the other house to use it

22
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.810
usually. Oh, okay. You don't get high of the trap house. Not really.

23
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.650
Just business. Can't get high on your own supply. No, Joe,

24
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.290
a never get high on your own supply.

25
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.680
Dan crack show to the, um, you know,

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.520
I think that's when I really was getting crazy.

27
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.880
And that's when I started turning like and less fun and more of an addict.

28
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.600
Yeah. I got very violent. Really? Yeah. Like I got,

29
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.360
I got banned from our own nightclub. I got banned from like, you know,

30
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.630
I got walked in on and I was trying to like, Rob, pretty much this drug dealer.

31
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.830
I was like, I swung on like,

32
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.230
I would be blackout drunk trying to fight my friends and like being like,

33
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:53.990
you can't stop. Like, because people would try to stop me. They would like,

34
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.630
I would walk into a bar and like, cuz I'm in the hospitality group. Like,

35
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.830
you know, I'm in the crew. So it's just imagine, um,

36
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:04.380
imagine like being a comedian and somebody, it gets almost like blacklisted,

37
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:09.340
but we still love you, but you can't show up here. Mm. But we love you.

38
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.180
You can do your comedy, like buy yourself out in your car,

39
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.220
but you can't come in here. &lt;laugh&gt; right. And I'm just like,

40
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.060
well I wanna still go into the bar. I go to the bar every day.

41
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:22.060
The bar's my that's my safe place. You know, I wanna, I wanna go into the bar,

42
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:24.250
like let me in. And everyone's like, you're not dying here.

43
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.090
You're not dying at my bar. So then I had to start going to these like deeper,

44
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:31.770
darker places and push myself. And, and, and,

45
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.610
and before when I used to do drugs, I never had to say,

46
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.890
it in your head. You know, when you're about to jump and you gotta be like, it.

47
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:44.880
Let's go. You know? So those moments when you off that have to be like,

48
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.720
you have to push yourself. I was doing that with drugs where I'd be like,

49
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.120
I know now I know that I could die before my ego was like, you'll never die.

50
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.600
Maddy. You're the man. But now all of a sudden,

51
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.680
my ego is a little bit shook, but my ego still is like, you,

52
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.200
you're gonna keep doing this.

53
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.400
And so I had to keep doing it and I had to keep saying, you to myself.

54
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.040
So every time that I started doing drugs, I would be like, it let's go.

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.790
And then that was the moment when I was just like, that's when got dark.

56
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.190
And so there was like a year of that.

57
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.190
And then my last time I ever drank

58
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.830
the last time I ever did any like anything was, uh,

59
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.590
you know, nine years ago, the weekend of November, whatever 12th.

60
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.270
And my friend was visiting from England,

61
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.620
a F and we were doing a big dinner and I got so drunk.

62
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.660
And I, I brought, I walked in Friday service, mid service.

63
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.820
Didn't even show up for work, took the chef out and, and was just like,

64
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.820
you know, didn't tell anybody. I'm just like bringing my buddy around town,

65
00:03:54.821 --> 00:03:55.654
being a host.

66
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.980
And I show up and all the partners were sitting at one of the chef's tables.

67
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:02.170
So there was like in the big kitchen at parts, in this warehouse,

68
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.250
there was like three chef tables. So the VIPs, the homies,

69
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.690
all the people got to sit in the chef tables and all the partners were sitting

70
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:12.610
there and I walked in and they're like, what's up?

71
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:16.090
You don't have to show up for work, bro. You get to do whatever you want to do.

72
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.280
Kind of thing. Like what the? And I was just like, like,

73
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.200
what the do you want? And I was just like, and I was like, what do you want?

74
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:26.360
Your restaurant's packed this look at this.

75
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.240
And I walked out into the middle of the dining room and I was like,

76
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.440
Hey everybody who the is having the best time ever.

77
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.640
And everyone was like, ah, and I wa looked at all the partners and I was like,

78
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.910
you. These are, this is my crew. This is my world.

79
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.510
That didn't go well, &lt;laugh&gt; ego.

80
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.390
I was such a psychopathic, young psycho. Well, those two things,

81
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.430
booze and Coke. I mean, they are pee. I got little pee pee.

82
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:59.830
I gotta make it up somewhere. You know, like it's, it's, it's,

83
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.460
it's so hard to, to, to, you know, fill the void,

84
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.340
you know? And I just, I found that with that. And then, you know,

85
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:12.860
the next day one of my partners was like, Hey, let's meet for coffee.

86
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.300
I wanna fire you to your face. And I was just like, okay. Yeah, fire me.

87
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.740
You can't like, I was just like, what are you gonna do with your restaurant,

88
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.930
bro? What are you gonna do with all your restaurants?

89
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.770
I'm the face of your company? I'm the guy.

90
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.850
And I showed up and uh, he was like, meet me here. I'll pick you up.

91
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:34.930
We're gonna go for a coffee. I was like, okay, let's meet up.

92
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.130
And I knew that I could manipulate and talk to him and you know, be like,

93
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:42.800
we're cool. You know, I won't do it again. Yeah. Panic. Just manipulate,

94
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.480
manipulate, manipulate, manipulate, and.

95
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.320
And uh, he drives me and it's like, oh my God.

96
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.240
He pulls up to like my homie's house. Who's like straight edge vegan warrior.

97
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.120
Oh boy. And I'm just like, oh perfect. And then like four,

98
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.040
my dudes come out and I'm just like, okay,

99
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.760
let's see what you losers. Gotta say, &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

100
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.960
let's hear what all my best friends gotta say about me,

101
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.120
how much you love me and how much you care about me.

102
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.000
Let's see what you like losers. Gotta say, you know,

103
00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:18.350
like instantly going into like hating these people that are trying to like help

104
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:22.670
me. And uh, you know, the veils that can come.

105
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.790
When you sit down in front of your best friends, your true, your, your, your,

106
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.150
your true inner circle, the people you can't lie to. The people that you can't,

107
00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:33.510
there's no facade. There's no media. There's no nothing.

108
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.830
It's you and your friends.

109
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.260
And I sat down and I listen for like four hours. And,

110
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.380
um, you know, and the next day,

111
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.340
one of the guys there goes to meetings and he is like, we're going to a meeting.

112
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.260
And so the next day I walked into a meeting and, um, you know,

113
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.300
the miracle happened and I at.

114
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.970
<v 1>A meeting. Yeah. What, what, what made you hit the switch you go from?</v>

115
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.570
Is everybody having a good time to all right. I'm done.

116
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.610
<v 0>Yeah, because I think the lying within that four year, four hour period,</v>

117
00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:12.890
that transitional period, I, that was my out.

118
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.170
I could stop lying cuz I was lying. The lying is what really broke.

119
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.320
<v 1>Me. Whether not where I was.</v>

120
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.800
<v 0>Going, where I was going, the people I was hanging out with lying to Trish.</v>

121
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.800
Another thing I've been with Trish for like 21 years, you know,

122
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.520
she's a Saint, she's a hard bodied. Italian,

123
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:37.080
Irish woman. She's, you know, three home births. She doesn't around. Yikes.

124
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.630
She's she's real deal. I'll birth bro. I'll birth the child right now. Who,

125
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.670
Jamie, you got a baby in there. Let's go. I'll birth you. So the,

126
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.270
I was like, why isn't Trisha here? And she's like, she's out, it's up to you.

127
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.670
She's got nothing left to say, she's out, it's up to you now.

128
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.940
And I was just like, huh? I don't like that.

129
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.460
And even now like, you know,

130
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.460
like I feel I can trigger that feeling of

131
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.900
this is real. This is it. This is, this is a time where I can stop.

132
00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.860
This is a time where I can, I don't, I can stop.

133
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.730
Okay. I accept. You know, I accept that. I'm I, I, I, I have a,

134
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.730
a chance and not ever having to lie. I have a chance.
