00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, you, you ran more than you bargained.</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.930
<v 1>Yeah, that was, that was far, I mean, I asked the guys there. I said, Hey,</v>

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:14.460
how far is it if I go from here to here? And they're like, oh, seven miles. No,

4
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.690
it was like 15. It was a grind and humid.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.583
Oh my God.

6
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.960
<v 0>Well, luckily you're, uh, accustomed.</v>

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.730
<v 1>To that. Yeah, yeah, no, it was good. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
<v 0>I was talking to a friend of mine, you know, and I was saying, well, you know,</v>

9
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:28.980
cam, when he first started running,

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.970
he had a hard time running a mile and then like what? Yeah. Like, yeah.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.020
That's how it works.

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.380
<v 1>Yeah, it was um, yeah. You know,</v>

13
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:42.090
and I was when I first started, I mean, I was okay in high school,

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.350
you know, cause I did all the sports and we do maybe a 10 K during the summer.

15
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:50.190
So, but then after high school, then I was just like,

16
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.470
I thought it was really cool. I could buy beer.

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.510
So it was like 21 and I'd swing by Riverview market on the way home and buy a

18
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:02.130
six pack of tall boys. And you know, I thought that was cool. I could pounce on,

19
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.370
you know, Coors light and I'm like, oh, I'm a stud now.

20
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.200
And then I started to get fat and I'm like, I didn't,

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.110
nobody cared. It was like, I didn't have,

22
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.090
I wasn't living up to any expectations.

23
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:18.180
I was actually living down to expectations.

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.580
And so I went through a phase there where I was just like,

25
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:28.020
not healthy. I was still hunting, but no real,

26
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.800
um, sense of, I don't know, I didn't have,

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.120
I wasn't accountable for anything or to anybody didn't have any high

28
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.810
expectations. So Mike, whatever. And I remember I,

29
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.450
I signed up for the beach Butte,

30
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:47.160
10 K and I got there to fifth street. Public market is about five miles.

31
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:50.400
I had another mile left and I quit and I'm just like,

32
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.960
this sucks. And so that was,

33
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.970
I think from there, I'm like, nobody feels good. You know,

34
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:04.230
you don't feel good when you're in that S in that place. So, um,

35
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.670
it was a slow grind,

36
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.870
but I got to where I just kept doing more and more and more than I did my first

37
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.000
marathon. Like in 2002. When you.

38
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.080
<v 0>The next day, how did you feel?</v>

39
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.820
<v 1>I felt all the time. So it wasn't like, I mean, it wasn't,</v>

40
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.940
you know, I was living with four guys and we'd just drink beer all the

41
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.680
time. And you know,

42
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.980
remember this one guy got DUI,

43
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.690
like two DUIs in three weeks. I think both in my truck,

44
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.840
at least I wasn't driving. I would never draw, you know? I mean, I w I never,

45
00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:44.730
never, never got caught, but it was just like, just stupid.

46
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:48.360
So it was just like another disappointment. It wasn't, it didn't stand out.

47
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.210
<v 0>Because it was just, there was no success.</v>

48
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.470
<v 1>No, no, it was just, I don't know. I didn't have anything going. It's like,</v>

49
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.260
that's where my life was. So it's just like, what.

50
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.093
<v 0>Changed?</v>

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.350
<v 1>I don't know. I know.</v>

52
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.840
<v 0>Well, something must have changed because now you're running 240 miles,</v>

53
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.670
probably the most successful bow hunter on the planet earth. I mean, that's,

54
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.590
that's a giant, I mean, you have 800,000 Instagram followers, something changed.

55
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.060
Like what changed?

56
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.590
How did it go from you being this guy who quit

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.030
after five miles and you drink beer all the time and you're hanging out with a

58
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:29.620
bunch of ne'er do Wells. Yeah.

59
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.060
And then all of a sudden you are an inspiration to millions of people. Like,

60
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.680
how does what's the shift?

61
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.840
<v 1>Um, I think having kids, you know, so, um,</v>

62
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.400
got married and then Kanner was born and 93,

63
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.730
and then it's like, man, it's not cool being a loser dad. No.

64
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:55.420
I mean, that's not that, that, it's, it's one thing being a loser,

65
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.550
being a loser dad cut, cause now I'm affecting other people's lives.

66
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.140
And so I'm like, I thought I got a,

67
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.710
I got to be an example, you know, I gotta, I want my kids,

68
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.540
every parent wants their kids to,

69
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.990
to have more than they had and had a better life than they had. And so,

70
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.580
you know, my dad wasn't around and, uh, you know,

71
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:22.510
I always remember wanting him around and just, you know, wanting to see them.

72
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.230
So I'm like maybe that, and then it was, I,

73
00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:30.670
I think I wanted my kids, I wanted to challenge them. Um,

74
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.170
so I remember my first marathon, I also made Tanner.

75
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.450
He was seven and yes, it was 2002, I think.

76
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.210
Or he would have been no must. Yeah. I don't know. Anyway, he was young.

77
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.920
I think he just turned eight actually. And I made him do the half marathon.

78
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.390
So I ran the marathon. He did the half marathon at eight at eight Jesus,

79
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.960
the good gut, like 2 0 2, which is a good half marathon for,

80
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:00.100
especially for an eight year old.

81
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.230
So then I started introducing my kids to these challenges

82
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.190
cause I'm like, you know, I remember my life growing up and it,

83
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.290
it wasn't comfortable, but not, not a positive way. And I'm like, well,

84
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.770
I think these kids, if they don't have challenges introduced,

85
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:20.380
they're going to be soft. They're going to have it too easy. So I would,

86
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.970
you know, that's why they've,

87
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.450
they've run marathons and they've done these things is cause that's kind of how

88
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:29.770
they grew up. So I think it was kind of a combination of being a parent, um,

89
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.730
wanting my kids to have a successful path.

90
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.840
And then just saying, I didn't want to be a loser dad.

91
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.040
So just kind of evolved from there.

92
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.100
<v 0>Didn't it run a hundred miles with you ran,</v>

93
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.570
would he get to 80, 85 90 Jesus Christ? Isn't it?

94
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.960
<v 1>No, no. His will broke.</v>

95
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.350
<v 0>Yeah. I thought he had a knee.</v>

96
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.760
<v 1>Uh, probably. I mean, but yeah. I mean all sorts of happens, you know?</v>

97
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.480
I mean you heard, but no, he, uh, God, it was like,

98
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.580
that was just this past summer and you know,

99
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.930
cars running a hundred miles in 24 hours is that's something. I mean,

100
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:11.720
I could never do that at he's 22.

101
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.670
I think there's no way I could have done that then. I mean, it takes mental.

102
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.890
Usually don't have that mental strength until you're older.

103
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.910
You've been through life and you've been beat down and disappointed and had your

104
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:26.030
heart broken. That's when you get like, Hey, this pain is just temporary.

105
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:29.900
This is for one day I can get through anything for a day. Well, when you're 22,

106
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.250
it's like a point of reference. It's great. It's been gravy the whole time.

107
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.930
But to run a hundred miles in 24 hours is you can tell that to anybody and it'd

108
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:43.700
be like, God, dang, congratulations. You know? So he wanted to do that.

109
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:46.460
That was his goal. So I said, all right, I go,

110
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.310
if you get to 60 miles in 12 hours,

111
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.830
you can grind out 40 in the second 12. And I said, that would be good.

112
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.300
So he got to 60 miles and 12 hours on, on pace. Everything was good.

113
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.720
And it just to paint is like,

114
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.620
I think he got 31 miles maybe, or almost 31.

115
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:09.860
I think it was 90 point something just, you know,

116
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:11.660
he ended up taking,

117
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.620
trying to take a couple naps was in the truck for a while.

118
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.630
And I remember I'd be like, so what are we doing? I'd go by the truck.

119
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.470
Cause I never stopped. And uh, so it's a course.

120
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.390
It's at 1.1 mile loop, oh my God.

121
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.550
A hundred times do it for 24 hours. And so I'd come by and it'd be,

122
00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.780
I gave him a little bit, a little while to chill out and uh,

123
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.070
but then our back, what are we doing here? And whatever,

124
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.530
for whatever reason, he got 90,

125
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.060
which is still 90 miles is a long way.

126
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.800
That's a long feet. That's like San Diego, but it's not a hundred.

127
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.710
It's not Mexico. No, I'm like, so we, we joke around too. Cause I am,

128
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.640
you know, I'm supportive, but also, I mean, I,

129
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:09.650
I am how I am. So I'm like, I go, God, you couldn't have got 10 more miles,

130
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.120
10 more miles. And you would have been in the a hundred mile club. Cause he,

131
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.530
I got this little wood chip.

132
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:19.160
It's like the it's like the smallest little token you could get.

133
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.560
It's not even like Goggins coin right here,

134
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:26.300
but it's half the size as a wood chip. And it says, uh, 100 miles,

135
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:31.430
I'm like, Hey, do you have a chip like that? Oh no, no, no, no. You only got 90.

136
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.840
They don't make 90 mile chips. And so like we said, it's like,

137
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:40.250
God, that the worst part about that is to get those last 10,

138
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.060
you got to get the first 90 and that hurts. Right.

139
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:48.830
So I think he's gonna hit his big goal was to get a hundred miles,

140
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:53.090
a 24 hour, 24 hours if she didn't get, and then also qualify for Boston,

141
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:56.370
which he did. So I we're going to, um,

142
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.540
what do you have to do to qualify for Boston? Um, for his age, age group,

143
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.500
he had to run under three hours in a marathon.

144
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.300
So he ran the Eugene marathon in 2 57. Wow. So he qualified.

145
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.630
That's amazing. Yeah. That's a good run. Fast. Yeah.

146
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.800
Jamie shaking his head. Yes. He ran. That would have been,

147
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.190
that's like 6 44.

148
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.210
That's fast miles for 26. That's fast. Yeah.

149
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.780
So the world record, they're trying to get under two right under two. Yeah.

150
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.680
And they use the like special shoes and and those guys are amazing.
