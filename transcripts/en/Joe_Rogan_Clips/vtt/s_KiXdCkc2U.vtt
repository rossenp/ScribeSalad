00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So dude, this is get into this man.</v>

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.410
We had this conversation at the comedy store. I'm like,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.370
you got to come on the podcast.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.110
We gotta talk about this because you are a part of probably the most iconic

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.030
boxing interview of our day. You with Deontay Wilder,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.010
when Deontay Wilder freaked out on you, it became this huge,

7
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.900
huge thing too. To this day, to this day, to this day,

8
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.120
he puts it on his Instagram.

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:33.740
He puts it in hashtags till this day, sell.

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.250
<v 1>Sweatshirts with till this day on them.</v>

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.720
There's a store that's adjacent to the Barclay center.

12
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.360
It's connected to the Barclay center and it's full of.

13
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.670
It says to this day on it, he had a grand opening there. I was invited to it.

14
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.670
So that is an iconic meme. This is now a major part of my identity.

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.540
<v 0>Do people associate you with it though?</v>

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.310
Do they like automatically or did they just cause it's you're you see the side

17
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.920
of your face, but you see him angry as.

18
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.510
Arguably the scariest heavyweight of all time. I mean, Mike,

19
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:13.370
Tyson's right up there. Mike C.

20
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.500
<v 2>Off stick off ring.</v>

21
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.070
<v 0>Outside of the ring. Deontay is a sweetheart. He's a really nice guy.</v>

22
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.170
So to see him angry outside the ring is kind of weird because I had him

23
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:27.830
on the podcast. He couldn't be a nicer guy. He's true.

24
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.390
He's a really nice guy.

25
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.120
And so to see him angry at you to this day and like giving you crazy

26
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:38.450
eyes, that was like, oh, and when you explained it, it was like, yeah,

27
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.400
that's what you do in an interview. You, you,

28
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.470
you want someone to expand and say, what do you.

29
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.340
<v 1>Mean by that? Yeah. And listen, man, this is not like the first day we met.</v>

30
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.690
So it had just happened upon this heavyweight champion of the world screaming

31
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:55.400
and it decided to them off. We've had multiple conversations,

32
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.170
sat down for hours at a time. In fact, in Belfast, in Germany,

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.720
he, uh, or Ireland, I'm sorry, we sat down for an hour and I'm going.

34
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.640
So I'm going to give you the call,

35
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.100
give you the context of what I was thinking in the moment, right. Was onstage.

36
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.280
<v 0>Tell him, cause some people might not be aware of exactly what happened.</v>

37
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.500
So just try it. So there it is right there.

38
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.440
<v 1>In a couple of weeks, we're going to see it again. I don't know.</v>

39
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:20.210
We're going to see the exact same thing happened.

40
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.230
Seasonal Deontay Wilder is facing Tyson fury.

41
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.150
Tyson fury is a British gypsy. Okay. He's a boisterous,

42
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:36.950
very animated, a showman in boxing. Heavyweights, mind you,

43
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:41.900
these guys are giant. First time they met, this is December 18.

44
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.210
So, uh, I traveled the world covering boxing everywhere. Like I said,

45
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:51.260
I sat down with this guy in Ireland. I've covered Tyson fury in, uh, England.

46
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:54.590
I've covered them in America. I've covered boxing, literally everywhere.

47
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.970
So I'm familiar with what you also know that fighting even

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.270
sports boxing, MMA, there's a regional aspect to it.

49
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.910
Like everybody's culture brings something to it.

50
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.370
The Irish fighter feels like he's got a certain style.

51
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.940
He's got a certain history. He's got a claim to the warrior legacy.

52
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.640
Same for the British fighter. Of course the American fighter.

53
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.710
But both of these guys come from, what's like an underclass of their society.

54
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.993
Uh,

55
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.160
travelers gypsies in England are looked down upon these people

56
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.110
are cultural fighters.

57
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.340
And I don't mean necessarily just the oppression of being an underclass,

58
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.800
but fighting is part of their tradition.

59
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.930
Almost like it is to Mexicans in Mexico. It's something that they do that bonds.

60
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.420
The clan is they believe in the history of it.

61
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.030
Obviously Jonty waters from Alabama, you know, he's as dark as midnight.

62
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.140
He is a descendant of slaves for sure. Okay.

63
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.440
He's got a history coming to any fight,

64
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.420
bringing what he experiences in this country to this element of the

65
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.610
face off one, man, one man versus one man.

66
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:07.930
So when Tyson Fury's on stage during the press conference at something,

67
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.370
uh, possessed him to say, you know, I'm coming from a fighting people.

68
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.270
My people have been fighting for 200 years. Well in context,

69
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.770
he means that the culture of travelers of gypsies is one.

70
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.930
We're fighting, man. I'm a fighting man.

71
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.060
That's something that they say about themselves and each other.

72
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.370
So that's what he's bringing to this argument.

73
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:28.660
That's how he's challenging Wilder.

74
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.660
But Wilder takes that and says 200 years of fight.

75
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.980
My people have been fighting for 400 years. Of course,

76
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.840
he's talking about the black experience in America, slavery, all the all alike,

77
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.320
but mind you, he's talking to a British fighter.

78
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.320
He's talking to a world audience.

79
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.190
It's not like he's fighting Dominick Brazil. You know what I'm saying?

80
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.300
Where it's two Americans,

81
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.600
probably not going to get that much international attention.

82
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.430
The world's watching particularly communities that don't necessarily

83
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:04.930
know when a black man says 400 years. You know, I know, you know,

84
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.180
cause we grew up in a mountain. You know what we're talking about?

85
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.200
The world doesn't know that I travel the world. They're not just,

86
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.910
they're not steeped in black American history. I've had conversations with him.

87
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.770
He loves to talk about the plight of the black man in America

88
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:24.130
and how it relates to his career, how he feels, you know,

89
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:25.540
disadvantaged in certain ways.

90
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.200
And he carries the mantle and other ways he's a champion of black America in

91
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:32.470
certain ways. And he's a victim of white America and other ways.

92
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.940
So when I see this argument happening, I'm like, oh, okay,

93
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.260
well this is definitely a moment, but I'm not a pool reporter. Right?

94
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:43.600
So in this particular instance,

95
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.610
it's unusual for me to be part of the scrum is when they call it collection of,

96
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.390
uh, reporters, uh, everybody's kinda shouting questions out,

97
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:55.960
just trying to evoke responses. Usually I'm a one-on-one guy. I'll wait my turn.

98
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.190
Right. But on this particular day, you know,

99
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.060
you're the way I didn't have a hair cut. I wasn't really, I was coming.

100
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.850
I just got back from Dubai and went on to Dubai with like, you know,

101
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.880
Dave Chappelle, I'm hanging out it's after Thanksgiving. And he's like,

102
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:10.160
you know what? I'm going to kind of mail this one in, to be honest,

103
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.233
I'm thinking,

104
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.650
let me throw something out because I know what he's talking about.

105
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:18.410
And I also know that the audience around us in the world,

106
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:22.190
especially may not have caught that reference, but he is, he's a,

107
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:26.060
it's a high watermark right now. It's Thursday and the fight Saturday.

108
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.820
So he's amped up. Yeah. That's the other thing.

109
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.880
Fight week fighters are not themselves,

110
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:35.630
not the guy you were sitting across from doing the experience. Right.

111
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:37.130
You know what I mean? That guy was having a good day.

112
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.020
This guy has been waiting to fight for at least three months. If not,

113
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:43.550
you know, 10 weeks.

114
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.890
<v 2>Ramped up rant. Right.</v>

115
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.120
<v 1>He comes off stage. He answered a couple of other questions.</v>

116
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.720
And then just to be sure, because I've been doing this a long time,

117
00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:56.680
not an idiot. I know he's amped. And I want him to get the question clearly,

118
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.760
Deontay radio Raheem. I say my name.

119
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.390
So he knows who it's coming from. Not because he doesn't know me,

120
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:09.070
but because he does. So radio Raheem, you just said, uh,

121
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.160
your people have been fighting for 400 years. Okay. First of all,

122
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.870
I'm in the midst of my question. I don't do these things. Uh, uh,

123
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.320
haphazardly. I wear my questions very carefully. Yes.

124
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.150
But in the ears of black America later in this, later on the story,

125
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.110
you'll find out that your people, that part of the question became,

126
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:30.790
uh, incredibly important.

127
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.680
And people were very sensitive about that because you said your PR people

128
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.030
instead of our people, but I'm quoting the guy. Right? Okay.

129
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.500
I'm not speaking for him. I'm quoting what he said. He said,

130
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.990
my people have been fighting for years. So if he had said our people,

131
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.340
I would have said our people, but I can't take possession of your quote.

132
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.800
It's not me saying it, juicing it. Right?

133
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.200
Your people have been fighting 30 years. What did you mean by that? So,

134
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.240
uh, laser focus turns to me he's already at 10.

135
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.310
Like there's no ramp up at this time. And he started shouting my face,

136
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:16.600
like, uh, your people too, but you know what I'm talking about? He says,

137
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.710
don't try to bait, you know what I'm talking about when I say these things,

138
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:25.000
when I'm like, well, yeah, I do. Can you tell them what you're talking about?

139
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.110
And to get them to expand,

140
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.270
tryna get them to explain to the world what he said to me on

141
00:08:31.271 --> 00:08:35.440
numerous occasions, in different interviews and off camera.

142
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.240
I know exactly what he's talking about.

143
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.920
And I know that this is the moment that he finally gets to talk about it to

144
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:46.330
people who have never been listening to him before. But

145
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.900
we heard your it a trigger for him too. I'm so oblivious.

146
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:00.810
And I even looking back, I'm like, man, how did you miss that?

147
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.540
I D I swear to God, I didn't know what the was. The problem.

148
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.160
He starts seeing shout in your people. And I'm like, whoa, whoa.

149
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.520
It took me him. He couldn't eat. He needed to keep saying it.

150
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.540
They didn't know why he was saying that. Yeah. My people to my people too.

151
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.290
Oh, here's a moment. I'm like, oh,

152
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.470
I thought he sounded, oh my goodness. Oh no.

153
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.600
You know, our people have been fighting for 400 years to this day, to this day.

154
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:41.880
And so what I wanted, what I wanted,

155
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:45.420
what I thought was happening was that, okay,

156
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:49.680
this moment now has become about him.

157
00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.760
Like attacking me because he thinks I'm attacking him. He thinks,

158
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:56.910
because I do know what he's talking about. He knows we've spoken about it.

159
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:02.010
But numerous times he thinks I'm pretending not to now,

160
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.880
like some, you know, air quotes, uncle Tom, or you know,

161
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.330
the numerous names I've been called on the internet. Since,

162
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.100
as though I'm trying to pretend like, oh, I don't want 400 years.

163
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.250
I'm like, oh, okay. Okay. Okay, fine.

164
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.420
<v 0>So when he's screaming at you,</v>

165
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.380
what is going through your mind when he's hitting you with,

166
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.840
is it to this day or til this day? Cause there was a debate on that.

167
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.610
First of all, let's see, let's play it, play it.

168
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.170
<v 1>You know what I'm talking about? Y'all all know what I'm talking about, man.</v>

169
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.770
Don't sit up here and try to bait. It's not know what I'm talking about.

170
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:47.700
Y'all know what the I talk about when I say these things y'all are people to

171
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:52.440
explain it. I am not. Everybody knows what I'm talking about. Radio right here.

172
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:56.700
I don't have to explain. What's understood, man. You know what I mean? By that?

173
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.720
You know what I say about it? I ain't got to go farther. And if nobody,

174
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.140
if anybody don't understand that, then God be with them, go look up the history,

175
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.040
go look up the history, this ain't don't everybody believe in Google,

176
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.880
go Google that. See what I'm talking about? You know what I'm talking about,

177
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:14.640
man. You know what? I dare you to sit up there and say, he's explaining,

178
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:19.080
you know, what I'm talking about, man is fighting people. You know,

179
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:23.280
we've been fighting 400 still fighting to this date, to this date,

180
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.710
to this date. You just sit here.

181
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.090
You don't know what I'm talking about

182
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.050
of here, bro. Let's go, come on. Let's go.

183
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.370
You don't have to keep playing it. But just so you know,

184
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.390
there's more to this video. In fact, the last guy says, oh,

185
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.850
well we know we know what he's talking about.

186
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:52.500
That's what I just said at the end.

187
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.510
But that clip everyone in the world has seen.

188
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.950
It's very neatly on Instagram in a minute. Oh right.

189
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.480
So you missed the beginning and the end,

190
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.513
but.

191
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.740
<v 0>20 Or 19,</v>

192
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:13.540
or went to the new age of clips and things being taken out of context.

193
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:14.080
So listen.

194
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.950
<v 1>This is not the first time I've had an interview that has, you know,</v>

195
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.850
gotten a major tangent. Not the first time a fire has been off at me.

196
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.570
I knew that this was going to be a big thing.

197
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.120
I know people are going to talk about it, bro.

198
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:33.610
<v 2>I had no concept of what was about to happen to my</v>

199
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:34.450
night. Like.

200
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.330
<v 1>I'm like basically when you're a reporter like this, you're like, okay,</v>

201
00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:40.750
well that was dramatic. And we've got a hot one. I, I might get me a, you know,

202
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:44.420
a few hundred thousand, if not a million views, maybe like, yeah, we got,

203
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.780
we got the chip. But also I'm thinking, you know,

204
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:50.950
it's something of a success like, okay, we got him to express.

205
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:54.250
At least it is in that moment. Something that we don't usually see,

206
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.560
it's fight week. We talked to this guy a million times.

207
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.890
Everyone's had their interviews. He's been on every show.

208
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.850
And that was like the realest moment in the whole buildup. So for me,

209
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.820
that in and of itself is something of a victory. Like you,

210
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.680
you've created a moment here where.

211
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.870
<v 0>You got to see inside the Champ's heart. You got to see like.</v>

212
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.560
<v 1>His passion. When I get home though, I gotta take a nap.</v>

213
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.030
Like it's been a long day. It's good. So as, as these stories tend to go,

214
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.860
I'm woken up by chimes on my phone to team, to team, to take to things

215
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.930
going on in the interim. He's posted on Instagram,

216
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.250
just a minute of what is really like a two and a half minute interview where it

217
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:37.270
looks so bad. Like, um,

218
00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.870
paragraph essentially about having to like, you know,

219
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.310
teach people like basically not to be uncle Tom's and how you got it.

220
00:13:45.311 --> 00:13:48.700
Like she straightened it out and like there's a whole like civil rights

221
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:51.700
diatribe. And I'm the pin cushion.

222
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:59.230
I'm the straw man. I'm the guy. Oh my God. Uh,

223
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.980
I start to of course read the comms. I'm like,

224
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:07.840
well maybe is there any possible way? This is good, bro. Everybody's like,

225
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.183
that guy.

226
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.120
[inaudible] this like, oh no. Oh no.

227
00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.460
I'm also not like a stranger to criticism. Not a stranger.

228
00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:28.090
YouTube comes. I live on YouTube. It's one of the most vicious places on earth.

229
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.910
If you ever want to like, just get humbled.

230
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.850
If you ever feel in too big abides though, post a YouTube video,

231
00:14:33.851 --> 00:14:35.770
let it sit there for about an hour and then start reading the cons.

232
00:14:35.771 --> 00:14:38.410
I don't care who you are. It'll bring it down or not.

233
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.230
But this is another element, bro. Rihanna was like upset.

234
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:49.030
Like at me, I don't want Rihanna mad at me and even Oriana,

235
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:51.010
like why I don't want to start our relationship. This

236
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.720
doc who we all now know can be incredibly vicious

237
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.760
when he's upset at somebody over something.

238
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.790
<v 0>Yo, yo.</v>

239
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.210
<v 1>You teach that. So like yeah. You know, inward his plates like.</v>

240
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.880
<v 3>Bro Snoop, Don's mad at me.</v>

241
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.820
<v 0>What are you feeling when this is going on? How many knots are in your stomach?</v>

242
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.140
<v 1>Panicking? I'm panicking.</v>

243
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:26.200
I'm way more comfortable with him shouting in my face and having no idea whether

244
00:15:26.201 --> 00:15:30.610
or not like this can go any kind of way. But at least I understand the moment,

245
00:15:30.611 --> 00:15:33.550
like at least I'm in control of a half of it, right? This is a,

246
00:15:33.551 --> 00:15:38.110
this is a train on fire off the rails. You know what I mean? And the,

247
00:15:38.111 --> 00:15:41.380
of course the more people respond to it.

248
00:15:41.381 --> 00:15:45.130
Celebrities and you know, other fighters and alike,

249
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.660
the more emboldened he is to double down on it, like,

250
00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:53.950
hell this is a moment the fights not selling well, you know what I mean? Uh,

251
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.450
they've been given him stick overseas for not being known anywhere.

252
00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.240
They're saying you can walk down the street and you know,

253
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:04.690
Eddie Hearn to this video where he's asking people in New York, like,

254
00:16:04.691 --> 00:16:07.810
do they know Deontay Wilder? And he made a whole video of him saying no.

255
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.050
So at this moment I also have to give context of what's happening in his career.

256
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.090
At this moment, he's knocking everybody out. It's WBC, heavyweight champion.

257
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.180
He can't get the fight to unify. Like with Joshua,

258
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.140
they're saying he's a nobody essentially can't he's not worth the money because

259
00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:25.090
nobody knows who he is. He's fighting.

260
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.030
Arguably the toughest fight he could have possibly pit Tyson.

261
00:16:28.031 --> 00:16:31.870
Fury is an incredibly technical fighter. No one thinks of Deontay.

262
00:16:31.871 --> 00:16:33.580
Wilder's a technical technician.

263
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.950
Like they're thinking this guy's going to get out class.

264
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.580
He can lose his belts this way and not be making as Nick Denali made a ton of

265
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:43.660
money for that fight. So now that all his attention is on him.

266
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.650
And like I said, it's the subject he loves to talk about.

267
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.670
He's a hero. He's like a champion of black America in this moment.

268
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.150
I'm just sort of like collateral damage

269
00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.400
boost the out of that fight though. Ticket sales through the roof,

270
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.820
the F the moments viral it's everywhere.

271
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:08.830
People didn't even know the fight was happening until this meme just is

272
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.250
in their inboxes. People, people are like.

273
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.760
<v 0>To this day, meme is taking over the internet and it'll speak to your soul.</v>

274
00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.210
Yeah. Oh my, yeah.

275
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:25.390
<v 1>This became like the flagship moment for black</v>

276
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:29.680
woke people to tell like, you know, the black

277
00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.710
class Kermit.

278
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.790
<v 0>The it, oxygen, oxygen mask on. And it says,</v>

279
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.370
you still in your parents' phone me

280
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:42.670
to this day.

281
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.070
<v 1>Internet. The internet is so God funny. Oh my God,</v>

282
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:51.270
this point is kicking my.

283
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.490
<v 0>Oh. Um.</v>

284
00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.020
<v 1>Yeah. So as this thing gets bigger and bigger,</v>

285
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.680
uh, I started to realize that it's it's well out of my control.

286
00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:07.790
And then I have to start to think about what my role really is.

287
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.180
It's not about me.

288
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.460
It's not what I do is. And so that people can feel one way or another about me.

289
00:18:16.461 --> 00:18:17.930
It's really, again,

290
00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.440
taking myself back to that initial moment of showing them something about the

291
00:18:21.441 --> 00:18:22.880
fighter that they haven't seen.

292
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.970
Let's get a look inside this guy and get them to share something.

293
00:18:25.971 --> 00:18:30.440
Usually they just verbally that they didn't know or that he there wasn't,

294
00:18:30.441 --> 00:18:32.930
he didn't come to the room expecting to share. Right.

295
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:36.860
And I support people,

296
00:18:36.861 --> 00:18:39.860
understanding the culture from which he,

297
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:42.860
we come as black Americans.

298
00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.850
I w I wanted to give him the stage to do exactly that didn't turn out.

299
00:18:46.851 --> 00:18:51.500
Like I expected tonic, like civil rights,

300
00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:53.210
a guest type of moment. It,

301
00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:57.770
it became one of those things that people identify with black power,

302
00:18:57.771 --> 00:19:02.390
black information being like, yo, this is, this is what we're experiencing.

303
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.010
And this is how deep it still runs at that time in 2018. Did.

304
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.970
<v 0>You think about it? Like in retrospect, how could I phrase that better?</v>

305
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.720
I mean, I'm sure you did, right? What could you have said?

306
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.880
Cause you wanted to get that out of there.

307
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.480
You wanted to get him to S to expand on it. I.

308
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.710
<v 1>Think that it was exactly the right thing at the right time.</v>

309
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.510
I couldn't have predicted in a million years, it would have went that way,

310
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.560
but that's the way it was supposed to go. If I had phrased it, so-called better.

311
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.380
And he had given him more reason, thoughtful answer.

312
00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.700
We wouldn't be sitting here.

313
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.920
<v 0>He would've made less money to the fight.</v>

314
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.060
<v 1>Went and sold less tickets, less paper views. No, that when it went viral,</v>

315
00:19:44.061 --> 00:19:46.220
you wouldn't have gave a about my side of the story.

316
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.520
The moment doesn't exist. Right. Right. And that's the beauty of it. Well, you.

317
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.640
<v 0>Were telling me in the back of the comedy store, I'm like, oh, that's.</v>

318
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.070
<v 1>You right. Oh my God.</v>

319
00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.850
So the blessing and the angle on the camera work in,

320
00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:05.570
in some regard is some people don't know it's me.

321
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.150
And I'm so happy for that. Oh my God. And the,

322
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.260
but the ones who do there's enough who do, so I'm telling you Joe, every day,

323
00:20:15.261 --> 00:20:19.100
since then, it's been over a year. Now, someone somewhere,

324
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.040
every time I've left my home. And sometimes while I'm still in,

325
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:24.260
it has shouted in my face.

326
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.010
That's how they say hello. People don't even know my name.

327
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.770
Oh my God.

328
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.620
<v 0>God. Yeah. Oh my God.</v>

329
00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.560
<v 1>You know, Hey man, it's a godson really?</v>

330
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.850
It's something that captured everybody's attention in a,

331
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.860
and if there'd been anything else, I can't imagine how it would have done that.

332
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:51.450
Right.

333
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.650
<v 0>It wouldn't have no,</v>

334
00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:56.340
it had to be that crazy in his eyes because he's so ramped up,

335
00:20:56.341 --> 00:20:59.820
getting ready for that fight. And he's so angry. He takes the glasses off.

336
00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.690
I'm like, I remember watching, I was nervous. I was nowhere near him. Yeah.

337
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.990
You must've been your pants. Okay. But you know him, right.

338
00:21:06.991 --> 00:21:10.380
So you probably weren't your pants, but you probably like very uncomfortable.

339
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.730
I absolutely was.

340
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.780
<v 1>Not my pants. It wasn't. In fact, in the, in the exchange,</v>

341
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.950
I'm quite calm. I'm just trying on the one hand,

342
00:21:19.951 --> 00:21:24.060
I'm trying to figure out what's happening in the beginning because I didn't

343
00:21:24.061 --> 00:21:28.290
understand like the rage being directed at me for, I'm telling you for a minute.

344
00:21:28.291 --> 00:21:30.150
I thought he was just talking to white Americans. Like yeah. Get him.

345
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:44.190
Oh my goodness. This is, this is my bad. According to him. Oh my goodness.

346
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:54.690
So once he's like, you know, I'm done, man.

347
00:21:54.691 --> 00:21:57.120
Like he just walks off in disgust.

348
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.120
I been fight him 20 minutes later.

349
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:05.160
And I interview him again this time and much more calm and reason fashion.

350
00:22:05.161 --> 00:22:08.340
I let him lay out what it was about what I expect to happen the first time a lot

351
00:22:08.341 --> 00:22:11.700
of people who've seen it, not a fraction of the people who've seen that.

352
00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.700
I do know the guy, but as you know, these people are warriors man,

353
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.650
and their blood's running high and may, and he saw red light. At that time.

354
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.610
We weren't friends. We weren't homies. He didn't remember Belfast. He didn't,

355
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:30.450
he thought I was coming for him. So even though I know of him,

356
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:33.390
I don't know him. You know what I mean? I don't know.

357
00:22:33.391 --> 00:22:37.020
What's really going to happen in this moment. Right. It was doing my job.

358
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.450
Like I can't be afraid to do that. So whatever happened to this moment,

359
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.370
this is what's going to be, you got a great.

360
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.410
<v 2>Perspective on it though. You're so right.</v>

361
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.230
<v 0>That without that moment blowing up like that,</v>

362
00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.680
the fight doesn't become as big as it is. The meme doesn't exist.

363
00:22:49.681 --> 00:22:51.840
You don't become more popular. Right. Right.

364
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.990
<v 1>And he even did like a segment, but, uh,</v>

365
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:59.460
before a fight on Showtime where he like went through a black hair,

366
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:04.200
like a black history segment on show time because of this,

367
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:04.741
like,

368
00:23:04.741 --> 00:23:09.510
it actually created a moment that put him in position to

369
00:23:09.511 --> 00:23:14.430
be the kind of representative of that issue that he wanted

370
00:23:14.431 --> 00:23:18.510
to be. And it gave me an opportunity to be seen,

371
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.170
even though in a lot of quarters initially negatively,

372
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.700
I was also seen as the journalist who pulled that out, like,

373
00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.780
I'm the other guy, I'm the guy on the other side of that camera that yes.

374
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.800
Created that moment. And I've been doing this long enough to where my fan base,

375
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.140
people who know my work, what a stand me.

376
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:42.000
They know that I think they know I'm not an idiot. And then I,

377
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.430
I like to think they know I'm not a sell out,

378
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:49.010
but they really know me because I don't ever make it about me.

379
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.110
I don't like this interview we're having is a,

380
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.460
is a unicorn like I've maybe done three or four or five of these in my entire

381
00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:58.490
life where I'm talking about my perspective on anything.

382
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.470
I entirely showing up at every press conference, every fight,

383
00:24:03.471 --> 00:24:05.840
every way in every media workout,

384
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:10.610
trying to get something out of the fighter to be

385
00:24:10.611 --> 00:24:14.690
consumed by the audience in a way that maybe they hadn't seen it before,

386
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.250
not just for the audience's sake,

387
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.190
but I want the fighter to get in touch with something like there's so many of

388
00:24:19.191 --> 00:24:21.290
these platitude questions in the same old.

389
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.310
And nobody's really like digging deep. These aren't one dimensional characters.

390
00:24:25.311 --> 00:24:29.900
These are actual bowls. These aren't just gladiators are fathers. They're sons.

391
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.240
They're like they have civil rights issues.

392
00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:34.160
They have cultural things are bringing to this thing.

393
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:37.700
They have all like depression. We know all the things that fighters go through,

394
00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.260
but they only want to show you one side.

395
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.320
Cause they don't want to show any vulnerability and their fans.

396
00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:44.780
Aren't interested in anything other than who's up and who's down.

397
00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:48.890
If that's all you're feeding them. So I try to get out of the way.

398
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.950
I don't want to get in front of the work. So when people see me in this light,

399
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.550
a lot of people just like, oh, this guy must be a uncle, Tom, then

400
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.760
Snoop dog thing. So clearly that's who this guy is.

401
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.840
Have you touched the Snoop since I taught this new thing, he just like,

402
00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:09.560
what about Instagram? That's what I'm saying. Oh no.

403
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.530
But I have talked to Wilder many times since then. And to this guy's credit,

404
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.400
never even, even the, even the 20 minutes after you're right.

405
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:21.230
We didn't know each other. We do have a history.

406
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.300
And he is now knowing the moment they created and knowing what he did to

407
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:30.260
me in that moment has always been especially gracious.

408
00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.590
He's always been especially helpful. I can always get access to them.

409
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.000
We have a bond now, like we share this thing and it's trickle,

410
00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.470
no matter what happens, you know what I mean? Oh my goodness. Yeah.
