00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.200
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Santaia became, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.160
a scam after a while. Like I was raised in santaaria from the age of five.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.240
I had little disturbances. When my dad died, I was weak. I didn't,

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.280
they didn't put me into santaaria to be a witch doctor, explain santaaria.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.920
<v 1>To people. Who't know what.</v>

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.150
<v 0>It's a religion that originated in African Nigeria.</v>

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.390
And then the slaves brought it over to Cuba.

8
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.470
They hit it from the plantation owners through Catholicism.

9
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.470
So that's why there's a lot of cross. It's kind of a mixture.

10
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.430
<v 1>Of African and.</v>

11
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.950
<v 0>Catholic Catholic religion. When I was five,</v>

12
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.430
I was brought up to 140 eighth street and this lady had a C,

13
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:45.020
C a dog. And I loved the Collie. I loved dogs and I was allergic to them.

14
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.020
So when I was playing with the dog,

15
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700
she would talk to me and I fell in love with this woman.

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.380
I fell in love with her. She was like my mother. And then as I got older,

17
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.900
one that they asked me, do you want this? Do you want that? Do you want, uh,

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.690
get wa which is the first one you UN, uh,

19
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.010
yo Romero.

20
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:08.690
Those are the first things you get and you put 'em by your door and they

21
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.690
guarantee, you know, your safety. For me,

22
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:15.730
it was health that big black woman is my godmother. Okay.

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.130
Uh, and then after that, when I was six,

24
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.000
they finally said they were gonna initiate me and &lt;affirmative&gt; mother, because

25
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.400
my spirit took my father. Wow. So they wanted my godmother.

26
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.040
They wanted me and my mother to be twins in the santaaria.

27
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.120
So I made Saint on 140 eighth street in Broadway. And,

28
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.280
but for me it wasn't to be a killer or to be anything like that. I can't carry,

29
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.350
I can't go in cars with strange people. I can't do business with three people.

30
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.950
I can't say I hope Jamie gets hit by a car.

31
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.590
I'm not allowed to say all those things.

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.230
I don't use it the way in the late seventies.

33
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.590
Why can't you do business with three people?

34
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.710
Because two of them were saddled up against you.

35
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.950
And that's the same thing that happened to me on my kidnapping. &lt;laugh&gt; I,

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.780
somebody with three people, I can't stay in anything. &lt;laugh&gt; look at my life.

37
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.140
Now, look at my life. When I was smart and white powder,

38
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.860
my Saint in my head is control.

39
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:14.380
Like that's why I always wear a white t-shirt on Mondays.

40
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:16.260
It's the day of the day. Why you.

41
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.820
<v 1>Always wear a white t-shirt on Monday.</v>

42
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.060
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; look at my shoes that white on white, always.</v>

43
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.650
When I step outta the shower, I walk onto a white shower, shower, Matt,

44
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.250
every day, every day, every day, I I'm still very santaary in my head.

45
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.530
I wasn't, when I was doing the Coke,

46
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.330
because I knew I wasn't allowed to what happened in the,

47
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.810
in the mid seventies with santaaria was I would pay you to tell me what you

48
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.690
wanted to hear. Listen,

49
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.120
I gotta a big cargo coming in from Columbia with 200 kilos.

50
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.040
What would the saints say? I do it's religion.

51
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.480
They don't transport blow &lt;laugh&gt;.

52
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.760
But these people got enamored with it. &lt;laugh&gt; so it was like, you know,

53
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.760
uh, you know, I want to kill Joe Rogan. Let me put his spouse.

54
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:06.880
You're supposed to, yeah.

55
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.440
Write your name on a thing and then take a tongue and put the in the cow's

56
00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:15.440
tongue. Like there was a big story when I was a kid for Dohi. One of, uh,

57
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.440
Doy's story that he's in the book, he's omega seven that I didn't know,

58
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.950
oldest growing up, he went to court one time and his godmother made a powder.

59
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.310
And before the judge went to make a verdict, sheplayed the power and the thing.

60
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.910
And the judge couldn't remember &lt;laugh&gt; what the he was about to say.

61
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.350
So I had dismissed the case &lt;laugh&gt; and she became a star after that every

62
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.020
criminal wanted to give a thousands of dollars. What was the powder?

63
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.780
Like a thing they made there's a movie they called years ago. It was, uh,

64
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.820
the devil's advocate with, uh, with, uh, Kaino, Reeves and Patino. Yeah.

65
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.460
And there's one scene where he has to go protect the guy.

66
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:54.820
The guy's a santaaria guy,

67
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.540
New York is prosecuting him because he's killing animals without a license.

68
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.410
And he goes, watch this. He takes a tongue out. He puts the tongue down.

69
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.290
He blast the tongue with like a thing. And then he says,

70
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.050
he asks the guy what's the judge's name?

71
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.850
And the judge gave him his name and he took the tongue and they roll it with

72
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.570
nails. And then they put it away and they go, don't worry about tomorrow.

73
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.970
The next day at court,

74
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.690
the judge starts to talk and he goes into a coughing spree.

75
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.680
You can't talk. Now that person looks like a hero.

76
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.160
These are all subtle coincidences that these

77
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.560
specs were fueled by now. So now I gotta, I want, I gotta have a big week,

78
00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:37.920
Joe Rogan. What does the Saint say? And you get four pieces of coconut.

79
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.870
You throw 'em on the floor and the Saint say, this is gonna be your week.

80
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.950
Let me give you $20,000. So now drug dealers started doing it with Noriega.

81
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:49.070
Got busted. He had santaaria in his closet.

82
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.390
Fadedel was well known for santaaria in his closet. His allt dudes. Well,

83
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.790
they have a, you have a special, you have an, you have an altar.

84
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.990
I made a promise. When I lived in that apartment that have got, if about,

85
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.940
I got me a house here, a have his own room, go to my house.

86
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.300
&lt;laugh&gt; my Saint is in my office right behind me all. I have an altar.

87
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.180
I'm not Cuban. I have an alt. And I also have a, if you, if you.

88
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.140
<v 2>Get into the Cuban thing, you, it will get you. It will get you.</v>

89
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.500
It will get you at some. So you from reading, this book created an altar. I,

90
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.100
I have a.

91
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.380
<v 0>I have an, you have, have to have an, you have to havewise my Isha, it Isha.</v>

92
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:22.810
He a little boy. Why did you do this?

93
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.530
<v 2>It's a belief system. And well, why did you do this?</v>

94
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:30.210
Cause you can't really understand the culture unless you embrace it on some

95
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.530
level. You understand it and live it unless you live, continue it.

96
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:34.310
Even after the book.

97
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.080
<v 0>Oh yeah.</v>

98
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.530
I've had people talk to me when I've thrown cards about you throw cards about

99
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:43.720
me. When, when people have done, my reading mentioned you in my readings,

100
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:47.880
really? That you're around the, you baai's son all the way to the end.

101
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.760
What does that mean? Oh, batai on oldwise Saint.

102
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.160
He has 24 different passages.

103
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.440
He goes my passages or yaguna that's the one you don't want around.

104
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.880
&lt;laugh&gt; cause they were supposed to put Chago in my head, but Toty me down.

105
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.960
I was that Chogo son Chogo means thunder. Yeah.

106
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.400
Whenever you see thunder and that's Chogo drum Chogo is a bad and a woman.

107
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.480
You can't kill mice around him.

108
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:18.150
They behead of him because a mouse woke him up and he woke up and oh, it's.

109
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.910
Look, I get, and you.

110
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:22.750
<v 2>You have no idea. Chananggo is the drum, the Congo drum, the drums,</v>

111
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:25.670
which is the thunder, you know, summoning the thunder. Yeah. So.

112
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:27.910
<v 0>They put a bottle line in my head to calm me down.</v>

113
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.350
I'm not supposed to carry weapons. I can't have knives on me.

114
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.990
I can't get into arguments. My mother in this saying there's OUN.

115
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.260
She's just a. &lt;affirmative&gt; she's just a Aun is the horrorre of the saints.

116
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.780
She gave him her kids to, yeah, my raise.

117
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.620
If you have problems with your stomach or you want to have a kid,

118
00:06:46.621 --> 00:06:49.340
you have to pray to all tune, you know?

119
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.940
But the women's saints are worse than the male saints.

120
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.380
You don't around with the women's saints cuz they will your world.

121
00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.290
<v 2>Tune is probably Mary.</v>

122
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.290
<v 0>Magdalene, right? Yes. And yeah, my, yeah. I sent a message to my mother.</v>

123
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.210
My mother didn't do it. My mother died. Oh, you know?

124
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.290
<v 1>So how the do I fit into santaaria &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

125
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.730
<v 2>What, what do.</v>

126
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.330
<v 0>You, you throw a couple years ago, I rather read.</v>

127
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.010
And some guy told me that you have a couple strong about a lot of people in your

128
00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:20.280
life and that's that from you? You're an older, wiser guy.

129
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.520
You're not violent. You're very controlled.

130
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:28.160
You're a lot more controlled than I am, which is more of a,

131
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.600
I gleaned towards the Chogo phase. My, my father child,

132
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.080
my main thing is a Yaa. A Yaa was the young batah.

133
00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:40.270
He's the one that took a sword and wiped it on his chest with red.

134
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.190
And they asked him why, uh, did he like to kill? And he said,

135
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:49.710
because blood makes change something stupid. He,

136
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:54.510
he has, but I don't practice that. I don't. My law is very calm,

137
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:00.060
but one, one guy goes sees her. He's a badass mother mentioned,

138
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.420
didn't mention your name. Didn't need, they don't need to mention names to me.

139
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.500
Once they tell me, I already know what they're talking about.

140
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.020
I already know what they're talking about. So I still go get readings.

141
00:08:12.021 --> 00:08:14.980
Like when I go to Miami, next time I go to my godmother, see, this is.

142
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.260
<v 2>The reason I a good thing on my head. I still follow it.</v>

143
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.740
This is the reason I still follow.

144
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.170
You are asking me I why I would still follow it.

145
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.930
It's because once you get to an understanding of the idea that there are certain

146
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.730
spirits within you and the O the res represent different spirits.

147
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.290
Once you understand that that's not something you throw away.

148
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.010
Even if you don't follow the religion anymore, you stillbel,

149
00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:40.360
you still have belief in that. You still believe in that.

150
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.000
So my ishia is eliua eliua is the Saint

151
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.880
he's a trickster. Eliua is a trickster, plays, little tricks.

152
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.600
And also the Saint of passages. So people put eliua above their door,

153
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.240
cuz you're passing from one room into another room.

154
00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.440
And so you identify with that spirit and that becomes part of your.

155
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.160
<v 0>Identity and you can't whistle in the house. Why? If you have LA,</v>

156
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.600
why you can't whistle in the house? Yeah, I don't whistle.

157
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.480
You can't go in the house cuz he'll leave.

158
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.320
So you can't whistle in &lt;laugh&gt; you can't whistle.

159
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.910
No. Wow. Like when I was a kid, I'd sit at the table and do yeah,

160
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:22.790
you can't whistle &lt;laugh&gt; my mom would go touch that table. And again,

161
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.670
I'd wake your head. Cause God lives in the table. &lt;laugh&gt;

162
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.710
now Joe, I grew up in it. They made Saint in me like the,

163
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:37.700
when, when I made Saint was a in November and they did it up in the Bronx river.

164
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.940
So they had to break the ice and they were darkskinned Cubans.

165
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.660
And I'll never forget that they rip your clothes off and then they take whatever

166
00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:49.420
your Saint is. They hit you with the number of water. So if your Saint is five,

167
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.740
you get hit with five things of water and they dry you up. You're freezing.

168
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.570
And when I saw them rip my mother's clothes, I was about five I'm like, you,

169
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.090
black. &lt;laugh&gt;. And I started running down Bronx Boulevard.

170
00:10:01.091 --> 00:10:04.330
They had to chase me and bring me back. I didn't wanna do it.

171
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.010
It's an all night ceremony. It's all night on a Friday.

172
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.450
It's crazy all night on 12 hours long. Oh my God, you sleep.

173
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.210
And then Sunday is when they read your future to you.

174
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.600
And then for a week you just live in a corner, white, they paint your head.

175
00:10:19.601 --> 00:10:23.320
You're bald. So I had to go back to school on Monday, balded with a hat.

176
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.360
They said he's not allowed in here with a hat.

177
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:29.400
My mother gave the principal a small nickel and I was allowed to wear the hat

178
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:30.280
from nine to three.

179
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.320
But then at three o'clock I had to go home and change into white clothes for a

180
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:37.870
year. Not allowed for a year. I had to dress in white now for a year,

181
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.550
a year &lt;laugh&gt; so for my cause I would just have to wear bills,

182
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.230
white socks and white t-shirt cuz I was a kid.

183
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.590
I can't keep wearing white every day. I'm I'm ripping. Right?

184
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.910
So now your hair has to grow back. So when I walk into, I don't,

185
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:56.750
there's a ton of Santa in LA. Really? I don't deal with it at all.

186
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.940
Cuz it's all the same thing. Like everything else in LA,

187
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.460
it's a bunch of white people who didn't grow up and,

188
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.220
and there's a hot black guy and they want to really just suck his Dick.

189
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.900
And he's telling about spirits. I saw a video today. I saw a video thing.

190
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.180
I'm like shame on them. It's all confus.

191
00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.580
It's like those white chicks that sucked at him.

192
00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:20.010
Do Dick when they go to hot yoga. Yeah know that guy. That's some bro Brum,

193
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.073
Brum is a pig.

194
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:25.490
&lt;laugh&gt; he got his bunch of white chicks with humish flavor in their mouth from

195
00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:30.090
sucking that Bru Dick. Well, he, he gets to me inside.

196
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.970
You suck that, that Dick &lt;laugh&gt; that smells like hummus chips, you know?

197
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.960
And that's what it is in LA. Like I've been in my I to two parties.

<v 0>In a role. It was histe and this is what it is here.</v>

220
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.860
It's more of a, of a, you know like whenever I,

221
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.980
the guy that I, the guy that gives me the reads is tremendous.

222
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.210
I'm gonna tell you this man to man. Tremendous,

223
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.930
really tremendous. I even took Duncan to him. Tremendous. You took.

224
00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:00.890
<v 1>Duncan to him. Oh yeah. I.</v>

226
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.170
The problem with him is I don't like his, the people around him. Yeah.

227
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:11.730
He has too many people that don't know when I join this,

228
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.040
I knew what I was getting myself into. Right. You know what I'm saying?

229
00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:18.200
Like I knew, I knew I liked it. It had nothing to do with my mother.

230
00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.680
It was to do with my godmother and it was my relationship with her. In fact,

231
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.280
my mother couldn't even say to me in front of my godmother. When,

232
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.520
when in 85? I I, my, when, when I moved in with the benders,

233
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.000
I couldn't bring my santaaria with them.

234
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:37.950
They D so I left it with this gay guy named Martin,

235
00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:42.630
the man mariun &lt;laugh&gt; he sold Coke at night. And he was, uh,

236
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.910
he was uh, uh, a seamstres in the daytime for a big New York play.

237
00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.030
But when I was a kid, he would go to cbsgs every night and sell Coke.

238
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:53.630
He was all these walking around today should give thanks to Martin.

239
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.580
Cause he was getting this Keith knocked out in black highs back in the seventies

240
00:13:57.581 --> 00:14:00.700
cuz he was gay. But right. I liked Martin. I ended up my,

241
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.540
I left my saints Martin and then years later I ended up Robb Martin

242
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.580
in my cocaine hellle. So my godmother asked me in 90 and 85,

243
00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:14.220
where's your saints. I go there in Martin's house. She goes, you know,

244
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:17.170
you're not supposed to have you were saying to the gay man's house.

245
00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.090
I'll go get 'em listen to me. I never saw my godmother again. After 95, I did a,

246
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.130
I talked to Duncan about santaaria and some company approached me from London

247
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.370
and I did their santaaria podcast. And I got an email on Twitter.

248
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.600
We know who has you saints? They're in Miami, 34 years later,

249
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.400
I flew to Miami. I got my Sans. You flew to get 'em. I flew to get 'em.

250
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.560
I shipped him back. You know how my godmother got him to Miami out on a bus.

251
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:51.120
Whoa. So six cases on a bus with all your future and your stuff.

252
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.560
I got my notebook. And if you look at my notebook,

253
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:58.880
I'll bring my notebook next time. And you reading you'll go, Joe, &lt;laugh&gt; they?

254
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:10.510
