00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.520
<v 0>Listen. Do you have any like, um, marriage advice?</v>

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.120
Like I've been married for coming up on five years? I have a two year old.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.600
My wife wants to have more children.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.240
I just bought a new house living in a brand new house, in a new town. Well,

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.080
you got a.

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.040
<v 1>Lot of things going on that are pressure points, right? It's.</v>

7
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.270
<v 0>Like living the American dream a little, little bit.</v>

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.390
I'm very happy with my family. They're wonderful people. I love them, but like,

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.710
I wanna sustain this. I have a great thing.

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.270
I'd like to put my arms are in and keep like, God, this is so great.

11
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.510
I don't want it to, to go away.

12
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.430
<v 1>Well, just that attitude alone, your, your awareness of how special it is,</v>

13
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.590
you know, you are doing the thing that everybody thinks of.

14
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:40.430
When they think about like fulfillment in life,

15
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:44.580
you're really a child you're having children. Yeah. You're, you know,

16
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.780
you're engaged in this intense relationship with another human being.

17
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.820
We've created a person. All those things are, those are giant, man.

18
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.901
Those are giant.

19
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:57.700
And also you're engaged in an activity that 50% of the people fail &lt;laugh&gt; and

20
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:01.140
then they fail at it. goes down hard, man. It goes down hard.

21
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.210
It's screaming and swearing and lawyers.

22
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.210
<v 0>Of all the levels of failure in life. Like there's nothing more, no failure,</v>

23
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.810
more impactful than a divorce. I.

24
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.330
<v 1>I've met. I, I mean,</v>

25
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.650
I have so many friends that have been fired from jobs and it's not fun.

26
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.610
It's not good, but they bounce back. Yeah.

27
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.530
<v 0>You bounce back. They.</v>

28
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.360
<v 1>The I've seen guys lose who they are from divorce.</v>

29
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.080
I've seen it happen. Um, I've talked about this too many times,

30
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.320
but it is a true story.

31
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.760
I have a friend who has been divorced to a woman for 14 years.

32
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.200
He's been married to a new one for 12. He has family.

33
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.640
He has children with this new woman. It's over with the old one.

34
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:43.790
He still pays her every. And is that possible?

35
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.630
No children. Cuz he her so hard. She can't work.

36
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.910
&lt;laugh&gt; it's because it's crazy.

37
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.110
Cuz the laws are insane. The laws are insane. They don't make any sense.

38
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.270
We're not talking about a woman who is like 80 years old and can't work anymore

39
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:05.180
either. We're were talking about a completely, you know,

40
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.220
viable human being dude. It's bananas. It is.

41
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.380
<v 0>Bananas for that to flip. Like you said, when, when back to like the,</v>

42
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.060
I do thing, like when you say I do, there's never, I did have a buddy who,

43
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.820
when he said I do and they turned around, she looked mad and he looked scared.

44
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.410
&lt;laugh&gt; why was she mad? I probably that, that she, he didn't say it, right?

45
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.250
Yeah. He didn't say that. He didn't say it. Right. Well,

46
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.890
I just say that I wanna be like a movie.

47
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.730
<v 1>And some people just don't they're not supposed to be together,</v>

48
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:36.450
but they think they should be with somebody. Yeah.

49
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.330
So they find somebody and they talk that someone into doing something insane.

50
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.800
Yeah.

51
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.010
Like signing a legal contract that says you're gonna be together forever and I

52
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890
until.

53
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.960
<v 0>Death. But see like,</v>

54
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.520
but my problem is a very lucky problem that I've got something that,

55
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.360
that at least in this like early years, this seems to be the right thing. Right.

56
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.440
&lt;laugh&gt; love you, honey. Love you.

57
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.960
<v 1>Honey. Hope you ain't listening. Odd. She made it this far. What are we?</v>

58
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.880
Two hours. And what? 30 minutes. Yeah.

59
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.120
<v 0>She ain't she's she's she's got a two year old by herself at home. She ain't,</v>

60
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.640
she.

61
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.200
<v 1>Checked out. Love you babe. Long time ago.</v>

62
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.400
<v 0>But I like, you know, my challenge right now is I think about life. I'm like,</v>

63
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.600
I got this wonderful, beautiful thing. Yeah. And I'm just distress.

64
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.480
Is that I'm gonna it up.

65
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.480
<v 1>Well, that is um, always the stress.</v>

66
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.910
And I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of marriages fail is because of

67
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:24.070
this intense pressure of the relationship, you know,

68
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.910
like there's a finality and, and I understand the need for this finality, right?

69
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:31.390
There's a need for this contract and that the everything locked down.

70
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.670
If you're a woman, you can't like you, when you're raising children,

71
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.660
you need help. Right. You need the man to be there to help if you raise it,

72
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:43.020
hopefully. Yeah. But you also need financial help. It's difficult. You know,

73
00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:44.020
it's it's this is all,

74
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.220
it makes sense that there a woman would wanna lock things in. Yes.

75
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:52.820
Like that it makes sense. It's also a weird cultural tradition, right?

76
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.060
It's this weird thing that we have this law. Like we, we,

77
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.330
we bring the law involved relationships and it's, it's very strange,

78
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.290
like legal contracts. Yeah. And some of 'em are preposterous. Right?

79
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.690
&lt;laugh&gt; like sometimes you see a guy who looks like Rupert Murdoch. Right.

80
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.250
And he's got this banging wife and she's like 30 years old and she's got big.

81
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.730
Or how about Harvey Weinstein and his wife she's in it for the right reason.

82
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.440
And you're like, Hey son, I, I see what happened here. &lt;laugh&gt; but he sees.

83
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.920
<v 0>It too. He can't believe of course he sees it too. It was his whole business.</v>

84
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:28.160
When they say I do. They're like, well, okay, well this.

85
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.640
<v 1>Is when you have a, where we are disgusting, Trudy type, you know,</v>

86
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.520
just gelatinous looking job of the hut looking man and a,

87
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.000
a beautiful, hot young wife,

88
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.910
cuz the guy's got in cajillions that's a normal thing. And they're both enters.

89
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.190
Don't put up any pictures.

90
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.430
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; but they're both going those folks. There was,</v>

91
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:53.510
were both going into that, knowing like, Hey look,

92
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:55.310
this isn't a traditional or pairing.

93
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.390
<v 1>Or maybe he was really sweet with her and that's all she needs. Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:02.620
Maybe she's just this rare soul that if he had $5 in his pocket,

95
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.780
she'd be super happy with him. Doubt. It could be doubt it.

96
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.700
I would doubt it as well. Doubt it as like a. I would doubt it. doubt it.

97
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.220
Um, it's a preposterous union in the first place. It's listen.

98
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.700
There's some relationships that you could define as legal prostitution.

99
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.410
They are absolutely legal prostitution.

100
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.490
A woman has made determination that she'll let this sloth shoot fluid into her

101
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:31.370
vagina. &lt;laugh&gt; on an intermittent basis.

102
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.130
If she could be bathed in diamonds and drive a Ferrari and live in a mansion and

103
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:38.090
this is a normal part of life.

104
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.850
<v 0>Some people would say, and I might even say like,</v>

105
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:42.560
as long as they're consenting and they're both aware that's going on then?

106
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.480
<v 1>Well, that would be a good argument for prostitution as well though.</v>

107
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:45.920
Wouldn't it? It's.

108
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.440
<v 0>A bit of a transaction, I guess. I don't know. It's a transaction. Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:50.960
I guess you transaction. Yeah. I guess when you look down at it, it's right.

110
00:05:50.961 --> 00:05:51.600
That way I've.

111
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.880
<v 1>Always said, why is it okay to give someone a massage? You give some massage,</v>

112
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.800
but you can't, you can't even jerk 'em off. &lt;laugh&gt; like &lt;laugh&gt;,

113
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.120
it's not legal. That's weird. The government decides who can touch your penis.

114
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.560
And like if the, the massage therapist said, Hey,

115
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.600
I really enjoy giving you a massage.

116
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.680
Let's go somewhere afterwards of my own free will. And I'll jerk you off.

117
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.400
<v 0>I'd be like, that'd be fine. That's fine. That's you're right.</v>

118
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.110
You just can't do it. Right. Confines of the massage parlor.

119
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.590
<v 1>It's a public health issue. I imagine if like,</v>

120
00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.870
if load smelled like gunshots and you were &lt;laugh&gt; you go to

121
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.630
massage power, it smells like a shooting range.

122
00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:32.350
Like a is going on in this place. This is a dirty massage place. I am I'm.

123
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.310
<v 0>Out pew, pew, pew.</v>

124
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.543
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;</v>

125
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.220
Imagine load, smell like sulfur Jesus. The devil's coming out. Boy.

126
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.380
<v 0>The devil purify that man. Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.620
<v 1>I mean there's a lot of laws that are ridiculous, but there's,</v>

128
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.460
there seems to be some someone here.

129
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.730
<v 0>Is the marriage advice I'm looking for. &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

130
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.290
<v 1>I got it. Maybe it was what we were talking about earlier.</v>

131
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.090
Maybe it's long form conversations, having long conversations with.

132
00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.370
<v 0>Each other, having long respect,</v>

133
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.250
like respecting the fact that you can get through some of this stuff in a very

134
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:09.410
short time. I I've always said like,

135
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:12.050
I appreciate a nice road trip for that reason. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.

136
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:12.600
Cause you can't.

137
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.530
<v 1>Yeah. Hanging out with each other for long periods of.</v>

138
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:14.971
<v 0>Time. Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:14.971 --> 00:07:19.160
Like I'd much rather the stress of an airport with a kid and is not I'd much

140
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:22.000
rather just drive it mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and take the time cuz you get this

141
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.040
like connection. If you can get the phones outta the way. Yep.

142
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:25.761
For the passengers,

143
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:27.760
you just get this connection that you wouldn't get otherwise.

144
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.880
<v 1>Yeah. Doing things together that are unique, that that helps, you know yeah.</v>

145
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:32.920
Experiencing things together.

146
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:36.480
But also you also have to both have the mindset that you enjoy each other's

147
00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:39.030
company. Yeah. And you wanna make it work good. Yeah.

148
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.030
I mean some people just don't man, and this is, I mean,

149
00:07:42.031 --> 00:07:45.150
we've all seen that happen. Right? We've all seen relationships with the girls.

150
00:07:45.151 --> 00:07:49.190
Just like check please. Yeah. And the guy's like, baby, I'm different, but.

151
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:51.310
<v 0>It's a 50, like you said, it's a 50 50 thing.</v>

152
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.110
So like you have been married for quite some time. And,

153
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.950
and we were talking about prior, when we were shooting our bows out there,

154
00:07:56.951 --> 00:07:57.790
like you're, you know,

155
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:02.060
like there's things you've done to make it work like you like your wife and she

156
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.860
likes you and it works. And it's been working for a long time.

157
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.660
And like the percentages say that's that's what'd you say 50 50

158
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.260
is, is it's.

159
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.700
<v 1>Chris rock had a great joke about it. You said he goes 50% of the people leave.</v>

160
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:19.420
He goes, he goes, but how many cos just

161
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.130
Look, relationships don't always work. But here's the thing.

162
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.090
You don't always know who the you are. Yeah.

163
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.290
And I'm a different person than I was five years ago. Yeah.

164
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.850
I just am I'm I hope I'm a better person.

165
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.960
I'm trying very hard to be a better person. I certainly know more about myself.

166
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.800
I understand myself better. This is a long slow process.

167
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.640
I think we are all a work in progress. That's right.

168
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.640
And not everybody engages in this work. So you could be a,

169
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:59.560
a person who's on this path of, you know,

170
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:04.000
being present and, and trying to be kinder and trying to improve.

171
00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.440
And then you have a spouse, male or female that just on you.

172
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.960
And I've seen that too, man. I've seen me too really brutal,

173
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.190
toxic relationships where they insult and,

174
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:19.550
and say rude things around your friends to try to with you and,

175
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.830
and people get into these, these relationships where they,

176
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.550
where they genuinely hate each other. Yeah. But.

177
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.310
<v 0>They're stuck together. And what that does to children too. Cuz I, I,</v>

178
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.110
I tell my dad, I wrote my dad this letter recently, this is getting real deep.

179
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.820
Our number three of the podcast, we get real deep or pro nuance. Um,

180
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.500
I, I sent it to my dad, but he won't listen to this,

181
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:44.340
but I wrote this letter that was like, listen man. Cause I,

182
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.900
I had seen recently like his developing relationship with my son and like

183
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.340
it shock it, it put this thought in my head that, you know,

184
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.650
my relationship with my had like his caring for me,

185
00:09:56.651 --> 00:09:57.890
the fact that he stayed with my mom,

186
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.770
then they developed this like place for me to grow and nurtured me and allowed

187
00:10:02.771 --> 00:10:05.450
me to become a person in that environment.

188
00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:08.210
Like there was a north star for me when then I left that environment.

189
00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:12.130
Like I always, I never wondered what my path was gonna be.

190
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.890
I always could look up and be like that bond that I developed in my family there

191
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.640
for me is like the thing that I'm always, you know, I'm looking back to,

192
00:10:19.641 --> 00:10:22.920
but also looking forward to because that's what defines me.

193
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.600
And regardless of what I do, I can always fall back on that,

194
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:29.520
that my dad loves me. My mom loves me. I love them.

195
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.520
And I grew up like with this strength of soul because I knew I don't have,

196
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.480
I have friends that came from the same place that I,

197
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.150
I did same town I did in Maryland that OD'ed on heroin.

198
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:44.910
They lived in the same little suburb suburbia community that I did.

199
00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.750
They had parents that were the same age. They went to the same high school.

200
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:51.030
They lived in the same environment. They went down one way.

201
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:56.030
I went down another and I truly do feel that that me going down that

202
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:59.780
way was, is the way my parents like built a structure around me.

203
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:02.900
That was always about that bond and that love and the things that they provide.

204
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:04.380
That's very, very fortunate. It was very.
