00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's a,</v>

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:06.210
we're in a weird place where people that might listen to this someday. Uh,

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.850
no one knows who the president is right now. Um,

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.960
the election has been went on last night,

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.590
but it hasn't been decided and it might not be decided for three or four days.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.770
They think that Pennsylvania is the big one. And, uh,

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.190
they don't know who's going to win Pennsylvania. And if he wins Pennsylvania,

8
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.270
apparently he wins. Maybe if he wins one other state in Pennsylvania, he wins.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.500
But if he loses Pennsylvania Biden wins and, um, it could.

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200
<v 1>Be real weird. Do you think you'll launch it?</v>

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.580
Do you think you'll run for president someday?

12
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.600
<v 0>No chance. That's a terrible job.</v>

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.130
It seems like they just distort who you are. They, uh, they,

14
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.750
they push a narrative. They, they say things about you. They're horrible. They,

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.650
they do ads where they're just trying to break down your character.

16
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.010
And it depends on who the establishment is for or against. I mean,

17
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:59.420
what they're doing with Biden has been extraordinarily weird or they're

18
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:01.280
ignoring all of his gaffes.

19
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.300
They're ignoring all of these like real legit intimate.

20
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.970
<v 1>I don't think you can say that they're ignoring his gas and you can go watch</v>

21
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.790
GAF, compilations. Yeah. But not on CBS.

22
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.600
<v 2>Not as that. And not his allies who.</v>

23
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.320
<v 0>Is in the news is not in the news. You're in the news.</v>

24
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.350
You're in the business of distributing the news. Do you want people to see?

25
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.160
Yeah. Like you don't want people to see him thinking he's running for Senate.

26
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.340
He's like, well, the reason why I'm running for Senator, you know,

27
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.790
like you don't want to hear that. So they don't show it. They,

28
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:34.640
they take away all the times. He forgets what he's talking about.

29
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.680
They don't say they don't.

30
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.240
There's no thing that they've ever had on CNN is where they have a legitimate

31
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:44.540
conversation. And whether or not he can hang in there for four years,

32
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:47.930
forget about eight. Like how much cognitive decline has this man.

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.150
<v 1>Experienced? You don't feel that they discussed that.</v>

34
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.050
<v 0>Non CNN. No, no, no. They haven't. They avoided like the plague.</v>

35
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.400
They avoided the hunter Biden emails. They avoided all that. They,

36
00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:58.850
they avoid so much,

37
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.290
they avoid so many different things that would be detrimental to him because

38
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.120
in large part, because they believe they covered that stuff too much. In 2016,

39
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:08.810
with Hillary,

40
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.190
when it came to the emails and deleting the 30,000 emails and then the

41
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:17.870
FBI, uh, uh, reopening the investigation right before the election.

42
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.800
And that could have cost her. And they've decided their approach this time,

43
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.010
they've decided that Trump is bad and he's a danger to democracy.

44
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.620
And so they're only going to cover the news that they think is important.

45
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.520
But the problem with that is then you, you open up the door to Fox news,

46
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:34.190
being able to say, why aren't these other people covering this?

47
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.520
They're not covering this because they're biased and it's fake news.

48
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.190
And th these, these people are criminals. This is all legit.

49
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.950
This is all happening right now. This is real stuff. Here's Joe,

50
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.440
Biden's stumbling. Here's Joe Biden, you know,

51
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:47.300
saying things that don't make any sense. Here's Joe,

52
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.630
but over and over and over again, you know, you don't vote for me.

53
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.000
You ain't black, all that crazy stuff, then they're not,

54
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.320
they're not super Thursday. Yeah. It's, he's a madman. Yeah. It's like, it's,

55
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:57.921
it's weird.

56
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:02.410
But all it shows you that the news is not just the news.

57
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.080
It's the news for the left and the news for the right.

58
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.630
You don't just get some unbiased source.

59
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.420
<v 1>I think that people who aren't on that are, are</v>

60
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.230
either feigning ignorance, like,

61
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:21.360
like people who don't think that there is an inherent bias within news

62
00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:25.740
organizations within longterm legacy news organizations,

63
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.810
they're either like feigning intra feigning ignorance because it

64
00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:34.350
benefits them. Or they're just flat out like, like Nike.

65
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 0>Well, it has never been this obvious where they're just ignoring really hard.</v>

66
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.950
You don't want someone to be present. And if they can't think, right, right.

67
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.960
If someone's showing a real clear sign of cognitive decline,

68
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.050
you don't, you don't, you're supposed to highlight that, like,

69
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:53.100
this is part of the news,

70
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:57.360
but they had already picked him to be the guy running for the democratic party.

71
00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.760
And they just, they just decided to just ignore all that.

72
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.420
<v 1>But like I read the New York times. So Jamie.</v>

73
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.340
<v 3>I just go after, while you were saying that, uh, I'm reading updates now,</v>

74
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.690
as of now, they've called, uh, Wisconsin for Biden.

75
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.470
Arizona has not officially been called, but I'm seeing that it's called.

76
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.190
And if he just wins, uh, Nevada and Michigan,

77
00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:23.280
which he's currently up in that's enough to give him two 70.

78
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.470
And it doesn't matter about PA matter about Pennsylvania at.

79
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.630
<v 0>That moment. Oh. So Biden's going to win that.</v>

80
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.890
<v 3>I, I don't know. That's the part of like, I've I heard last night, um,</v>

81
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.050
I think it was Carl Rove, actually,

82
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:37.800
that was saying on Fox news that this reporting number is not accurate because

83
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:40.410
they have no idea how many people voted right now.

84
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.920
And how many mail-in ballots or early ballots are sitting out there.

85
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.390
So saying that like 99% or 95% is in, that might not be a good,

86
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:49.380
accurate number to go off.

87
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.690
<v 0>This is for which state any, any of this? Any.</v>

88
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.970
<v 3>Of the states. Yeah. Yeah. So the closest ones right now are in Nevada,</v>

89
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.160
Michigan, and Georgia, which is look how close.

90
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.510
<v 1>They are. Dude. They're down to reporting like, like chunks of 3000 votes.</v>

91
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:01.740
It's nuts, man.

92
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.420
<v 3>And the Trump administration, I think has said,</v>

93
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.450
they're already filed a lawsuit to stop the counting in Michigan.

94
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.870
What does that mean? I don't know, understand.

95
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.910
<v 0>How he's like, why would you want to stop.</v>

96
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.070
<v 1>Counting? I understand. Like how can you justify the argument?</v>

97
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:20.490
You want to stop counting. Yeah. But they want to keep counting in Arizona,

98
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.230
but what's the art, like what is, um,

99
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.200
what do they mean? Stop counting. I don't know.

100
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.880
<v 0>So it looks like Arizona's lost 51% to 47%. That's a big gap.</v>

101
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.770
Left a hundred thousand gap with 80. Well, it's only 84.

102
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.500
So they have 16% of the possible.

103
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.010
<v 1>Vote out there. Yeah. But what's off Trump though, is,</v>

104
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.040
was off his team. Is that what they're counting?

105
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:51.960
Our mailings and mailings are Democrats are way more likely to vote Malin.

106
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.680
Yeah. Right. So that's like, I'm sure I'm telling something you already know.

107
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:59.110
Yeah. Yeah. That his gripe about these things that are laying around. And,

108
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.490
and I think that he thinks they're just going to start making them up. He.

109
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.500
<v 3>Tweeted earlier, like he was like,</v>

110
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.290
they keep finding Biden votes in all these states. Like, yeah. He's.

111
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.580
<v 1>Like, someone's going to find it 4,000 Biden volts somewhere. I don't know.</v>

112
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.980
Sure. Well.

113
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.080
<v 0>It's,</v>

114
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.870
they're also made weird rules in some states where the signature on the envelope

115
00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:19.870
does not have to match the actual person's signature.

116
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.070
Like when you sign the envelope for a mail in ballot, really?

117
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.070
<v 1>They, they, my, I know my midterm ballot got thrown.</v>

118
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.670
<v 0>Away because it didn't look like your signature. Like I.</v>

119
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.430
<v 1>Got to know I was out of town. I got a call. There was a problem with my ballot.</v>

120
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:36.100
By the time I got back, it was over and I didn't get counted.

121
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.000
And did they say why? Yeah. It was like, I didn't sign,

122
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.420
I didn't sign and date it. Right.

123
00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:42.760
Or didn't sign and date where I was supposed to sign and date

124
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.550
some w w well, I thought I was, I was quite pleased with the democracy.

125
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.850
The fact that they tried to call me to rectify the situation I would have had to

126
00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:53.290
like, do a bunch of stuff. And there'd be no way.

127
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.450
I think they probably knew there was no way I had enough time to do everything I

128
00:06:55.451 --> 00:06:59.200
need to do. But the fact that somebody would like place a call to be like, bro,

129
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.710
your votes not counting. Wow. You call back. Or do you gotta do X, Y,

130
00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:04.900
and Z in a hurry to get your vote in. And I missed.

131
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.930
<v 0>Biden, wins Wisconsin, Fox news projects,</v>

132
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.220
limiting Trump's chances of reaching 270 electoral votes. Wow.

133
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:16.780
So if Biden won Wisconsin, Wisconsin's in, so it's kind of over, right.

134
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.290
<v 4>And that's what they're going to go to lawsuits now. So we'll see how it goes,</v>

135
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.260
man. I just lost 300 bucks.

136
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.860
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

137
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.010
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

138
00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:38.410
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

139
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:42.130
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

140
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.120
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

141
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.950
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye

142
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:54.940
okay.
