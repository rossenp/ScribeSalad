00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.251
<v 1>Morality.</v>

3
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:08.100
Talk to me how we're talking about morality and we're talking about why we can't

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:09.210
talk about certain things.

5
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.400
<v 2>While we're what you were saying before about being a competitor.</v>

6
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.920
The United States is competitive obviously.

7
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.160
And when you're playing the ultimate game, which is war,

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.730
you have to be very careful about what you reveal and what you don't reveal.

9
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.090
And this is where the conversation about surprise,

10
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:30.470
kill vanish comes in because the CIA using these

11
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.450
covert operations to fascinate people and whether or not that should be

12
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:39.560
allowed or not allowed, whether it's good or bad, whether it's necessary,

13
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.590
whether it's like, if you want people to be safe over here,

14
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:45.410
there's certain people you got to take out and sometimes you just can't follow

15
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:46.244
the rules.

16
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.630
<v 1>And why, why are we not supposed to know about that? Should we know about that?</v>

17
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.400
The way the story started for me, I'm at my house in 2009, a source is,

18
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.580
you know, calls me up. He says, I'm on my way. Back from the middle east,

19
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.370
going to pop by the house and say, hi. Um,

20
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.600
he brings me a challenge coin that says, cobble Afghanistan, state department,

21
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.650
I'm thinking, okay. He is not a diplomat. I mean, he's weapons trained.

22
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.430
Um, at the time my boys were young,

23
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.600
there were lots of GI Joes in the garden and they had little weapons. Right.

24
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.020
And the source is showing them about the weapons.

25
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:23.360
And they're like so into it because they know he's military trained.

26
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.970
And then he says, if it's okay with your mom and dad,

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.790
I'll show you some weapons. Boys are like, please.

28
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:33.470
So he sets up the sniper rifle in the living room and I live up in the

29
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.310
Hills and you can look across the canyon through this scope.

30
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.960
He sat up and I can see the veins on a leaf across the canyon.

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.610
And I thought, okay, so now I know what he was doing in Kabul, Afghanistan.

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.650
He's taking out Al-Qaida with this.

33
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.520
There's another case on the ground that he never opens.

34
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.440
And when the boys go off, I say to him, what's in that. And he said,

35
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.130
he opens it up and inside there's a knife and it's cerated.

36
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.290
And I said, what's that for immediately realizing, you know, my Evita.

37
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.340
And he says to me, sometimes the job requires quiet.

38
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.700
So why that became interesting to me was because of my own

39
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.810
thoughts and perceptions about what he had told me. In other words, I could,

40
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.990
I could deal with him with a sniper rifle. I could be like, okay,

41
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:27.110
that's what he does. But the knife gave me pause. I was like,

42
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.350
is he slitting someone's throat? Is it in the ribs? And I thought,

43
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.810
why is it that I am willing to accept sort of the clinical

44
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:39.650
nature of a, of a sniper rifle, but I can't,

45
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.660
I'm uncomfortable with that close up hand to hand killing.

46
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.780
And that led me to surprise kill vanish,

47
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.550
because that was the motto of the precursor agency of the

48
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:56.690
CIA. It was called the OSS, the office of strategic services.

49
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.970
Their motto was surprised, kill vanish,

50
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.220
because they would jump out of aircraft, land,

51
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.480
work with our French partners and kill Nazis with a, you know,

52
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:11.440
a knife to the throat. And I thought, okay, that's considered, okay,

53
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.750
because they were Nazis. Right. But we can't,

54
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.740
we're not supposed to do that anymore. In this world.

55
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.690
We live in Y and I spent the whole,

56
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.120
this whole book researching and reporting is about that sort of

57
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.560
conundrum. If you will, that moral puzzle, you know,

58
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.110
why do we, why do we differentiate?

59
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.430
<v 2>Yeah. And who are they willing to do that to? Where do they draw that line?</v>

60
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.690
Like, I'm sure you're aware of the story of Jamal Khashoggi,

61
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.670
the journalist who was assassinated by someone,

62
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.590
some group of people and that they, he entered into the Turkish embassy. And,

63
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.610
um, they, they whacked him and chopped them up and carried him out in boxes.

64
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.280
And it's, uh, an international

65
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.540
is, well, it's a huge incident, right.

66
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.310
This supposedly was ordered by who was it?

67
00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:10.740
Supposedly or by the head of Saudi Arabia?

68
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.140
<v 1>Yes. Mohammad bin Salmaan. I mean,</v>

69
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:17.100
that's the ideas that their head of state wanted him killed because he was a

70
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:19.050
threat because he was a reporter because he.

71
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.640
<v 2>Was right. Saying some things. Yeah. And that they,</v>

72
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.110
this is how they did it. Yeah. I.

73
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.840
<v 1>Mean, and there's, that's a great question because what you're saying is like,</v>

74
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:32.640
okay, so, but we all think of that as reprehensible. Right. Right. Y you know,

75
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.390
cause he's.

76
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.870
<v 2>A journalist and he's on our side, he's delivering information to people,</v>

77
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.710
but the government of Saudi Arabia disagreed,

78
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.670
they're like that information is our information. He's a threat by releasing it.

79
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.810
He's a threat to our livelihood. Yes.

80
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.030
<v 1>Yeah. And who decides who's a threat? I mean,</v>

81
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:54.480
a lot of this book is about who's on the kill list and right. I mean,

82
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:58.050
there is an actual killer. There always has been. And the euphemisms involved,

83
00:04:58.051 --> 00:05:00.390
I mean, I write history, as I said,

84
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:04.830
so Eisenhower called his assassination program,

85
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.490
health alteration. I mean literally in the data classified documents,

86
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.350
health alterations, the health alteration committee. Wow.

87
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.390
Kennedy had an executive action committee. Right. Cleaner.

88
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.640
Right. Guess what Reagan's was called?

89
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.710
<v 2>Uh, super wonder boy, power up. I don't know what those.</v>

90
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.350
<v 1>Preemptive neutralization.</v>

91
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.700
<v 2>Preemptive neutralization. Wow. Why did they keep switching the names for.</v>

92
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.420
<v 1>It? They're bearing the information. Right.</v>

93
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.550
And they keep switching around the,

94
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.780
they switch around who has authority to,

95
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.070
you know, say, yes, let's go ahead and put this guy on the kill list. I mean,

96
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:50.760
that was fascinating. I mean, I interviewed a guy named John Rizzo.

97
00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:53.370
Who's a decades long CIA attorney.

98
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.160
I was stunned that he was willing to talk to me, um,

99
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.280
and explained to me how a presidential finding

100
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.900
also called a memorandum of notification works that gives the

101
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:10.850
president the authority to put an individual on

102
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:11.570
the kill list.

103
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.250
That job is then given to the CIS paramilitary army,

104
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.800
an operator or their assassins because the CIA works under a code

105
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:25.700
called title 50 of, so it makes it legal.

106
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.970
Whereas the defense department works under what's called title 10.

107
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.250
So in other words, and they can't,

108
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:34.790
their rules of engagement are totally different. So the misnomer is like, oh,

109
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:39.140
the seals killed bin Ladin while they were seals trained.

110
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.360
But that was ACI mission because Pakistan

111
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.700
is a sovereign nation and the military can't kill

112
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.040
people in countries. We're not at war with.

113
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.110
So those guys all became essentially CIA operators

114
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.570
for the night. Whoa. Right. And if you look at photographs, as I have seen,

115
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.800
you'll notice that they have no markings on their

116
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.270
outfits so that if the job went south, they'd be like,

117
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.410
I don't know who these guys are.

118
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.820
And if you look back at Vietnam photos of the Mac V saga teams,

119
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:19.940
which I also write about in surprise, kill vanish,

120
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.020
cause that's the precursor of that. You see no markings, right?

121
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.220
That way you can go into, you can go behind enemy lines.

122
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:31.160
You can go into Laos, you know, in the Vietnam war, you can go.

123
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.960
Now you can go into Pakistan.

124
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.070
What I learned reporting this book is we're in 134 countries

125
00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.810
doing title 50 operations. Think about that.

126
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.210
Government wants that to be kept secret.

127
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.170
<v 2>So in all those countries,</v>

128
00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.240
they're doing things that don't fall under the normal letter of

129
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:53.074
the law.

130
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.960
<v 1>Not yet, not under the rules of engagement of the military,</v>

131
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.800
but the CIA works at the president's behest.

132
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.760
That that was one thing that really blew my mind to report, to research,

133
00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:04.600
to understand.

134
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:08.920
I talked to 42 guys who have direct access to this who are in this world,

135
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.730
you know, from the knuckle draggers on the ground,

136
00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:17.140
as they call themselves to the lawyer at CIA senior intelligence staff,

137
00:08:17.141 --> 00:08:21.340
that's equivalent of a general at the CIA, those guys explaining to me, Annie,

138
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:25.660
this is how it works. You know? And again,

139
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.530
to your question, well, why, why does someone get to know that?

140
00:08:29.531 --> 00:08:31.300
And why does the government want,

141
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.510
why are they allow that information out is super interesting.

142
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.820
And I believe that has to do with a certain climate we're in

143
00:08:39.821 --> 00:08:42.700
right now about military might. Right? In other words,

144
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.350
what the CIA does is called Tertia Optio. It's the third option you've got.

145
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.430
The first option is diplomacy. Second option is war.

146
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.820
So if diplomacy is not working and war is why's you

147
00:08:56.821 --> 00:09:00.720
go to the third option, which is the CIA paramilitary.

148
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.680
<v 2>And they're in a hundred. And how many countries in 34 well,</v>

149
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:09.230
if you wonder why the military budget so big, that's what it is. Folks.

150
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.530
You've got to feed those folks while I work. I mean, a lot of happening.

151
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.210
<v 1>And you as a competitor would be fascinated by the kind of training they do and</v>

152
00:09:17.211 --> 00:09:17.811
what they do. I mean,

153
00:09:17.811 --> 00:09:20.870
so many of these infiltration techniques are mind-boggling, you know,

154
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.710
they've got halo jumping, which you know about right where they go,

155
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.520
high altitude, low opening. So they jump out, they, you know,

156
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.750
free-fall down terminal velocity, pull the rip cord really low.

157
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.400
So they're not detected by radar.

158
00:09:34.401 --> 00:09:36.980
And then they meet up with a team on the ground and go do what they do.

159
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.760
And they also have Heyo, which is high altitude, high opening.

160
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.830
And that way you can fly over airspace where we're allowed

161
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.780
and float into, let's say a country like Iran

162
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.580
and land, gather your team and do what you have to do.

163
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.450
But like so much of what I report, I get information like that.

164
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:03.050
And then I ask a million questions like you've asking me, and it's like,

165
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.600
can't talk about that. That's classified. Hmm.

166
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.400
<v 2>You don't, you you're a journalist. So you're trying not to judge,</v>

167
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.523
but

168
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.750
is it your belief that this is a good thing for America?

169
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.930
<v 1>Meaning half the president having a third option? Well, I mean,</v>

170
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.610
I write in the book that that's in the prologue after I tell that story about

171
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:32.000
the source with a knife, I say, I wanted to know.

172
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.810
And that exact question, like, is this a good thing? And my answer at the end,

173
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.390
after it's complex, not to be vague,

174
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.140
but it is really complex is also that,

175
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.640
well, if you're gonna take that pole position,

176
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.940
you okay, must accept rivalry. Right.

177
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.620
And also after TA do I think it's a good thing

178
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.990
after talking to a lot of 20 year old soldiers who come back from the war

179
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.360
theater, missing a limb or with intense PTSD and

180
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:14.900
who essentially serve as cannon fodder,

181
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:18.800
I would say my opinion, right? For the Pentagon,

182
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.890
that's the second option or

183
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:28.550
the 42 guys that I interviewed, you know, they're like, send me,

184
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:32.030
they are professional. They are tier one operators. They're green Berets,

185
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.600
they're seals, they're Delta. They retire, they joined the CIA.

186
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.110
So they're like professionals at what they do. And they're saying,

187
00:11:39.111 --> 00:11:41.120
I want someone has to do this job.

188
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.600
We've been doing this since the end of world war II. I want to do it.

189
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.460
So do I think it's better? I mean,

190
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.190
I think that that concept

191
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:59.080
speaks to choice, right?

192
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:02.860
Because I'm not so sure that the 20 year olds know what they're in for and the

193
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:06.010
40 year olds know what they're in for and are willing to do it.

194
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.920
<v 2>So that it will also the difference between a specialized trained individual</v>

195
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:16.330
with very specific tasks versus someone who is sort of following orders and at

196
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:17.164
the front of the line.

197
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.370
<v 1>Right. I mean, and also has a, you know,</v>

198
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:26.330
a lot of times I talk to these young kids who go to war and they tell me one of

199
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:31.180
the fascinating detail is that they talk about movies that they see

200
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.410
and whether it's saving private Ryan or, um, black Hawk down,

201
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.710
even right where the outcome is not necessarily great,

202
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.570
but they talk about the romanticization of

203
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.860
war and of camaraderie and of brotherhood that comes from that.

204
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.150
And then they have their experience. And some of that does give them that sense,

205
00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.980
but not always, whereas the operators are much more about,

206
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.840
um, you know, getting the job done. That's what I was fascinated by. I mean,

207
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:05.710
these guys are really clear they're they're competitors.

208
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.220
They're like top tier competitors. They have a job, they do it,

209
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:12.400
they get it done. And they asked for the next job.

210
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.500
<v 2>So is the oversight when it comes to choosing whether or</v>

211
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:19.840
not this operation takes place or not, is it,

212
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.920
do they have moral guidelines?

213
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.870
Do they have ethical or moral guidelines where they say like, this is this,

214
00:13:27.871 --> 00:13:32.800
the president is requesting that this person can get taken out the chiefs of

215
00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:36.580
staff, whoever it is, is that, I mean, did they have to make a,

216
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:38.050
an ethical distinction?

217
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.050
<v 1>You mean, are they like kill him nicely? Like, don't make it hard.</v>

218
00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:44.710
<v 2>Did they decide, like, does this make sense? Or like,</v>

219
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:47.620
what if the president is like Rosie O'Donnell she's been talking, take her.

220
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.870
<v 3>Out. Like, you know what I'm saying? Well.</v>

221
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:52.360
<v 1>I mean, that's, you know, that's a big issue,</v>

222
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:56.980
but what I try to write and what I try to report and

223
00:13:56.981 --> 00:14:01.120
surprise kill vanish is the idea that the people we take out,

224
00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.620
maybe our bad guys, right? One, one guy I write about is Che Guevara. Okay.

225
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.570
Because Che is often portrayed

226
00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:13.660
in the press as you know,

227
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.550
this amazing hero and that he and we, you know, I don't know if you know,

228
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:22.690
but he was, he was killed by the Bolivian Rangers, but it was a CIA operation.

229
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.410
And I interviewed the man in charge of that operation in surprise, kill vanish.

230
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.120
His name was Felix Rodriguez. Okay. Long serving CIA paramilitary officer.

231
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.553
So,

232
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.360
but I also report why the president to your

233
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:40.960
question wanted Che Guevara dead. You know,

234
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.030
he was really advocating for nuclear war and

235
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:50.830
I, and I showed them, yes. I mean, he spoke publicly about, you know, if,

236
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.540
if we have to have an atomic war, the Cuban paraphrasing,

237
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:57.200
the Cuban people will be happy to have sacrificed themselves for that. I mean,

238
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.060
Jay was also J killed anyone who betrayed him. He killed,

239
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:05.510
he writes about it in his diaries as I write in the book. Right. So,

240
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:09.260
but on the morality question, who decides I don't have that answer,

241
00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:12.740
but I will tell you what I did. I went with my main source Billy Wall,

242
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.440
who he's 89 now. And he was,

243
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.550
he's been with the CIA for 60 years. Okay. I mean,

244
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.530
he went and he,

245
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:25.970
and I went to Cuba for him to do a halo jump

246
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.070
with Che Guevara son.

247
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.240
So we were a guest of the man

248
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.280
whose father was killed by the CIA. Okay.

249
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.440
And we had this really interesting discussion in the cigar club where

250
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.320
Che and Castro, you know,

251
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.980
smoke cigars and plotted the downfall of the United States.

252
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.570
And that's what I try to give readers a sense of

253
00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.050
the long lens of history,

254
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.290
how time changes all things and

255
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.830
maybe leave with them, them with this idea,

256
00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:06.770
which they can come to their own conclusions about what you asked me of,

257
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:11.630
is it right? Or is it wrong because really what you might ask is,

258
00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:14.840
is it necessary, right? I mean,

259
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.610
I could moralize right wrong, but it would just be my opinion. But when you see,

260
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.800
I went Billy Wall and I also traveled to Vietnam because he was

261
00:16:24.801 --> 00:16:25.790
supposed to kill,

262
00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:29.720
he was tasked to kill the top commander of the north Vietnamese army,

263
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:30.950
a guy named general shop.

264
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.750
And while I didn't kill shop and we had this incredibly,

265
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:39.260
this terrible mission that went awry that I write about in the book in the

266
00:16:39.261 --> 00:16:42.650
Vietnam war. So 50 years later, wow.

267
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:47.300
And I go to visit the son of general shop are sitting there in job's

268
00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:50.510
home talking about these same issues. Right.

269
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.800
And my conclusion of that again, is not,

270
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:59.630
is it right or wrong, but is it necessary? I mean, we have these wars,

271
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.990
we keep having these wars. Is it necessary?

272
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.940
What do you think? Well, I mean,

273
00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:14.120
my opinion is that the defense department is far too concerned with

274
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.390
vast weapon systems of the future,

275
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.880
which is it's mission statement of it's science department.

276
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.890
And so you create what some at the Pentagon call a self-licking ice cream

277
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:27.800
cone or the military industrial complex.

278
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.310
And there's a lot built into that. And there's a lot to be said about that.
