00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Do you, are you optimistic about the future?</v>

2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.433
Yeah,

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.280
I say that because it's going to take a lifetime's work and I don't think that

4
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.780
in our lifetime, um, much is going to change. I think, you know,

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.100
maybe for the next generation.

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.081
<v 2>Uh, what is it,</v>

7
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:27.050
the picture of ma how do you conceive of your job at the moment and, and what,

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.790
what is the status quo? I mean, so for instance,

9
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.100
ISIS or the Islamic state is sort of fading from most people's memory now.

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.600
I mean, there's, you know, uh, even mine I'm, uh,

11
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.090
I'm spending much less time thinking about it because it seems to Vincent.

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.900
<v 0>So let me tell you a story. I can answer this question with a story. So radical,</v>

13
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:46.290
which is my autobiography has a us publication, right? Um,

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.790
in the UK it's random house penguin,

15
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:49.770
it's published by the biggest publishing house. Uh,

16
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.160
when I came to publish in the U S I approached publishing houses,

17
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.770
but it was after bin Laden was killed.

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.210
And so when we approached 10, 20, whatever publishing houses,

19
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
the problem solved, they all said, no, they said the problem solved. They said,

20
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.180
we think, you know, we wish you'd come to us five years earlier,

21
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.910
but problem solved. Now there's not a problem anymore. And, uh,

22
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.940
and a bit like what you mentioned is sort of your expertise. And, and I,

23
00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:15.960
I have been consumed by this subject all my life.

24
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:19.410
And there are a few people on this planet that I would take seriously on this

25
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.450
subject, um, uh, outside,

26
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:24.180
especially of Quilliam and there are other organizations,

27
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:26.940
they have some really good people, but I know them all. And, uh,

28
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.420
we regularly speak. So I would say it's all these publishing houses.

29
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.030
I can assure you 100%.

30
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:37.230
This problem not only has not been solved is going to come back around in a far

31
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:40.530
worse way than you can ever have imagined. This is before ISIS came along.

32
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.950
None of them believe me, of course, what then happened.

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.390
My book eventually got published by some very small publishing house in the U S

34
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.010
and has done quite well for them.

35
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:53.970
But the point of the story was this ISIS came around and people were suddenly

36
00:01:53.971 --> 00:01:56.460
like, oh my God, where did this come from? Of course,

37
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.610
those of us who had been monitoring the situation knew this was going to come

38
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:03.510
back around very, very heavy. Now that ISIS has been pushed back.

39
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.290
And this is where this story is sort of the point of the story is we've got to

40
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.980
resist the temptation to believe the problem has been solved because the,

41
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.990
the organization known as ISIS, which is an, a bureaucracy has been fought back.

42
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.490
But the ideology upon which that organization was built, um,

43
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.490
is still very much alive. And it's still strong. Um,

44
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.330
what Al-Qaida did while the whole world was focused on ISIS,

45
00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:32.130
was exploited that opportunity to rebuild and regroup. And they've been,

46
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.480
uh, rebuilding in Syria.

47
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.950
Now they are stronger than they have ever been even under bin Laden,

48
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.040
because for the first time in the history of that organization,

49
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.020
they are firmly embedded within the Syrian population as a genuinely kind of

50
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.100
viewed by the people that they were fighting on behalf of as a grassroots

51
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.080
resistance organization. Whereas before that,

52
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.510
they were seen as a terrorist group, that was like, you know,

53
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:57.810
just like a Vanguard they've embedded themselves in the Syrian population,

54
00:02:57.811 --> 00:03:02.020
in the Yemeni civil war. They've embedded themselves in north Africa,

55
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.910
east Africa, and in Pakistan. And they are resurgent and they are grooming, ah,

56
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.930
Hamza bin Laden who has been not in sun and the grooming him for leadership.

57
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.330
And a time will come maybe in a couple of months,

58
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.300
maybe in a couple of years where they announced sometime in Leiden as a new

59
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.710
leader of Al-Qaida currently at Siemens, who are, when they do that,

60
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.570
once their grooming has been complete and assuming Hamza isn't killed up until

61
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:30.280
then all of the, um, fragments of what remains of ISIS will probably rejoin.

62
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.810
Al-Qaida under Hamza bin Laden,

63
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.530
and you'll have a stronger than ever before on kinder organization.

64
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:36.364
And we've got to,

65
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.330
we've got to remember that we never expected ISIS to emerge and kinda will come

66
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:41.290
back with a vengeance.

67
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.110
<v 2>Okay. W what is the, the politics between the remnants of ice, uh, uh,</v>

68
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.910
ISIS.

69
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.680
<v 0>And Okada? Well,</v>

70
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.990
how has it been loud in succession to the leadership solves that problem of the

71
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.300
pickers, the ISIS guys? Um, well,

72
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:59.350
originally all Al-Qaeda ISIS was Al-Qaeda in Syria and they broke away after bin

73
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:00.670
Laden died because they didn't,

74
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.720
they had pledged allegiance to bin Laden and the new leader of Al Qaeda Ayman

75
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.280
Suare is by all accounts, a rather uncharismatic. And you know, he's a,

76
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:13.150
he's a pediatrician. He's not really a kind of bin Laden had the pediatrician.

77
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.180
Yeah, he's, [inaudible], he's

78
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 an Egyptian pediatrician from a very well-off Egyptian family, by the way. Um,

79
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 I think his grandfather was the German ambassador to the UN pharmacists. Um,

80
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 Binladin clearly had the charisma, the wealth, the presence, the looks

81
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
, he had all of it that Zara doesn't, um,

82
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 as wirey is competitive in Latin, he does it doesn't, you know, so

83
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 if the guys that broke away from Al-Qaeda's form ISIS centers, a watery

84
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
, the current leader, we pledged allegiance to be learning. We owe you nothing. 

85
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
You are not our Amir, our leader. If Hamza bin Laden

86
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
 comes back into, as the leader of Al Qaeda

87
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
, it solves that problem because those remnants of ISIS have a loyalty to the Binladin name, and 

88
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.180
they've been light in family, and they remember what they consider

89
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.013
 their glory days fighting under on the Binladin.

90
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.520
<v 2>Yeah. That's not nice to.</v>

91
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.770
<v 0>Hear that's no good. No, no. The problem has not gone away.</v>

92
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.010
I can tell you that the problem and the problem is the ideology,

93
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.220
and it will not be dealt with until we deal with this ideology.

94
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.380
And it's why it's so dangerous to, you know,

95
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:14.890
there was this awful term that I railed against.

96
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:18.040
It was so frustrating to see under Obama's presidency.

97
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.630
The us state department officially adopted as their name for challenging this

98
00:05:22.631 --> 00:05:27.190
problem, they adopted the term Al-Qaida inspired extremism.

99
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.930
Of course it isn't, it isn't Al-Qaeda that it inspired extremism.

100
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:36.250
It's extremism that inspired Al-Qaida and it's for the purposes of political

101
00:05:36.251 --> 00:05:36.790
correctness.

102
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.940
You've got this term in the state department officially that we're fighting

103
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.200
across the world. We are fighting,

104
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.370
Al-Qaeda inspired extremism my former organization.

105
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.390
Here's what I heard a caliphate espousing organization that believes in their

106
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.120
ideal califate that gay should be killed adulterous.

107
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.480
It should be stoned to death. Um, they were there before all kinder,

108
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.220
and this ideology has been there before on kite.

109
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.940
I'll kinda was one of a long line of groups that came as a result of these

110
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:05.300
limits ideology. And we've got to start focusing on the ideology itself,

111
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.050
not the physical groups that spring up from it because they can change their

112
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.320
name.

113
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.250
<v 2>Um, as you point out, there's a, another layer to the ideology.</v>

114
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.080
That is all that is even more well subscribed that presents social and political

115
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:20.000
problems. So for this, as you said,

116
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:24.080
there are conservative Muslims who don't support Al-Qaeda,

117
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.580
they're not jihadist. They, they can,

118
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.960
they would honestly say bin Ladin doesn't represent my brand of Islam,

119
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.810
but these are still people who will,

120
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.900
who will say that homosexuals should be killed. So, so it's like,

121
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.430
there's the apparent allies against quote

122
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:42.500
extremism can still be people with.

123
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.200
So with religiously mandated social attitudes,

124
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:49.640
that just cannot be assimilated in cosmopolitan societies.

125
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.410
Uh, so people who are worse,

126
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.110
worse than worse than Al-Qaeda inspired extremism,

127
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.920
there's just this notion that on the left, and this was,

128
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:03.620
this came out of Obama's mouth and it came out of Clinton's mouth.

129
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:06.440
And it's largely why she's wasn't president. Uh,

130
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.630
it's not, it's just generic extremism, right? So that,

131
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:16.460
like in the same sentence that you have to worry about the califate you have to

132
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:21.200
talk about, uh, abortion doctors being killed in the U S once every 15 years.

133
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.280
<v 0>So you wrote, cause you remember,</v>

134
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.610
because president Obama refused to use the word Islamist extremism. Of course,

135
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:26.720
Trump has the other problem.

136
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:29.150
He thinks that bite like Rumpelstiltskin by repeating it enough,

137
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.040
you've solved the problem, you know, but,

138
00:07:31.041 --> 00:07:34.880
but actually one of the elements in which he was correctly critical of Obama

139
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.800
was, and I was at the time, uh,

140
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:41.570
vocally critical of Obama's reluctance to use the word Islamist extremism. Um,

141
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.680
and we've got no problem. When we talk about, you know, uh,

142
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.200
when we talk about white supremacist ideology,

143
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.920
we don't mean that all white people are supremacists. You know,

144
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.360
what we were doing here is,

145
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:58.160
is actually attributing precisely specifically what the ideology is and

146
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:02.630
believes in white supremacy and likewise Islamist, you know, it's important.

147
00:08:02.631 --> 00:08:07.340
So we can identify that ideology, um, still, while not calling it Islam,

148
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.820
right? So we're still giving a bit of a leeway there for everybody else,

149
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:11.803
all the other Muslims,

150
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.050
but to call it Islamist extremism is to recognize that it's an offshoot of

151
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:18.380
Islam, it's a manifestation extreme or otherwise obvious lamb.

152
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:22.730
And thereby we are acknowledging that its justifications are in Islamic

153
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:24.050
scripture, as well as of course,

154
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.870
a multiplicity of other causes grievances and what have you.

155
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.370
But we cannot ignore that.

156
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.750
It's also rests on justifications that are derived from the Islamic scripture.

157
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:32.931
I mean,

158
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:36.710
I can cite for the Arabic that tells you in the crown itself to cut the hand of

159
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:40.910
the thief or to lash the adulterer. Um, you know, the, these are the,

160
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:44.300
are the Heidi for the saying of the prophet that says kill the person that

161
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:46.790
changes their religion. This is scripture. Um,

162
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.040
and so of course there are other factors involved as well.

163
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:52.460
But one of the factors that gives rise to this, uh,

164
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.710
is the unreformed scripture that these site.

165
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.300
And so we have to knowledge that Islam has a role to play. Um, I often say that,

166
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.310
you know, because again, under the Obama presidency,

167
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:05.670
it was frustrating that the common refrain was to say that Islam,

168
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.470
this has nothing to do with Islam.

169
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.040
This is absurd is arguing that the Spanish inquisition had nothing to do with

170
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.874
Catholicism.

171
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.230
<v 2>He wasn't even further at one point,</v>

172
00:09:13.231 --> 00:09:16.350
didn't he at one point say that not only does this have nothing to do with

173
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:20.340
Islam, this has less to do with Islam than any other religions. It was just,

174
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.570
he bent over backwards.

175
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.090
<v 0>It's not saying the crusades have nothing to do Christianity.</v>
