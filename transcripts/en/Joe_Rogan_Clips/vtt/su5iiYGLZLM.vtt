00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 2>That was my first time after the sunset fight,</v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.920
since the cam has a gawky fight that I didn't get injured.

4
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:12.480
I tore tendons and ligaments and stem cells out for eight weeks to, you know,

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.240
and then all of a sudden I was like, man, I was back in the gym Monday,

6
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:19.320
hungry to go and then COVID get, COVID get a title shot. I'm like,

7
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:21.750
I'm at the fight figure at 25, you got COVID.

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.960
<v 1>Bad. Right. Well, you did you get COVID in the,</v>

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.570
will you in the middle of training when you got it? Like when you're worn out.

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.530
<v 0>Dead,</v>

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.310
I was doing one training session and actually I started the whoop and I was

12
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.780
like, man, like my recovery score is 1% in the morning. My HR was like 17.

13
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.560
It was 1% for like a week and I would only do one workout and then I'd have the

14
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.810
cancel on Chris and Milan. I'm like, 1% is.

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.733
<v 1>Dead dude.</v>

16
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.200
<v 0>Crazy. But then I was like, you know what? I'm just gonna go ride the bike.</v>

17
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.180
You know, I was getting on those bikes doing, you know,

18
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.020
50 to a hundred mile rides and just suffering. Cause I had vertigo really bad.

19
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.410
So I couldn't get in those uncompromised position that when did you start.

20
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.460
<v 1>Experiencing vertigo?</v>

21
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270
<v 0>Vertigo was my first symptom of Colvin not knowing I,</v>

22
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:04.050
and then I had it head injury. My, uh, my doctor, I went and saw and he's like,

23
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.420
that's a concussion. I'm like, dude, I didn't get hit hard.

24
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.410
And sparring my fights. Like I've worked on defense a lot. Like I know,

25
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:15.360
I would know if it was a concussive blow that gave me vertigo. And um.

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.550
<v 1>What did you experience it after training? Did.</v>

27
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.520
<v 0>You experience it? It was during grappling. I was like grappling. You didn't.</v>

28
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.900
<v 1>Collide heads or anything?</v>

29
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.470
<v 0>Nope. Into the scramble and mixing, you know,</v>

30
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:28.470
it was just like fighting the hands off and the whole room was spinning and I

31
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:30.930
was actually training with her Uriah and I was like, man, he's like,

32
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.880
you all right. I'm like, what's going on? I was like,

33
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520
kinda like didn't want to in the route.

34
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.070
So I just kinda like closed my eyes and like hold onto his hands.

35
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:40.020
So he wouldn't choke me. You know, he used to, he was taking my back.

36
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:42.270
So I was finished around and I was like, man, I just don't feel good.

37
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.360
And I was nauseated for a few days. Um, so I went to my doctor,

38
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.530
he was giving me like anti-nausea medicine that was making me so much more tired

39
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:52.110
than I was. Cause I was fatigued from, from training. I was,

40
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.100
you're trying to train through it. I was like,

41
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:54.690
I have a world title coming up in eight weeks.

42
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.990
Like I have to get down to 25 and my weight was good. Um,

43
00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.760
I wasn't restricting any calories. Nothing.

44
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.910
<v 1>You felt something was off with your body besides the vertigo?</v>

45
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.650
<v 0>My body felt like I just was for about a three week period when I was training</v>

46
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:11.370
and I didn't feel like myself at all. I just mental clarity was, was.

47
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.310
<v 1>So do you think during that time you had COVID the whole time?</v>

48
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.050
<v 0>I think so. You know, that is crazy.</v>

49
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.120
<v 1>And th that makes sense that it hit you so hard because you never gave your body</v>

50
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:24.690
a break and you were beating yourself up while you were fighting off COVID.

51
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.990
<v 0>Well that, I think what happened was the kidney infection.</v>

52
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.720
In the beginning of 2020, I was on all those antibiotics.

53
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.290
I was on five different antibiotics to people don't even know there's two weeks

54
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:37.260
before the fight with the sun. So that infection came back.

55
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.430
So I had to go to another infectious disease doctor that my Dr. Hill found in

56
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:45.000
Sacramento. This lady was amazing. Did two blood cultures found out,

57
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.630
got all the report from the hospital in Jersey, the reports from the,

58
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.290
the specialist and the Cleveland study those all in a day, got a blood culture.

59
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:54.600
I was on the wrong antibiotics that didn't kill the infection.

60
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:56.100
Just basically put a bandaid over it.

61
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.760
So I had to go 10 days to an IV fusion center to get an antibiotic drip for 10

62
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.430
days while I'm training two weeks before the fight. Oh my God,

63
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.800
I didn't let any of the UFC or anybody know. Um,

64
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.830
I told Ali what was kinda what was going on because I just needed to get in an

65
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.320
Octonauts like, dude, just put me in that octagon. I know that it'll happen.

66
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.940
Like to get me there healthy and I'll be good.

67
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.360
<v 1>So, but that with your endurance in a big way.</v>

68
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.850
I V antibiotics are a routine.

69
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.690
<v 0>It was tough, man. It was a, and my strength conditioning coach,</v>

70
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:26.170
we were having the hardest time I was hovering around, you know,

71
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.160
I was getting my heart rate up 180 7 and then I couldn't get it below,

72
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.540
like hover at one 50,

73
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:35.500
which I'm fine at St at one 50 and going up and being in that one 50 to 180 zone

74
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:38.710
that I can be there for awhile, but we're working on the aerobic system.

75
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.190
So to drop it, you know, I just couldn't drop it.

76
00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:45.970
It took about the last week of training before I flew out to the fight week

77
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.570
to finally get my heart rate in like 30 fives. Like after a hard,

78
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:51.700
like a minute 30 push and then drop it down.

79
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.630
So I noticed something like that was it. But mentally I was like, it's good.

80
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.910
<v 1>Two weeks out. You D you had to do a 10 day cycle of IVF.</v>

81
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.560
<v 0>And then a 10 day of, um, oral. What? Yeah,</v>

82
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.040
I was on antibiotics for literally five months, almost from Jersey.

83
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.280
I was on five different antibiotics from the hospital. So.

84
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.930
<v 1>From the sunset fight,</v>

85
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.680
how many days did you have where you weren't on antibiotics before the fight?

86
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.230
<v 0>I mean, I declared that I had,</v>

87
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.830
and I was on antibiotics all the way up to the fight, you know, antibiotics.

88
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.120
I was.

89
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.920
<v 1>So you were taking probiotics to counteract the effects.</v>

90
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.800
<v 0>A lot of probiotics, Frankie, Edgar, his wife sent me, uh, she did, they were,</v>

91
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.130
they took care of me when I was in Jersey. Like hooked it up.

92
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.170
Like coach brought me pizza in the hospital. He was like,

93
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.490
it was during COVID when it.

94
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.560
<v 1>Happened, but don't, you have to cut weight. I don't.</v>

95
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.640
<v 0>Cut weight to 35. Really. I'm like right now, probably 1 44.</v>

96
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.270
I don't, I stay, you know, strong and fast.

97
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:51.040
And this is why I feel good at the 5 35.

98
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.250
I'd have to just diet a little bit like everyone else does for 25.

99
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.980
That's what everyone's making is a big deal going at 25. It's not.

100
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.710
<v 1>You basically beat your immune system up while you had COVID and</v>

101
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:07.260
then because of that, you got COVID really bad. Yes. Yeah. So tell me what.

102
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.200
<v 0>I was horrible. I mean, I had the vertigo was the first symptom. And.</v>

103
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.090
<v 1>Then when did they test you for COVID?</v>

104
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.570
<v 0>I didn't get tested. Ty went down to Mike Tyson's ranch.</v>

105
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.230
We were working with the smart cups company, Ross,

106
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.080
all sponsored by I'm doing digital videos.

107
00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:22.660
And it was our first kind of getting the athletes together.

108
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.740
Cause they started doing fighters boxers and some rest WWE Kurt angle was there.

109
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.260
So I had to do like rabbit Tesla. We just did here and, um, uh,

110
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.990
waited, waited a while and they're like, Hey, we want you to do another one.

111
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.900
I'm like, all right, cool. Like we just didn't see some things we liked.

112
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.110
And I was like, all right. I'm like waiting for an hour, do another one.

113
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:44.710
I'm like, well, what did you guys see another test? Which I see, I'm like, oh,

114
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.350
you failed the first one. I'm like, well, that's a subtle way you telling it.

115
00:05:47.351 --> 00:05:48.970
Like, I want to stay away from everybody. And like, you know,

116
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:52.750
everyone's coming up to me. And so I tested there in August. Um,

117
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.500
and then I went, you know, quarantine went home. Did the, did you.

118
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.700
<v 1>Do any medication? What.</v>

119
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.630
<v 0>Did you do? I did a Z-Pak um, I got on an inhaler because I had pneumonia.</v>

120
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.960
I got pneumonia, um, vertigo.

121
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.570
And then I did like a 21 day cause I had it so bad.

122
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:10.310
I kept getting tested like every three weeks.

123
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.600
And he kept having kept having I didn't molecular test, which was like nine,

124
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.890
you know, some of the best ones to do is.

125
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.880
<v 1>That the PCR tests.</v>

126
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.200
<v 0>And just kept negative negative. My doctor's like, Hey,</v>

127
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.750
we're going to quit testing you, you know? Like you being positive.

128
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.583
<v 1>You kept testing.</v>

129
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.880
<v 0>Positive, positive for it. And I'm like, dang, this is crazy. I mean,</v>

130
00:06:28.881 --> 00:06:33.710
and I had started to have the symptoms going away. Like pneumonia was fine.

131
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.431
My lungs were good.

132
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.400
Like I felt it like I was that's when I started cycling a lot. Um,

133
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.960
so I was out there just pushing the lungs.

134
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:42.200
That's when my doctor said it was the best thing to do is riding that bike.

135
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.840
That much is getting those lungs keep working.

136
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.950
Cause you have pneumonia really bad. Jesus Christ. Wow. I felt horrible.

137
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:50.450
I thought it was cycling was one of the hardest things to do.

138
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.471
<v 1>Yeah. Isn't it funny?</v>

139
00:06:51.471 --> 00:06:54.980
Because you would think like most people would think that a guy who's a world

140
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.490
championship caliber fighter is the type of guy who would get COVID and it would

141
00:06:58.491 --> 00:06:59.750
just burn right through his system.

142
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.280
But because you were training while you had it and beating yourself up,

143
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.810
it just got deep into it.

144
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.000
<v 0>The, I mean, it, it, it took over my body,</v>

145
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:11.510
but I think honestly from the kidney infection beyond an antibiotic,

146
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.493
my immune system was.

147
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:15.290
<v 1>How much time was there between the kidney infection, the antibiotics,</v>

148
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:16.280
and then getting COVID.

149
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.130
<v 0>I literally got out of the hospital and I texted Dana like, Hey,</v>

150
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:22.520
I heard your did a press conference about having a fight. Um,

151
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.360
my kidney levels are good. I'm waiting for, maybe you have to do a biopsy. Um,

152
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.820
but I want to fight. And he's like, all right, work on it. And I was like,

153
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.260
begging Sean, you got COVID right away. Um, so I, then I, uh,

154
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:36.590
after the fight I had a, so June to August, but, uh,

155
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:40.040
so it was from the kidney infection, the fight to fight camps, you know,

156
00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.230
basically one didn't happen, uh,

157
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.730
recovery building myself back up from where I was at getting ready to fight a

158
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.110
sun's out. The first time in March,

159
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.460
I literally had to start walking on a treadmill for a couple of weeks to get my,

160
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.940
I was in rough shape, rough, rough shape, and uh,

161
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.040
started training at my business partner's house. He had a home gym,

162
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.950
cause everything was closed, already rise, gym, wasn't open. He said, dude,

163
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:04.910
I got a treadmill. I got weights, kettlebells, you know, kettlebells. And uh,

164
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:07.670
so I went over there and just started to train and I'm like,

165
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:10.790
I'm getting myself ready. And it was brutal, brutal,

166
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.040
brutal training getting back in there. So this is pre.

167
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.060
<v 1>COVID. This.</v>

168
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.890
<v 0>Is pre COVID. This, this kidney cancer.</v>

169
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.360
<v 1>Infection. Jesus Christ. So your body was obviously already compromised.</v>

170
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.860
<v 0>Yeah. Very caught my still antibiotics. They still had me on antibiotics. Uh,</v>

171
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.600
the clean out the infection. I was on it for.

172
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.150
I got 30 day antibiotic from the hospital. So.

173
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.930
<v 1>August you get COVID. How long before it clears your system,</v>

174
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:34.670
how long before you start feeling good.

175
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.040
<v 0>Months. Like I literally,</v>

176
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:40.070
I went to Miami and worked with this company called amino Wells and they did

177
00:08:40.071 --> 00:08:43.280
like kind of injections where we talked about like kind of stem cell injections

178
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.710
throughout my body arms. Um,

179
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:50.350
and I kinda started feeling a lot better at like the week after then I did a

180
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.480
month on the injections with a three milliliters, uh,

181
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.560
a week and I felt really good body felt good. Um, clarity went away.

182
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.250
I actually had to go to Arizona, the Mayo clinic, uh,

183
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.900
Dana thought I had many years disease.

184
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.240
So I went and saw his doctor that did his surgery. Um,

185
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.770
they gave him a shot in his ears. Did all these testings hearing test, um,

186
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.390
where they did you have ringing in your ears?

187
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.580
I had ringing bad in my left ear and there's, um,

188
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:20.070
I have a loss of a hearing in this year and they don't know why,

189
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.550
I think maybe because, um, this is my lead lead and.

190
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.420
<v 1>You get hit in the left.</v>

191
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.570
<v 0>Ear. That's all I can say. I'm like, I don't know. I haven't shot a gun without,</v>

192
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.180
you know, anything like that. You know, trying to just figure out what,

193
00:09:30.181 --> 00:09:33.840
why is ringing? It makes like this popping noise. Oh. Um,

194
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.800
and I was just getting so like dizzy. I couldn't even do anything. Um, so,

195
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:38.820
so that's probably 10.

196
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.740
<v 1>Attributed to the vertigo for sure. Right.</v>

197
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.700
<v 0>Um, they said it.</v>

198
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.570
<v 1>Wasn't the visually it's.</v>

199
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.490
<v 0>Ear things. Yeah. They said like crystal was,</v>

200
00:09:44.491 --> 00:09:47.280
I had vertigo before I worked with UPMC.

201
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:49.260
I was out for a whole year at my pro debut,

202
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:52.910
broke my hand and it had a vertigo from crystals being out of the air,

203
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.200
went through the UPMT crystals, crystals. You,

204
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.900
I was on a irregular tube that was throwing my equilibrium off,

205
00:09:57.901 --> 00:10:01.710
which basically is positional vertigo. A lot of it's that's the most common one,

206
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.000
you know, a lot of people just, you know,

207
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.180
they can Steve's wrong or do something sleep wrong,

208
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.700
their neck and they have vertigo and there's a maneuver. You do to put it back,

209
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:11.880
but it wasn't positional vertigo. It was just literally COVID had,

210
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:13.440
had me so messed up.

211
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.550
<v 1>So your body was so compromised from the antibiotics, the kidney infection,</v>

212
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:23.010
second kidney infection. So you were just basically getting your health,

213
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:27.480
your health back, which is crazy that you beat a sunset in that state.

214
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.940
You had to be clearly compromised.

215
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.920
There's no way you could have been a hundred percent if you were gone,

216
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.470
if you went through that much antibiotics before that.

217
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.670
<v 0>But I think that goes back to the, my middle state where I was at.</v>

218
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.100
I knew that I needed to get in that Octa and the changes around,

219
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:45.150
I was not living life like this. I was tired of living on a three fight skid.

220
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:48.210
I was ready to just get back in there. And when, you know, like for me, like I,

221
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.890
like we talked about earlier with the TJ fights.

222
00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:53.100
I don't have to go in there and be angry and upset and want to rip his head.

223
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:56.370
I got there. I hate this guy. I've hatred for this guy. It's a flip the switch.

224
00:10:56.371 --> 00:10:58.980
Like when, you know, you have it in you, you don't, you know,

225
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.390
that that's been bred in me. I've had it. Um, so I just needed to get in there.

226
00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:06.390
I was like, not taking no for an answer. I mean my coaches and stuff like, oh,

227
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:07.620
I don't know if you're going to make it, you know,

228
00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:09.900
and coach mark had called him cause we basically did.

229
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.940
I would fill my pad work and my sparring rounds and send it to coach on

230
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.610
WhatsApp. And then he would break everything down, do more of this,

231
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:21.360
do less of that. Look at good, looking fast on the, you know, your left hook,

232
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:25.050
counter off or things like that. So we did virtually, you know,

233
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:29.370
camp through there. So then when he came out to,

234
00:11:29.371 --> 00:11:31.920
I just kept working the codes to, you know, keep working your codes,

235
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.950
keep working, you know, make sure you're doing under nine and things like that.

236
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.040
Um, then when we came to fight week, it was just.

237
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.580
<v 1>So talk me through you getting, you got COVID tested in August at the Tyson,</v>

238
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.620
Joe, you knew that you had it. When, when are you free of it?

239
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.933
Like.

240
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.620
<v 0>This is the first that I had passed since tests that my doctor would test in</v>

241
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:01.420
February, February. She's so excited. I was like, dude,

242
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:02.020
I'm free.

243
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.350
<v 1>I'm free of it. It was literally, you know, a couple months of having it,</v>

244
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:06.470
testing it to where my doctor's like,

245
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.820
I'm not going to send out any more tests because they were 72 hour return ones.

246
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:12.700
And every time you did it, you had it. Every time I did.

247
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.750
<v 0>This for months, um, tested my son. He didn't have it with me. We were, I was,</v>

248
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:20.320
if I didn't get it, um, she ended up getting it. Um,

249
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.060
but it wasn't as severe. It was, it was a couple months ago that she got it. Um,

250
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.370
two months ago her and her twin got it. And it was kind of, you know,

251
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:29.980
they were sick, but not like mood I had, like, I was just.

252
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.280
<v 1>Yeah, well, you're a perfect example of, you know,</v>

253
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.390
obviously you're a super healthy guy and an elite athlete,

254
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:40.120
but when you put yourself through training camp,

255
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.920
there's only one way to get in shape. You got to beat yourself up. There's no,

256
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.280
there's no other way around. That's true.

257
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:48.730
And when you are so tough that you push through,

258
00:12:48.731 --> 00:12:52.420
even though you had COVID and you let that get deep into your system,

259
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.440
there's a lesson in there for people, you know, because there's tough.

260
00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.830
Tufts important. Yeah. You don't get where you get without being tough,

261
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.770
but there's, there's also, you gotta be,

262
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.470
you gotta be able to take a step back and go.

263
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.340
It's not wise to push sometimes.

264
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.870
<v 0>And I think honestly, if I got tested before having COVID then I mean,</v>

265
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.450
before I first had the first, like I've had this.

266
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.580
<v 1>I probably would have had it for a couple of weeks or whatever.</v>

267
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.100
<v 0>Exactly it wouldn't be. As it took over my body, then I came back.</v>

268
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.710
I hit pads the first time, like, dude, I'm an I'm in great shape.

269
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:30.070
Cause I was cycling a hundred miles. You know, I had to hard pace.

270
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:32.890
We were riding four or five times a week, you know, building the legs up.

271
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:35.500
And um, so I started hitting pads again and was excited.

272
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:38.140
Like I'm back in the gym. I can be around people because on the bike,

273
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:41.170
I was just on the bike show on the road, just, you know, suffer on the bike,

274
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.150
came back at pads the first time. And man, I, my bicep was so sore,

275
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.320
uh,

276
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.200
that I remember going to sleep that night and waking up and excruciating pain.

277
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.190
And my bicep was just filled up with blood like this. I thought I tore my bicep.

278
00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:56.950
So I went to my doctor and he ultrasounded it.

279
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.040
And he thought it was a distal bicep, Terri, you know, deemed a doubt.

280
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.840
My father had to call Dana and tell them like, Hey,

281
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.480
I'm just talking about bicep and then get the MRI,

282
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.710
get the MRI nothing's torn. It was a, a guy.

283
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.480
And then I had to go get an urgent ultrasound.

284
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.370
I tore my vein in half and it ripped in half from then I had

285
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.310
three blood clots. So I was immediately,

286
00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:20.440
they started injecting me with blood thinners. I was on,

287
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.870
I've been on blood thinners for, you know, since.

288
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.710
<v 1>Yeah, this is because of COVID as well.</v>

289
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.490
That's another thing that happens with people that severe cases of COVID they

290
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:31.120
get blood clots.

291
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.540
<v 0>I didn't know. And my business partner, Jeremy Perkins,</v>

292
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:39.040
he owns a PMP medical, which they work with COVID or they work with blood clots.

293
00:14:39.041 --> 00:14:40.030
They have, you know, some,

294
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.210
the device that they sell to doctors and hospitals and the whole time he's like,

295
00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:44.890
dude, I think you have a blood clot. I'm like,

296
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:46.350
there's no way I have a blood clot. Well,

297
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:49.510
that's a number one silent killer in the nation is his blood clots because

298
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:52.070
people don't know they have it. I had three of them in my arm.

299
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:55.500
Didn't even know that's crazy. I just had like, my arm was sore for a while.

300
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.440
<v 1>So you were on blood thinners now I.</v>

301
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.870
<v 0>Just finished up my last, I was on blood thinners for.</v>

302
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.070
<v 1>A month.</v>
