00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 1>I would think that, um, for a guy like you, who's building cars away,</v>

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.900
you're you're building the real challenge would be staff.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.340
I think that would be the real challenge is finding people that understand what

5
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:14.910
you're doing,

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.620
finding fellow artisans that also understand how to build cars that really get

7
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.454
what you do.

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.900
<v 2>Yep. That, and, um, I love the state of California,</v>

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.590
but they do not want me here. How so? They don't want me in business.

10
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.240
They don't want anyone in California making anything except maybe solar

11
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.290
assisted bicycles.

12
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:39.120
I did the business climate in the state of California and the associated

13
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:43.200
HR costs and in insurance and workman's comp and liabilities,

14
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:45.210
like every couple of weeks,

15
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.020
there's another absurd ruling that we get an update on that. Like, wait,

16
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.100
what it's like,

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.170
you mean to tell me if I catch a dude smoking crack while on the clock stealing

18
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.970
my inventory. I can't fire his on the spot. Nope. What? Oh yeah.

19
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.410
Now if you do,

20
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.180
you have to give him a week's pay at the time of letting him go and you can't

21
00:01:06.181 --> 00:01:09.390
make him sign anything that indemnifies nor protects you.

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.640
You have to put them on probation and offer therapy and resources. No,

23
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.474
you don't. Yes.

24
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.410
<v 1>Really catch someone stealing merchandise and smoking crack.</v>

25
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.490
<v 2>Like literally the most Vagrant disrespect, uh, of,</v>

26
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.330
of safety of policy of company goods.

27
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:31.530
Like it has gotten so bad. And like, we just got a letter from the,

28
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.480
from the building inspector came by and he's like, yeah. Um,

29
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.230
you know, those, those automotive lifts in your building, I'm like, yeah,

30
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
he goes, yeah, you have 30 days to remove all those. What thank you.

31
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:47.460
That was pretty much my response verbatim because yeah,

32
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.610
you're not sewing for automotive. I'm like you see this plaque on the wall,

33
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.710
the Congressman Councilman and the mayor.

34
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.310
You see this picture of me and the mayor when he did the ribbon cutting here's

35
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:59.850
the email records showing the mayor's aid personally delivered me all my

36
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:03.180
occupancy permits because yeah, not my problem. I'm like,

37
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:06.240
what about the last nine years of inspectors coming in all the time and saying,

38
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.410
you guys have the cleanest,

39
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.890
most professional above board shop kick-ass well done.

40
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.230
Thank you so much for making my life good. He goes, yeah, they're idiots.

41
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:14.130
I'm the new inspector.

42
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.560
<v 1>So the new inspector says you're not.</v>

43
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.640
<v 2>Licensed.</v>

44
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.960
I'm not zoned appropriately to be in business where I'm at,

45
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.690
despite having permits and everything for it.

46
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.400
<v 1>Did they change the zoning?</v>

47
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.290
<v 2>I don't know what the hell happened.</v>

48
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.850
Other than this new guy seems to be a prick and wanting to show his value.

49
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.240
What's his.

50
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.073
<v 1>Name?</v>

51
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.080
<v 2>I actually don't remember, but I literally at every turn it's killing me.</v>

52
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:41.130
And like I piece of,

53
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.050
I think at this point to the amount of costs related per employee

54
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.050
should be going to my employees,

55
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.730
not to insurance companies and all this that gets tagged on top.

56
00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:57.720
It's like for every dollar you pay someone. Now there's another 32 cents.

57
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.760
That should be going to them. That's sewing to some.

58
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.380
<v 1>Extent when they want you to choose,</v>

59
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.100
how do they expect you to work on these cars? Oh,

60
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.360
is this something you can fight? Are you going to have.

61
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.970
<v 2>I had to lawyer up and we're fighting it. But I mean,</v>

62
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:14.500
literally I honestly think they'd rather have a commercial weed

63
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.040
facility in that building, kicking out a hell of a lot more tax revenue than us.

64
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.173
Really?

65
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.190
<v 1>Yeah. Do you think that's what they're doing? Yes.</v>

66
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.180
So you really think they're trying to make it challenging for you to do business

67
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:25.900
so that.

68
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.400
<v 2>Yes. And just about any small business owner I know in the state of California,</v>

69
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:35.350
the challenges we're facing are getting to the point of making us wonder about

70
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:38.110
our own intellect for staying in this state. I don't want to move.

71
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:39.970
I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to, I love it here.

72
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.430
<v 1>So what would you do if you lose this?</v>

73
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.910
<v 2>You know, if it gets to the point that we, we have to, oh,</v>

74
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.690
you mean this building situation, I'll fight it or a move and I'll deal.

75
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:50.650
I've been through this ship.

76
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.470
<v 1>For a while. You find some place where you are zoned for just keep.</v>

77
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.620
<v 2>Partying on, but I know I'm zoned fine where I'm at. I'm just going to have to,</v>

78
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.730
you know, instead of running a business, I have to now become a lobbyist and,

79
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.900
you know,

80
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.920
knock on doors and ring phones and dig through my black book to find people with

81
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:07.870
the clout to get the city to go. So.

82
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.760
<v 1>This is kind of flexing, like.</v>

83
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.200
<v 2>Lit is this I think so.</v>

84
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.620
And at first he seemed like he chilled out when we went above him and then

85
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.030
everything was good.

86
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.970
And then a week later bubbled back up again and we got another notice.

87
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:20.290
So we're in the middle of it right now.

88
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.060
<v 1>But you went above his head and you got approval, verbal, verbal.</v>

89
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.610
<v 2>Yeah. And then city, I don't know what he's talking about. You're fine.</v>

90
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.060
You're good.

91
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.290
<v 1>To go. And then you go back again. I mean, now it's a problem. What in the?</v>

92
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.660
<v 2>That's crazy. But look at the end of the day,</v>

93
00:04:34.661 --> 00:04:39.190
the reality is also I'm going against what trade schools are telling young kids

94
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:42.460
that are going into the field. What are they telling kids?

95
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.900
They're telling kids that a here, if you run this scan tool, you'll be, uh,

96
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.220
you'll make 150 grand a year as a lead tech at a BMW dealership. What,

97
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.460
they're not telling these kids while sucking all their money out of them with

98
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.460
crazy, you know, student loans and stuff is, yeah.

99
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.830
That's like the kids in the street in Brazil,

100
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.830
all wanting to grow up to be paleo. There's not that many payloads.

101
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.090
So there's plenty of dudes at that dealership that are making minimum wage or

102
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:11.860
there abouts or dealing with the politics of flag hours or whatever. But what,

103
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.540
what I'm having a hard time with is we charge a hundred dollars an hour for our

104
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:17.374
labor.

105
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.330
I can't just keep charging more and more and more it's level of what we do with

106
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:25.810
projects that can run thousands of hours per job.

107
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500
The math is it almost doesn't make sense.

108
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.230
Like I honestly have guys that I think should be,

109
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.290
I should be paying them 70, 80, 90,

110
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:37.870
a hundred grand a year to do what they do because they're artists and they

111
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:42.130
deserve it. The of running a business in California,

112
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.010
all of the exponential costs that are added on top,

113
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.030
even de-incentivize overtime. Now, if I give a dude overtime,

114
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.220
it ups his tax rate and they take even more out of the overtime.

115
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:57.800
Well it's whatever happened to like GDP and employment and productivity and like

116
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.810
keeping everything rolling there,

117
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.460
Dean incentivizing us even to offer our employees more money with more hours.

118
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.260
It's, it's tragic.

119
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.060
And I've lost several guys now that have gone to do jobs

120
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.170
that they hate, but like department of water and power,

121
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.950
I've lost several employees at DWP. Cause they'll get a pension,

122
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:20.150
they get killer health care,

123
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:23.150
they get 90 grand a year to pick their nose and watch other people work

124
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.483
sucks.

125
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.590
<v 1>What is this? Is this a Democrat thing?</v>

126
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.120
<v 2>I think it might be the Uber green side of democratic,</v>

127
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.620
um, because, um,

128
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.250
I think they'll whatever the whole two-party systems a show as it is. Anyway,

129
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:42.770
I don't think it's about which party so much is.

130
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.510
I think we've empowered attorneys to such an extent that it it's,

131
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.720
it's downright sinful because it's hindering industry.

132
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.390
It's hindering innovation. Um,

133
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.830
there's just so many constrictions cause everyone has their handout. No,

134
00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:01.970
one's no one's self accountable, but everyone's liable.

135
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.540
So then you, you know, then you need a policy for that and this and that.

136
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.970
I mean, we had a, we had an employee once Suez,

137
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:12.860
he jumped in a dumpster to stomp on everything, to compress it in the dumpster.

138
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:17.630
It started moving across the ramped parking lot and he jumped

139
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:21.800
out of it, clipped his leg on the way down and shattered his arm in four spots.

140
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.280
Well, he sued me and it's like, well, it's not in your job description.

141
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:28.490
Did someone tell you to jump in the dumpster and stomp on it? No.

142
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.240
And then we discovered the guy had in brittle bones due to chemical agent

143
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:35.240
exposure in the military, but it's my problem.

144
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.510
Like what people, whatever happened,

145
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.050
like be proud of what you do be respected,

146
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:47.420
be well-paid everyone's content. Everyone's like inspired and engaged.

147
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.220
And I just feel like more and more.

148
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:54.020
There's just so much noise and lawyers and policies, all this crap.

149
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:54.854
It's like,

150
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.570
we're just here to like do something we love and get rewarded and pay people.

151
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:00.830
I mean, I'm stoked that, you know,

152
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:05.420
we support directly 58 families plus all our sublets and everything

153
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.650
else, but it's, it's hard to retain people when, when we,

154
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.600
we know we can't pay them what they're worth in this business environment.

155
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.930
<v 1>We're really hard time with the whole crack thing is catching someone, stealing,</v>

156
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:21.860
smoking crack and you can't fire them. That seems so strange.

157
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:26.180
You have to give them a week's worth of money yeah. On the spot on the spot.

158
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.370
So you have to cut them a check. This is.

159
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.540
<v 2>Getting so stupid.</v>

160
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.540
<v 1>That seems, that seems, and you had to offer them therapy.</v>

161
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:40.100
<v 2>I mean, to be clear, I didn't catch a guy doing that. Just a general thing,</v>

162
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.300
but I tell you man, more and more surf shack with like my own little garden out,

163
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:48.260
back in my little leather studio and sell on Instagram,

164
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:52.610
simplify life, me and my wife and my dogs. I know what you're saying.

165
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.190
I own one bay garage, but you know what?

166
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.600
<v 1>Jamie Montana we've been.</v>

167
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.960
<v 2>We've been dealing with cancer. You know,</v>

168
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:01.440
my wife got diagnosed with cancer last year and we've been in the throws of

169
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.320
chemo and dealing with that whole show.

170
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.260
You want to talk about something that puts everything into perspective?

171
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:12.420
You know, we really made us stop and sit back and go, okay, all right.

172
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.020
That doesn't matter. Like a lot of the,

173
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.250
a lot of the noise in our modern world does not matter.

174
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.840
Doesn't mean a thing.

175
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.800
So that kind of reinvigorated,

176
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:30.420
but also refresh my perspective to remind myself if someone's painting as

177
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.320
they're in there. Not because they're, icon's been in storage for six months,

178
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:37.110
they didn't plug it into the tender and the battery's dead and they want to call

179
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:40.290
and yell at me about it with like really like,

180
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.640
give me your bank and philosophy or your money back. Oh, well, no,

181
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.910
that is not what, okay. Then why are we interfacing like this?

182
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.810
You have a dead battery. You haven't been there for six months to.

183
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.000
<v 1>That's what happens? Pick your battles. Well,</v>

184
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:57.120
that's why the icon has a real easy way to remove the battery post.

185
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.100
<v 2>Right. And an integrated tender if you click that box on the configurator.</v>

186
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:03.023
Yeah.

187
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.250
<v 1>Well, there's a lot of silly people out there for sure.</v>

188
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:08.670
But it's just weird when they're empowered by the government. When, you know,

189
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:13.590
when you don't have a common sense approach to knuckleheads,

190
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:16.670
you know, if you, you got a guy smoking crack and stealing things,

191
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.280
you're not supposed to reward that kind of behavior with, uh, uh,

192
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.090
a week's paycheck and.

193
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.630
<v 2>Counseling.</v>
