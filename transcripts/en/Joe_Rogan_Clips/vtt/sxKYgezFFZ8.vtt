<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.180
<v 1>Experience. They're like so many things in life we figured out so late. If ever,</v>

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.200
you know, when we're kids, we look at, uh, adults, our parents, um,

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.690
those in authority. And when they called, they got figure it out yet.

5
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:17.310
You had a really good joke about this, about thinking, um, the older you get,

6
00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:20.160
the more you, you understand life and how things are going on.

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.220
But the older you get realized, nobody knows what the is going on.

8
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.940
And everyone's out here just winging it. Like, I don't know what the I'm doing.

9
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.210
I'm just kind of trying my best. But, but I'm like, oh,

10
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.720
maybe I should look to my parents for advice by she's the really just adult

11
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.210
kids. They know what the they're talking about. Yeah.

12
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.170
<v 0>The bit was, do you remember when you thought that grownups were real?</v>

13
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.440
They don't exist. Like I used to think that one day I'm going to be a girl.

14
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.110
I was crying. I was young. I was so upset. One day,

15
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.970
I'm going to be a grown up and everything's going to make sense.

16
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.560
And then one day you're at the supermarket and the guy goes, paper plastic, sir,

17
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.540
you look, sir, I'm a, sir, am I grown up. This is it.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.530
And then you realize no one knows any more than you about what this is all

19
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:06.480
about. You might have more data in your head. You might have more experience.

20
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:08.970
It might be a brain surgeon. You might know how to build rockets.

21
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:12.870
You might be smarter than me, but you don't have any idea what this is. Yeah,

22
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.510
no one does. You cannot. No, you can.

23
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.130
<v 1>But everything is there. I like to think there are, there are really no facts.</v>

24
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.990
Everything is a theory because we could all be asleep in a dream right now or

25
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.650
hooked up to a machine. Like nobody knows that for sure.

26
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:32.250
So how can you possibly say anything as factual? You can say,

27
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.680
things are factual with the information that's in front of you,

28
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.430
but that information might be. And 10 years from now might say,

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.660
we might have a completely different perspective on things that we're doing now

30
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.120
that we think are right. And like, this is the way life is.

31
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.510
It's the way the world is. You know, like 10 years ago,

32
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:51.060
people had very different approach to things, you know? Yeah.

33
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.880
<v 0>What we can say is, as far as we know,</v>

34
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.040
this is the case and this is what we know is repeatable. If you do this,

35
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:02.490
if you put two bricks on top of two bricks, you have four bricks.

36
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.450
We're pretty sure maybe not, but we might be in a dream. Yeah.

37
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.500
<v 1>Like we could all be wrong. And that's why I, I, I think it's, you know,</v>

38
00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.760
so stupid to, to judge other people's beliefs be like, oh,

39
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:19.110
your way's the right way. You gotta figure it out. Everybody else is crazy.

40
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:20.040
But you think it I'm like,

41
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.770
don't you think that they think the exact same thing you do?

42
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.450
<v 0>Well, there's a problem today.</v>

43
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.700
And there's a lot of people out there giving advice. And um, th this is,

44
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.640
was interesting. Sometimes advice re it resonates,

45
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.900
and then you get older and wiser and you realize that advice is really stupid

46
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.850
because you ha it's there's people that are giving

47
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.640
advice and they're there. They were there.

48
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.800
There's like a lot of value in motivating people,

49
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.130
right? Like when someone's a like legitimately motivational person,

50
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:54.990
whether it's like Wim, Hof,

51
00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.630
the Iceman or someone who's like really done some things.

52
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.990
There's something about them that, that their inspiration is fuel.

53
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.030
It's it really does something to you.

54
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.590
But then there's a lot of people out there that are just saying.

55
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.220
Cause they think it's going to be motivating to other people.

56
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:15.910
And it sounds like horse. And it only tricks dummies.

57
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.380
And that stuff is painfully prevalent.

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.970
There's so much of it.

59
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.500
There's so many people out there that are trying to offer advice and they're

60
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:31.090
trying to motivate people, but then you go, Hey man, what have you experienced?

61
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.820
They've had a Placid dull life filled with non

62
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:40.270
accomplishments. The biggest accomplishment is tricking people into thinking.

63
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.620
They're a good motivational speaker.

64
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.860
<v 1>Like the get rich quick thing.</v>

65
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.800
<v 0>Oh, there's so many of.</v>

66
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.570
<v 1>Those. This is how they've gotten rich.</v>

67
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.990
<v 0>Sure. Yeah, dude, I was watching a documentary on one of those guys,</v>

68
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.950
one of these internet guys who rents houses and rents cars,

69
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:58.190
and PR tries to pretend he's as big baller and, and spends all this money and,

70
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.571
and, you know,

71
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.750
and then ran a bunch of scam dating sites and all these different things.

72
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:06.160
And I'm like, wow, this is, this is, this pursuit is odd.

73
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.750
It's a odd thing.

74
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.280
This pursuit of tricking people into thinking that you're more knowledgeable

75
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:13.114
than you actually are.

76
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.980
What resonates with people is like what you were talking about from the

77
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:19.090
beginning of this podcast,

78
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.920
when you're talking about your life and how you felt and your own

79
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:28.120
real legitimate experiences and the feelings of inadequacy.

80
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.730
And then the finding of the light at the end of the tunnel and all of these

81
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:34.640
different things that are just you're, you're, you're relaying your,

82
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:39.070
your life's lessons and experiences. Those are extremely valuable for people.

83
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.570
Those are extremely valuable,

84
00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.150
but because people know they're extremely valuable,

85
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.470
there's a lot of bullshitters out there that are trying to concoct these things

86
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.990
and then trick you. And like, this is how I got this mansion. Yeah.

87
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:52.660
You can get this mansion too. You can make it.

88
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.540
I'm going to show you here on a whiteboard. This is what you can do. And like,

89
00:04:55.541 --> 00:05:00.040
they're just horse, but there's money in that. And so there's a lot of them.

90
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.770
There's like, they pop up all the time. I get emails from them.

91
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.780
I get a Instagram messages. I, I see him like, Hey, I want to come on your show,

92
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.980
motivate people. A mom I'm really about motivating people like bro, you're 22.

93
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.840
The are you motivated? You ain't motivating. You know,

94
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:18.460
go move to Nepal for a year.

95
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.620
<v 1>And it's also such a, it's a tricky thing. Because like, even for myself,</v>

96
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.400
it's like, of course I want to motivate people. I want to help people. Yes.

97
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.180
But you can start drifting into that. Now I'm a motivational speaker.

98
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.670
Now I'm not being honest and communicating the full

99
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:41.410
spectrum of the things that I'm dealing with and going through in my I'm only

100
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.470
gonna focus on this positive thing. Like, oh, just do this, this and this.

101
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:45.760
And you know, you're going to go with the right way.

102
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.580
<v 0>And oftentimes, because they don't have someone in their life,</v>

103
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.030
like the way you were describing Gina, someone who's going to, Hey, face.

104
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.903
You know.

105
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.663
<v 1>Like your head.</v>

106
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.430
<v 0>You have to have somebody to life. That's raw with you. There's real with you.</v>

107
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:00.680
And for me, it's my friends. It's definitely my wife.

108
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.370
She doesn't me about anything. Yeah. Those, those people are giant in your.

109
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.290
<v 1>Life. You gotta have people that check you.</v>

110
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.200
<v 0>They have to know you too. They have to know you.</v>

111
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:10.970
You can't hide anything from them. We have.

112
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.890
<v 1>We have a lot of, a lot of us tend to have these, um, um,</v>

113
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.930
what would the word be? I don't know these people in our lives that like,

114
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.100
they're only there because you're doing something for them or like, yeah.

115
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:28.160
But those people aren't pushing you they're they're they're yes. Men. Yeah.

116
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:32.270
The parasites parasites. They're not, it's not a real relationship.

117
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.620
It's not a, it's not a relationship you're going to grow through. That's a,

118
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.790
that's the relationship is going to make you feel good. And in a lot of ways,

119
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:43.460
and yeah, that's fun and comfortable. It's like, but if you,

120
00:06:43.461 --> 00:06:45.770
if that person can't, uh,

121
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.030
get to the core of you and really be like, when you tell me something,

122
00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:53.810
I know it's truth because you have no other reason to just say.

123
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.680
<v 0>Right? You don't owe me. You don't need anything from me. Yeah.</v>

124
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.260
That's giant for people. You can't like,

125
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.730
this is one thing that I've seen many times with celebrities when they go off

126
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.110
the rails and they, you know, they don't hang out with other people like them.

127
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.960
So they don't have real friends.

128
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.980
They have these employees and people were into kids, real sketchy,

129
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.570
and everyone that they talk to and interact with needs something from them.

130
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:25.430
And they assume this position of authority where no one can

131
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.400
question them. Like no one can call. No one,

132
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.600
like you got to have peers. It's very important. And you don't have,

133
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.350
if you don't have the respect and the friendship of your peers, like, man,

134
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.280
you're a drift. You're not tethered. You're out there in orbit. Just floating.

135
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.230
<v 1>Around here. Another dimension and.</v>

136
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.753
<v 0>Not good.</v>

137
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.050
<v 1>Very easy. Very much, much easier. Especially for.</v>

138
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.880
<v 0>Successful people. People start kissing your.</v>

139
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.360
<v 1>Yeah. Like, oh, this is nice. I don't need, I don't need to deal with this.</v>

140
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.420
I'm going to have these people around me that make me feel good and say yes to

141
00:07:56.421 --> 00:07:59.570
me and bring me all the things that I want. And given me no stress.

142
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.590
<v 0>When I meet people like that, I go, you should do jujitsu. Yeah. Go get choked.</v>

143
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.300
<v 1>And that's such an important thing. Any, anything physical?</v>

144
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.793
<v 0>That.</v>

145
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.370
<v 1>Is a extremely, I think vital for everyone. I mean,</v>

146
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:17.630
particularly kids coming up, putting kids into athletics and martial arts.

147
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.770
<v 0>And if you don't like martial arts, look, you can't fake a marathon.</v>

148
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.180
26.2 needs to be run. You need to go left foot, right. Foot left foot,

149
00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:29.330
right foot till you hit the finish line period. End of discussion.

150
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.970
If you don't do that, you don't get there. You can't fake it,

151
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:36.200
but you can fake a lot of. Yeah. There's a lot of you could fake,

152
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.730
but moving your body, you know, you can't really fake that. You gotta do it,

153
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.050
you know, a 90 minute yoga classes, 90 minutes. It's hot as.

154
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.320
And you're in there sweating your balls off and it, you know,
