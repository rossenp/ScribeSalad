WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.080
<v 0>They had either the same name or similar names with people</v>

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.640
that had some sort of a criminal record. If.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.600
<v 1>Somebody made a typo, when they put their,</v>

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.120
their name in the system and mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, then they were,

5
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:13.240
they were made and knowledgeable.

6
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.080
<v 0>And then there was also some concern that some of that was deliberate cause so</v>

7
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.360
much of it was taking place in democratic districts. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.533
It's um,

9
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.030
it's very disconcerting the idea that someone would try to rig an

10
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.270
election. Yeah. I mean,

11
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:32.150
we would like to think that that is an absolutely unAmerican thing to think of,

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.150
but people can up with not American thing. It is,

13
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.270
but people can come up with very strange reasons for justification of very

14
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.220
awful acts. And this seems to be one of 'em they think their side is right.

15
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:45.054
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

16
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.500
<v 1>Well, that, that points to, um, the,</v>

17
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:51.420
the super delegate issue that Democrats have been dealing with where

18
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.780
people who have been arguing to keep the system of super delegates,

19
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.580
where in a state like mine in Hawaii, for example,

20
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.290
we've got four super delegate votes, uh,

21
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.170
two for the members of Congress and two for the senators, explain.

22
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.010
<v 0>That to people who don't know what a super delegate means. So.</v>

23
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.690
<v 1>This is something that is, um,</v>

24
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.290
created by the political parties themselves. So the democratic party has,

25
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.370
has been using the super delegate system where, um,

26
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.320
as people are running for president, you have a certain number of,

27
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.120
of delegates that go to one person or another, uh,

28
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.080
based on that state's rules.

29
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.920
So some states say it's winner take all other states say that it's proportional.

30
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.880
So if you get 60% of the vote, that means you get 60% of the delegates,

31
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.800
but then you have the special category of super delegates,

32
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:45.670
which they're they're over 700 them. It includes all 435 members of,

33
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.830
of, or, sorry, all, um, democratic members of Congress,

34
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.390
Democrats in the Senate and people who are appointed by, uh,

35
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.990
the party leadership, both at the state and the national level. And so,

36
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.350
um, what we saw in, in, in my state of Hawaii for example,

37
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.220
is &lt;affirmative&gt; over 70% of the voters voted

38
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.380
for Bernie Sanders, but out of those four super delegate votes,

39
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.860
he got one which is mine.

40
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.620
So the super delegates don't have to cast their votes to reflect how the,

41
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.460
their constituents voted.

42
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.260
<v 0>So how did the rest of them vote?</v>

43
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.570
<v 1>They voted for Hillary. So that puts you in a situation where,</v>

44
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.970
and this is not about, well, Bernie would've won without Dale.

45
00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:34.130
This is not even what that's about. This is about really looking at people,

46
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.250
casting their votes.

47
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.170
And then you have this special group of people who are either elected or

48
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:42.250
appointed who can then say, nah, I don't,

49
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.960
I don't agree with the way that the people in my state or my district voted.

50
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.600
So I'm just gonna vote the other way and then shift, uh,

51
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:53.720
potentially the outcome of that election for that state or for the country. So.

52
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.440
<v 0>Did it shift it for Hawaii? Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.840
<v 1>Yeah. So Hillary won Hawaii's um, uh, super delegates,</v>

54
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.000
but the people voted differently.

55
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.480
<v 0>And it was 70% of the people voted. Yeah. For very.</v>

56
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.240
<v 1>It, it wasn't close. It was, it was, but she won the state. And that was how,</v>

57
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.400
how you saw, um, that's. So in some states where, you know, I think,

58
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.880
I don't know, Vermont, there,

59
00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:20.350
there were a few other states that I remember were looking at where, um,

60
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.530
when they were counting the votes as they were coming in,

61
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.050
they would report one number. But if Bernie won the state,

62
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.050
his number was zero.

63
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.570
And then there was a certain number that was already built in to Hillary's count

64
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.290
before the votes were even finally tallied because she had already had the

65
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.360
declare heard support of those super delegates within that state.

66
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.360
So the Republicans don't do this. I think they may have super delegates,

67
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:51.200
but those super delegates are required to, um,

68
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.680
reflect the votes of their constituency.

69
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.200
So they don't have the freedom to change their change,

70
00:03:57.201 --> 00:04:01.870
their vote or change their mind. But, um, yeah,

71
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.150
this is, uh, this is, so this is something that I've been,

72
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.230
I've been fighting to,

73
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:09.390
to try to reform within our party is to get rid of super delegates,

74
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.711
to, uh,

75
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:14.750
make it so that we have open primaries so that you don't have to be a card

76
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:17.030
carrying party member to vote in democratic primary.

77
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.740
Cause that was another problem we saw across the country where people return and

78
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.580
away because in some cases, well, you didn't register with the party a year ago,

79
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:27.260
which is the requirement. And so, um,

80
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.980
have open primaries and then you have same day registration.

81
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.980
If you're not registered to vote,

82
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:35.460
you should be able to register to vote on the day of the election so that you

83
00:04:35.461 --> 00:04:36.900
can participate in our democracy.

84
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.730
<v 0>Those things seem so clear. Cut. It seems so hard dry, but the, the,</v>

85
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.850
the super delicate issue in particular it's, that's so disturbing. Yeah,

86
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:45.930
that seems so dirty.

87
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.490
<v 1>Yeah. So there's been some progress made since then, though,</v>

88
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.810
just recently the DNC had a meeting where, uh,

89
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.490
it was a very strong majority of people who voted to bar super

90
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.770
delegates from, uh, casting their,

91
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.080
their own free votes in first ballot in a presidential,

92
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.200
um, convention. So I don't know, it's been a long time since,

93
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.200
uh, uh, uh, it's gone to the second or third ballot, but that, that was a,

94
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.720
a major step forward to make sure that as people are going and casting their

95
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:24.310
votes in these primaries, that they're not risk being overruled by again,

96
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.670
a group of special individuals who are elected officials who are lobbyists and

97
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.150
who are party officials and people coming from all different backgrounds.

98
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.510
<v 0>Is there any resistance to getting rid of these super oh yeah.</v>

99
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.790
<v 1>The resistance was very strong. It was not a given that was gonna pass at all.</v>

100
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:45.340
People who are very invested in this system. Um.

101
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.540
<v 0>But it seems like they would have to be invested in keeping the system rigged,</v>

102
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.020
like making it easy to influence elections by having these few people that you

103
00:05:53.021 --> 00:05:55.420
can control, having influence over these people.

104
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.680
These people have massive influence over the results of the election that, so.

105
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.880
<v 1>It it's, it is it it's,</v>

106
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.920
it's so counterintuitive to what we stand for with our democracy. Yeah.

107
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.600
And I think there is, um, I mean it's a fear of losing power.

108
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.920
I think ultimately is what it comes down to. And you have people who said, Hey,

109
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:17.790
look, I've given my life to the party. You know,

110
00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:20.550
I've put in all of this time and energy, I'm a volunteer,

111
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.710
I'm doing this and all of that, which all of that is is fine. And it's great,

112
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.550
but that shouldn't, uh, make it so that like, you know, as,

113
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.910
as myself as a superdelegate, I've talked about this, I shouldn't have any,

114
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.220
my vote shouldn't count for more than yours or anyone else else,

115
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.980
and that we should be strengthening and, and, um,

116
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:46.020
empowering and uplifting the voices of the people rather than saying, well,

117
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.260
this small elite group has way more power than you.

118
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.300
So we'll see what they think about things.

119
00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.980
<v 0>It's so bizarre that that's a part of the system.</v>

120
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.130
It just seems like that's something that should have been eradicated a long time

121
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.370
ago. It should have been now Bernie Sanders had to be fuming. Yeah. I mean that,

122
00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:06.010
from that, and then from finding out the DNC,

123
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.730
actively conspired to have him lose the primary, all of that. Sorry.

124
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.610
<v 1>One, one last thing on, on the super de is that,</v>

125
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:16.210
that some of those who support it have said is that it is their job to be able

126
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.640
to save the country in case of people elect someone who isn't good.

127
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.033
&lt;laugh&gt;.

128
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.720
<v 0>Really, that's hilarious. Yeah. That is a hilarious justification. Oh, you know,</v>

129
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:29.760
better than the whole country. Yeah. You must be super smart. Yeah.

130
00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:30.880
What kind of test do you have to take?

131
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.360
Take a super delicate &lt;laugh&gt; to become a super delicate,

132
00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:34.194
what do you have to do?

133
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 1>Yeah. It's certainly not a written test. You should. No, it's it's really,</v>

134
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.550
I mean again,

135
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.430
or either you're either an elected member of Congress or you're somebody who the

136
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:43.270
party chooses.

137
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.710
<v 0>Wow. The idea that the reason to keep that is because, you know,</v>

138
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:49.350
better mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I mean, that's essentially what they're saying,

139
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.150
you know, better than all the people that voted. Yeah.

140
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.070
<v 1>So disrespectful too. It's.</v>

141
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.190
<v 0>Crazy to people. It's really crazy. Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.350
<v 1>Hmm. So I mean, that that's been,</v>

143
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.980
I think a pot positive thing that has come through all of this is,

144
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.300
is more people are say, like, you know, I,

145
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.500
I honestly wasn't paying a bunch of attention to super delegates before all of

146
00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:09.660
this. And, and a lot of people had their eyes opened up to say, okay,

147
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:12.820
this is clearly wrong. Yeah. Why was it there in the first place?

148
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.780
Let's do something to fix the process.

149
00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.460
<v 0>Well, most people don't think until this election,</v>

150
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.930
the public wasn't even aware that that was, that. That was the case. Yeah.

151
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.330
And then when, you know, people find out about it, they go, wait, wait, wait,

152
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.690
what? Yeah. They can just decide to not vote the same way the people voted.

153
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.290
Yeah. And then they, the state can lose or, I mean,

154
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:36.370
the person can lose the state,

155
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.520
even though 70% of the state voted for that person. Right. That's insane. Yeah.

156
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.720
It is. Did you read Donna Brazil's book?

157
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.360
<v 1>I didn't read the whole book. I heard I,</v>

158
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.240
I got excerpts excerpts from it and of it.

159
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.160
<v 0>Um, I was,</v>

160
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:55.080
I was shocked that they conspired to have Hillary

161
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.080
win the primaries. I was more shocked that more people weren't outraged.

162
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.360
<v 1>Yeah. What does that tell you?</v>

163
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.880
<v 0>It tells you that people have sort of resigned to the idea that this is a</v>

164
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:08.680
corrupt system. Yeah. That they don't have time. I mean,

165
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.680
it goes back to what we're saying earlier that, you know, people are exhausted.

166
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.750
Yeah. Most people mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; most people are exhausted &lt;affirmative&gt;.

167
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.870
<v 1>And I think that's where you see a lot of,</v>

168
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:23.310
a lot of the energy that came around for, um,

169
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.470
somebody like Bernie Sanders or somebody like Donald Trump who are perceived as

170
00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:29.430
being not of the system. Yeah.

171
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.773
<v 0>Whew.</v>

172
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:36.700
<v 1>But it, it shows us, it shows where we need to go, honestly.</v>

173
00:09:36.701 --> 00:09:38.980
And you're talking about authentic,

174
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.940
honest leaders who have integrity and, and um,

175
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.900
I think people are not as blind to like, people can tell.

176
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.420
Yeah. People can tell if you're being real or not,

177
00:09:52.421 --> 00:09:54.140
or if you're signing them a false bill of goods.

178
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.010
<v 0>I think they're better at it now. Yeah.</v>

179
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.170
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Paying more attention. Well, there's.</v>

180
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.770
<v 0>Also this there's enough footage of people now. That's.</v>

181
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.770
<v 1>Yeah. Everybody's a reporter now. Yeah.</v>

182
00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.610
<v 0>I mean, it's, uh, it's easy to go back and you say, well,</v>

183
00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:12.330
look at this interview from four years ago. Yeah. When they, uh,

184
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.130
we're completely different. Like what happened? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, I mean,

185
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:15.331
it's,

186
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:20.280
there's also calculated maneuvers that people do politically to align themselves

187
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:22.400
with one group or another where they realize like, okay, there's,

188
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:25.920
there's a lot of money in being a, a, this that's a that, you know,

189
00:10:25.921 --> 00:10:28.800
there's a lot of money in being a, whatever it is, you know,

190
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:33.360
Republican or Democrat or there's, there's an angle for success, right.

191
00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.480
<v 1>Yeah. Right. That's um,</v>

192
00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.310
all of those different labels and things that people are capitalizing on within

193
00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:41.144
the political world,

194
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.070
I think are the things that are turning off more and more people, right.

195
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.470
To the politics, because then it's like, well,

196
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:48.190
if you're not branded with this label,

197
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.310
then I'm not gonna talk to you or I'm not gonna have a conversation.

198
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.870
Or it's this camp versus another camp,

199
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.820
this tribe versus another tribe than like recognizing

200
00:10:58.821 --> 00:11:02.540
even amongst our own families and friends and communities, like we,

201
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.740
we figure out ways to talk things through and find ways to collaborate and

202
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.820
areas where we agree. We can agree to disagree on certain things,

203
00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:12.660
but we can do that with, you know,

204
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:15.140
what we in Hawaii call Aloha and with respect. Yeah.

205
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.490
And actually find a way through to move forward.
