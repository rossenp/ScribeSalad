00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 1>Experience. I, I, I would really like cross promotion fights, you know,</v>

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:06.713
I really would.

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.560
<v 0>Betor just did it with Verizon. Yeah. You know, and what's your, I mean,</v>

5
00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.360
what's your take on that? I think it's.

6
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.000
<v 1>Be good for everybody. Like I said, I'm obsessed with Douglas.</v>

7
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.880
lima&lt;laugh&gt; fighting at 170 pounds. I wanna have you not seen Patricio fight.

8
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.870
Yes. I'm I'm look, I'm obsessed with Patricio too, but I look,

9
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.590
I feel like right now, 1 45 in the UFC is so talent stacked. Yes.

10
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.790
I'm comfortable with some of these matchups that I wanna see. Um,

11
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.990
I really am interested in seeing, um,

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.710
a rematch between vulcanoski in max Holloway. Yep.

13
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.310
I think max Holloway with just a few adjustments checking those leg kicks. Yeah.

14
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:40.950
And maybe a little bit more movement. He, you know, I think he can win that for,

15
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.540
but I think vulcannaziski with a few adjustments might be able to put on even

16
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.780
better performance. And now that he's beaten the, the goat feather weight,

17
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.540
I mean, who knows? I mean, a lot of guys,

18
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.740
you don't really see what they're capable of until they win the title.

19
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.260
And then you see the confidence take over. I mean,

20
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.380
I think cross promotion with all the champions would be fantastic. I mean, look,

21
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.410
I'm a terrible business person. I would obviously,

22
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.170
obviously I'd promote everybody. I'd be like. Yeah. Beto. Let's be friends.

23
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.730
Let's, I'll blow you guys up too. I wouldn't,

24
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.810
I don't think the way the UFC does. It's sort of an I isolationist perspective.

25
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.690
Like when feddo was a champion,

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.770
they would get bummed out that I would kept mentioning him when feddo was over

27
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:21.250
in pride. And I was like,

28
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:23.840
you gotta take anys consideration fedydo millionco yeah. I mean,

29
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:25.520
you might be the best heavyweight alive.

30
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.000
And there was a lot of guys over there that were phenomenal fighters and we

31
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.360
absorbed a few of themem and there was some problems with that. You know,

32
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.760
obviously there was problems with the fact that the contracts that they got from

33
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.280
pride, a lot of 'em weren't real. So, you know, there was,

34
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.320
we thought we had faydore and we didn't, we, we thought we had a lot of guys,

35
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:44.670
they had to just put 'em under nuke contracts. Mark Hunt was a good example.

36
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.430
He wrote out his contract and then there was a problem with supplements.

37
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.310
You know, a lot of those guys were on the Mexican juice, but.

38
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.550
<v 0>Cause it wasn't in the contract. No,</v>

39
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:54.030
I fought over there and they said we did not test for steroids,

40
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:55.150
like in the contract and.

41
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.950
<v 1>In anyway, tell me that it was in giant bold print. Yes. It was&lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

42
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.780
<v 0>It was, it actually was. Yeah. I want to even say it was under. Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.980
It was like, no look. So I agree with cross promotion. Yes.

44
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.860
I wanna see that I a hundred percent wanna see that, but I also think though,

45
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:13.780
too, you gotta look out for all promotions. If we're gonna cross promote,

46
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.300
let's not have champion versus champion.

47
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.900
Let's have your number two guy versus this number three guy. Sure.

48
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.060
Let's make the best fight.

49
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.340
<v 1>Here's the thing. Do you think it would hurt the UFC?</v>

50
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.970
Cuz I don't know if it would. I think it would definitely helped Bellator,

51
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.530
but I don't know. First of all, I hate the name Bellator.

52
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.090
<v 0>I, I, I think everyone did and I honestly, I think everyone did it. It was true.</v>

53
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.650
I mean, but here's the thing like you already, they already spent millions.

54
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.610
I understand probably close to over a billion dollars and trying to make sure

55
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:39.210
that it was marketed properly back then.

56
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.050
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; when Scott came in, it's like,

57
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:42.970
let's not try to rebrand this. And Scott's,

58
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.760
Scott's brilliant when I'm still doing this thing, these type of things.

59
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.600
But you notice how he got rid of the, he made it very simple.

60
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:51.040
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the logo is simple. Everything is simple now.

61
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.360
And it's easier to say, oh,

62
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:56.280
that's our logo right there versus this big word that says with like a,

63
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
I don't even know what it was behind.

64
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:01.560
It was like a Bellator fighter or whatever it was. Yeah. It went away gone.

65
00:03:01.561 --> 00:03:05.440
Yeah. So look, he look at all these things. It takes time to get branded.

66
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.280
<v 1>Do you remember king of the cage when they used to have the king of the cage?</v>

67
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.760
A giant bodybuilder dude? Yes. Who was like the mascot? Yep.

68
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.280
Remember how strange that was? Uh, shout.

69
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.160
<v 0>Out to terryroock good. That guy look he's been around forever, forever.</v>

70
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.950
<v 1>Around Terry. This thing though. You.</v>

71
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.950
<v 0>Gotta appreciate guys like that. Yes. Cause even though he's not getting rich,</v>

72
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.590
but he's also making sure that young and up and coming fighters have a way to

73
00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:30.550
like get their name out there and still fight at, you know, at.

74
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.950
<v 1>A high level. Well, you know, budrezman was one of the owners as well.</v>

75
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.670
He's a really good friend of mine. He actually sold him. My old house.

76
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.150
He lives in my old house. He's a real good friend of mine. I.

77
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.100
<v 0>I had never met him. I don't think. But bud.</v>

78
00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.020
<v 1>And Terry were partners in the, the,</v>

79
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:46.940
a venture and they used to have this guy who was this enormous bald

80
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.180
bodybuilder dude who was the king of the cage. Yeah. And he was like a mascot.

81
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.380
Yep. You remember? It was so yeah, I do.

82
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.920
<v 0>Remember. It was always,</v>

83
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.580
he was always wearing like a dry fit shirt or like a really tight,

84
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.260
a really tight yeah, yeah.

85
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.890
<v 1>Yeah. And old connect. Bald guy. Huge muscles. Yep.</v>

86
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.090
But it was so strange. It was like, but he's not the fighter. No,

87
00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:07.930
this is so weird. &lt;laugh&gt; like give a mascot.

88
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.850
<v 0>Yeah. Hey, whatever man. Everyone's got, you've gotta try.</v>

89
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.690
<v 1>Something. Differentifferent mascots are weird for it's a fighting mask.</v>

90
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.970
Cause remember the UFC had the dude who was the bald muscular guy in the

91
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:21.480
logo. Do remember that? Is that you? No,

92
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.360
&lt;laugh&gt;s on me as boss Rudin. It looked like boss Rudin. Oh.

93
00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:27.880
Do you remember the early days of the UFC,

94
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.280
the logo had this guy who was his bald Jack dude. Yeah.

95
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.760
And that was like a part of the UFC logo with some bald dude.

96
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.520
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I do remember that. I do.</v>

97
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.440
<v 1>Remember it was weird. It looked like boss. Like when boss won the top,</v>

98
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.110
I was like, is this Destin for you? Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; like,

99
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:47.350
look at this &lt;laugh&gt; it was really weird. There it is. Look at the old logo.

100
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.510
Yeah. That's true. How weird is that?

101
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.870
No one like that ever won the title up until boss.

102
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.430
<v 0>But that's like, so when Scott came in, he changed the logo to make it simple.</v>

103
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.871
Like,

104
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.990
like basically what Dana and Lorenzo and those guys did basically made it simple

105
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:03.180
like that. Yeah. So I think, I think it's good for the sport. We'll see, like,

106
00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:05.940
look, the name itself is like, Hey, do we wanna rebrand this? No,

107
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:07.020
you don't wanna waste all the money.

108
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:09.900
You did trying to rebrand a new organization. Right. That's just too hard.

109
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.340
And it, you know, at the end of the day, it's, you know,

110
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.340
the execs talk and they're like, Hey, let's just try and make some changes,

111
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:17.860
make it simple and make everyone just fall in love with us all over again.

112
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.140
But you know, for a different reason, the other thing too,

113
00:05:20.141 --> 00:05:24.290
even though we are doing a tournament format for our fights, we're,

114
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:27.050
we're not doing 'em every like be tour before I was doing 'em every Friday

115
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.170
different weight class. And I didn't even really,

116
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.810
I never paid attention cuz it was just too hectic to try and keep up.

117
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.010
Now you have big fights scheduled, you know, every, you know, once a month,

118
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.610
you know, with the, with the tournament fighters. So, um,

119
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:42.010
like this weekend we have cyborg fight and Julia, but for the title, which is.

120
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.880
<v 1>Fight phenomenal, very underooked fight. Yeah. Julia, Budd's a monster.</v>

121
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:47.960
<v 0>She's an animal. And I mean, people are,</v>

122
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.160
and it's funny cuz everyone just keeps overlooking her and she she's so jacked,

123
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.240
you know? And she's not only is she jacked, she's got her,

124
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:56.440
wrestling's gotten a lot better and I need to remind you guys,

125
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.080
her only two losses have been to a man Nuez and Rhonda Rousey when Rhonda Rousey

126
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:03.440
was at the top of her game. Now those two losses though,

127
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:07.200
two were extremely early in her career. She's been on a terror ever since then.

128
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.280
And she's been doing phenomenal. The I've had again talking with John,

129
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.520
him and I have talked her it's her confidence.

130
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:16.990
Her confidence needs to be at a D the.

131
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.710
<v 1>Guns on that chick. &lt;laugh&gt; Jesus.</v>

132
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.070
<v 0>Christ. Her striking, I think is better than, than cyborg. Really? Yes.</v>

133
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.990
I think it's better. Really? Her striking's better than cyborg.

134
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.430
Now it's a bold statement. Can't she take a shot from cyborg? Who knows?

135
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.870
But I think there's a lot to be said,

136
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:35.950
like cyborg doesn't throw the straightest punches in the world. Right. You know,

137
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.980
she throws a lot of hooks. So if Julia compress her to the fence, get inside,

138
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.740
thelinnch make her that dirty get in that dirty boxing,

139
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.620
get rid of those loopy punches.

140
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:46.100
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and be inside that pocket right there.

141
00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.660
Then I think she's got a good chance.

142
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.940
<v 1>Well, after cybo got flatlined by Amanda, Nuez the whole game just changed.</v>

143
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.900
Yeah. Everything changed, you know, you realized do everybody else. Okay. Okay.

144
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.450
Yeah. Well, first of all, Nu as it has hammers,

145
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.930
that lady throws hammers. It's crazy. It's crazy. How bad she is.

146
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.990
I look at it though.

147
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.690
<v 0>Too. That cyborg had been undefeated for so long.</v>

148
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.370
Hadn't lost in so long. Yeah. That she's just like,

149
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.650
I'm just gonna walk through this chick and it just cost her.

150
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.610
I think her confidence was that, oh, none of these girls can hurt me.

151
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.080
I could beat her know. And when she got hit, I'm gonna hit you back.

152
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.680
She was thinking she was gonna impose her wheel like she did against everyone

153
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:26.760
else. Right. Okay. And she's gonna try to do the same thing to Julia, but right.

154
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.440
And it's a matter of whether, how Julia, but responds. And we're gonna know,

155
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.480
I think in that first round,

156
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.520
whether Julia is going to rise to the occasion or if she's gonna step

157
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:41.190
back and let cyber work dictate the pace like a lot of other girls have. Right.

158
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.670
I think with Amanda, when she pushed Amanda back,

159
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.750
Amanda hit her and cyberborg got rocked and Amanda pressed Ford and she thought

160
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:49.630
she was gonna hit her back. And it became with this exchange.

161
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:52.870
It was a very sloppy fight on, I think from both sides.

162
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.990
But Amanda has big dogs and was able to land the clean good punches and timing.

163
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.790
<v 1>The timing was fantastic. She.</v>

164
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.060
<v 0>What she,</v>

165
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.780
he did very well in that fight was that she made sure that she didn't blow her

166
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.100
wa and wasteless punches. She pick, she was picking and choosing her shots.

167
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.940
So she was making sure that they were landing versus just throwing, you know,

168
00:08:09.941 --> 00:08:11.180
aimlessly and not landing.

169
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.420
You see that a lot of times people get rocked and the guy just comes and he

170
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.700
smotherers himself so much that nothing lands and the guy recovers and you're

171
00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:18.860
back to fighting. Yeah.

172
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.170
<v 1>I, you know, know when I, when I knew that Amanda Nuez was a dangerous,</v>

173
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:28.170
dangerous fighter was first of all, the first round went well, well, you know,

174
00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:31.370
there's a lot of fights where you saw it, you know, you started to,

175
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.650
to see it with cats. And ghanano the first round.

176
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:37.050
She almost had cats and ghanano out, but then she faded and then she,

177
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.970
she got put away later in the fight, which just shows how tough cats and Ghana.

178
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.600
Yes. KAZE, Gone's a savaboage she's at Bellator nine. Yes. I know.

179
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.880
Very happy to see her over there.

180
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.320
But when Amanda Nuez beat the outta mieshaateton and strangled her, I was like,

181
00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.640
oh God. Yeah, Jesus Christ. And then when the,

182
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:54.920
the Raque Pennnington fights an underooked fight. Yeah.

183
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.680
Because Raque Pennington is as tough as they come,

184
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.840
that lady impresses the outta me.

185
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.720
And the fact that she was able to stop her and beat her down before she stopped

186
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:06.720
her. You know, you just,

187
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.440
you realize she was on another level at that point in time.

188
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.280
But still when the cyborg fight had questions, I was like, is she gonna be,

189
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:15.870
look what she did to Holly? Holmess yborg just bullied Holly home.

190
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.070
She was just on top of her beating her down. And Holly is a phenomenal striker.

191
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:23.590
Yes. And I was like, man is man. But the difference is Amanda is her hands.

192
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.910
Yeah. Holly, you know, has good power to hands. Excellent timing.

193
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.710
Good counters. But Amanda has like legit one shot, knockout power. Yeah.

194
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.350
I agree.

195
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:36.500
<v 0>I just would've liked to have seen them do a second fight because I think,</v>

196
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.740
I think that cyberrg, would've fought a smarter yes. Fight.

197
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.820
And it would've been a different.

198
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.740
<v 1>Outcome. She would've made a different, she would've made the adjustments.</v>

199
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.860
<v 0>For yeah. She would've made the adjustments, not just made the adjustments,</v>

200
00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:47.540
but we saw what Jermaine derronomy when Jermaine fought her, that Amanda,

201
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.460
as the fight goes on, she's not the same fighter. Why do you think.

202
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.020
<v 1>That she decided to move over to Bellator?</v>

203
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.220
Why do you think she didn't pursue the rematch? Oh.

204
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.570
<v 0>You know of the answer to that? Come on, Joe, is it like Dana?</v>

205
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.970
It's not just you can't. I, I think the comments, just the,

206
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.930
to being treated like there, you know,

207
00:10:02.931 --> 00:10:05.850
certain ways people talking behind her back saying, you know, calling her,

208
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.010
you know, a man, whatever it was, those are, there's not just that.

209
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.810
But then also to a little bit of the, I think some of the mistreatment, um,

210
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.650
in that, in that whole thing, the other thing as well,

211
00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:20.200
let's all that stuff aside, she's got a relationship with Scott Coker.

212
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.080
She had it from Strikeforce and they've always got along. He's always,

213
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.640
he's always AED. And you gotta remember,

214
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.800
he's the one that first put women's MMA on the, on the, on the big stage,

215
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.640
you know, her and ginarono were the ones that made women's MMA.

216
00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:36.480
That next level of, of what a, what it could be.

217
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.230
<v 1>There was something that happened between them where the UFC was like,</v>

218
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:42.870
we're getting outta the cyborg business. I'm trying to remember what it was.

219
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:48.070
I don't remember what happened, but there was some sort of a dispute that they.

220
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.910
<v 0>Had. Was it before I think it was before the Amanda fight. Oh.</v>

221
00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:52.470
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

222
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.670
They put out a video Cyborg's boyfriend put out a video,

223
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.620
he put words in Dana White's mouth, mouth. And they were fake. Yep. They,

224
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:04.260
they mistranslated it on purpose willfully,

225
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.260
and then she had to apologized for it. And then theoc was like,

226
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:10.060
get the outta here. You can't do that. Yeah. And that's when they released her,

227
00:11:10.061 --> 00:11:11.060
but that wasn't her. Right.

228
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.980
<v 0>Her boyfriend, her boyfriend and her and her management, I think.</v>

229
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.260
<v 1>Or something like that. Well, her boyfriend is her man. Okay. Yeah.</v>

230
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:19.770
That's what it was. So that's why she, she got out the business.

231
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:22.170
That's why the UFC got done with the cyborg. But.

232
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.290
<v 0>Here's the thing is that when she was with, when she she's been,</v>

233
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.450
she hadn't lost in what? 15 years or so like that. Something since.

234
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.770
<v 1>Gina Carran. Well, before the ginaran fight,</v>

235
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.170
her first fight was her very first fight. First.

236
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.970
<v 0>She lost fight. Yeah. But whenever, so that first fight,</v>

237
00:11:36.971 --> 00:11:40.440
she hadn't lost since then. It's been close to 15 years. Yeah.

238
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.720
And to say that like now all of a sudden, cuz she had one loss after a man,

239
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.400
Nu or to when she lost to man, Nuez that she's done.

240
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.960
Like she wants to fight easy fights.

241
00:11:48.961 --> 00:11:52.360
She wants Julia butt is not an easy fight for her. No. You know? And um,

242
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.680
but that, when we go back to, when I was talking about the narrative,

243
00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:59.280
the narrative being that Dana shapes, the narrative, the narrative is that,

244
00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:02.560
look, if you wanna fight over there, you're gonna have easier fights. And the,

245
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.160
the press jumps on board and the fighters jump on board and it becomes an issue.

246
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:09.280
That's why I feel like we're not seen cross.

247
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.400
<v 1>Promotions. Well, I just think it's a business decision.</v>

248
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.830
The UFC doesn't have an invested interest in blowing up Bellator and making them

249
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:17.350
bigger and Bellator would get bigger along the way.

250
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.670
But I think Julia bot hangs with any 145 pounder in the UFC.

251
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:23.350
And I would like to see her fight in the UFC.

252
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:25.590
I would like to see crosspromoion with her as well.

253
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:31.110
I just feel like it's just one of those things where it's it hampers the, the,

254
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.020
the, the fans cuz the athlete it's they're just not gonna face each other.

255
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.260
<v 0>Well, let me,</v>

256
00:12:36.261 --> 00:12:41.260
let me go into this is we already saw a cross promotion when UFC

257
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.300
was basically asking, or I don't wanna say begging, but they were,

258
00:12:45.301 --> 00:12:49.100
they were trying to force the issue with C Chuck Ladell fighting vandler in.

259
00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:51.460
Yeah. Vanla yeah. And remember that they.

260
00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.850
<v 1>Got over because they actually sent go over there and then pride.</v>

261
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:56.010
Didn't send anybody over here.

262
00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.290
<v 0>Yes. You know, and, and I here's the thing though,</v>

263
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.770
we've already seen with Scott, what he says he's gonna do. He does. Yes.

264
00:13:01.771 --> 00:13:04.810
And that, that's a big reason when I had to, I actually had to fight call Jerry.

265
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.931
It was supposed to be,

266
00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:10.450
they sent aocki over when it was dream and they sent aocki over and Scott was

267
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.530
supposed to send Gilbert over afterwards to fight each other.

268
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.240
So a aocki fought in Strikeforce and then after Gil beat him,

269
00:13:16.241 --> 00:13:19.200
he was supposed to go over there and fight him in a ring. That didn't happen.

270
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.760
So I got a call on like 12 days notice and Scott's like, you need,

271
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.200
can you do this for me? And I was like, I'm,

272
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.560
I'm literally sitting at the court side of the warriors game,

273
00:13:27.561 --> 00:13:30.640
eating chicken strips and drinking a beer &lt;laugh&gt; and I'm like, I'm like,

274
00:13:30.641 --> 00:13:33.080
let me go home. I'm gonna run about four or five miles. See how I feel.

275
00:13:33.081 --> 00:13:35.430
And I'll get back to you. Call 'em that night at, at night. And he's like,

276
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:36.750
I'm like, yeah, I'm good. I can go.

277
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.830
So that's how I took the fight with Caler on like 10 days notice.

278
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.070
And just so look,

279
00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:44.990
when people want to talk about how the Japanese do business and what happened

280
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:46.390
with the UFC. I can understand,

281
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.710
I can understand while they're hesitant to do cross promotion. Because when,

282
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.830
when I actually accepted that fight with 10 days,

283
00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:55.620
notice I was supposed to fight Aoki. But when I got there,

284
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.700
they changed it to C Jerry. Wow.

285
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.520
<v 1>That's a big difference.</v>

286
00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.380
<v 0>That's a big difference.</v>

287
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.100
But what they do is what they do is one's a wrestler and one's a Jitsu guy.

288
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.060
Sure. But the other thing too is what they do is they say, Hey,

289
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.620
here's another amount of money. Here's a check for this.

290
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.300
If you switch and you take this guy.

291
00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:22.130
<v 2>I.</v>
