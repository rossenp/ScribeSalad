00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Most insulting thing I've gotten, this is recent.</v>

2
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.220
I don't even know how to talk about it, but anyways, I should,

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.650
because it's just funny, you know, I'm, uh,

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:13.680
I'm at the final at this point in my career of people sending me scripts,

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.340
if I want to do it, which is very flattering. I'm like, oh great.

6
00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:19.470
So there's an email. My agent sent me.

7
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:20.970
He's like either you're going to be really angry at this.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.320
All really happy about it. I was like, oh.

9
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.030
Not a good way to start an email from me agent. And um, they're like,

10
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.290
they want you to play a lead in this bio pic. I was like, oh, what's up?

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.590
You know, like I'm ready. Uh, and then they're like, yeah, but, uh,

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.940
it's the biopic of William hung. I was like, brother, you kiss.

13
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.510
<v 1>At the Virginia's shooter. Nah, nah, nah, nah. Oh, that's that?</v>

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.660
Guy's the American singer. She bangs.

15
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.440
I met that dude look nothing wrong with the guy.

16
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.970
That was definitely something wrong with him. Well.

17
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.910
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. But yes, yes, yes. But he's not malicious,</v>

18
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.360
maybe a little Asperger or something. I don't know what it is, but.

19
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.250
<v 2>I thought it was that, that one dude who was a shooter. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.850
<v 0>Yeah. That's tough too. I read all 115 pages of that script.</v>

21
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.810
I've never been so angry reading a script like I wanted to

22
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.940
vomit. And why were you angry? Well,

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.980
you got to understand. I think, um,

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.340
William hung set us back like 10 years.

25
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.410
<v 1>Look nothing wrong with that brother. It's not his fault. Right?</v>

26
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.180
Maybe there's a very nuance.

27
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 0>Way to write this movie of why American idol producers picked him out of the</v>

28
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:38.540
crowd and featured them just to make fun of him and why the rest of America

29
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:42.230
laughed at this guy. That might be an interesting story.

30
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.740
<v 2>Well, it wasn't that the whole thing about American idol it's like you had real</v>

31
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:46.131
talent,

32
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:49.910
but then you also had delusional people and the delusional people was part of

33
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:50.720
the.

34
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.860
<v 0>It's funny. I love watching that,</v>

35
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:53.840
but I think it just cuts so deep as an Asian guy.

36
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.130
It's the opposite of Bruce Lee.

37
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:59.390
William hung is the exact opposite of Bruce Lee and, and.

38
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.780
<v 2>He's, there's something wrong with him. I mean, as a human being,</v>

39
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.360
like there's something to be said,

40
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.370
like I get that the guy signed a release and I get

41
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.110
that. That's part of the fun with the show,

42
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.460
but there is kind of a difference between people that are mentally challenged

43
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.350
and someone who's just not very talented.

44
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.720
<v 0>But people are laughing at him. Exactly.</v>

45
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.490
<v 2>That's what I'm saying. He's mentally challenged,</v>

46
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.530
just something wrong with them. When I say there's nothing.

47
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.740
<v 0>Wrong with him, I don't mean he's not, you know, autistic, mental challenge,</v>

48
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.700
whatever it may be. I'm saying there's nothing wrong with his intentions.

49
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.970
He's a dreamer. He wants to make it. Right. Right, right.

50
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.230
So there's sure a very nuanced way to write about William home,

51
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.490
um, that could work, but we just shouldn't make that movie.

52
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.170
Have we ran that at Asian people out there that I can do biopics about and a

53
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.090
William Hong script lands on my desk.

54
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.350
<v 2>Isn't that, that's a part of the problem with reality TV in general. Right?</v>

55
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:55.130
It's like,

56
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.680
what they're trying to do is there's some reality TV that's based on actual

57
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.410
events that are taking place. But a lot of it is like they're taking,

58
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.180
you have to sign these releases on a lot of these shows that allow them to edit

59
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:09.820
your words in a very distorted way.

60
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.100
Like you can like you and I can have a conversation.

61
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.540
You could have an answer to one question and they'll put that answer on another

62
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:18.460
question. That's totally unrelated. Right?

63
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.900
You look like a real piece of and they're a 100% allowed to do that.

64
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.720
And they do that for the storyline. They do that for the narrative.

65
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.130
They don't care about your reputation.

66
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.560
They don't care about what happens when you go back home people like,

67
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.470
how can you say that Jimmy? Like, I didn't,

68
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.980
you didn't have access to the raw tapes. You can't release, you know,

69
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:36.850
no one's going to believe you,

70
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:41.260
but that's they victimize people on purpose just so that they can make a good,

71
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.040
what they call a good show. Yeah. But they're doing that with him.

72
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:49.960
It's different because he's got a problem. It's not like he's a guy. Like,

73
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.380
it's not like if I decided I was going to be a singer and I went on American,

74
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.870
America's got talent. I was terrible. And I was,

75
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.990
I'm sitting in and everybody just, they hit the buzzer to get the outta here.

76
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.770
Like yeah, I can. I'm a normal person. Like if you think I suck,

77
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.970
like I probably suck. But if I have a problem, like a mental problem,

78
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:11.350
like there's something wrong with me. Yeah. And I do that and you know,

79
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.930
there's something wrong with me and you still put me on television.

80
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.480
That's where we're getting weird. That's where we're getting like,

81
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:20.100
are you PR you're profiting off? Yes.

82
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.820
You're profiting off of someone. Who's clearly mentally handicapped in some,

83
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.840
some way shape or form. If there's a spectrum of mental disability,

84
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.880
he's on that spectrum. It's not you. It's not Jamie. It's not me. It's like, oh,

85
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.210
it was a regular guy. Yeah. You know, we're all different, but regular, no,

86
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.600
you can talk to them that guy's off, something's off, you know, he's off.

87
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.660
But they like perfect, Ron. It perfect.

88
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.950
<v 1>Wind them up because people are that they know people will laugh.</v>

89
00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:48.330
And why are people laughing?

90
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.630
<v 0>You know, I look, it it's tough being, uh,</v>

91
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.430
I guess one of few Asian actors in America, right. Uh,

92
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:59.190
I'm very fortunate to be in a position. We all kind of know each other.

93
00:04:59.191 --> 00:05:02.100
It's a small circle. I'm very proud of all of us.

94
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.320
But early on in my career, I got some flack, uh, from Silicon valley,

95
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.450
my character, you know, uh, it was, uh, accented character. Um, which, I mean,

96
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.800
for me, it's a little different because I came to this country when I was 13,

97
00:05:16.801 --> 00:05:18.330
I couldn't really speak English. So I was like, okay,

98
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:20.070
I'm just gonna play an early version of myself.

99
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.560
I understand I'm gonna try to put some humanities character,

100
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.210
but then some articles or whatever. It's like, this is the offensive stereotype,

101
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.390
blah, blah, blah. And that really looked into that. I was like, okay, I get it.

102
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.230
Eventually the character became a more three-dimensional character because the

103
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:35.010
jokes no longer.

104
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.630
And him just being foreign it's on him being like a diabolical coder person or

105
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:40.464
whatever.

106
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.360
But it's tough being an Asian actor because now not only do I have to,

107
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.850
uh, uh, uh, decide on playing a part in that by looking at, oh,

108
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.600
is this a good script? I got to look at the cultural ramifications.

109
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.640
Is this good representation? Because there's so few of us,

110
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.270
each of us that does something mean so much more, right? Uh,

111
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:05.870
that was the beef with the APU character because there wasn't a lot of Indian

112
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.400
and then you characterize whatever. Now that's, what's great about,

113
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.620
uh, crazy rich Asians.

114
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.030
And then I had a lot of fun on that movie because for one of the first times,

115
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:21.170
I wasn't the only Asian dude on set and I can just play a character.

116
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.060
My character is an in that movie,

117
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.590
but I can just lean into that and be a character actor and play it, man.

118
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.940
<v 2>It's a powerful, funny movie, great production. It came out excellent.</v>

119
00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:34.510
Everybody enjoyed it and all good. And there's a whole spectrum.

120
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:35.170
<v 0>Of Asians.</v>

121
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.040
It's not just one Asian representing all Asians and that you're handsome Asians,

122
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.670
your,

123
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.620
Asians to a romantic lead and also the ex-girlfriend whatever.

124
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:49.510
So we can just actually be actors for the first time and not be actor slash

125
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.920
Asian representative. So when something like William hung the table. Yeah.

126
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.710
Just can't do it, man. I mean, I get on.

127
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.960
<v 2>I get it. You know, it's interesting that,</v>

128
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.030
that it's like when someone gets offended at racial stereotypes,

129
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.460
society puts it through this filter of whether or not it's a valid and I'll give

130
00:07:09.461 --> 00:07:10.091
you an example,

131
00:07:10.091 --> 00:07:14.920
the Soprano's the Italian American Anti-Defamation

132
00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:16.490
league or whatever the it is. I don't know. They were,

133
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:20.050
they were at the Soprano's they're that it was, uh,

134
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.790
it was reinforcing negative stereotypes about Italians and I'm

135
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:27.370
Italian and everyone, I know that's Italian was like,

136
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.050
what the are you talking about? Those are real people.

137
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:36.610
I know guys like that, like this is offensive. What's offensive reality. Yeah.

138
00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.690
Is the mob real? Are those fat guys real? Do they eat pasta like that?

139
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.000
That's real. Yeah. Like that's not a,

140
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.110
because Italians aren't really discriminated against,

141
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.070
so it's it doesn't hold any water. What also.

142
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.720
<v 0>You are Italian. There's a ton of Italian actors, comedians out there.</v>

143
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.900
So Sopranos is not the only place.

144
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.000
<v 1>Where you see it. Right. It's not the only represent.</v>

145
00:08:01.001 --> 00:08:03.610
So that waters it down and it's fine. Yeah. Because.

146
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.590
<v 0>White people, yeah. You can play, uh, whatever, uh, mentally handicapped guy,</v>

147
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.700
not so smart guy or complete because there's a million other white people.
