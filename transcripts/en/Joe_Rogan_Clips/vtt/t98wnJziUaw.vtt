1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>The general good experience. Um, to bring it back to your work.</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.340
One of the things that you talked about was eyesight and, um,

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.600
regaining eyesight, or dealing with people that have weakening eyesight.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.380
My eyesight is going to, man. Do you have some getting older? No.

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
And I'm just old 52 and just there's the macular degeneration.

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.370
Like I can't, I mean, I can read my phone.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.870
I can read all these text messages that are coming in 14 new ones since I put my

8
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:28.704
phone down.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.390
But what I do know for sure is that my vision is not as good as it was 10 years

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:38.180
ago. And certainly not as good as it was 20 years ago. What are you done? Okay.

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.660
<v 1>So there's what can be done now and where we're headed,</v>

12
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:44.840
but I suspect you want to know what can be done now fix my eyes. Okay.

13
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.680
So we do have a clinical trial in my lab right now through my affiliation with

14
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:53.450
ophthalmology, where, uh, people put on VR goggles,

15
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.780
very separate from the fear inducing thing.

16
00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:58.280
It's actually a very pleasant experience.

17
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.770
And we use a particular pattern of stimulation that

18
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.390
activates the cells in the eye that are most vulnerable and create vision loss.

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.050
It stimulates those in a way that reinforces their connections with the brain.

20
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.370
That's the logic. So every cell in your eye has a different function,

21
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:16.911
but some of them,

22
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.730
their job is to transmit visual information to the rest of the brain.

23
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.020
They're called ganglion cells.

24
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.120
We know what patterns of activity make them healthy and what

25
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.490
reinforced regeneration. Back in 2016,

26
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:32.270
my lab published a paper showing that that particular pattern of stimulation

27
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.610
combined with a particular pattern of gene therapy.

28
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.860
So this is one injection into the eye of a gene that triggers growth of these

29
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:43.760
cells in mice that allowed regeneration of neurons that were

30
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:46.700
damaged. And it actually reversed slightly,

31
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:50.840
but it reversed blindness completely blind mice were able to see again. Oh,

32
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.890
so that was in mice.

33
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.990
We then took that built a human clinical trial using just the VR

34
00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:00.710
part. However, some people in this trial are receiving injections.

35
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.840
It's about once every month,

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.200
very painless injection into what we call the vitreous to the eye.

37
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.760
They shoot it right in the eyeball. Yeah,

38
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.130
just a little insulin syringe go right in. You look that way. Boom.

39
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.370
A skilled ophthalmologist can do this without any pain or anything.

40
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:14.530
I know it sounds terrible, but it's,

41
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:19.100
it's very straightforward to inject something called silica

42
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.960
CNTF ciliary near trophic factor and the combination of this

43
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:28.910
growth factor. Plus the visual stimulation we believe is going to protect

44
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.350
cells that would normally be lost from getting lost. So offset vision loss,

45
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.010
and potentially restore vision. Now the results of this trial aren't done,

46
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.470
but we are recruiting people for this trial. Jamie you're in.

47
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.370
<v 2>My eyes are good. And.</v>

48
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.550
<v 0>If the prisoners okay. And if the prisoners are really bad people,</v>

49
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:47.810
but they can't see that good. The.

50
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.640
<v 1>Injection part provided it's done by a really by a skilled ophthalmologists is,</v>

51
00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:53.180
is an it's a, it's a cinch.

52
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.270
You you've been through way worse this morning on your way to work. Trust me.

53
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:57.230
So it's, it's nothing.

54
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.370
The other thing is that there was a paper published just recently,

55
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.990
a couple of weeks ago, not from my lab,

56
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.970
but from a group over at university college, London,

57
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.140
looking at the effects of red light on mitochondria in a different cell type,

58
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:09.700
which are the photo receptors of the eye.

59
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.960
So you've got the cells that connect the eye,

60
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.880
the brain called the ganglion cells. And you got the photo receptors,

61
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:14.530
which take all this photon information,

62
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.140
turn it into this incredible thing we call vision,

63
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:21.250
which itself has a whole galaxy of information, but is amazing.

64
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.510
And those cells degenerate over time. The photoreceptors,

65
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.350
they don't do very well in part because as we age,

66
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.520
the mitochondrial function gets disrupted. This study was preliminary.

67
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:37.210
It wasn't very many subjects. I think it was only 20 subjects. Maybe it was 12,

68
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.580
but getting red light therapy,

69
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:43.390
just viewing a very bright flashes of red light of a particular wavelengths.

70
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.100
I don't want people going out there and blasting their eyes,

71
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.760
improved vision on vision tasks almost immediately.

72
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.370
And that's a very noninvasive approach. And.

73
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.910
<v 0>I have a, one of those red light therapy machines.</v>

74
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.060
<v 1>One of those shoes. Yeah. A little different than this.</v>

75
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.940
If you're interested in doing this, let me know. And we can, you know,

76
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.920
potentially plug you into this, um.

77
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.950
<v 0>Be the difference between that red light therapy and the other kind of red light</v>

78
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.630
therapy. Cause I really liked that juve thing. I'm not,

79
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:09.060
I'm not exactly sure what it does.

80
00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.240
It's supposed to like regenerate college in and do a bunch of different things

81
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.630
that helps you, but it feels good. It feels good to stand in front of it.

82
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.673
And the bright.

83
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.090
<v 1>Lift, you know, one of the things is,</v>

84
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.640
remember we're saying that the eyes are actually a piece of brain.

85
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.980
The brain needs to know when to be awake and when to be asleep.

86
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.640
One of the best ways to wake up your brain is to view bright light.

87
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.451
And you know,

88
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:30.930
there are all these people that are fanatic about blue light out there viewing

89
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:34.260
bright light in the morning from sunlight is the Mo is the best thing like in

90
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:36.960
Southern California, go outside two to 10 minutes, again, bright light.

91
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.790
And then you want to avoid light from like 11:00 PM to 4:00 AM actually has been

92
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:46.560
shown to suppress melatonin. It can disrupt sleep. It has a lot of problems.

93
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:48.990
You don't really want to be looking at any bright light in the middle of the

94
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:52.050
night. A lot of people get obsessed with blue light being bad.

95
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.350
You want bright light during the day and you don't want any bright light at

96
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:58.500
night, really too much of it. And people come after me though,

97
00:04:58.501 --> 00:04:59.670
like the blue blockers, you know,

98
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:02.490
I call it like the blue block in east does have been coming after me recently

99
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:05.730
because I'm out there saying like, it's like, what about the it's like, look,

100
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.570
the blue block yours will help filter some light. It'll make things less bright.

101
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.230
It's hard to see with sunglasses in your house. So be my guest and wear them.

102
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:16.380
But really what you want to do is dim the lights in the evening, deeper sleep,

103
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.550
melatonin, suppression. Isn't, won't be a problem. That'll that's all good.

104
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:21.384
Get bright light,

105
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.630
first thing in the morning when you wake up and then the bright red light is

106
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.160
probably having a dual effect.

107
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:29.130
It's probably increasing mitochondria in the photo receptors if the study is

108
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:29.400
right.

109
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.610
And I do believe this study isn't it looks really good to me and the person who

110
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:34.950
did it has been in the game a long time. So I trust him.

111
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.260
And in addition to that,

112
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.350
it's going to wake up your system and get the balance of these hormones.

113
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:42.210
Like you want cortisol high in the morning and,

114
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.180
and melatonin coming up about 16 hours later before sleep,

115
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.790
it's going to put all that into the right rhythm. So I say,

116
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:49.560
go ahead and do the red light thing.

117
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:52.440
But if you want to pursue the red light flashes or the VR,

118
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.340
and maybe even the CNTF injection where we should talk about that, CNTF.

119
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.000
<v 0>Injects mean the, they squirt it right in your eyeball.</v>

120
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.060
That's the growth factor. Yeah. But I'm scared of.

121
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.420
<v 3>That. Well, well the good, the news is.</v>

122
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.640
<v 1>The good news is that the VR,</v>

123
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:09.280
we do have a condition in the study where it's just VR.

124
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.450
So it's a daily at you're essentially, you know, neurons like to be active.

125
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.710
And these cells that connect the eye, the brain are the most above all others,

126
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.610
the most active neurons and cells in your entire.

127
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.820
<v 0>Body. I don't know of anybody who's done this, where they had the injections.</v>

128
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.080
<v 1>In the eyes. Oh yeah.</v>

129
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:28.990
Many people now in the study have had the injections we had gotten to the

130
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:32.230
benefits of the, of the, well, so I want to be careful.

131
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.330
I can't talk about the results of a clinical trial,

132
00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:37.390
but I can say they're promising and this is inhuman.

133
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.890
<v 0>Just wink. If you think I should do it, uh, wink, if you can fix my eyes.</v>

134
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.760
I think if you.

135
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.420
<v 1>If you qualify for the study, I definitely think you should do it. Um, but I,</v>

136
00:06:46.421 --> 00:06:49.060
I can't reveal that, uh, the results of the study,

137
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.250
cause I actually don't know in the name of good science,

138
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:54.250
I'm blinded to the conditions, no pun. Right. Like I just don't know,

139
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.820
but we have, we have subjects or patients that are as young, as 17,

140
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.980
as old as 80. Um, and the, the beauty of this is that it's,

141
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.250
uh, if you decide not to get the injection, it's completely non-invasive okay.

142
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.110
And how many injections do you have to have?

143
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.260
I think it's a once a month for a period of about six months. So.

144
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.330
<v 0>What I have to go to the bay area once a month.</v>

145
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.620
<v 1>Yeah, no. So there,</v>

146
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.310
so there is another version of this where there's a slow release polymer

147
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:22.840
capsule. That's, that's placed into the eye. That sounds even worse.

148
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.480
Just inject me and get it over with someday.

149
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.420
We will have drops that we'll get through the vitreous and down there.

150
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.430
Cause they're like, like we work on glaucoma in my lab,

151
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.700
people for glaucoma take, uh, drops, rye pressure. Um,

152
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.480
but getting things into, you know, remember it's brain.

153
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.330
And so there's a reason why you have this tough skull. They're.

154
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.610
<v 0>Not going to be able to think that way. Okay. Yeah. The,</v>

155
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:44.770
the brain thing is really my head up.

156
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:47.070
The fact that your eyeballs are you're exposed.

157
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.510
<v 4>Versus the brain. That is so nice. It's two pieces.</v>

158
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.250
<v 1>Of the brain. And so visual repair is soon going to go the way of two other</v>

159
00:07:54.251 --> 00:07:55.084
strategies.

160
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.970
And I think we're going to see this in humans in the next couple of years,

161
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.840
meaning two years.

162
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.110
Cause I hate the 10 years thing we've been hearing the 10 years thing forever.

163
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.980
One is the work of someone that you've had on here before Davidson.

164
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.440
Claire love that dude. He's great. He's terrific guy,

165
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:12.340
both for sake of his work on combating aging and also just,

166
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.340
I really have to tip my hat to him because he was really first man in,

167
00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:17.560
in terms of doing public facing science education,

168
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.650
through podcasts and things like that. And you know, I'm,

169
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.100
I'm starting to do that and others are starting to do it and he deserves credit

170
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:24.640
for that.

171
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.760
It puts scientists in a vulnerable place and I think he's doing it with a lot of

172
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.240
it integrity. And he's also got a fun personality, so great guy. Yeah.

173
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.130
So for him to get the point across.

174
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.100
So David's not typically known for doing vision research,

175
00:08:36.101 --> 00:08:39.520
but he paired up with another guy, his lab, a guy named Keegan.

176
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.150
He at Harvard children's hospital, someone I know very well,

177
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:46.720
we worked together on a number of things and they took advantage of what are

178
00:08:46.721 --> 00:08:47.920
they called? These Yamanaka factors.

179
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:51.490
Yamanaka won the Nobel prize prize for finding these four factors that could

180
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.040
essentially allow a cell to turn into anything.

181
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.230
Any other cell type kind of create stemness in the cells,

182
00:08:58.231 --> 00:08:59.430
make them pluripotent stem cells.

183
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.850
The problem was that tends to induce cancers in these cells.

184
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.150
So David's lab has combined an anti cancer gene. I think these,

185
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.460
these work are still not published, but he's talked about them.

186
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:12.240
So I feel comfortable doing this suppresses cancer while turning these cells

187
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:16.470
young again. And at least in mice, they see some very encouraging results.

188
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.020
So that would be a sort of one injection kind of thing where you go in,

189
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.870
once you get the injection and then never again. And if.

190
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.980
<v 0>I did an injection once a month, how long we talking, how many months.</v>

191
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:25.910
<v 1>For,</v>

192
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:30.110
so the study would probably run for about six months or the embedded capsule,

193
00:09:30.111 --> 00:09:32.150
the CNTF capsule combined with the VR.

194
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.530
Now you have to put those VR goggles on for 20 minutes a day and watch that's

195
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:38.180
easy. You can listen to music and do whatever you want.

196
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.700
It's a very passive thing that triggers activity, the cells.

197
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.600
The activity is key because we know that neurons, you know,

198
00:09:44.601 --> 00:09:46.850
you hear fire together wire together and all this other stuff.

199
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:51.140
But the fact that matter is neurons that are quieted. Even if you cast an arm,

200
00:09:51.141 --> 00:09:54.890
the neurons that support moving to that arm very quickly start to turn off and

201
00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:57.290
eventually they can die.

202
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.210
So keeping neurons active and alive and healthy involves keeping them literally

203
00:10:02.211 --> 00:10:04.940
active electrically. And so that's what this, the VR components about.

204
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.320
So there's the Sinclair kind of turning back the clock stuff.

205
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.010
And then colleagues of mine at Stanford are doing incredible work with neural

206
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.800
prosthesis prostheses. So little robotic retinas,

207
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.970
as well as stem cells that are injected into the eye that settled down into your

208
00:10:19.971 --> 00:10:21.740
eye and give you the cells that you've lost.

209
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.670
And we're not quite there with the human trials yet, but there's a group,

210
00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:28.610
the retinal repair initiative on part of this thing,

211
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:30.770
it has a kind of funny name, but it's called the retinal dream team,

212
00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:34.550
which is a bunch of people brought together to, to cure blindness,

213
00:10:34.551 --> 00:10:38.240
to solve blindness in a particular D's disease called neurofibromatosis.

214
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.290
So there are dozens of labs working extremely hard on this problem.

215
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.010
This is one place where I can say there's been tremendous progress in the last

216
00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:48.620
five years. There are clinical trials. Now for instance,

217
00:10:48.621 --> 00:10:50.570
the one in my lab and in two or three years,

218
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.290
you're going to start seeing people who would normally go blind.

219
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.220
You're going to halt that.

220
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.100
And you're going to see people who are completely blind.

221
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.830
I think eventually those people will see again.

222
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.810
<v 2>Wow. Yeah. I have a amazing, it's amazing. And you know.</v>

223
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.110
<v 1>Blind people that mental real, the, the mental real estate,</v>

224
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:12.050
but like the visual real estate in the brain gets taken over by other functions.

225
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.670
I, um, there's this guy, Dan man Siena, he's a skateboarder is completely blind.

226
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:17.630
He's amazing guy.

227
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.580
<v 4>And keyboards blind with a cane, whoa, rides up to rides up to curves.</v>

228
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.240
<v 1>And handrails all he's onto him. Kick flips out this kind of stuff. Regular.</v>

229
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:27.200
Yeah. And,

230
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:30.500
and I've talked to him a bunch of times because he was having some issues with

231
00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:33.590
his sleep because at one of the issues that blind people have is because light

232
00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.510
is controlling when to be alert and when to be asleep,

233
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.010
he was having some issues with this. So he contacted me. We're also in touch.

234
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:40.611
Cause we're trying to,

235
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:44.150
he's trying to build skate parks for blind kids so that they can oh yeah.

236
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.930
Check out Dan.

237
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.330
<v 4>Wow. That's insane. Such a beast.</v>

238
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.870
<v 1>I mean, most people would be, would be afraid to do this without. Yeah,</v>

239
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.690
that's crazy. Yeah. And what's, what's so great about Dan, is he also,

240
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.153
you know.

241
00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.630
<v 5>He's in, he's in graduate school. He's I mean, he is such a mess.</v>

242
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.900
<v 0>Things. So he knows where they are,</v>

243
00:12:03.901 --> 00:12:07.350
but how does he know the scale of the ramp or the pitch of the ramp?

244
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.690
<v 1>He has an internal representation of it.</v>

245
00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.440
<v 4>Wow. Yeah. That's bonkers.</v>

246
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.360
<v 5>He's from which she could see how cool it is.</v>

247
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:21.540
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. He's a, he teaches blind kids. Like what's possible basically.</v>

248
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.720
Cause talk about COVID and being indoors, blind, blind people.

249
00:12:24.721 --> 00:12:27.420
I spent a lot of time with blind people because of the visual restoration stuff.

250
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.030
And there are people like Dan who are out there trying to get blind people to

251
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:32.130
come out of their rooms, to get into society.

252
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.580
If you have a dog you're better off, right? Because the dog,

253
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.020
you outsource your vision to the dog.

254
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.740
There are now glasses that blind people can wear and walk down the street.

255
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:45.060
And it communicates with somebody in a, like a dispatcher who says, oh,

256
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:47.280
you know what? There's someone sketchy over there to your right.

257
00:12:47.281 --> 00:12:49.740
You don't want to cross the street. And it works really well,

258
00:12:49.741 --> 00:12:53.430
but it's very expensive. And of course, privacy is an issue. You get home,

259
00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:54.370
you start on dressing, you know,

260
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:57.600
you don't want the person like looking at you in the mirror. Right. Um,

261
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.150
you know, or maybe people do, but that's a whole different business, you know,

262
00:13:00.151 --> 00:13:04.890
but, but people like Dan are amazing. And, and I do believe, you know,

263
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:08.310
the hope is that people like Dan will eventually see it again. Um,

264
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.670
but that's going to require new cells and actually for him,

265
00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:14.700
he's going to need new eyes. So Dan actually has had, um,

266
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.940
because he had this coat's disease that led to at retinitis pigmentosa,

267
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:21.810
he had his eyes removed. So whenever people are like,

268
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:23.850
sometimes you'll see on social media, people will say,

269
00:13:23.851 --> 00:13:28.230
I don't believe he's blind. It's like guy doesn't even have eyes. So.

270
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.750
<v 3>Anyway, there's a lot, that's a whole universe of stuff.</v>

271
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.750
<v 1>But if you'd like to explore visual repair and visual restoration,</v>

272
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:37.350
offsetting vision loss more, um, the happy to, yeah.

273
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.280
<v 0>I would love to. Yeah. I'll be your Guinea pig. Get the party rolling. Okay.</v>
