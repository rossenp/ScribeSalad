<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.743
<v 1>To your product.</v>

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.980
The conversation that I had yesterday with Francis and Ghana about

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.960
escaping Cameroon,

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
making his way to Morocco and being arrested seven times,

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.950
trying to escape Morocco and go to.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.080
<v 2>Cause that little piece of land.</v>

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.570
And it's technically Europe in the north of Spain. Yeah. North of.

9
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.450
<v 1>Okay. They would, they would take them after they arrest them,</v>

10
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:25.284
they would hold them.

11
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.070
And then they would bring them to the Sahara desert and drop them off.

12
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.520
And they did that to him. Seven times. They literally tried to kill them.

13
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.600
They'd try to drop them off in the desert, no food, no water, no nothing,

14
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:38.550
no clothes. They did it in the winter.

15
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:42.540
They did it in the summer and the winter it's horrific because the temperature

16
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:46.800
drops to an insane level and there's, they have no transportation.

17
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.240
They have nowhere to go. And these Africans are doing this on a daily basis,

18
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.800
making this journey from whatever country they're in and Africa to try to make

19
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.634
it to Europe.

20
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.740
And he did it over the course of 14 months and he outlined his 14 month

21
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:05.580
journey of homelessness living in the forest. Dude.

22
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.520
It was crazy that.

23
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.460
<v 2>Do you know what Eritrea, which is Southern Ethiopia?</v>

24
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.050
So the only reason that came across my desk is there was an article and it said,

25
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.810
this is the only country where journalists are less free than in North Korea.

26
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.940
I'm like, oh my God, I'm getting to silver now.

27
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.020
And what they did is they took the journalists,

28
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.990
put them in steel cages and left them in the desert by and it's it's

29
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.870
uh, no one knows about this place. What's amazing about Eritrea is took the.

30
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.660
<v 1>Journalist and put them in steel cages and just left.</v>

31
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.980
<v 2>Them to die. But the capital of Eritrea, when Mussolini took over Ethiopia,</v>

32
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.200
it's a perfectly preserved Italian city.

33
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.950
So there's this like Fiat factory that they converted into like a museum.

34
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.810
So when you're in the capital as Mara, you're like in the Riviera, whatever,

35
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.800
some European city, and as soon as you step out, it's hell on earth. Holy.

36
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.380
So it, but that North Korea overtook them,

37
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.780
took back the lead of worst country for journalists.

38
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.720
But it's a fascinating country that no one knows about.

39
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.690
And the oppression there is absolutely insane.

40
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.340
<v 1>How many journalists have they killed?</v>

41
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.650
<v 2>I have no idea. This wasn't recently. This was a while ago.</v>

42
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:12.750
And it's the only country I think with no foreign journalists in it.

43
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.170
Like the thing that drives me crazy.

44
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:20.160
And I know you agree is that there's so many people who like read the New York

45
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:23.460
times or the new Yorker and they think they know everything about the world

46
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.930
because they just read the same publication.

47
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.340
Every else does where there's so many places that are so barbaric,

48
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.630
like Turkmenistan, whatever that it doesn't cross your desks.

49
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.430
So you don't even think it exists or it matters. It's like, well,

50
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.640
I'm sure I would have heard of it. It's like, no, no, no.

51
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.290
It just isn't sexy enough for someone to cover.

52
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.760
And these people are basically resigned to having a nightmare existence.

53
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.000
Not that necessarily we could do anything at an individual level and it's just

54
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:48.750
horrible.

55
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.280
<v 1>Yeah. There's a lot of them. And the unfortunate thing is,</v>

56
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.940
is too many to really follow. If you spent your day, day,

57
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.070
waking hours, paying attention,

58
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.930
all the atrocities that are being committed in the world,

59
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.170
you would never have time for anything else because they're constant.

60
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.280
Like we're just, we're, we're just so accustomed to this life here,

61
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:13.870
this first world, life that any deviation from that at all just seems horrific.

62
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:18.190
Like anything that goes wrong in America seems like intolerable and horrific and

63
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:22.840
a human rights violation. And like, this is the shining of the world.

64
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.801
And someone like you,

65
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.640
who's an immigrant can speak to this better than most you and someone also who

66
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.680
has traveled to places like North Korea and who understands the world better

67
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.180
than most we can talk about.

68
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.670
<v 2>Yeah. This is the theme of my next book, the white pill,</v>

69
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:40.840
which is just talking about people don't know how bad it used to be

70
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.180
and how close we came this country to falling in some very,

71
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:48.700
very bad, uh, directions. Uh,

72
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.790
and because it's kind of thing where if you don't talk about it, you, we forget,

73
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.350
you know, just what the past was.

74
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.480
People in this country have no idea about Stalin.

75
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.720
I'm writing a lot about him or the Berlin wall, the things that they did,

76
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:02.290
it's just, and you hear these, like I was just I'm writing right now.

77
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.560
There was this part, what Stalin would do is like he'd kill parents, right?

78
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.220
Cause they were traders or whatever, that kid who was left behind,

79
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.480
who now lost their parents boy or girl, whatever everyone knew.

80
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:16.780
If I help that kid, my family is under suspicion.

81
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.850
Why are you helping the child to these traders? Oh,

82
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.550
where you colluding with them in the past, because they're trying to find links.

83
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.960
So this poor kid is now a complete social outcast. Even family,

84
00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.160
friends wouldn't even look at them.

85
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.630
Even the children that they were friends with,

86
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:31.780
wouldn't look at them and they fallen away in history. No one, I mean,

87
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:35.560
there's so many cases like this and Americans don't have any idea of what that's

88
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:36.394
like.

89
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.290
<v 1>How recent that was too. It's not even a hundred years ago. Right? Right.</v>

90
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.520
Not even a hundred years ago,

91
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:45.580
people were resorting to cannibalism with their own children.

92
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:48.010
They're cannibalizing their own children because they were starving to death,

93
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.530
thousands and thousands of people starve to death.

94
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.580
Like they don't even know an accurate number of how many people starve to death

95
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.443
under Stalin.

96
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.840
<v 2>Margo Honaker who died. I think in 2016,</v>

97
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.000
she was the head of education east Germany.

98
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.690
And she had a concentration camp there for children, which ended in 89.

99
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.140
That's not that long ago we watching shows in 89. You and I,

100
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.490
and what they would do is they would institutionalize these kids to make them

101
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:15.580
into good communists, to no singing, no humming, you know?

102
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.580
And it would be the kind of thing where like, there's a, there was this one,

103
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.870
one survivor.

104
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.680
She was suicidal because her stepdad kept raping her while you're suicidal,

105
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:27.010
you got institutionalized you. Right? So they put them sometimes in solitary.

106
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.820
And the thing is the people who were guardians in the, in this place,

107
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.690
they would sexually assault the kids with impunity and take them home.

108
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.540
What else she would do is, uh,

109
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.630
if parents were suspicious under suspicion of the state,

110
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:44.590
they take the kids and force good communist families to raise them.

111
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.460
They would take newborns and you would never see your kids again.

112
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.880
And your kids were discouraged from trying to seek you. It's,

113
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:52.570
it's the levels of,

114
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.900
of depravity that would happen in these countries.

115
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.240
We are so oblivious to in America. And it's like, all right,

116
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:02.180
if I have to be the one to kind of talk about this and to,

117
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.120
we should treasure people take so much for granted here.

118
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.280
