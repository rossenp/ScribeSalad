00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, and this,</v>

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.360
this excuse making that people do do as a straight white man,

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.640
I can't get a break in this talent. Oh my God.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.960
When you're a straight white man and you're complaining,

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.920
like you got one of the most captivating hands of.

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.000
<v 1>Cards in, in world history in the world.</v>

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.870
<v 0>In 2000, 19 straight, still a great.</v>

8
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.270
<v 1>Hand, still a great hand. You might get beat with a crazy,</v>

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.710
uh, you know, naette yeah. A naette.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.590
<v 0>Hand take you out at the hamstrings.</v>

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.790
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; man. That'll get you on the river. Yeah. But, but she, what?</v>

12
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.700
<v 0>I know she got number one, but it wasn't even funny. What the? Um,</v>

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.220
anti-cho what's.

14
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.980
<v 1>Anti- comedy. All right. Uh.</v>

15
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.260
<v 0>My take on in that thing and I haven't even seen it. It's like,</v>

16
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:49.940
do people like it? Yeah. Good.

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.380
<v 1>I saw it live. Did you like it? Yeah. I liked it a lot. Nice. It's not see it.</v>

18
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:56.660
Likestan I saw it in New York. I saw before it was on Netflix,

19
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.900
like I saw it and met her and was like, thought I was like, was she nice?

20
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.050
It was an awkward conversation. I'll say that. Well, she is a.

21
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.890
<v 0>Little spectrumy right. Isn't that's.</v>

22
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.290
<v 1>Talk about, I, I think that's a fair,</v>

23
00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:11.330
she's pretty open about it's fair estimation. Yeah. Like it was, it was,

24
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.810
it wasn't like easy.

25
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.610
<v 0>Do you find that you, when you speak to certain women in particular,</v>

26
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.450
you feel like almost like you're guilty of something like you di like you're a

27
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.320
male, like you're an oppressor. Do you ever, you ever feel like.

28
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.280
<v 1>That? Not too many women. And it could just be a projection. It could be my own.</v>

29
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:33.800
Yes. It could be. I'm like auto projecting where I'm like, I definitely do that.

30
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.680
I, there aren't too many, but I think you have to work against stereotypes.

31
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.030
Yeah. You're working against tattoos. Built bald. Yeah. Right. Wing podcaster.

32
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.620
Well.

33
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.390
<v 0>Cage fighting, commentator killer. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

34
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.790
<v 1>Everything. Oh. I forgot about that. Jesus, Joe. Yeah. I'm a monster monster.</v>

35
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.070
So like you have a lot, I'm pretty, you know, a feat.

36
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.950
<v 0>The way I look is a problem. It's like, I, and I, if.</v>

37
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.590
<v 1>You, what are the odds? You're not sexist, right? Or a.</v>

38
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.790
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Not that good. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.580
<v 1>My like what are the odds, right. Like, so, uh, you try. I mean, I don't,</v>

40
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.340
I don't feel it too much, but I can imagine how much,

41
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:15.140
what percentage of women do you feel like you have to do that.

42
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.260
<v 0>With the ones who don't know me once they know me, like, I'm pretty,</v>

43
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.890
pretty nice.

44
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.130
<v 1>Like go to a venue. You go the venue that you've never been to.</v>

45
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.450
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, there's a woman, the backstage,

46
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.530
one of the works for live nation or she works the venue. Like,

47
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.530
does she assume that you're? Nah.

48
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.090
<v 0>Not if they work for live nation. Okay. I'm nice to all those folks. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.930
But I think that if someone has, uh, like a,

50
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.930
a very staunch feminist perspective and they meet someone like me, they might,

51
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.840
depending upon their perspective, they might think that I'm the enemy.

52
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.080
That that's a, that's a possibility that like right away,

53
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:49.800
they look at me like the enemy. Yeah.

54
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.200
<v 1>Well, that's the thing of like, what are you absolute? Like yeah. Even,</v>

55
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.200
and you, you can tell sometimes when you're arguing with,

56
00:02:57.201 --> 00:02:59.960
with people that are super, uh,

57
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.920
dogmatic about whatever they believe in that they can,

58
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.880
you can watch them go into a line of logic

59
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.840
that they know that they then realize I can't, cuz that will like,

60
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.320
uh, seed some ground to this person. They go mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's like,

61
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.670
I saw you start mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to go down that like a, just a reason.

62
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.790
And I'm not saying, uh, stop, believing what you believe in. It's just like,

63
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.990
it's it doesn't have to be a hundred percent. Exactly. Just it's fine.

64
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.070
You can still you're still win the popular vote. It's just majority rules.

65
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:35.310
It doesn't have to be overwhelming. Just,

66
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.950
just don't it's dishonest in a way. Cuz the,

67
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.860
they don't want to believe they don't want to have, uh,

68
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.900
they don't wanna have a chin in their armor in terms logically.

69
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.340
<v 0>Yeah. To wanna lump people into categories. Cuz it's easy to define them too.</v>

70
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.700
You know? Uh, we were goofing yesterday.

71
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.740
Me and Joe list were goofing around about a Alyssa Milanos sex strike that she

72
00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.690
was proposing Uh-huh and I was like with one of the things that about that is

73
00:04:00.691 --> 00:04:03.250
first of all, that um, that women

74
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.650
would agree with you that they would just withhold sex from the person that they

75
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:09.770
love. Because Alyssa Milano said,

76
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:14.210
because Melissa Milano said you should withhold sex because in Georgia they're

77
00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:15.130
limiting abortion laws.

78
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.890
But the second thing is that like that you would assume that all men are respons

79
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.120
for this. Not even just the voters in Georgia, but all men,

80
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.680
somehow like a man in Minneapolis should be denied sex from his progressive

81
00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:28.220
girlfriend.

82
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.280
<v 1>Or that he's gonna call like his friend in Alabama. Like man, this,</v>

83
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:35.680
you better do something cuz I'm not getting no up here, bro. This.

84
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.360
<v 0>Sex strike is for real bro. This is hitting us.</v>

85
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.390
So it's so delusional and such a dumb flag of virtue that

86
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:48.110
they're throwing up. And it's such, it's such stupid 2019 woke politics.

87
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:49.190
That that was actually well by the well that's.

88
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.790
<v 1>The way it's like based on less tra like a, a old Greek play. Wasn't really?</v>

89
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.570
Yeah.

90
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.910
<v 0>No. There was a sex strike and.</v>

91
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.110
<v 1>An old Greek play play. Yeah. That's the yeah.</v>

92
00:04:57.111 --> 00:05:00.710
And that's what that movie Shyra was about. It was, it was a sex strike.

93
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.020
No in Chicago. Yeah. Did that work? It's uh, I don't think it's ever,

94
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.820
I don't know. Will you Google and see if it's ever been done? Um,

95
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:10.290
I would imagine.

96
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.300
<v 0>That girls just use an excuse to not a guy. They won't don't wanna. It's.</v>

97
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.980
<v 1>Also like I'm on a of, of em aren't anyway. It's yeah.</v>

98
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.980
Like what are you gonna it's like rock had that joke about like,

99
00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:23.730
what are you gonna, you can't you're already not me, dude. I.

100
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.450
<v 0>When you hear, when hear women talk about not wanting to their husbands,</v>

101
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.370
it's like, it's such a depressing, like I was listening to this gal.

102
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.450
She was like, well, you know,

103
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.210
most wives don't wanna have sex with their husband. It's like what?

104
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.770
You li you listen to that. You like, Ugh.

105
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.690
<v 1>As a husband, it bumps you out. Or as a, as a,</v>

106
00:05:41.691 --> 00:05:45.880
a human being humans are that they're in a situation. Yeah. Well the, the.

107
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.800
<v 0>Thing that people like the most about relationships, but,</v>

108
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:52.760
but besides the fact that you love someone, you care,

109
00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:56.040
someone is having sex with somebody who wants to have sex with you. Yeah.

110
00:05:56.041 --> 00:05:58.800
It's great. Fun. Yeah. It's a fun time. It's.

111
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.480
<v 1>Very rewarding. It's super feels real nice. Feels.</v>

112
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.480
<v 0>Especially take a little hit. They really feel it. Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.320
<v 1>Feel vulnerable. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It.</v>

114
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.040
<v 0>Feels great. So when you hear like, someone doesn't want that and then you know,</v>

115
00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:13.320
their attitudes that most women don't want that. Yeah.

116
00:06:13.321 --> 00:06:15.120
Most women don't have sex with their husband. They just do it.

117
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.073
Cuz they have to like.

118
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:16.940
<v 1>Well they that's also,</v>

119
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.590
it's very hard to get a clear story about women and sexuality in that.

120
00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:24.750
Like it's I don't, I think it's varies from wildly.

121
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.150
<v 0>Oh for sure. Like the hasn't it in girls you've dated.</v>

122
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.990
<v 1>Yeah. Even the other day I put a thing on, on uh, Instagram where I said, how,</v>

123
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.950
if you start following a guy, how long do you think he should wait to DMU?

124
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.740
&lt;affirmative&gt; because as a guy I'll have girls follow me. And because I'll like,

125
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:45.580
just do jokes on there. I'm like, does this girl wanna, I don't wanna be like,

126
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.140
so you came for the comedy also Dick &lt;laugh&gt;.

127
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.380
<v 0>I don't. Yeah. That's a weird thing.</v>

128
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.060
<v 1>I don't wanna, I don't wanna bumm her out if she just came.</v>

129
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:57.420
Cause she thinks I'm funny, but like, yes. But what about me?

130
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.890
Can I injur you in that? What about my penis? Yes. Um, so,

131
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.090
and of course the answers were all over the place. Yeah. I was like four days,

132
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.250
five days, 10 minutes. And then I said, but if he's cute, it doesn't matter.

133
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:11.650
And they all wrote Nope. Doesn't.

134
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.770
<v 0>Matter. &lt;laugh&gt; ah, yeah. If it's, if it's Aqua, man, just let them. Yeah. Fine.</v>

<v 0>BL cabloi and in Columbia where women held a 10 day se strike</v>

152
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:07.900
in 2006 to end gang fighting. Wow.

153
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.420
<v 1>End gang gang fight. It's a great, it is a great idea. It truly is like,</v>

154
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.700
if you wanna affect change, just get every I was saying to somebody last night,

155
00:08:17.701 --> 00:08:22.650
like we all know like every, somebody was asking me about,

156
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.930
uh, cheating on and I was like, I'm not a cheater,

157
00:08:27.931 --> 00:08:31.850
but I was like, every guy does what they do.

158
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.210
Most human achievement is because they men wanted to get like, yeah,

159
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.010
like buildings, electricity. If you think the.

160
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.840
<v 0>That SCAs a problem in unions. Just trust me.</v>

161
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.840
If you got a sex track them, hos them hos are gonna come out.

162
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:48.560
Cause it's also like.

163
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.960
<v 1>Work. What am I gonna use? &lt;laugh&gt; I have no leverage. This is my main leverage.</v>

164
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.840
Like, um, but, but yeah, like it's a,

165
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.600
it's a great bargaining tool. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean it's the,

166
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:01.400
it is the bargaining. I mean that's,

167
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.640
in some ways that's most of the negotiation of a relationship is like where

168
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:07.600
girls go, like women don't control it. It's like,

169
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.560
they may not control it explicitly. But I know if I do something,

170
00:09:12.561 --> 00:09:14.990
that's gonna get you in a bad mood. You're not gonna lock me.

171
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.070
<v 0>And legalized prostitution is one of the,</v>

172
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.470
one of the best ways to combat any kind of sex strike.

173
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:26.590
And that is one reason why women hate the idea of legalized prostitution.

174
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.870
They don't ever want that to not be negotiable.

175
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.790
They don't ever want you to be able to go, oh, oh, I'm an. Yeah.

176
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.700
I I'm going for a drive. You go right down to the store. Yeah.

177
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.940
Where you go to the sex store. Yeah. And you,

178
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.820
you pay for a 10 and she's built like Jessica,

179
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.460
a rabbit and you bang her and you have a time of your life. And then you,

180
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.060
you go home and your girlfriend's got a little bit of a gut and her saggy.

181
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.940
And you're like, I just, no, I mean, you can't tell me what to do anymore.

182
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.180
I spent 80 bucks. I just, it wasn't that much. Yeah. I,

183
00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.050
if sex was legal financially, if it was transactions sexual.

184
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.130
<v 1>No, it is legal in a lot of countries or not a lot of countries,</v>

185
00:10:03.131 --> 00:10:03.850
but a few countries.

186
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.170
<v 0>A few. Yeah. Enough. But if it was legal in this country,</v>

187
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.610
how much do you think it would shift perceptions and the way what people? I.

188
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.530
<v 1>Think it would, I don't know.</v>

189
00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:14.490
Cuz I was just in Singapore and apparently it's legal there.

190
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:19.480
By the way I went like there's a, I was in Singapore, did some shows.

191
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.200
Excellent. And uh, and there was a place

192
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.400
called uh, it's orchard road and it's a mall during the day.

193
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.360
And at night it becomes a mall for prostitutes.

194
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.510
<v 0>Fevo prostitute mall. Yes.</v>

195
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.870
<v 1>It's they have likechar road.</v>

196
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.270
And the awful saying for it is four floors of horses, which is I, I just,

197
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.350
I hate, I hate the word of war. I hate the world war. I don't know.

198
00:10:47.351 --> 00:10:49.430
It just bugs something about it's like you who,

199
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.710
it just feels like dice or something. You like pro I don't know.

200
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:57.820
<v 0>I, I like is a term of, uh, endearment hook. No,</v>

201
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.060
not like that. Like Barney mouse that kinda like shut your mouth.

202
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.860
Like she say that to your friend,

203
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.300
like a girlfriend who's just joking around about the top.

204
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:06.180
Like shut your mouth and nobodybody will laugh.

205
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:11.260
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, so, but it, I, so the,</v>

206
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.700
the, the local guys were going there and I was like, well, yeah,

207
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.210
I'm gonna go also. Cause I wanna see this place. I've read about it.

208
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.650
And there was a restaurant there that they ate in, which is a whole other issue,

209
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.650
but it's literally like a mall, like a mall. Like not like a,

210
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.850
you know, Glendale. Galleri where it's like,

211
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.410
like a LA it's just one of those like square ones where it's like four floors

212
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:35.570
there's escalator in the middle. And then there's just basically like,

213
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.160
and there's just wimp prostitutes, hookers. As you call them, uh,

214
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.400
out in the.

215
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.440
<v 0>Walkway, Jamie's got a visual for us. I was trying to find something,</v>

216
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:50.800
but I found a trip, a trip advisory review of, or don't go at night.

217
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.600
&lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Wow. Don't go here at nighttime. Unless you wanna be shocked.

218
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.000
A little, the whole place turns into a countless, into countless brothel bars.

219
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.080
I feel like I need to scrub myself after our visit. I.

220
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.520
<v 1>I don't dis like I was there about three minutes and I was like, all right,</v>

221
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.760
cuz the thing is, there's a difference between legal,

222
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.510
legalized prostitution and anyone wanting to be a prostitute and they don't

223
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:19.230
wanna be, I mean, they are right. I don't think they're being forced or coerced,

224
00:12:19.231 --> 00:12:21.630
but life is coercing them. What you doing.

225
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.070
<v 0>It? Did you, what did you think about the Robert KRA situation here?</v>

226
00:12:25.071 --> 00:12:28.750
Here's what bothered me about that two things bothered me about that one. They,

227
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.550
they accused him of being a part of sex trafficking. Right.

228
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.940
But turns how that wasn't true. There, there weren't.

229
00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:38.420
There were just regular girls who wanted jerk guys off for money right there.

230
00:12:38.421 --> 00:12:39.820
Wasn't there's no one there I wanted.

231
00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.813
<v 1>I think is a big word.</v>

232
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.820
<v 0>Were willing, did it voluntarily, whatever. Um,</v>

233
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.020
and they, they were threatening to release the film footage yeah.

234
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.780
Of him like youre. So what do you do?

235
00:12:50.781 --> 00:12:54.690
You're just trying to shame him into submission and the fact that this guy,

236
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:58.050
even though he is a billionaire, he can't stop that from happening. Like how.

237
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:58.571
<v 1>Crazy? Well,</v>

238
00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:02.050
the funny thing is the fact that he's a billionaire and still has to go to the,

239
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:07.170
the massage to the drive through it's like I, boy,

240
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.610
I wish there was a better system. There should be.

241
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.290
<v 0>A better system. Yeah. I mean, I think it's gonna be robots.</v>

242
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.320
I think sex robots are gonna blow like blur the morality line. I.

243
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.000
<v 1>Was at a, this is a similar thing about like there's no, uh,</v>

244
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.840
uh, release relief anywhere.

245
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.480
I was at a party recently and deicao was there and there were,

246
00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.440
and there were a bunch, it was just like a huge, crazy party,

247
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:34.400
like crazy Hollywood party. Like the kind I never go to. And there's just like,

248
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.190
just everyone's there. And uh,

249
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.150
deicaprio's girl wanted to leave and he goes, well, uh,

250
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.870
the girls tired. So I gotta leave the greatest party ever.

251
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.630
Like he had to leave like even to leonardard deicaprio the king of Kings.

252
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.670
The girls are tired. God.

253
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.740
<v 0>How gotta go? How long had they the party for uh.</v>

254
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.180
<v 1>I don't know, hour and a half or something, but there was like a dinner before.</v>

255
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.180
Mm. But it was, it was just a funny thing like, oh, okay. So there's no,

256
00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:07.060
it doesn't matter who I am. Yeah. You still you're at the, when they're done.

257
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:10.100
Yeah. When they're, when they're done, you're gonna go sometimes.

258
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.810
But having said that we still all do it for some, um,

259
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.370
invisible. Uh shaangrala.

260
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.450
<v 0>I bet she would've stayed at the party for Aqua man.</v>

261
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.410
<v 1>You know what I mean? &lt;laugh&gt; I bet Aqua man was there.</v>

262
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.050
<v 0>She Sheman Aquaman been like, it's fine. Let's stay. Yeah.</v>

263
00:14:28.051 --> 00:14:30.970
I might feed her a little, but I'll take off my shoes, whatever.

264
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.610
<v 1>Yeah. No, the, uh, but yeah, there's still, he's still kind, I mean,</v>

265
00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:38.880

266
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.720
like all the achievements and all that. It's still some yeah.

267

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.360

269
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.920
<v 1>Right. Even if you're not gonna take 'em up on it, right? Yes.</v>

270
00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:58.520
Like I told an anecdote on, on, uh, howne field this week, um,

271
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.640
about the best compliment I ever got.

272
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:05.120
I was doing a show in Vegas with two buddies of mine who shall remain nameless.

273
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.560
We get on the elevator at the end woman gets on and goes,

274
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.750
can I just say I'm married, but I would all you guys. &lt;laugh&gt; whoa.

275
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.550
And we, and it was great. It's like, oh, you get,

276
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:23.710
we feel accomplished. We did a great job of the show. You're attracted to us.

277
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.830
You just happened to be married and that's so nothing's ever gonna happen.

278
00:15:26.831 --> 00:15:30.310
But thank you for expressing your attraction to us.

279
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.140
D know if she was saying, even though I'm married? No, she was saying it like,

280
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:40.180
just so you know, if I weren't married. Oh, if I wasn't married, I. And not.

281
00:15:40.181 --> 00:15:43.100
And she didn't mean at the same time either. She was a little drunk. She was,

282
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.700
but even tipsy. She said some ridiculous, but that's a very nice thing to say.

283
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:50.420
Like, that's kind of what you want to from everyone, for a guy. Yeah.

284
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:54.770
Like I would you girls. Don't want to hear that. They're like, yeah. Thanks.

285
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.730
Yeah, no kidding. They don't hear that. Yeah.
