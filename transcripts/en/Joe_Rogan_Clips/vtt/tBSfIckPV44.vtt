00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It just seems.</v>

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.060
<v 1>Like in the beginning,</v>

3
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:09.050
at least they're trying to figure out what the correct treatment was for these

4
00:00:09.051 --> 00:00:13.340
people, as they were just showing up in mass in the emergency rooms.

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.210
And they didn't really know, and doctors, they varied in how the approach to it.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.720
My friend, Michael, his doctor didn't put him on a ventilator. And he said,

7
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.270
if I put him on a ventilator, he's probably going to die. Right.

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.970
Because he said his body's going to stop working.

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.480
Cause it's going to let the ventilator do the breathing forum and it's going to

10
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:34.130
give up. And when he was talking about, uh, after the fact,

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.840
what Michael was talking about was how that is proven to be correct in New York

12
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.180
and that some monstrous number,

13
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:44.150
like 80% of the people that put on ventilators went up done just.

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.080
<v 2>New York. I like I've had friends that are physicians that have like, you know,</v>

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.910
and, uh, new Orleans. I mean the same thing where it's like a, you know, I,

16
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.770
there was someone on my team. We were looking,

17
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:56.120
we were doing some research on this and I,

18
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.030
and I didn't sort of dive into the whole thing, but he was,

19
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:03.110
he was telling me that, um, ventilators do actually like,

20
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.120
cause more damage to the lungs. And like,

21
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.640
like he'd been reading some studies to like confirm that.

22
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:12.050
And he was pretty certain that that ventilators actually cause damage and

23
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:16.490
actually could like induce damage where it's like making it worse.

24
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.170
So I don't know. I don't know all the specifics so that all I know is that it,

25
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.200
it looking at the statistics, like if you go on a ventilator, I mean,

26
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:26.330
surely it seems like the outcome's not very,

27
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.120
it doesn't seem like it's going to be very good. Right, right.

28
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.850
<v 1>But it's hard to say, is that the cause of it?</v>

29
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:36.590
Or is it just that they're so up by the time they get on a ventilator,

30
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:38.300
they just wind up dying. Right?

31
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.190
<v 2>Well, here at lake, the,</v>

32
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.580
there's been some really interesting data looking at like in the there,

33
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.450
so in the Philippines, um, and Indonesia,

34
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.530
where else I think new Orleans as well. Um,

35
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.850
they've looked at patients that have died and their vitamin D levels.

36
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.060
And in Britain basically like in the Philippines, you know,

37
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:03.110
people that for like every standard deviation increase in vitamin D levels,

38
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.180
serum, vitamin D levels, you know,

39
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:08.990
the people had like an 8% or were eight fold,

40
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.100
eight times less likely to have a severe form of COVID-19. And if they had,

41
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.230
and they were 20 times less likely to have critical like critic critical, um,

42
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.350
form of COVID-19, um, in the, in the,

43
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.280
so that was the Philippines in the Indonesia was a really interesting study

44
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:28.220
where like they measured vitamin D and this was measured in the patients.

45
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.190
There's been some vitamin D studies also where they're like looking at,

46
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.890
you know, countries that have been affected the worst.

47
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.830
And they all like have low vitamin D and it's like, okay, well, anyways,

48
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:41.180
that's correlation, but, well, so is this, but, um, a little,

49
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:44.990
it's a little stronger data. The, in the, in Indonesia, um,

50
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.740
patients that died 90 about almost a hundred percent,

51
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:53.660
it was like 98 point something percent of patients that died with COVID-19 were

52
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:54.710
vitamin D deficient

53
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.700
4% of patients that died from COVID-19 we're vitamin D sufficient or say

54
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.950
4%, only 4%,

55
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.170
uh we're fi vitamin D sufficient. So basically they're all vitamin D deficient,

56
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.810
all the ones that are dying. Whoa. Crazy. Right.

57
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.980
And like new Orleans had some crazy, crazy number,

58
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.780
be the mechanism that would cause, so I think there's all right. Can we cut?

59
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.110
Can we get into vitamins, please do. It's a big, I really think.

60
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.550
<v 1>Because of you, I take a 5,000, I use a day.</v>

61
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.900
<v 2>Awesome. Um, right now I'm taking 5,000. I use a day, um, you know,</v>

62
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:32.130
70% of the U S population has insufficient vitamin D levels,

63
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.300
which is considered less than, um, blood levels, less than 30 milligrams,

64
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.890
nanograms per milliliter.

65
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.920
<v 1>Then your body can generate naturally.</v>

66
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:45.630
If you're exposed to sun on a daily basis, that's the best way to get it. But.

67
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.130
<v 2>The problem is is that we don't go outside anymore. And you.</v>

68
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.420
<v 3>Know, yeah. Especially now exactly now more than ever, but.</v>

69
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.190
<v 1>Terrible recipe, right?</v>

70
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.450
If vitamin D deficiency is what makes it worse and then you're staying inside.

71
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:01.740
So you're not getting any vitamin D.

72
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.160
<v 2>You're becoming even more deficient, you know, like third,</v>

73
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.450
like somewhere like 28% of the U S population is actually deficient like less

74
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:12.750
than 20 nanograms per mil, you know, that's defined deficiency.

75
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.620
So there's a lot of people in the United States. Um, as you mentioned,

76
00:04:16.621 --> 00:04:19.620
you make it from the sun. So particularly UVB radiation.

77
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:23.190
There's a reason why I want to talk about this. Uh, you make it from UVB,

78
00:04:23.191 --> 00:04:27.540
radiation exposure, you know, basically it's made in the skin. And, um,

79
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.370
but you know, there's certain times of the year,

80
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:33.090
depending on when you live in a more Northern latitude where that UVB isn't even

81
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:35.880
hitting the atmosphere. So you're not making vitamin D also,

82
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:40.230
if you have darker skin, melanin protects you like the whole, you know,

83
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.970
people with darker skin, people from maybe Africa or India or south Asia,

84
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.560
they're more equatorial regions. They're closer, you know, closer to, to,

85
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.430
to the equator. And there's more UVB radiation throughout the year.

86
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.510
And so as a protective mechanism to not get burned,

87
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.750
you have melanin, which protects you. Right? The problem is,

88
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:05.220
is that melanin also blocks your, your ability to produce vitamin D.

89
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.980
But if you're out in the sun all the time, you know,

90
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:11.070
in a place where you're getting UVB radiation, it's not a problem.

91
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.371
<v 1>Well,</v>

92
00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:15.990
this is the very reason why people in places like Scotland and England have such

93
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:18.450
pale skin exactly cloudy all the time.

94
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:22.860
So your body sort of develops its own ability to absorb more vitamins. Exactly.

95
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.250
So what.

96
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.270
<v 2>Happens when you take something?</v>

97
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.220
What happens when you take a person from south Asia, from India,

98
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.020
from Africa and you put them in Sweden or in Minnesota or in the UK

99
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.180
and a place where UVB radiation doesn't hit most of the year

100
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.740
and you don't give them a supplement.

101
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.320
What happens is they become severely vitamin D deficient.

102
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.720
<v 3>Severely. And what happens when.</v>

103
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.120
<v 2>You take it? I mean, I mean, you can throw this on the, you can flip,</v>

104
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.360
flip this over and say, okay, what happens when you take the guy from the UK,

105
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:52.950
the Brit and put them in Australia?

106
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.730
Like without any sunscreen or without a hat or number they're gonna yeah.

107
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.564
So mean.

108
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.530
<v 1>Do you think that this could be a factor in why so many African-Americans are</v>

109
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.460
getting hit so hard?

110
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.590
<v 2>So here's the thing. So African-Americans are, there's lots of, alright.</v>

111
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.240
African-Americans are, are, are in, in, in the United States,

112
00:06:10.241 --> 00:06:13.390
there's been studies, um, African-Americans are severely deficient.

113
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:17.620
They're 28 times more deficient in vitamin D than, than Caucasians.

114
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.450
Wow. Yeah. And it's, it's,

115
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.930
it's because it's because they have darker skin and you know,

116
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.040
if you're not getting enough sun,

117
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.680
they're not getting enough sun because people stay inside,

118
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:29.320
more people stay inside. You know, it's not,

119
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.580
it's not like the old days when we were out hunter gatherer and out in the sun,

120
00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:36.130
all the temporary and our like we're inside all the time. We're in school,

121
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.270
we're, we're, we're at work and our office in our cubicle. Um, so the CDC,

122
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:40.451
you know,

123
00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:43.300
obviously there's been studies showing that African-Americans are more hit,

124
00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:46.270
but they didn't really correct for tons of like other factors.

125
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.050
Cause socioeconomic status is important. Uh, hell. Other health factors,

126
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:54.520
you know? And, um, but there was a big study just released not long ago from,

127
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.680
from like the national office of statistics in Britain or something like that.

128
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:03.490
I don't know what their official name was, but they released, um,

129
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.860
some statistics from England and Wales and the, um,

130
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.970
I don't know what the correct name to say. I mean, the,

131
00:07:11.971 --> 00:07:16.930
the blacks they're basically living in England and in Wales are four times

132
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:20.980
more likely to die of COVID-19 than, than whites. When they,

133
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.650
when they adjusted all that data for socioeconomic status.

134
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.830
And for other health factors, there were two times more likely to die.

135
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.010
So clearly socioeconomic status and other health factors are playing a role,

136
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:32.140
but through something else unidentified.

137
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.150
And I think it's vitamin D I think that, you know, so, you know,

138
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.260
the vitamin D like it hasn't looked vitamin D I'm not saying that vitamin D is

139
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.680
going to prevent you from getting COVID-19 or it's a treatment.

140
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.000
Although I am involved in a clinical study where we're going to be testing as a

141
00:07:48.001 --> 00:07:50.800
very small open-armed study, we can talk about, but you know,

142
00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:54.700
I'm not a physician, I'm a medical doctor. I've never intubated anyone. Uh,

143
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.640
so don't think I'm saying that I don't want people to think I'm saying it's a

144
00:07:57.641 --> 00:08:00.670
treatment. I just want to, it's a hypothesis that needs to be tested.

145
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:03.310
And thankfully there are clinical trials,

146
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:05.950
randomized control trials that are now ongoing,

147
00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:07.270
and there are some that are recruiting.

148
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.800
<v 1>It's just the statistics that you've already listed about vitamin D and the</v>

149
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:14.350
people that had COVID-19, those are insane.

150
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.420
<v 2>It's insane. And also in Sweden,</v>

151
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.320
there's a huge population of Somalis that have migrated to Sweden.

152
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:25.480
And they have been identified as being severely vitamin D deficient

153
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:29.320
because a lot of the Somalis have all there also like autism rates were really

154
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:30.100
high there.

155
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.280
And there's this link between I published a link also between vitamin D and

156
00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:36.970
autism. But so there's been studies looking at vitamin D levels in the Somali

157
00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:40.360
population. I mean, they are so deficient because you're taking again,

158
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:43.480
you're taking someone who's supposed to be who's, you know,

159
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.310
evolved to be getting a lot of sun, um, but not burn from it.

160
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.120
And then,

161
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.480
and then putting them in a place where they can't get any vitamin D from the

162
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:57.390
sun. And if they don't get a supplement, like they're going to be deficient,

163
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.350
you know, and they're so much more likely they're, they're like, it's,

164
00:09:00.351 --> 00:09:04.860
it's wreaking havoc in Sweden on the Somali population is so logical. Yeah.

165
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.500
It's it's it's and then, okay, so elderly,

166
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.550
elderly are like insanely more deficient. I forgot the exact number obese.

167
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.050
Also the obese people are like three times more likely to be vitamin D deficient

168
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:19.590
in the United States, because vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin,

169
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.580
and it's less, it's been shown to be 50% less bioavailable.

170
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.680
So you have to re after you make it in your skin,

171
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.550
it's stored in fat and you know, it's released. And when, you know,

172
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:32.730
basically into the bloodstream, and then it gets converted into a hormone,

173
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.640
this hormone regulates 5%,

174
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:39.480
more than 5% of the human protein and Cody human genome.

175
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.180
It's a lot of G that's a whole, it's a hormone. Like,

176
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.090
can you imagine just walking around without testosterone? You're a man,

177
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.190
that's a hormone. I mean, like,

178
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.670
cause there's a lot of people that are deficient in vitamin D and it's a steroid

179
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:54.000
hormone. It gets converted into a hormone like this. Isn't just a vitamin,

180
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.200
you know, it's important. It's really important. Um,

181
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.950
so I went off on a tangent, but anyways, uh.

182
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.600
<v 1>Can I ask you this boy, we're off on this tangent? What is,</v>

183
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.190
when you see what is happening to people when they are vitamin D like what's

184
00:10:10.191 --> 00:10:12.290
happening in the vitamin D deficient,

185
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.160
what is happening in the body that's causing their immune system, this,

186
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:17.390
this hormone deficiency,

187
00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:20.600
not having this vitamin D whether it's through sun exposure.

188
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.860
So there's lots of things.

189
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.670
<v 2>I mean, it plays a key there's vitamin D receptors on like your immune cells.</v>

190
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:26.271
And,

191
00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:29.780
and the reason for that is because when the hormone vitamin D hormone binds to

192
00:10:29.781 --> 00:10:30.614
the receptor,

193
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.200
it activates all these genes and that the genes do stuff that are regulating

194
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:39.170
immune function. You know, there's, there's studies that have shown people.

195
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.910
And I love these studies because,

196
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.440
because they basically take away people's complaints about, you know,

197
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:49.310
there's lots of epidemiological studies showing that low vitamin D is associated

198
00:10:49.311 --> 00:10:52.250
with disease X, Y, or Z. And everyone's like, well, you know,

199
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:55.040
they're out in this, they're not in the sun as much. So they're not as healthy.

200
00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:56.840
They're not as physically active and not whatever,

201
00:10:56.841 --> 00:11:01.820
even though those confounding factors are usually correct it for it's old

202
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:03.800
at the end of the day, it's a, it's an association, right?

203
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:06.440
And everyone's like correlations, not causation, which is true.

204
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.790
But sometimes you gotta like, look at the full body of data, you know, um,

205
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.040
there are genetic polymorphisms. So,

206
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.730
so there are people that have variations in genes that caused them to

207
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:20.060
genetically have lower vitamin D. And so this,

208
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:21.980
this is called [inaudible] randomization.

209
00:11:21.981 --> 00:11:26.900
When you can take a person that's that has a genetically they're genetically low

210
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:29.840
vitamin D. So you're not categorizing them based on their vitamin D levels.

211
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.000
You're categorizing them based on their gene.

212
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.740
And those people are more likely to die from respiratory infections just based

213
00:11:36.741 --> 00:11:39.440
on that gene alone. So yeah,

214
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.140
that gene that it's known to lower it lowers by them.

215
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.510
It leads to lower vitamin D levels. And so like,

216
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:47.660
those people are more likely to die from respiratory infections than people that

217
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:48.260
don't have that,

218
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.070
which is a great way of kind of randomizing people by their genes,

219
00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:55.690
as opposed to doing a randomized control trial. Those have been done as well.

220
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.960
There was a study that was over 25 randomized controlled trials.

221
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.290
People that were given a vitamin D supplement varying doses,

222
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:06.010
either weekly or daily, monthly didn't work. Um,

223
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.780
they're the people with low baseline vitamin D levels.

224
00:12:09.781 --> 00:12:11.170
So people that were like deficient,

225
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.980
they were 50% less likely to have a respiratory tract infection.

226
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:18.430
If they were taking the vitamin D supplement over 50% actually.

227
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.210
And people that had already normal levels still had a protective effect,

228
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:23.680
there was 10% less likely.

229
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.730
So even people that were already considered normal taking a buy vitamin D

230
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:29.980
supplement helped prevent the respiratory tract.

231
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:34.960
<v 0>Infection. You take too much vitamin D yes, you can. You can too much. So,</v>

232
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:35.230
right.

233
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.340
<v 2>So the, the upper, the tolerable upper intake has been set by, um,</v>

234
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.060
the nutrition board and the Institute of medicine to be 4,000, I use a day. Um,

235
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.950
but there's been studies that have shown that, um, you can, I mean,

236
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.810
people that have taken, you know, 10,000 I use a day for, for multiple years,

237
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:57.160
haven't had any hypercalcemia or had, you know, um, problems,

238
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.440
but too much vitamin D can be toxic. It's not good to take that. Um,

239
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:07.510
it's best to like get a vitamin D blood test. And I think that personally, um,

240
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.910
there has been a trend.

241
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:14.110
So people that have blood levels higher than 60 may have just a little bit

242
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:16.240
higher calcium level,

243
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.140
but not much not like it's not like anything to be hugely concerned about,

244
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.890
but there are studies also showing that either vitamin K one.

245
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:28.870
So there's been a meta analysis looking at, uh, 12 different studies, I think,

246
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:31.690
where vitamin K one or vitamin K two were given,

247
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:36.070
and both of those improved bone mineral density and prevented any

248
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:40.120
hypercalcemia. Cause when you take vitamin D you absorb calcium better,

249
00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:44.950
like something crazy, like 40% more dietary calcium is being absorbed. Wow. So,

250
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.060
so the problem is,

251
00:13:46.061 --> 00:13:50.940
is that calcium can easily form a precipitate in, in,

252
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.660
in general.

253
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.050
And particularly when phosphorus is around and phosphorus is another thing

254
00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.930
vitamin D does increase the absorption of. Um, but again, like I said,

255
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.200
you know, it's like,

256
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.430
it's really hard to find any studies where vitamin D is causing, you know,

257
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.930
hypercalcemia, unless it's like really, really high dose for, for awhile. Um,

258
00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:15.580
I personally think taking the vitamin K and what's interesting about the vitamin

259
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:17.800
K one versus vitamin K2 with,

260
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.310
without going into too much of a tangent is basically, um, the,

261
00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.600
the vitamin K one.

262
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.230
Normally it goes to your liver and it's involved in blood coagulation,

263
00:14:26.231 --> 00:14:28.180
but when there's enough vitamin K one around,

264
00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:32.140
it stays in the periphery and it moves calcium periphery being bloodstream.

265
00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:34.600
It moves calcium out of the bloodstream and takes it to places where it's

266
00:14:34.601 --> 00:14:37.300
supposed to go like the bones and the muscle. Um,

267
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.700
vitamin K2 usually stays around the periphery.

268
00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.410
It doesn't really go to the liver. So it usually,

269
00:14:41.411 --> 00:14:45.610
that's usually what it's just doing is moving calcium out and bringing it to the

270
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:49.270
bones. And so I take a, I actually have K one in my multi that I take,

271
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:52.880
but I also take a K2 supplement, MK four, I take it like a couple times a week.

272
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.520
<v 1>And what dose you're taking for K one, well.</v>

273
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.120
<v 2>The K ones in my multi. So I don't vitamin K one is, um,</v>

274
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.720
really it's found in dark leafy greens. So I get a lot of those as well.

275
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.690
I get a lot. So I'm getting a lot of Q1. Um,

276
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.120
vitamin K2 is not as, it's not as readily found in like the Western. I mean,

277
00:15:11.121 --> 00:15:15.320
it's like the food that's highest in it is that fermented swiping natto,

278
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.630
but it's like small quantities. And like.

279
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.400
<v 1>You don't forget concerned from the high volume of leafy greens.</v>

280
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.560
Do you ever get conservative oxalates or getting kidney stones or anything along

281
00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:26.950
those lines? No, I.

282
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.400
<v 2>D I like the few studies that I've seen and send people that are like doing</v>

283
00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:34.780
insane juicing and they're already like messed up, you know?

284
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.300
So I'm not concerned at all. Like, even like the oxalates oxalates, actually,

285
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.810
I don't want to go into this, but so yeah, no, I don't concern kids, kids here.

286
00:15:43.811 --> 00:15:48.010
I want the vitamin D thing is so important to me. Like the, the, um,

287
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.110
the reason there's a big reason. I think that vitamin D is so important. Um,

288
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.690
it's for the lung function and the respiratory function,

289
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.940
but what's really interesting is that, you know, the,

290
00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:03.670
the very receptor that this SARS cov two virus binds to,

291
00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:07.090
to gain entry into the cell, it's called ACE two. Um,

292
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:12.580
that very receptor plays a really important role in preventing

293
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.840
lung damage and, and basically in preventing acute lung injury,

294
00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:19.360
preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS,

295
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.720
and what's been shown with SARS cov.

296
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.590
One is that cause Sarco one also binds to that receptor ACE two, it's called,

297
00:16:26.591 --> 00:16:30.340
and that's how it gets into the cell. Just like the SARS cov two, when,

298
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.670
when it binds the receptor, it like it attaches in like,

299
00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:36.190
through this like weird endo cytosis mechanism,

300
00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:39.370
it takes the receptor in and decreases the receptor.

301
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.770
What's called down-regulates downregulates receptors.

302
00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:43.510
You end up having less H two,

303
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.280
which causes like D can cause to be your lung injury, not having the AEs to,

304
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:51.250
it plays a big role in protecting, that's been shown in multiple studies. Like,

305
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:55.150
so the SARS cov one virus does that it's thought the SARS cov two also does it,

306
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.510
cause it goes through the same enters through the same receptor. Um,

307
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.490
and it's been shown that like, if you, for example, if you give mice, um,

308
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.660
lipopolysaccharide or something that's going to cause lung injury,

309
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.490
and then you give them vitamin D.

310
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.390
So the lung injury itself also causes the ACE two receptor to decrease.

311
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:17.470
And so it's like this vicious cycle of like making the damage worse.

312
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:20.290
But if you give my Spider-Man D before that happens,

313
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:24.730
the ACE two receptor increases and it protects them from the lung injury.

314
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.600
But you give the vitamin D to control mice that don't have the lung injury.

315
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.880
It doesn't do anything to the ACE two receptor levels.

316
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.510
So it's not like full stop. It's not like, you know, drugs,

317
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.250
the way drugs are designed is they, like,

318
00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:39.220
they target a certain molecule and they boom,

319
00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:42.310
they like do their thing and they either increase it or decrease it a lot of

320
00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:46.970
times with like hormones, you know, vitamins, things like that. They're they,

321
00:17:46.971 --> 00:17:50.550
they maintain homeostasis. You know what I mean? Like, so when,

322
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:55.080
when goes wrong, they fix it. They're not just like boom, full,

323
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.650
gonna like increase something when everything's normal. So,

324
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:02.850
and that's important because there've been some concern about taking vitamin D

325
00:18:02.851 --> 00:18:04.230
increasing the ACE two receptor.

326
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:07.440
And there's another study that was with hypertensive rats,

327
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.730
where the hypertension caused ACE two to go down and that like makes lung,

328
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:12.840
it makes all sorts of problems.

329
00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:16.680
It also causes like kidney problems and all sorts of things. Right. Um, but,

330
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:20.820
but the vitamin D increase the ACE two, but only in the hypertensive, rats,

331
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.210
not in the normal control rats again. So, you know,

332
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.660
and then there was another study that was like some other messed up diabetic

333
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.530
animal model where the vitamin D actually, um,

334
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.270
didn't increase the ACE two receptor,

335
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:35.370
but it increased what's called soluble ACE two,

336
00:18:35.371 --> 00:18:37.710
which is in like it's in the periphery.

337
00:18:37.711 --> 00:18:40.770
And that actually potentially could bind SARS,

338
00:18:40.771 --> 00:18:43.680
cov two virus and prevent it from it's like sequestering it and preventing it

339
00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:44.550
from entering the cell.

340
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.860
That's actually being explored as a potential therapeutic.

341
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:50.100
So the bottom line here is that

342
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.000
sometimes you'll hear this ACE two receptor and that's how the virus gets in.

343
00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:56.820
And it's like, oh, I don't want that. I want,

344
00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.220
I want less than that because that's how the virus gets in. But like,

345
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:04.740
like biology is always way more complicated than just a simple taking it

346
00:19:04.741 --> 00:19:09.360
out of a big picture. Right. You know? So like the ACE two receptor,

347
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.820
the ACE two is part of the renin angiotensin system.

348
00:19:11.821 --> 00:19:15.090
It plays a huge role in inflammation. It's also like when you,

349
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.103
when you decrease,

350
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.620
[inaudible] all of these signal signaling cascades happen in it. It's like,

351
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.640
[inaudible] important for producing pro-inflammatory cytokines at the end of the

352
00:19:23.641 --> 00:19:26.310
day, without getting into all the stuff, you know, specifics.

353
00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.860
So it causes massive inflammation to have a decrease. It, it,

354
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.680
it basically causes acute lung injury. It exacerbates it. I mean, it's crazy.

355
00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.160
So, um, I really, I just,

356
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.280
I really can you imagine if vitamin D really did help?

357
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.360
Like if there was something that could be given along with the other stuff from

358
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.180
Desi or whatever, whatever it's going to be, the stuff that we identify,

359
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:52.350
but like vitamin D so, so cheap, it's so easy.

360
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:56.640
And so many people are deficient and insufficient, you know, like,

361
00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.190
so yes, as you mentioned, there is, you know,

362
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:02.490
you don't want to take too much vitamin D you don't want to like, you know,

363
00:20:02.491 --> 00:20:07.200
overdose on it. But I think in the short term, uh, you know,

364
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.380
particularly like in the short term, and particularly in patients,

365
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.730
people that have already been infected, you know, it may be wise to, to,

366
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:19.140
to try giving your patient, like, if you're a physician, um, you know,

367
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:20.000
dealing with this may,

368
00:20:20.001 --> 00:20:23.880
may be wise to try and see their vitamin D levels and perhaps give them some,

369
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.150
you know, explored.

370
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.540
<v 1>Pub. I mean, is this something that people are talking about publicly? Cause I,</v>

371
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:34.070
all I'm hearing is drugs and possible drug remedies,

372
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.590
potential vaccine that they're working on in the future.

373
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.890
I'm not hearing anything about methods,

374
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.520
nutrition that boosts your immune system.

375
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:45.440
This is one of the reasons why I really wanted to talk to you right now. Yeah.

376
00:20:45.441 --> 00:20:47.980
Let's definitely talk more there. Yes.

377
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.740
<v 2>It is. So there are clinical studies, unfortunately,</v>

378
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:54.480
not a ton of them in the United States that are looking at randomized controlled

379
00:20:54.481 --> 00:20:58.810
trials, looking at vitamin D the effects of vitamin D on already, you know,

380
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.100
patients with COVID-19,

381
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:04.870
which what would be great is like giving them to like first responders or

382
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.260
healthcare workers and seeing like, how does it, how does it, what does,

383
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.680
what role does it play in prevention? Cause that's really the easiest thing,

384
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:15.220
right? Um, I'm involved with a friend of mine, Dr. Eric Gordon.

385
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:19.360
He he's put together. So I kind of, with his help,

386
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.210
I've helped him design a, uh, an open arm trial,

387
00:21:22.211 --> 00:21:24.850
very small 40 patients where we're, um,

388
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:28.990
where he is going to be giving them 50,000.

389
00:21:28.991 --> 00:21:33.310
I use every five days of vitamin D. So it's like a weekly dose. Um,

390
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.190
because a lot of times these people are severely deficient.

391
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.970
So you want to give them a higher dose, you know, and, and for, you know, doing,

392
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.470
doing 50,000, I use weekly,

393
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:45.250
isn't something that's necessarily going to be toxic or anything like that. Um,

394
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.790
and then we're gonna, you know, we're doing some other things, vitamin C um,

395
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.570
three grams, three times a day. And then, um, bitumen B one,

396
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.080
we can talk about that timing as well. But so yeah, there are,

397
00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.760
I think there's like open label trial,

398
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:00.410
open label trials are just kind of a start it's like, if you,

399
00:22:00.411 --> 00:22:03.760
if you see something, plus we're doing like kitchen sink, right. We've got this,

400
00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:07.270
this and this and this. So I think vitamin D really is the, is the star,

401
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:09.880
you know, I think that potentially, you know,

402
00:22:09.881 --> 00:22:14.320
I think it really should be explored. Um, I think it has huge potential.

403
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:17.830
It has to be shown like this. Isn't something that people can just, you know,

404
00:22:17.831 --> 00:22:20.380
take it home and think I'm protected. Like that is not the case.

405
00:22:20.381 --> 00:22:22.840
We don't know that it has, there's no data showing that,

406
00:22:22.841 --> 00:22:26.500
but I think it has huge potential. Um, you know, so.

407
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:31.590
<v 1>One do a randomized control study on vitamin D and people that</v>

408
00:22:31.591 --> 00:22:35.100
have COVID-19 like, it seems like, well, they're going to do it.

409
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:37.890
<v 2>In addition to, they're going to, in addition to standard of care.</v>

410
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.970
So it's basically whatever the standard of care is. And that's,

411
00:22:40.971 --> 00:22:44.100
that's what you know, is happening at the a hundred and hospital in India.

412
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:45.000
But as.

413
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:45.451
<v 1>You said,</v>

414
00:22:45.451 --> 00:22:48.450
it seems like what's really critical is getting it to people before they get it.

415
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:49.590
Yeah.

416
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:54.330
<v 2>I would love to see that study done if anyone can do that study.</v>

417
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.660
Amazing. That would be, cause that would be like.

418
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.030
<v 1>Yeah, get it to nurses, get it to first responders. Yeah. Or even.</v>

419
00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.240
<v 2>Just get the information out there and have nursery nurses,</v>

420
00:23:06.241 --> 00:23:10.080
and first responders take it. I mean, you know, vitamin D is something, again,

421
00:23:10.081 --> 00:23:13.890
like 70% of the us population has insufficient levels. You know,

422
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.610
it's a crazy number. It is. And it's generally safe to take like,

423
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.680
like 4,000 I use a day. It is, I am, but for thousands, the, the T the,

424
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:26.550
the, what the, they indicated as the tolerable upper intake.

425
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.720
So why do you take five?

426
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:31.410
I'm just taking 5,000 right now because that's like the, I could buy the five.

427
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.160
I was like, I didn't want to take two pills of the 2000. Right. Well, that's me.

428
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.720
<v 1>Too. I've got one pill. It's 5,000. And I'm like, well, so I had my, my levels.</v>

429
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.490
<v 2>Measured, literally. Like I went to LA to quest quest labs,</v>

430
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:50.210
like a month before all this lockdown happened. So I got my data back pretty,

431
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.870
pretty recent. And I still have around 50 nanograms per mil,

432
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.380
even though before I was taking 4,000, it didn't generally speaking.

433
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.270
1000 I use will raise your blood levels by about five nanograms per mil.

434
00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:06.110
And there are people with different variations in genes that are related to

435
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.560
vitamin D metabolism, where they have lower levels and they need a higher dose.

436
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.480
The only way you're going to know that is by of course,

437
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:13.790
measuring your vitamin D levels multiple times,

438
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.450
and then potentially even doing like a, a genetic analysis, you know, as well,

439
00:24:17.451 --> 00:24:21.230
but you'd have to measure your levels. Like, that's the only way to know. Um,

440
00:24:21.231 --> 00:24:22.220
of course, right now it's like,

441
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.090
you can't go to a lab it's like hard to do any of that. I mean,

442
00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.940
th the things that are like normal.

443
00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:30.620
<v 1>Yeah. But right now when you need it.</v>

444
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:35.570
<v 2>But the vitamin D I mean, I'm just so, like, I just, I have so much,</v>

445
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.730
I have high hopes for it, you know, and maybe,

446
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.940
maybe I'm a bit of an enthusiastic with it. You know, I do like,

447
00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:44.510
I've studied vitamin D so much. I've got two publications on. I certainly like,

448
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.620
you know, you said, so, you know, take that with a grain of salt as well.

449
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:51.050
But I just think the data is strong. I really think the data is,

450
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.940
I think it's mounting data.

451
00:24:52.941 --> 00:24:57.050
And I think that eventually something will come out and it's going to just like

452
00:24:57.051 --> 00:25:00.500
the randomized controlled trials showing that it protects against respiratory

453
00:25:00.501 --> 00:25:03.080
tract infections, push everyone wants randomized controlled trials.

454
00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:06.080
Like no one wants to believe anything until it's a randomized control trial.

455
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.020
Yeah. I'm just, I'm amazed.

456
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.290
<v 1>That the numbers of people that are deficient it's so stunning.</v>

457
00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:13.930
And when we pointed out the number of people that are deficient,

458
00:25:13.931 --> 00:25:18.670
that actually wind up having severe COVID-19 problem. Right. Yeah. I.

459
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.950
<v 2>Know it's stunning. Like some of those numbers, like.</v>

460
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.230
<v 1>The missing link, it's like, it's right there. I.</v>

461
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.690
<v 2>Think that's a really good hypothesis. I do.</v>

462
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.550
I think it's a really good hypothesis. I want to believe it because it's easy,

463
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:34.930
it's safe. And I think people need vitamin D anyways. I mean, yeah. You know,

464
00:25:34.931 --> 00:25:39.820
so, so of course I want to believe it, you know? Um, but like, oh,

465
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.430
there was this interesting study where African-Americans,

466
00:25:42.431 --> 00:25:44.140
who are very deficient in vitamin D.

467
00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:47.500
They were given a vitamin D supplement for like a month.

468
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:52.390
And it decreased their epigenetic age by like two years.

469
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:57.100
I mean, yeah. So that's a marker a month. Something like a month, I think. Yeah.

470
00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:58.030
In a month.

471
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.790
<v 1>They decrease their epigenetic age by two. Yeah. Okay. Don't hold.</v>

472
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.700
<v 2>Me to the month. Maybe give me some month or two months. But I think.</v>

473
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.820
<v 3>It was even if it's three months, that's crazy.</v>

474
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.360
<v 2>The studies are about a month. Yeah. So it, yeah, by 1.8 years. So.</v>

475
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.830
<v 1>What's in indicative of their suffering from this vitamin D deficiency,</v>

476
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.220
this alleviates that suffering. And then it puts the body in homeostasis.

477
00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.230
<v 3>Hormone. Yeah. Hormone. It's.</v>

478
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:24.930
<v 2>Changing 5% of the human genome. That's a lot. It's a lot.</v>

479
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:27.790
It's a lot. Yeah. That's a crazy number. When you think.

480
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:32.520
<v 3>About it, it is one vitamin D it's not just a vitamin, right? Yeah. Hormone,</v>

481
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.140
super vitamin. Can you imagine it's like, it happens when you.

482
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:38.290
<v 2>Go into menopause. Well, you're not making your estrogen. I mean,</v>

483
00:26:38.291 --> 00:26:41.740
stuff goes wrong. I mean, it's a hormone like estrogen, estrogen is a hormone,

484
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:46.150
you know, testosterone is a hormone, it's a hormone, you know, it's, it's,

485
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.150
it's important. So.

486
00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.671
<v 1>So that's the,</v>

487
00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:54.050
if you have the Dr. Rhonda Patrick pyramid of

488
00:26:54.051 --> 00:26:58.820
supplementation for preventative symptoms of COVID-19 or

489
00:26:58.821 --> 00:27:02.690
preventative measures dealing with COVID-19,

490
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.880
that's your base that's number one.

491
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.270
<v 2>I take vitamin D I certainly don't know if it's going to prevent COVID-19.</v>

492
00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:11.930
<v 3>But I'm hoping it does. Yeah. I take it hoping it, but.</v>

493
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.990
<v 1>I'm not even saying preventative. I mean, like keeping your body healthy.</v>

494
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.680
<v 3>Totally. I mean, my mom, I've got my mom and my dad, I got.</v>

495
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.110
<v 2>My whole family everyone's on the routine, you know,</v>

496
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.850
vitamin D is like the most important,

497
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:26.540
so that's the foundation's vitamin D right now. Yeah. I mean, it's, it,

498
00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:28.580
I'm always trying to get them to have that, but like,

499
00:27:28.581 --> 00:27:30.710
it's easier to convince when people are scared.

500
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.020
People are more likely to make change when, like, you can't like, if something,

501
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.020
they have to be motivated to make the change themselves or just otherwise it

502
00:27:39.021 --> 00:27:42.860
doesn't work. You know? So I think that in this case, um,

503
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.390
people are motivated,

504
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.320
especially people in my parents' generation that are older because they're,

505
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:49.154
they're more scared.

506
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.020
They're more scared that they could be effected by a severe case of

507
00:27:54.021 --> 00:27:58.100
this. Right. So, so I think that's, that's certainly, you know, the issue.
