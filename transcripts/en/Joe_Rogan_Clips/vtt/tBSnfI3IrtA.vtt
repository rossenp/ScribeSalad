00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.160
I like that you think about how long you have left on the planet?

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.500
<v 1>I think you should. Yeah. Yeah. I wake up, I try to think about that every day.</v>

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.050
<v 0>You know,</v>

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.030
all like politicians I'll enter office and I'll make a clock set for like four

6
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:17.060
years or whatever, and it counts down. I need to get one of those,

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.290
like for life, for like roughly my life expectancy and it counts down backwards.

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.430
Well, I think that.

9
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.140
<v 1>Your life expectancy, I mean,</v>

10
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.650
you are one of the few people that I know that has almost been killed by a

11
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:28.484
grizzly bear.

12
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.590
<v 0>Well, yeah. Well, um, do you have a real, like in a brush?</v>

13
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.390
Yeah. Uh, something enough where it was scary enough that I, now,

14
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.200
now that I've studied it a fair bit, that I now know I had, um,

15
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.080
I had a mental, I had, uh,

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.620
I had a, I had like a,

17
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.580
like a near death experience, mental, a near death experience,

18
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:58.550
mental experience, even though I was unharmed, but,

19
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.230
but it jarred my brain so hard. It jarred my, the, the, the, the, the, the,

20
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.110
the minute or the seconds that occurred,

21
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.720
jarred my brain so hard that as I started,

22
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.350
as I've tried to be curious about and study about what happened in my brain, um,

23
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.820
it's parallels are all found in w and it's discussed by people who discuss near

24
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:19.220
death experiences, which might just mean I'm not like I'm mentally,

25
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:22.730
not that I'm not as tenacious mentally as I'd like to be, but I,

26
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.350
my brain got joggled, but don't you think that joggled the word?

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.160
<v 1>No. Don't you think that when you're in contact with an animal,</v>

28
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.990
that's that large, I mean, a predatory animal. That's how big was it? 10 feet.

29
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.183
Okay.

30
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.930
<v 0>Easily. Yeah. I don't want to, I mean, like, it was like struck all of us,</v>

31
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.140
and we've looked at a lot of bears as being like, you know, a mature brown bear.

32
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.450
Okay. So mature Kodiak brown bear. Yeah.

33
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.740
<v 1>That's what we wanted to talk about.</v>

34
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.410
Talk about where you were at a fog knack island,

35
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.890
which is a place that has enormous bears.

36
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.670
That whole part of the world is known for some of the largest brown bears on

37
00:01:58.671 --> 00:01:58.910
earth.

38
00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.661
<v 0>Yeah. It's this, I mean, it's,</v>

39
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:02.120
it's separated from Kodiak by a narrow straight it's like,

40
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.200
so like the Kodiak brown bear being like the world's biggest barrels is a

41
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:09.860
neighboring island, but that specific specimen, you know,

42
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.730
I don't know a mature animal, but just huge. Just huge. Yeah.

43
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.130
<v 1>When you're around something like that,</v>

44
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.820
where there can be no doubt that you can't get out of the way you can't,

45
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.460
you can't fight it off. You can't, you're, you're helpless.

46
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.510
Like it must trigger something in your,

47
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.490
your mind where you, you,

48
00:02:28.491 --> 00:02:32.870
you come to grips with the reality of predator and prey that you almost were on

49
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:34.040
the menu. Like,

50
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.210
there's just no way around that you can't there's no,

51
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.790
there's no rationalizations.

52
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.940
You could play in your mind when you're confronted with such absolute

53
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:44.870
superiority.

54
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.370
<v 0>With the term playing possum. Yeah. Obviously. So,</v>

55
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.120
uh, our understanding of opossums now is that they're not playing.

56
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.470
<v 1>They conk out, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

57
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.600
<v 0>Stress he's not playing dead. He hits such an a, like,</v>

58
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.340
he hits such a stress level that he shuts off. Um,

59
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.520
I'm like embarrassed to admit,

60
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.260
but I think it's instructive to point out that, uh,

61
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.460
I was playing possum in that moment and I don't mean playing.

62
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.960
Yeah. It like it, possum, to me out.

63
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.470
Let's tell everybody who doesn't know the story. Yeah. So real quick, um.

64
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.750
<v 1>Fog neck island, we've been.</v>

65
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.300
<v 0>Yapping a long time, but we had, uh,</v>

66
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.920
we were hunting it at hung a elk up in a tree and left it for a day and a half,

67
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.420
all the meat hanging in a tree. Um, and we're camped few miles away from there.

68
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:45.160
And went back to retrieve,

69
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.410
went back with some few guys to retrieve the meat out of the tree and, uh, uh,

70
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.310
Baird found it. Um, and

71
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.291
we were very,

72
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.670
very aware that this might occur and went up and investigated the area around

73
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.890
the tree and determined that the bear hadn't found it yet. In fact,

74
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:07.120
that the carcass of the animals land not far away, it was untouched. Um,

75
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.320
in hindsight, there was a pile of bear that had been smeared on the,

76
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.230
on the ground. And I remember looking at that pile of bear.

77
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.920
And I'm wondering if it had been smeared by a bear's foot or smeared by a boot.

78
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.110
And I determined that it looked like I'd been smeared by a boot,

79
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.920
which would have men,

80
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.730
and we'd smeared the when we were hanging thing in the tree. And then stupidly,

81
00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:25.870
we like sat down and eat lunch.

82
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.240
And within a couple of minutes to sit down and eat lunch, um, it came, you know,

83
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:35.170
the bear came in and it's, it's open mouth past, uh,

84
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.490
just 18 inches from my head. Jeez. And I was facing away.

85
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.760
So I was the last one to see it. Um, Yonis who, you know,

86
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.450
he had a pistol, he had bear spray,

87
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.820
but he hit it in the head with a pair of black diamond trekking

88
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:54.850
poles. He had sat down,

89
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:57.880
he's got spray and set his pistol on his pack.

90
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.310
But then when the,

91
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.920
when I talk about like playing possum and all the that happens there,

92
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.410
his instinct is to smack it with the track and pole. Wow. Everything you spend,

93
00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.253
all your, you know,

94
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.330
you spend all your time thinking about how you're going to handle this, that,

95
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:17.470
and the other thing. Um, and,

96
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.310
uh, sometimes it's disappointing that you don't handle stress that well,

97
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.210
you know, I, I just, I don't know. I don't know where I went.

98
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.860
One of our guys like got ran over by a bear, wrote it down the hill. Um,

99
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.030
at that moment I snapped out of whatever I was in, but I was,

100
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.450
it shot me down bad. I even noticed, um,

101
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.630
I even noticed there's a thing that happens to people when they get really cold,

102
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.150
they enter a sort of a self fulfilling prophecy mentality.

103
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.100
When you start to get cold, um,

104
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.050
you lose as you start to get really cold, like where you get,

105
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:59.450
like where you could be in a hypothermic situation, um,

106
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.880
people stop doing the obvious things that you would do to

107
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:05.714
get warm.

108
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.480
And I is aware of that as I am,

109
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:14.960
as many times as I've experienced that, I still see it happened to me.

110
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.580
I still have to snap myself out of it. Like you just like,

111
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:22.640
you're getting cold, you're getting lethargic, you're getting cold,

112
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.540
more lethargic. The cold is getting worse. And I have to be like, you can stop.

113
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.590
You can step in right now and stop this. And I have to remind, it's still,

114
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:33.770
it's like, it still doesn't come naturally. You know,

115
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.350
when you talk to people who train, like, um, you talk to me,

116
00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:40.430
we were trained for this kind of stuff that they have to train

117
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.170
in a very realistic environment. They have to train, like, keep your head,

118
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.560
you know, and just like, make good decisions.

119
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.650
If you walk into like a active car crash scene or whatever,

120
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:54.680
and there's a severed hand laying on the ground, right?

121
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.580
Some people are just going to see that hand and they're not going to see

122
00:06:58.581 --> 00:06:59.414
anything else.

123
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.330
Some people are just gonna see chaos and they're not going to focus on any

124
00:07:02.331 --> 00:07:06.100
particular thing, but it's like the person would come in, see the hands,

125
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.690
see everything around them, like assess all that. It's like,

126
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.260
it's just from exposure to that super traumatic stuff. Not to get in.

127
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.940
Kohl's traumatic. But I do, when I, when I look at how I respond to things,

128
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:21.530
I do catch that there's like a, uh, a mentality to practice and learn.

129
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.853
Yeah. It's.

130
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.060
<v 1>It's understandable that something like a bear attack would trigger senses</v>

131
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.570
and trigger response that you're just not conditioned for. You're not,

132
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.560
I don't know how you would ever get conditioned to a bear attack. I don't.

133
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.350
<v 0>Know. I don't know. I mean, I don't know on that same island,</v>

134
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.250
these dudes at the same island, there was some guys, some, uh,

135
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.470
the same island. I think it was later that same year, uh, uh,

136
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.700
some operative, some military guys happened to be hunting there.

137
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.190
They got attacked by a bear and killed.

138
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:57.783
<v 2>Really.</v>

139
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.600
<v 0>Got, one of them got messed up bad, but he killed it. I'm like,</v>

140
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:02.620
why did he kill it? And I did.

141
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.310
<v 2>Well, maybe they had their gun out. Right? You.</v>

142
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.890
<v 1>Were in a weird situation too. Cause if you guys were relaxed,</v>

143
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:12.790
eating lunch with your guards down, you're sitting there chewing on a sand.

144
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.340
<v 0>I always laugh because you know what? I was in the middle of saying what,</v>

145
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.200
like I was in the middle of a sentence,

146
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.970
I'll never forget because someone was laughing,

147
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.460
but why we're putting some sandwiches together.

148
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:25.000
And someone was laughing about why my sandwich looks so much nicer than someone

149
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:29.650
else's sandwich. And I said, if you want, I was in the middle of saying,

150
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.030
if you want a sandwich like this, get your own TV show, but.

151
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.280
<v 2>I was never.</v>

152
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.080
<v 0>Able to finish the sentence. Wow.</v>

153
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.780
But I know I was in the middle of the saying that when all of a sudden the

154
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:44.650
people around me erupted off the ground, uh, as the,

155
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:48.370
like a landmine had gone off underneath us. Whoa.

156
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.650
Cause they saw it and I didn't see it. I was looking the other way.

157
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.910
And he came in running. Oh, just, ah, yeah,

158
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.760
no scary man. And I've, I've had like, you know, fair bit fair bit of exposure.

159
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.260
Um, and um, yeah, like, I mean,

160
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.260
relative to most, a ton of exposure to those things,

161
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.830
I got to expose my 10 year old kid to him this year. A couple of times,

162
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:17.550
you know, um, hunting caribou in Alaska. And it was, it was, it was like,

163
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.740
cool to kind of see his thought process.

164
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.880
<v 1>You, yeah. You've been exposed to a more than 99.9, nine,</v>

165
00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:29.990
9% of the population. And for it to rattle you like that.

166
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.590
<v 0>Was disappointing, man. Cause we're always talking about,</v>

167
00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:37.490
I'm going to do this and I'll do that. And we're always like, yeah. You know,

168
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:41.150
I actually prefer the 44 over to three because you know,

169
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.070
if I can't get it done with this 13, you know,

170
00:09:46.071 --> 00:09:49.460
I got 13 reasons. He doesn't want to charge me with this.

171
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.610
Semi-auto it's like all this like, you know,

172
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.730
but all of a sudden it like hits and like, you know,

173
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:58.840
SWAT it with a tracking pole. I've only seen.

174
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.130
<v 1>One grizzly ever in the wild, uh, up close. And, uh,</v>

175
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.210
it wasn't a big one. It was like a six foot pear. But uh,

176
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.930
it looked at me in a way that, uh, another bear has never looked at me before.

177
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.550
Uh, I've seen black bears, black bears look at you. Like, who are you?

178
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.500
Who are you? What's going on? Can I walk by you? Like black bears?

179
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:22.880
Look at people in a weird way.

180
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.370
<v 0>Yeah. They're like Denisons of the underbrush man.</v>

181
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.840
The grizzly looked at me like this.

182
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:34.460
<v 1>Just locked on me. And I was like, oh. Like Dan is just a different thing.</v>

183
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.350
Like it, it looked at me like, yeah, am I heating you? Am I going to eat you?

184
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.680
<v 0>Yeah, there's a mindset probably that comes from, uh,</v>

185
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.550
there's a mindset that probably comes from just not being challenged. Yeah.

186
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.340
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
