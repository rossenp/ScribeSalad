00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Hey, uh, did you watch the Canella fight this weekend?</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.440
I was.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.520
<v 1>Working, ah, yout. See it at all. You, I saw the highlights. Jesus broke.</v>

4
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.840
<v 0>His face, bro. He hits so hard. Broke that orbital bone.</v>

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.520
He's one of those guys that like, you know, some guys just have power. Right.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.960
But he works on it all the time. That's.

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.470
<v 1>What I say. He's the most, I, every fight. He's the most improved fighter.</v>

8
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.470
He always goes back and fixes anything. He saw wrong. Yep.

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.390
<v 0>Well the Danny Jacob's fight. Remember his head movement. Yep. It's I mean, it.</v>

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.223
<v 1>Gave Danny problems.</v>

11
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.350
<v 0>We give anybody problems,</v>

12
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.190
but it was also like he was showing his head movement in that.

13
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.230
<v 1>Fight. Yeah. Cuz they used to say he just walked right in and then he fixed it.</v>

14
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.220
There was a, a video of fix it. There's a video of Deontay Wilder. Uh, the,

15
00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.460
yesterday I saw it and he's looking really good. Malik Malik,

16
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:50.380
Scott King is training him now. What is he doing with him? Oh,

17
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.100
he looks like a completely different fighter. I think if you could find that.

18
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.580
Oh.

19
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.380
<v 0>Is he like using a lot of jabs is jab.</v>

20
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.300
<v 1>Jab video and planning his feet and it looks like a boxer now.</v>

21
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.810
He doesn't look like a wild man. Just leaping off his throw.

22
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:05.370
These wild punches looks and I'm excited to see his him fight now because he

23
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:07.970
looked really sharp. Looked like a real boxer now.

24
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.730
<v 0>Don't you think he needs uh, a few fights like that with lower,</v>

25
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.690
lower tier competition. Look.

26
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.290
<v 1>At that. Yeah. Look at that. Sitting on him. Bam.</v>

27
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.930
<v 0>The jab is very important. He's gonna need some, you know,</v>

28
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.280
some tuneup fights. Don't you think he.

29
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.800
<v 1>Should definitely have a, just to see how that style works in the ring,</v>

30
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.000
but he is moving. You see the way he is moving. He never move.

31
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.920
<v 0>Like that. But again,</v>

32
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.000
he's a guy that has preposterous power. Yeah.

33
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.640
Isn't it. Power's so weird. You.

34
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.760
<v 1>Know it is cuz he's so thin, you know like where's it coming from? Well,</v>

35
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:42.480
Tommy Herns. Yeah. Well Tommy. Yeah. To.

36
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.230
<v 0>Tommy Herns had he knocked Roberto Duran out cold. The only guy ever. Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:46.791
Second round.

38
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:51.230
There's just guys that just have preposterous power and Canello is a guy that

39
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.190
has power, but is constantly working on.

40
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:57.990
There's a great clip of him working with, uh, Andrew Ruiz and their uh,

41
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.390
you know, that, that shield,

42
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.940
that weird hand shield what they hold up when you hold for hooks. And he's like,

43
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:07.620
this is not for speed. This is just power. Just power. He's like don't,

44
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.500
don't try to be fast with this just power and you see him, just

45
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.980
everything is.

46
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.020
And so in that fight with Billy Joe and Billy Joe kept doing that,

47
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.300
that same lean over and over, like after he would punch,

48
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:23.460
he would lean outta the way and he just timed it perfectly with that upper cut

49
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.690
and through everything in.

50
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.890
<v 1>It. Yeah. That's the thing. He, he really watches you in a fight. HES, not some,</v>

51
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.450
some knucklehead who knows how to he really pays it. He's very aware. Yes.

52
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.730
And to me, I was never a Canello guy before, but after the past five fights,

53
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.410
I was like, you know what? If I'm not a Canello fan, now I'm a hater,

54
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.720
but I am a fan now cuz I really appreciate his work ethic, you know?

55
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.673
And the way he.

56
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.320
<v 0>Look at him this, see it, see it's about power. Yeah. See, this is,</v>

57
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:55.000
this is the thing they're working on. They just that's good.

58
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.360
And he'll do that over and over and over again.

59
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.680
So he's the guy who already had big power,

60
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.320
but he's constantly working and developing that power. So like in a fight,

61
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.280
like the Saunders fight,

62
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:11.200
there was massive consequences to anything that Saunders did Canello is in this

63
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.800
weird place where he is kind of cleaned out the division. Right.

64
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:16.880
He's got Caleb plant. Right. And not just that division,

65
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.630
he's kind of cleaned out a lot of division. Triple G is still in the,

66
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.990
in the running, which is interesting because he hasn't fought in two years. No,

67
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.470
he fought recently. Triple G fought. He fought last year. Yeah.

68
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.750
It's been a year though. Definitely. Since he fought last, um,

69
00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.310
I don't think it's quite a year. Cause I, I was in Texas.

70
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.790
I watched it in Texas live or yeah. Yeah. Um, see, find out when he,

71
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.900
when he font, but he looked good, dude. He not only looked good.

72
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:44.900
He looked ripped. So I was like, Hmm. toast please.

73
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.820
&lt;laugh&gt; cause he is like 38 and oh he's got, I think he,

74
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.620
he is bordering 40 real quick right now looked as good as he is ever looked.

75
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.380
He looked phenomenal December. Oh December. There you go. Oh, okay.

76
00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:59.020
So it's not been that long then. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, so, oh,

77
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.970
so wait, is he fighting when he? Is he fighting again then? Well,

78
00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:04.930
they're talking about him possibly fighting Canello he's I don't think that's a

79
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:06.890
good fight for him anymore for him. Maybe not,

80
00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:09.090
but maybe the last chance at romance.

81
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.250
I mean how much more of an option does he have? I mean, where's he gonna go?

82
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.730
Where, what else does he have? But the first fight I thought he won. Definitely.

83
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.330
I was at that one. Yeah. I thought he won the first fight. I was ringside there.

84
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.160
The second, very close, very close.

85
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.800
And Teddy Atlas was saying they should have given it to triple G.

86
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.080
A lot of other people favored Canello but a much better performance for Canello.

87
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.120
But I think Canello as, like we said, these, these guys like Kamar,

88
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.400
Usman like Canello Alvarez. Like these guys who are just consummate champions,

89
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.270
you's just gonna get a better version of them.
