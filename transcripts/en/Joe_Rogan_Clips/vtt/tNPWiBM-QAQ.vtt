00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Let me do my Joey Diaz impression. Hey Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.570
I like that. He calls you Joe Rogan.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.430
So if today someone said we can, schools can open up.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.790
Clubs can open up. Venues can open up. We can go back to normal.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.890
If you wear this bracelet that tells me where you are at all times where

6
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:22.050
you were last night and who you hung out with.

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.390
<v 1>This is the problem with it.</v>

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.690
The same problem with shutting down the Tik TOK house. It's because, okay,

9
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.280
you shut down a house that has 200 people. What if it gets down to five?

10
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.950
What if they tell you, you have to split your family up?

11
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.530
What if you have 10 people in your house, you can't have more than 10.

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.140
What if you have 12, grandma comes over, can't come over.

13
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.440
Who the are they to tell you can't have a party.

14
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.210
You have mismanaged this crisis.

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.340
So horribly at every step of the way and not just the city and not just the

16
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:50.600
state, the federal government.

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.520
And of course the people that were releasing the information from [inaudible]

18
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.900
that's the, that's the big step.

19
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.960
Cause they're the ones who it up because there was a lot of legit doctors and

20
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:01.610
scientists that were in Wu Han,

21
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.940
Chinese doctors that were trying to get the word out and they were silenced.

22
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.811
And the main one,

23
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:09.740
the first one that did it actually wind up dying from the disease. It's crazy.

24
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.130
Right? So that's, that's the biggest up, but there's,

25
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.320
fuck-ups every step of the way.

26
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.420
And one of the biggest ups that's happening right now is these people being in a

27
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.300
position of power and telling people that they can't work telling people,

28
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:23.720
they can't do things. Tell them you can protest. I'm going to say you can't.

29
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.430
But I did.

30
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.370
I did see that Tim Dillon was supposed to be there governors and long island,

31
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:29.204
the comedy club,

32
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.020
but you can't have a person that just because they win a popularity contest,

33
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.320
make new rules. You can't give them the power to make new rules.

34
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.950
Cause everybody becomes a tyrant. And there's what they're doing. They all,

35
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.100
they're doing it to protect people. You tell me how many hospital beds you have.

36
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.720
You tell me what the death rate is.

37
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.170
And then you tell me why this is the only state in the country that can,

38
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.680
that can't open a beauty salon. The beauty salons can't be open right now.

39
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.150
Only California. They're crazy. This is, it's a crazy.

40
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.030
<v 2>State. And they opened them for a second and then took it away.</v>

41
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.630
Maybe it's because we don't pay.

42
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.620
<v 0>Enough taxes. Jesus Christ.</v>

43
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.180
<v 1>Uber. I never paid. The point is that bad people are going to wake the up. No,</v>

44
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.940
it's fine. I.

45
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.640
<v 2>I never paid taxes. I'll say it on podcasts. Nobody knows. Let's just say,</v>

46
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.310
let's just say on paper, man, Wesley Snipes have a lot in common.

47
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.270
<v 0>Dude. They don't around. They find, you know.</v>

48
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.430
<v 2>I'm, I'm having my, well, I'm not talking about this actually.</v>

49
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.890
<v 1>But the, this, the state is just, they're terrible at it.</v>

50
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.340
And the fact that they can shut down these tick talkers, we should be nervous.

51
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.950
Not because these tick Dockers are our geniuses,

52
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.540
but it's because who the are you to say? You, you can shut the power off.

53
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.050
You can shut someone's. But isn't it funny that they're very.

54
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.170
<v 2>Slow. They're taking their, their ability to use their phones.</v>

55
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.080
They're like your phone's going to die. And then you're a. I think they're.

56
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.150
<v 1>Shutting the lights off in the house. That's what they're doing.</v>

57
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:52.880
They're cutting off the water. But if you do that,

58
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.560
you're saying that you have the ability to shut off essentially things that keep

59
00:02:57.561 --> 00:02:59.560
people alive, water power.

60
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.970
And you're saying that you have the ability to tell them how they can live in

61
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:04.804
this house.

62
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.210
And there's no real law that says you can limit the amount of people that can go

63
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:12.870
to a party. And don't think there is, this.

64
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.860
<v 0>Does not happen, Texas. No, my mom is from Texas. Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:20.250
You do not get to tell people from Texas what to do except don't smoke weed.

66
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.980
Yeah. Except weed. What are we gonna do about that? Oh,

67
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.940
I'm going to have the, what you.

68
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.840
<v 3>Can see laws and like that. Like the amount of people that can be. But if you.</v>

69
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.330
<v 1>Can't change them, can you, can you make it a house?</v>

70
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.380
Like if a house is normally has a party, like Danville's, Erin's place.

71
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.240
<v 3>You're in college and you have too many people at your house,</v>

72
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.590
they'll come and shut it down. Right. Right.

73
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.000
<v 1>But that's the cops and that's not your house. That's Jamie. Well.</v>

74
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.960
<v 3>We don't own the house either. They're probably renting it. They didn't,</v>

75
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.590
they don't have $10 million to buy those houses. Yet. The.

76
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.460
<v 1>People who own the house have some sort of a regulation. Maybe I could see it.</v>

77
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.130
But if you like Dan Bilzerian didn't own that house either.

78
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.570
And the whole thing about that house,

79
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:01.620
it would off the neighbors was cause he would just bus in people and they'd fill

80
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:05.190
that place up and DJs and marshmallows there and, and everybody's going crazy,

81
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.140
but they didn't shut his power off.

82
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:09.720
So they're sitting there saying they have the ability to show your power and

83
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:13.590
water off because during the pandemic they can limit the amount of people in

84
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:13.861
your house.

85
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:17.100
So that's a new rule because if they were having these occupancy laws,

86
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.960
Dan Bilzerian, would've gotten shut down too.

87
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.900
They're doing it because they're saying you could spread COVID this way.

88
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:22.890
And it's irresponsible.

89
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.060
The problem is the way that they're doing something new,

90
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.930
they're shutting power off on someone's house that doesn't listen.

91
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.880
There's shutting power off on someone.

92
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.970
Who's having a party who doesn't know bay. They have, and.

93
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.660
<v 0>They're doing it for press to kind of let people know what's up.</v>

94
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.770
It's just like a threat.

95
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.420
<v 1>It's the same guy that offered rewards for people who turn folks in.</v>

96
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.680
Remember the whole thing, snitches get stitches. Well now snitches get rewards.

97
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.740
If people want social justice saying that people are having parties.

98
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.180
And that was for small parties. Remember that was for people having barbecues,

99
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.433
this.

100
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.800
<v 0>Do you think I'm going to get? Cause I'm starting a standup show in my backyard.</v>

101
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.390
Just for comics. We're going to do testing.

102
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:05.640
Like what Chappelle is doing in Ohio. I'm going to do in my backyard.

103
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.270
Cause it's just getting crazy. Am I gonna get shut down? No.

104
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.250
<v 1>No, but you're going to let everybody know where you live now. Oh.</v>

105
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.020
<v 0>It's going to be, it's basically going to be like a bringer show.</v>

106
00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.720
It's gonna be like comic bring like two friends that you trust to know.

107
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.480
<v 2>Guys, if you join my Patrion, do a raffle</v>

108
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.430
and some. We might try to show you some stuff. Like why not? Yeah. Why.

109
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.560
<v 1>Not? I just wonder what is the law? Like?</v>

110
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:27.920
See if we can find out if there's any written thing.

111
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.610
I know many people can I have. I don't know. Yeah. Like what,

112
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:34.290
what is the law now in LA? If these tic talkers have too many people,

113
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.490
but they believe a lot.

114
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 0>That I'm going to have like five comics. Cause when I started.</v>

115
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.370
<v 1>I think he should just be arrested. If that's a law,</v>

116
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.050
I think you should be fine or something.

117
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.780
I don't think you should be able to shut someone's power.

118
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.060
<v 0>Find me great. All right, bye. Yeah.</v>

119
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.720
<v 1>If like if these tic talkers like, Hey, you guys are violating the law.</v>

120
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.310
So here's a fine of $200. This blimp things make sense.

121
00:05:56.311 --> 00:05:59.720
If you're finding for like, if you're, if you park in the wrong place,

122
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.750
you can get fined. But there's a thing that they're doing. That's weird.

123
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:07.430
They're shutting power off ordinance on loud or unruly gatherings known as the

124
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:11.210
party house ordinance hate Dan Bilzerian did ever work on you officially took

125
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:13.970
place August 15th, 2018. They never used it on him.

126
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.420
The ordinance claims to curb repeat offenders have added control parties of

127
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:21.230
residential neighborhoods with escalating fines and new enforcement from Los

128
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.900
Angeles police department. I don't think that's connected though,

129
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.590
because this is 2018. Is that like a blanket statement?

130
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.010
Don't think that's connected to the Tik TOK house. These are all, do we want so.

131
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.120
<v 0>Many heat wave? It was 107. You can't cut off someone's electricity in 107.</v>

132
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.160
<v 1>And we're all, we're assuming they're kids and they're allowed to be there.</v>

133
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.143
Okay. Here,

134
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.560
property owners who skirt building and safety rules or city laws such as Los

135
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:47.170
Angeles party house ordinance was the same law, right?

136
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.180
Are in violation of COVID 19 public health orders in the city's party house

137
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:54.580
ordinance, which becomes the law in 2018.

138
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:58.060
So they're talking about that law and it said it wasn't clear whether Garcetti's

139
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:01.180
announcement was related to that motion. Okay.

140
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.570
What it feels like it's still exactly they're making

141
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.650
up as they go along. It's still sneaky.

142
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.880
I liked the proposal penalties for large gatherings could include water and

143
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:17.320
power shut off permit prohibitions and having a certificate of Hopkins

144
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.970
occupancy held or revert revoked for large co close

145
00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:22.540
contact,

146
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.250
largely masked list gatherings in violation of city emergency orders and

147
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:30.100
county health order. So the city emergency and the county health order,

148
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.980
they make an order saying you can have a large gathering. And if you do,

149
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:35.980
they're going to do a new thing, which is shut your water and power off.

150
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.740
When do they never do that. Unless you're a fugitive,

151
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.320
you have to have like a gun and you're pointing it out.

152
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.860
<v 2>The window. So it's like, we're always at risk of fires.</v>

153
00:07:44.861 --> 00:07:48.820
And now you're making people use candle light. Like I've seen, I've seen.

154
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.140
<v 0>These kids, they don't shower anyway.</v>

155
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.530
It's just punish them that much slippery thing. If you're loud,

156
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.820
it's a God complex.

157
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.070
<v 1>I think it's stupid that these kids want to have these parties.</v>

158
00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:59.680
And we were talking about Dr. Malkin and all these people that came to him that

159
00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:03.100
got sick from one of those parties. You can get sick for sure.

160
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.910
And there's probably, you know,

161
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.910
it's a high likelihood that people are going to die.

162
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.150
If they keep getting sick and they infect someone, you know,

163
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.380
it's like zero it's point, zero 4% of people who catch COVID die.

164
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:18.250
That's what the current standings are. So it could lead to a death or two.

165
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.510
It is possible. But I just,

166
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.450
I just don't think you should allow people to do that.
