00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. She had the COVID. She had it,</v>

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.350
she got it over. She, she kicked it.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.200
<v 1>It's surprise more comics.</v>

4
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:13.700
Didn't get it the way we're shaking hands and meeting people after shows. Um,

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.830
yeah, I saw my, I got, my wife, had the kits we had to get tested. So I was,

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.450
I suddenly, yeah.

7
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.000
<v 0>Think Jay Oakerson got it. He had it.</v>

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.300
And he's claiming feels weird to be talking about people that have it. Yeah.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.730
I know a lot of people that caught it. Yeah.

10
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.850
I know about nine you're like naming names like Joe McCarthy. Okay.

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.440
Oh, they're fine now. Well, I like people.

12
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.300
<v 1>Who've had it now. Cause they have the antibodies.</v>

13
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.520
They think they can like walk on fire. It's like, dude,

14
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:43.310
this thing is a brand new thing. I don't know if you want to be testing.

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.800
You know, I got a buddy of mine, uh,

16
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.160
ended up getting it and then he was just like, oh, I got tested.

17
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:52.640
I got the antibodies. So now I think he feels like he's Bulletproof. So.

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.950
<v 0>They don't even know if you can catch it again. They don't,</v>

19
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.660
they really have no idea. Well.

20
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.180
<v 1>People are gonna find out now we're gonna find out. Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.290
Cause when I was driving over here,

22
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:04.130
I actually got into a moderate level of traffic on the highway.

23
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.730
Like I've noticed it's just at some point. I mean,

24
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.760
considering people are just kind of doing what they want to do.

25
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.390
And a lot of people were after two weeks, everyone just sort of,

26
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.200
depending on where your ego was like, you know, go to me.

27
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.100
This is something I'm going to go outside those people.

28
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.590
They just kept it going. So now I just feel like, well,

29
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:29.360
you can't have 60% of the population go broke because less than 1% has

30
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:32.570
something. Yeah. So I don't know.

31
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:34.790
I think we're just going to just go back.

32
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.490
I think we're just going to go back and if you get it, you get it.

33
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:39.320
And if you die, you die. And if you don't,

34
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.440
you don't and then eventually they're going to get they'll get and get

35
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:45.380
something. That'll slow it down or stop it or something like that.

36
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.020
<v 0>Here's it slows down your immune system. They don't tell you.</v>

37
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.160
God thing about that.

38
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.080
They don't tell you how to take care of your immune system.

39
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.560
There's no word about that. It's put a mask on wash your hands.

40
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.250
No one's telling you sleep more. Drink water, take vitamins. Cause.

41
00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.880
<v 1>None of that,</v>

42
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.710
I know this one guy brought up vitamin D and his big podcast and then you

43
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:04.100
couldn't find it anymore. Did you like Oprah?

44
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.480
When she attacked the meat industry? I just saw a clip. Oh, this guy on Rogan.

45
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:10.640
And I, of course it didn't even research. So who the guy was,

46
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.220
it was just like take vitamin D. I was a woman. That's such a,

47
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.210
how much I pay attention. And then I go, I go health, food store. It's all gone.

48
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.180
And there was somebody who was bootleg vitamin D was like vitamin.

49
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.660
<v 2>D plus I'm like, what is that? What is that? I.</v>

50
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.520
<v 1>Know that, that that's probably going, gonna make me catch it.</v>

51
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.600
So I just take vitamin C and I try to get eight hours sleep. And I I've been,

52
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.780
I've been doing a pretty good job of, uh, I'm pretty,

53
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.540
anti-social like a lot of comics. So I haven't had a problem.

54
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.473
<v 0>Soda away from everybody.</v>

55
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.070
<v 1>My wife, I quarantine in my house.</v>

56
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:42.410
Like my wife's are you guys to sit down and have dinner with us? I'm.

57
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.030
<v 2>Always open. So I'm alone. No one can hurt me. Oh.</v>

58
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.170
<v 1>Just leftover childhood.</v>

59
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.490
Just coming from a family alone or so feel weird.

60
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.140
<v 0>Not doing stand up was I've been like.</v>

61
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.420
<v 1>Um, I did not miss it at all,</v>

62
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.260
but I think that whenever there's something like painful in my life,

63
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.870
I think that that's what I do is I just, I just go, I don't care.

64
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.640
I don't give a. It's all.

65
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:14.320
I really learned a lot more about myself during this quiet

66
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.710
time of not running around and going to airports and kind of sitting with myself

67
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.850
and being like, wow,

68
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.470
I thought I was way further down the road working on myself than I was,

69
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.670
but I have a lot of childhood issues left over.

70
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.920
<v 2>I got a, I was like, wow. Like I really.</v>

71
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.780
<v 1>Started like all these puzzle pieces just started coming in and I was able to</v>

72
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:37.660
look all the way back where I was to where,

73
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.370
where I am now and how I got here and these little things that happen to me,

74
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:43.301
you know,

75
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:47.140
good things and bad that just sort of just knocked me down this road that I'm

76
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:47.710
on. It was just.

77
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.300
<v 0>Sitting alone with alone time.</v>

78
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.700
<v 1>Yeah. Well, you know, my wife was going through, you know, the third trimester,</v>

79
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.070
you know, when, you know when they're just over it and you're like, oh God,

80
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:58.090
there's six weeks ago.

81
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.300
<v 2>I ran, you know, he'd be like, oh no.</v>

82
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.420
<v 1>Um, you know, I finally, you know, get my daughter to bed, get her to bed.</v>

83
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:09.820
Everything was good. Made sure all the doors were locked.

84
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.300
And then I was just sorta like why, you know, all these years of doing standup,

85
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.500
I'm just up at that hour. So I was just sort of, you know,

86
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.650
sit and kind of by myself, like I.

87
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.780
<v 0>I'm worried about a second wave of the Corona.</v>

88
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.460
I'm worried about them locking things down.

89
00:04:23.461 --> 00:04:26.580
Someone's going to step in and stop them from doing that. Next, next wave.

90
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.260
You guys gotta be proactive.

91
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.330
You've got to do something about people's immune systems.

92
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.320
You've got to lock down old people and sick people let regular people do

93
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:35.850
whatever the they want. You can't,

94
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.650
you can't just lock people's freedom down for something that killed a small

95
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:42.390
fraction of what you thought it was going to kill.

96
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.580
The whole thing is it's just creepy to have guys like mayor Garcetti,

97
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.120
be in charge of telling people whether or not they get to work.

98
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.950
Like that's not what a governor is.

99
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.530
<v 1>Supposed to be. We'll try it.</v>

100
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.920
But they they're trying to look out for your best interest in trying to get

101
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.280
400 million people to all pull in the same direction.

102
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.280
It's it's you can't get 40 comics to pull in the same direction.

103
00:05:05.281 --> 00:05:08.430
So like they have like an impossible they did. And they didn't.

104
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.420
There was those people right the whole time.

105
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:16.800
There's been on my street, walking around no masks, you know,

106
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.310
not quarantining, like the people that come by the houses, you see the,

107
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.300
you know,

108
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.760
the same people that were going in and out of the house who are not part of

109
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:25.380
their family, still going in and out of the house.

110
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.030
<v 0>I want people to walk down the street with a mask on.</v>

111
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.410
<v 1>Let's not start this job. Let's not start this. Okay, let's start it.</v>

112
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:34.500
I don't want to start this. I'm not going to sit here with no medical degree,

113
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.570
listening to you with no medical degree,

114
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.850
with an American flag behind you smoking a cigar,

115
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.710
acting like we know what's up better than the CDC. All I do is I, listen.

116
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.740
I watched the news once every two weeks. I'm like, eh, masker, no mess.

117
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.130
Still mask. All right, mass. That's all I give a about. I don't care. But even.

118
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.160
<v 0>They say you shouldn't wear a mask unless you're treating a coronavirus patient,</v>

119
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.540
the world. Yeah. They.

120
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.350
<v 1>Didn't say that initial. They didn't say it initially. No they didn't. They did.</v>

121
00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:01.070
And then it gradually went up and then everybody wore the masse.

122
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.620
This is like rollerblading, everybody roller bladed.

123
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.810
And then it was that one homophobic joke.

124
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:07.490
And then everybody acted like they never did it.

125
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.840
And then a hundred million roller blades got thrown into the ocean. We.

126
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.150
<v 2>All wore masks. And then all of a sudden people.</v>

127
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.910
<v 1>Are sitting there, but you don't have the body type for it though.</v>

128
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.000
You knuckles would scrape on the ground. You don't want that extra two inches.

129
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.160
I just love how wearing a mask became like this like soft thing that you were

130
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:33.370
doing, like being courteous, being courteous. What is it for pitches?

131
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.690
I was so stupid.

132
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.420
<v 0>Matt, first of all. Oh God. You're.</v>

133
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.890
<v 1>So tough with your open nose and throat GI Joe and your five o'clock shadow.</v>

134
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.340
This is a man right here. A man doesn't wear a mask.

135
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.320
Why does it always become like that? It's always like the man's were stupid.

136
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.010
Well.

137
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.630
<v 0>The men do we make fun of things, anything, anything that, uh,</v>

138
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.510
seems like you're not taking chances, right? We don't.

139
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.500
<v 1>Have problem with that unless you are already wearing the mask and then you're</v>

140
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:03.400
acting like you didn't,

141
00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.660
then all of a sudden people watch your thing and then they all pile up. Ooh,

142
00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.970
this wearing the mask. It's like, you were doing it two weeks ago.

143
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.630
<v 0>I was scared out of my mind in the beginning, in the beginning,</v>

144
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:15.280
like when the first, when,

145
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.280
when everybody's shutting down the beginning and people were stockpiling food,

146
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.890
I was convinced. I was like, Jesus, do you.

147
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.020
<v 1>Have like nine elk in your basement? You were,</v>

148
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.990
you were the one person I knew it was fine. Tom pop is making bread. Plenty.

149
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.950
I knew, I knew he was.

150
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.510
<v 0>Fine. I was worried about it. I was worried about people.</v>

151
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:30.070
I knew getting really sick and dying.

152
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.340
And then I was convinced that I had it at one point in time was I kind of fed

153
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:37.540
you feel like I'm breathing heavy. I felt like my breath is some,

154
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.080
like my breath is coming short. I did, I did.

155
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:44.940
I had like psychosomatic issues thinking about it.

156
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.710
<v 1>Okay. I had a panic attack sitting on 12 elk.</v>

157
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.030
You had a panic attack and then you felt bad about yourself.

158
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.370
And then you attack people with masks. That's how it works.

159
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:59.290
And that's how the hatred starts. And that's right now.

160
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.420
Why seven blocks to Seattle? You can't go now.

161
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.730
<v 0>Okay. Want to go? And I'm going to drop off free food for those folks.</v>

162
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:08.050
Those are fine protests. There.

163
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.620
<v 1>Is a major American city. We're seven blocks that people have took over it.</v>

164
00:08:11.621 --> 00:08:14.500
And I had no idea what you were talking about. So that's great.

165
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:17.710
Anything that I say I don't watch it. I envy you at all.

166
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:25.450
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
