<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.980
When people talk about issues in this country, there's a,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.520
there's a giant, there's a giant divide with,

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.630
with one thing in particular, and that is mass shootings, uh,

5
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:17.160
mass shootings and gun control.

6
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:21.570
There's a giant divide between people that are second amendment advocates and

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:25.740
people that want to round up all the assault weapons and take away all the guns.

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:29.820
And they think that guns are the problem. When you see this

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.400
pretty disturbing increase in mass shootings in this country,

10
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.480
what is, what is your take on it? And what do you think could be done?

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.440
<v 1>Well, it's awful. Um, they're terrorist attacks, and I think,</v>

12
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.280
I think it's safer to call them that, uh, the, the weather,

13
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.030
depending on how you define a mass shooting. Um, now you define,

14
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.450
when we look at murder statistics, we're actually at a very,

15
00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:58.420
very low point in our history. I mean, look at the early nineties,

16
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.290
it was vastly more murders by gun, uh,

17
00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:05.180
than we have now as just statistically speaking. What's.

18
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.160
<v 0>That because of this, do they know.</v>

19
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.210
<v 1>There was a massive kind of war on crime? I think in the nineties, uh,</v>

20
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.760
increase in police, you know, you have the,

21
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:14.960
some of the crime bills that went through,

22
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.240
which were obviously the source of a lot of debate right now in the Democrat

23
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.730
primary. And, uh, yeah, it just, it was just, there was a, there was, uh,

24
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.770
an approach to fix that. Okay. You know, tackling gang violence,

25
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:28.400
tackling all of these things. And, uh, we, we live in a much,

26
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.420
even though you wouldn't think so because of these kinds of theatrical, again,

27
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.910
they're, they're terrorist attacks. I don't know what else to call them, uh,

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.690
because, because the person doing and is trying to commit terror. Right. And,

29
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.930
uh, you know, for different reasons of course, but, but there are,

30
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:44.540
they at least they attach themselves to some kind of reason, but in the end,

31
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.220
they're, they're angry at something. And they're, they're probably, you know,

32
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.490
probably have been taking some kind of psychotropic drugs over time and they've

33
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:55.340
gotten to this point and they'll attach themselves to whatever reason they need

34
00:01:55.341 --> 00:02:00.290
to do this. And it's awful. Um, so, you know, how do you fix that?

35
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.240
Um, we have to understand the problem. We have to diagnose it. And, um,

36
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.100
and then we got it and I think we have to be realistic about what the solutions

37
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:15.020
really are and what our ability to influence those outcomes really is.

38
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:19.640
And that's a, that's an emotional conversation for people. Uh, you know, we've,

39
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:21.830
we've been dealing with for the last few weeks, of course. I mean, it's, it's,

40
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:25.880
it's front and center, um, in the debate. And so, but we gotta have it.

41
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.890
<v 0>What can be done.</v>

42
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.410
<v 1>Yeah. Um, well, the, the,</v>

43
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:35.000
so obviously the reaction by many is to go after the tool, right.

44
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:39.530
To go after the guns. Um, I don't think that's the right approach.

45
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.790
It's not, it's not, again,

46
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.430
it's not clear that that would actually solve the problem. There's, there's two,

47
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.450
there's two main requirements. When you're looking at, uh,

48
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.280
an approach to gun control. It's like,

49
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.550
does it infringe on law-abiding citizens rights? Number one,

50
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.560
what's the answer to that? And two,

51
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.160
is it going to actually affect the outcome that we're trying to affect?

52
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.090
Is it gonna feel, or is it going to do good? Okay.

53
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.360
And I think the vast majority of proposals, um,

54
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.930
failed both of those standards. They, they definitely infringed on law,

55
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.170
abiding citizens rights, and they probably wouldn't even solve the problem.

56
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.670
You know, look at examples, assault rifles, or let's not, well, Hey ours. Okay.

57
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.440
They're called assault rifles. They're really,

58
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.950
the reason they're in AR is because they're called ArmaLite. That's a brand, um,

59
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.960
assault rifle is not a, is not a real thing. It's not a real definition. And,

60
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.810
um, but what if you banned them? Well,

61
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.010
rifles are responsible for less than 3% of all gun deaths, about 2.6,

62
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:36.880
6% of all gun deaths. Okay. Hammers and knives, I think are, are,

63
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.490
are responsible for far more deaths. Um, so yes,

64
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:42.000
the hammers.

65
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.840
<v 0>And knives are responsible for more deaths and rifles got statistics, including.</v>

66
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.340
<v 1>AR in the back. Yeah, really? Yeah. Rifles account for four,</v>

67
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.840
2.6, 6% of people with hammers. I mean, it's a good weapon.

68
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.913
I guess.

69
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.030
<v 0>I feel if somebody has a hammer of all you have is a hammer. Well.</v>

70
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.810
<v 1>But yeah, if you have a gun yeah.</v>

71
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.760
<v 0>Pretty well. Even if you don't have a gun, I feel like I could stop my hammer.</v>

72
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.640
Yeah. But you're a pretty good fighter. got an AR.

73
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.030
<v 1>Well, that's not true. I can take away your AR if you're frowning, you know,</v>

74
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.250
how close do you have to be to do that? You just got to reach it.

75
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.610
It's very easy to take away an AR. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.793
<v 0>How easy.</v>

77
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.860
<v 1>I just, I just need to get a hand on the barrel.</v>

78
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.900
Can I [inaudible] classes. Yeah, I know. And I've taken those classes.

79
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:31.920
That's why I know it's so easy. Whoever controls the barrel of any gun controls,

80
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:34.980
the gun. People don't quite realize that they think if they're gripping it,

81
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.590
then they control the gun. That's not true. Right. Um,

82
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.360
we can weeds now the way that we can demonstrate that. Yeah. Afterwards. So.

83
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.890
<v 0>Flame thrower maybe rubbed up. Yeah. No rifles.</v>

84
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.950
Is that what that I was seeing on? My sure. What that was.

85
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.870
Are you going to take a picture with that later? Okay.

86
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.970
<v 1>Can I, can I actually use it though? Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.250
<v 0>We can turn it on. As long as you don't cook the ceiling.</v>

88
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.560
<v 1>Okay. But I can cook anything else. Yeah. You'll be the only one.</v>

89
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.600
<v 0>Who's ever turned it on here. Other than Ilan.</v>

90
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.600
It doesn't have to be in the room, but yeah, it does though.

91
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.600
Picture do it in the room. Um,

92
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.440
so have you thought about this? I mean, if you,

93
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.440
if you had a magic wand and they said, Hey, Dan Cranshaw,

94
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.910
what can you do to solve this mass gun violence?

95
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:19.890
What can you do to solve these mass shootings?

96
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.090
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

97
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.140
you have to target the source of them and it's just not an easy conversation.

98
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:28.650
Right. And so this let's also think about where these things started.

99
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.600
They were talking about the theatrical mass shootings.

100
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:32.790
There's a lot of statistics out there. They'll say we have hundreds of them,

101
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.670
you know, which include four or more deaths,

102
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:38.250
but these are usually gang violence. So gang violence is,

103
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.630
it's a it's in a category. Right.

104
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.530
<v 0>Just to do, I believe there was 279 mass shootings so far this year.</v>

105
00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:46.620
And some of them, they do include gang violence. Right.

106
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.760
I think it's two or more. Is that what it's deemed mass shootings. Yeah.

107
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.690
It might be more, which is so weird that we have a statistic. Well,

108
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.180
that doesn't count. It's only. Yeah. Yeah.

109
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.940
<v 1>I mean, you gotta draw the line somewhere. You gotta,</v>

110
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.730
you gotta be able to analyze if you're going to analyze it, you have to,

111
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.770
to have to look into that. But the, these themes,

112
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.180
I think the kind of dramatize shootings that these, that these guys are doing,

113
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.360
and it all started with Columbine and it's become this sort of copycat crime

114
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.230
that has occurred over time. And it, like, we didn't have this before that.

115
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:19.160
And I think that's interesting. I think it's something to take note of. Um,

116
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.680
and it, and it's not clear what you do about that. Um, you, you have to,

117
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.450
you don't have to look for signs, uh, people before they do it. And, uh,

118
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.010
so one bill that I'm on,

119
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:33.740
which is there's is I've taken a lot of fire for it because of the people are

120
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:37.310
just, I think, misunderstand what it actually is, is the taps act,

121
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:40.520
which is the threat assessment, uh, prevention and safety act.

122
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.560
All this does is give local law enforcement the ability to apply for grants,

123
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:49.220
to get training and, and behavioral threat assessment, training,

124
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.570
and data analytical tools to identify these threats beforehand.

125
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.060
<v 0>And people that are opposed to it. They look at it like red flag laws. They,</v>

126
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.500
they.

127
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.450
<v 1>They combine those two quite a bit. And that's just, that's just not,</v>

128
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.540
it's not true. I mean,

129
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.290
th the taps act doesn't actually have anything to do with guns.

130
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.890
<v 0>And red flag laws, depending on how they're implemented,</v>

131
00:07:08.891 --> 00:07:12.460
could take someone who looks like they're erratic,

132
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:15.580
or who has a pension for violence. And they will say,

133
00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:17.350
you do not have access to guns.

134
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.300
<v 1>Right. In theory, that would, that would be how they work. And, um, they,</v>

135
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:22.870
they would fill a gap. I think in it, it depends on the state.

136
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:23.980
Some states have all the ability,

137
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:28.330
they need to see threatening behavior and then arrest that person. Uh,

138
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.840
but it depends on criminal law within that state. So I theoretically,

139
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:33.910
a red flag I would, would fill, fill that gap.

140
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.170
The concern with red flag laws obviously is, is there really due process?

141
00:07:38.171 --> 00:07:39.580
A lot of people hear that and they're like, okay,

142
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:41.920
that means my neighbor can tell on me and they're going to get my guns the next

143
00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:45.040
morning. Well, yeah. I mean, if that's how the law was written, then yeah.

144
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.640
You better be against that because that's a terrible law. Um, and, and,

145
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.820
and to be fair to a lot of the people who, who don't like red flag laws,

146
00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:54.760
they see how these are written in a lot of states and in California has one.

147
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.133
And, uh,

148
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.050
and they see how there's a written and they say this doesn't protect due

149
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:02.260
process. How can we possibly, before this, um,

150
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.640
that on the other hand, there hasn't been any cases where there's,

151
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:10.780
there's been some obvious abuse of that law either. So, um, you know,

152
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.250
I've encouraged the conversation.

153
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.400
I think the conversation has to happen at the state level because every state

154
00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:18.730
has different criminal law and that's where criminal law happens. It's it it's,

155
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.170
uh, it does not happen at the federal.

156
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.540
<v 0>Level. The only other controversial, uh,</v>

157
00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:26.350
approach that I've heard is, uh,

158
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.240
putting armed police or soldiers at schools,

159
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.160
which is like that,

160
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.590
that seems incredibly disturbing to me that you have to have people look,

161
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.300
I'm not opposed to it,

162
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.250
but it's disturbing to me that you would have to have someone standing by

163
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.010
ready for violence. Well, we have.

164
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.760
<v 1>Guards everywhere. Why not our schools, um, because we've never.</v>

165
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.910
<v 0>Had them before. And it's sort of signaling that.</v>

166
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.710
We've reached this point of impasse where we have to do something about it,

167
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:01.320
and we're not doing anything to prevent these things from happening.

168
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.680
What we're doing is protecting the people that are going to be there when these

169
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:05.514
things happen.

170
00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.690
<v 1>Yeah. I think inner city schools have long had police presence there.</v>

171
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.960
So it's not, it's not, I don't think it's totally new. Um, the idea,

172
00:09:11.961 --> 00:09:14.780
and I think we could rapidly get used to it. Uh,

173
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.450
there's a good argument to be made that gun-free zones are the first thing that

174
00:09:17.451 --> 00:09:19.490
are attacked too. So, I mean, you know,

175
00:09:19.491 --> 00:09:22.550
it's a counterintuitive response to this, but it's, it's true.

176
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.550
If I'm going to commit a terrible act. I w of course,

177
00:09:25.551 --> 00:09:27.610
you're going to go to the place where, you know, nobody's caring. Yeah.

178
00:09:27.611 --> 00:09:29.150
You're not going to a gun show. Right.

179
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.090
Uh let's you were just really, really looking for a fight. Um, but, uh,

180
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.420
th th that's, that's, there's some truth to that. And it's, it's just hard.

181
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.340
It's so hard for people to have this conversation,

182
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.690
because it's so emotional and there's a cultural Fisher here too.

183
00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:48.740
There's there's, some people don't understand some people who like guns, right.

184
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.990
And there's, there's a cultural divide there. Yeah.

185
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.800
And I just don't like people who like guns, you know, that's, we have to admit,

186
00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:55.634
that's true.

187
00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:00.380
<v 0>They'd have this idea of guns that guns bring violence and violent.</v>

188
00:10:00.381 --> 00:10:04.160
People want guns. And that that's just not true.

189
00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:07.070
And one of the things that people like to gloss over is how many people have

190
00:10:07.071 --> 00:10:11.510
defended their life and defended the lives of their loved ones with guns in this

191
00:10:11.511 --> 00:10:14.150
country. Every year, it happens all the time. I've.

192
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:18.710
<v 1>Got a whole list of stats and examples that I'm sure I could read to you right.</v>

193
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.130
<v 0>Now. One of the things that gets brought up during gun violence, statistics,</v>

194
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.730
and talk about how many people die from firearms every year in this country,

195
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.530
they're also talking about people who've defending their lives and defending the

196
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:31.490
lives of their loved ones.

197
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.090
People get their houses broken into all the time by armed criminals.

198
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.530
And they shoot those people and they lay live to see another day and that person

199
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:43.400
dies. And that is the whole reason why people don't want to get rid of guns.

200
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.180
Right. And I want.

201
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.800
<v 1>To bring something up along those lines.</v>

202
00:10:45.801 --> 00:10:49.850
So it's far more likely in countries like great Britain that you'll get your

203
00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:51.290
house broken into while you are,

204
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.610
they're far more likely than in the United States. Like about by a,

205
00:10:55.611 --> 00:10:59.300
by a good order of magnitude actually. So that, that the, why is that? Right?

206
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:02.000
Because they know that there is no gun in that house. Right.

207
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.480
And you do that in Texas. There's a good chance. There's a gun in that house.

208
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.130
A hundred percent. Yeah. Even the liberals.

209
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.990
<v 0>If you don't have a gun, take one of mine out a gun.</v>

210
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.560
<v 1>So, so that's important and interesting point. The other,</v>

211
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.350
the other good statistical analysis to do is okay, well,

212
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.670
when there's high amount of concealed carry, what does that do to crime rates?

213
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.760
And, and the correlation is there's less crime. Okay. Now,

214
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.070
now it's not fair to say that's a causation. That would be,

215
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.030
it would be intellectually dishonest, but it's an important co-relation to know.

216
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.590
It's also important to note, okay.

217
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.010
Per capita places like Switzerland in Israel have far,

218
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.910
far more gun ownership than we do. People don't realize that. Is that true?

219
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.180
Oh yeah. I wouldn't switch. I wouldn't come in here and lie to you.

220
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.580
<v 0>I know, but I'm stunned as a retort.</v>

221
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.560
<v 1>Because of the, now, now somebody would counter-argue in that. So say know,</v>

222
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:54.280
those are, those are government weapons to people. Yeah. Fine.

223
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.240
But they still are with the people like the people have the guns. Okay.

224
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:02.510
And they're at a rate higher than the United States. And there's like, yeah.

225
00:12:02.511 --> 00:12:02.771
Yeah.

226
00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:07.600
But that's how they stay neutral so that they have almost no crime,

227
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.270
almost no crime Israel to almost no crime. Um,

228
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.540
except for the obvious issues that Israel has in general with the Palestinian

229
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.970
Israeli conflict. But as it does a criminal act,

230
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:18.820
like they have very little crimes, like this is interesting.

231
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:23.080
So you combine that with what we know about concealed carry data here in the

232
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:26.020
United States, you know, how do you solve this problem?

233
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.790
The other thing to think about is, um, the, the vast majority,

234
00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:35.320
over 50% of all gun crime, it happens in like 2% of all counties.

235
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.410
So it's highly concentrated. You can, you can.

236
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.610
So as we look to solve this problem, like we,

237
00:12:40.611 --> 00:12:42.880
we do have to really peel back some layers here,

238
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:46.930
like who is committing to the crop, where is it happening? Why is it happening?

239
00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.840
Um, you know, we can attack the tools, but it's just,

240
00:12:49.841 --> 00:12:53.110
it's so far from self-evident that that would work again, going back to ARS,

241
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.180
they're responsible for less than 3% of gun deaths.

242
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:59.410
And also let's say you banned them. Are you actually stopping 3% of gun deaths?

243
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.170
No. Cause why don't they just use another gun?

244
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.680
Why don't they use a different weapon, one of these, a truck, like they can use,

245
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.170
if they want to kill, they can kill the,

246
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:11.050
the horror that we're seeing is that they like to kill this way.

247
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.220
And maybe that's w why is that? And again, I go back to Columbine.

248
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.920
It all started with that. And that's interesting. We should look at that.

249
00:13:17.921 --> 00:13:20.050
And like, what is driving people to like that?

250
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:24.990
<v 0>Well, I think there are a lot of people. I mean, if you look at mass shootings,</v>

251
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.780
a lot of these people, when you read their description,

252
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.170
they're very disenfranchised. They're very angry.

253
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.760
And when you're disenfranchised and very angry, there's like an archetype,

254
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.061
right?

255
00:13:36.061 --> 00:13:39.930
There's an image that you have in your mind of shooting all these people that

256
00:13:39.931 --> 00:13:41.880
wronged you. I mean, this is a.

257
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.330
<v 1>It goes back to our victim hood conversation or blame somebody else.</v>

258
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.620
<v 0>And then the real conversation is how many of these people are on psychotropic</v>

259
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.260
drugs and what are those, what are those drugs?

260
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.750
And what are the effects that those drugs have on people? Well,

261
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.270
when you look at the numbers, it's stunning.

262
00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.710
Whether it's anti-anxiety medications or SSRS or amphetamines,

263
00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:04.470
or whether it's whatever they're on,

264
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:08.910
that alters the chemical frequency or the camera,

265
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.380
or the biological structure of your brain in terms of like what chemicals are in

266
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.910
there, serotonin dopamine,

267
00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:20.180
these speeds that so many kids are on Adderall and

268
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.560
various types of speed. That's tough.

269
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.230
Radically changes the way you look at the world. Yeah.

270
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.360
How many of those drugs contribute or are a

271
00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:33.630
factor in these mass killings?

272
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.360
I don't know if correlation equals causation,

273
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.220
but I do know the correlation is phenomenally high. Yeah. I mean,

274
00:14:41.221 --> 00:14:42.170
I think it's enough. Well.

275
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.360
<v 1>His homes, things like that. Sure. Let's, let's start analyzing it.</v>

276
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.650
<v 0>In cells, which is a new word, involuntary celibates. Do you know about, huh?</v>

277
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.590
You didn't know about that. I taught you about entails.

278
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.690
<v 1>You just look amazing.</v>

279
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.291
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

280
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:01.640
There's whole groups online on message boards that they can't believe they can't

281
00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.440
get laid.

282
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.110
<v 1>Oh. And they just go voluntarily involuntary sites.</v>

283
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:09.130
They're just guys who can't get laid. Yeah. That's just a fancy word for that.

284
00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:11.950
Yeah. Let's not call them losers. That's what makes them crazy. If there's.

285
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:16.480
<v 0>A game there's winners and that a high school football</v>

286
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.020
quarterback was banging all the cheerleaders that guy's a winner.

287
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.350
It sucks that, yeah, that's true. But you know, yeah. It is unfair,

288
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.830
you know, I'm, I'm hoping genetic engineering fixes all that future,

289
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.570
but you know, this is what you're dealing with. A lot of times, it's these,

290
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.060
these guys that got a really roll the dice and that's,

291
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.260
there's no other way to describe it.

292
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.710
They they'd got handed a terrible hand of cards. Right.

293
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:46.570
And some of them are pilled up and angry and abused and they have

294
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:49.420
access to guns. And then next thing you know, there's a mass.

295
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.840
<v 1>Shooter, right. And then again, going back to the victim of a conversation,</v>

296
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.760
they, maybe they did were dealt a bad hand,

297
00:15:54.761 --> 00:15:57.430
but they also tell themselves the wrong story about why that is and who's to

298
00:15:57.431 --> 00:16:01.510
blame. And, uh, it's, it's that narrative just seeps within them.

299
00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:03.570
And it creates this. I mean, the drafts, we write it.

300
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.650
I is when Bernie Sanders was on here,

301
00:16:05.651 --> 00:16:07.210
there was one thing I thought I agreed with him on,

302
00:16:07.211 --> 00:16:10.270
which is we have to look at the effects of these drugs and like really what they

303
00:16:10.271 --> 00:16:12.670
are. I don't see anything wrong with that. I think that's.

304
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.370
<v 0>True. It's amazing how much blow back you get from that.</v>

305
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.390
And it's by people that want to look at the guns. They just want to say no, no,

306
00:16:18.391 --> 00:16:21.670
no, no. Why are you talking about psychotropic drugs? It's the guns? No,

307
00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:23.260
I'm talking about the guns too. I mean,

308
00:16:23.261 --> 00:16:26.350
I don't necessarily think that really angry,

309
00:16:26.351 --> 00:16:29.140
volatile people that have criminal records should have guns.

310
00:16:29.141 --> 00:16:32.800
I think they shouldn't. Right. So the guns are already out loud. Yes we do.

311
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.040
And we probably should, you know,

312
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.220
have some understanding of who you are before we give you a gun.

313
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.690
The real question is what,

314
00:16:40.691 --> 00:16:43.150
what is that understanding and how do we go about doing that?

315
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:46.780
And how do we keep people from making these incredibly rigid rules? I mean,

316
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.280
particularly regionally, right?

317
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:53.260
If you have states that decide to have incredibly rigid rules that preclude most

318
00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:55.660
people from having guns. Yeah. I mean,

319
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.930
that can be possible if they devise their own tests.

320
00:16:58.931 --> 00:17:02.260
And you're honest about your perspectives on things, and that's.

321
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.460
<v 1>The fear, and it's an honest fear to have, because what is the limit? You know,</v>

322
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.610
if you're on psychotropic drugs, seed, you be barred from having weapons,

323
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.000
of course not. Uh, you know, and, and, and, and how do you,

324
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:17.350
how do you manage that? And the way we do it now, again,

325
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.870
you have to have committed a crime of some sorts. So there's,

326
00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:24.400
there's other things too, if you abuse medication, if you abuse, uh,

327
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.900
yeah. Medication, then I think you're also, I think in according to federal law,

328
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.110
like you're, you're, you're barred from, from, from owning that, you know,

329
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:35.560
that's in the system, uh, I think dishonorable discharge from the military,

330
00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:36.430
things like that. So there's,

331
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.570
there's already a lot of standards that actually precludes you from buying a

332
00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:44.050
weapon. And, uh, there's, uh, there's,

333
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:48.190
there would be a very vigorous debate on how you add more standards to that.

334
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:48.840
Honorable.

335
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.970
<v 0>Discharge keeps you from buying a weapon. That's what I've.</v>

336
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.340
<v 1>Read. We can fact check that, but that's interesting.</v>

337
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:57.750
<v 0>I didn't know that when I thought you had to have a felony Hmm. Maybe,</v>

338
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:02.310
um, may make sense, but it's, there's no answers.

339
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.970
And this is the thing that domestic abuse too. I came up with from,

340
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.500
is there something Jamie? Yeah.

341
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.160
Dishonorable discharge and NFA. What's an NFA firearm, uh,

342
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.120
NFA.

343
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.310
<v 2>Refers to the national firearms act.</v>

344
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.190
So that's what ban like automatic weapons based.

345
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.290
<v 0>On yeah. General court martial conviction,</v>

346
00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:28.310
a person who was convicted of a crime that is punishable by imprisonment for,

347
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.670
uh, more than one year, including dishonorable discharge is prohibited.

348
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.130
<v 2>From yes. Okay.</v>

349
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.870
<v 0>That's what it is. So it is true. So if you're imprisoned, not just a dishonor.</v>

350
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.250
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. It would be, it would,</v>

351
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.850
there's a lot of people dishonorably discharged. They're probably not, not,

352
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.010
not violently. You know, they're not violent offenders.

353
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.700
<v 0>[Inaudible] talking to you talking to Bernie and talking to Tulsi,</v>

354
00:18:49.701 --> 00:18:53.150
talking to everybody. Nobody has a solution. I mean, well,

355
00:18:53.151 --> 00:18:55.760
all the brightest minds that are thinking about this all the time,

356
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:58.670
no one has one thing that makes sense.

357
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.820
<v 1>Into a very deep question about what our Cape.</v>

358
00:19:01.821 --> 00:19:04.070
And I think I've briefly touched on this before.

359
00:19:04.071 --> 00:19:07.550
Like why does government exist and what are we capable of solving and what needs

360
00:19:07.551 --> 00:19:10.940
to be solved by ourselves? You know, there are there in,

361
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.330
in what is just inherent to human nature and it's evil and we hate it and we

362
00:19:14.331 --> 00:19:18.410
don't want it to be there, but it is. And, and, and is it,

363
00:19:18.411 --> 00:19:21.500
is it appropriate for us to scream to our politicians as they save us?

364
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.150
And sometimes it is sometimes we can solve it. We should try, but we have to,

365
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.380
we have to do it with some kind of constrained vision as Thomas soul would put

366
00:19:30.381 --> 00:19:32.330
it about what is possible.

367
00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:36.000
And then let's be reasonable about what is possible and, and, and,

368
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.700
and hit those two categories. I said,

369
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:42.080
are we infringing on the rights of everyone, uh, for the sake of doing this,

370
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.410
and second, is it going to actually solve the problem?

371
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.270
And those are very important questions.

372
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.110
And if we don't frame the debate within those, I think we're, we're, we're,

373
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.470
we're not doing, we're not doing justice to the, to the problem itself.

374
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.790
<v 0>True. But again,</v>

375
00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.800
no one seems to have any logical course,

376
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.790
any logical clear path, like this is how we're gonna reduce gun violence.

377
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.310
This is how we're going to stop mass shootings. I mean,

378
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:12.140
other than arming all these public places, I was in Rome recently. And,

379
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.090
uh, when you go there, it's stunning. It's military vehicles guys with guns,

380
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:21.080
just strapped, ready to rock, just standing by yeah. All over the place.

381
00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.470
And it was like, used to be that way. No, it didn't. And I was like, wow,

382
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.400
this is a very, uh, it's, you know,

383
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.250
you're trying to enjoy yourself when you're on vacation,

384
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.670
you checking all these ancient buildings. And then you're like, oh, guns,

385
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:38.630
military tank, look at that, you know? Yeah. And it's.

386
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:44.540
<v 1>I wish it wasn't that way. Yeah. You know, and, uh, but again,</v>

387
00:20:44.541 --> 00:20:47.030
like w you know, you're right. We don't, we,

388
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.540
we haven't come up with perfect solutions.

389
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.390
We have some ideas that I think would mitigate these threats. And we've been,

390
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:55.200
we've discussed those at length. Uh, but none of.

391
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.720
<v 0>Them seem tangible. Everything seems like, just talk.</v>

392
00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.740
<v 1>Well, apps act that I talked about, I think is perfectly tangible. Again,</v>

393
00:21:01.741 --> 00:21:05.460
it's not a, they won't solve everything, but it mitigates something, I think,

394
00:21:05.461 --> 00:21:07.110
armed security at schools,

395
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.540
I think certainly mitigates things as far as school safety goes. So I don't,

396
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.780
I don't, I don't think it's just talk. I think those are tangible things. And I,

397
00:21:14.781 --> 00:21:17.840
I think they're perfectly reasonable. Um, you know.

398
00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.410
<v 0>We're so reluctant to think that we need armed guards at school,</v>

399
00:21:22.411 --> 00:21:24.630
and I understand it. And I'm thinking about it myself more.

400
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:28.380
So really what it's going to take is armed guards at school.

401
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.120
<v 1>I went to high school in Bogota, Columbia. So we had armed like a lot.</v>

402
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:37.733
<v 0>[Inaudible] tomato.</v>

403
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.600
<v 1>Oil, business, oil, oil, petroleum engineer. Yeah. So we moved to my,</v>

404
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.740
my life growing up was between Houston and overseas back and forth.

405
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:51.450
That'd be very bizarre. Yeah. It was fun. I mean, I don't regret a minute of it.

406
00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:56.190
It can be hard at times. Um, moving around a lot, it used to be better.

407
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.110
It's not bad. I'll do an interview in Spanish.

408
00:21:58.111 --> 00:22:01.470
So it's really not bad by any means, but it's not great.

409
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.900
<v 0>So you can go into a Taqueria and hang.</v>

410
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.950
<v 1>Out. We totally hang. I speak. I speak really well, conversational Spanish,</v>

411
00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.160
my Spanish, it's harder when I'm talking complex policy issues,

412
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.130
because I didn't learn that kind of Spanish. Right, right, right. So, but yeah,

413
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:15.870
I have pretty good. Yeah.
