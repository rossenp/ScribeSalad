00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 1>Experience. Did you see the fight? No. Oh my God, dude.</v>

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.170
He's one of the greatest heavyweight fights of all time.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.750
One of the greatest boxing matches of all time. Yeah. Have you seen it yet?

5
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:11.340
Jamie? We can't.

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.050
<v 2>Hear you. I watched it live. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.670
<v 1>Yeah. Did you your pants?</v>

8
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
<v 2>Uh, no. I was tired long day, so I was just sort of watching it.</v>

9
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.890
<v 1>What did you scream out at all? No, you don't scream out of things. Still do. I.</v>

10
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.560
<v 2>Will on occasion, but I got to be real riled up.</v>

11
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.003
<v 0>Buckeyes stuff. Right.</v>

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.010
<v 2>It depends really. I'll be honest.</v>

13
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:31.620
I'm trying to think of last time I did actually I'm with something happen.

14
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:34.290
I screamed on occasion. Kanye and Kim got divorced. No.

15
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.200
<v 1>When Kim showed up with that crazy mask on Dude,</v>

16
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.720
that fight had a screaming, we were screaming. It was,

17
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.800
we had an awesome watching party. Yeah. So it was, uh, it was Phil.

18
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.670
It was a Laura bites and it was Tony and I, Jimmy.

19
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.653
<v 0>Been too low.</v>

20
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.220
<v 1>Joe Moscow, all these friends of Tony's and Tony's family.</v>

21
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.850
And it was amazing. It was, uh, it was, uh, you know,

22
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.460
there's something about watching fights with a bunch of people.

23
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.250
It's very festive, you know, when everyone's screaming and cheering on,

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.160
it's like, it's more exciting. It's like, you got a small crowd.

25
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.770
It's almost like you're watching it live when you are watching live.

26
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.410
But you're also like watching it in a small crowd. Yeah.

27
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.340
<v 0>It was cool.</v>

28
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.030
Cause like we go to a lot of cities on a lot of different nights and there's

29
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.650
never a boxing match like that.

30
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:21.660
Like we don't ever really do a viewing party like that,

31
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.230
but it was so fitting that we were to me that we were an hour away from

32
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:29.160
Youngstown, which is like a real boxing city, boom, boom,

33
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:32.970
and Kelly Pavlik and all those greats, uh, that came out of there.

34
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.040
<v 1>Be able to watch that fight live and to catch it live because it was so good.</v>

35
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.850
It was so crazy. It was so action filled. I mean,

36
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:44.580
it was amazing from Tyson fury,

37
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.910
knock and Wilder down early to Wilder looking like he was done.

38
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.680
I just right-hand boom. He had Tyson fury on co weird street.

39
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.720
Look at how that conscious look at all that.

40
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.720
That's what they call it because you don't know what's going on. It's odd.

41
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.200
It's a word for OD. It's an old, it's an old saying it's nothing to a gay folks.

42
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.650
Look at this. Boom. Look at this punch. Look at the fat. Watch his fat ripper.

43
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.030
Oh wow. Crazy bro. That's how hard Deontay Wilder punches.

44
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:09.864
Let me see that again.

45
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.520
Cause that is there's maybe one or two other humans that have ever lived that

46
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.870
can punch as hard as this guy, these, without a doubt,

47
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:17.190
one of the hardest punches of all time.

48
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.280
So he smashes Tyson fury while he's getting his kicked,

49
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.490
smashes him with his right hand, the fourth round. Look at that fat roll down.

50
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.430
Look at that fat. Look at it rolled down. I mean,

51
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.150
that's the shock waves that ripple through his head. Most human beings,

52
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.300
right there, a going out most human beings, shedding them.

53
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.610
And then he hits him again and clubs him to the ground there.

54
00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.960
He hit him behind the ear. He he's a murderous puncher, but the,

55
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:42.750
the level of skill was so evident.

56
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.140
The difference is Tyson fury is a masterful boxer.

57
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.610
I mean he's masterful the that he did was amazing. And his strategy was amazing.

58
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.960
Just stay glued to Deontay where on them, hang on them,

59
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.100
make them work. And just, just you just drag them deeper and deeper,

60
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.230
deeper into these horrible waters filled with crocodiles.

61
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.260
And that's what he did. And almost got knocked out doing it.

62
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.660
That's how dangerous Wilder is while there is like the opposite of Ooh,

63
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.590
sick, like [inaudible] is like this insane boxer.

64
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.480
Who's this insane footwork in motion and Wilder kind of looks awkward at

65
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:20.980
times, but if he hits you once you're.

66
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.850
Even if you're the one of the greatest boxes of all time, like Tyson fury,

67
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:26.500
if you're one of the gray he's, without a doubt,

68
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.350
one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever six foot dine,

69
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.420
277 pounds and lightning fast for a

70
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:37.870
guy that big, he moves so well. He moves his jabs.

71
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.950
<v 0>I mean, isn't it crazy destiny? What are the odds that,</v>

72
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.930
that guy who could be Paul Jenkins or Mike Smith just as

73
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.140
easily. His name is Tyson fury.

74
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.730
A heavyweight God is named Tyson fury.

75
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.610
What are the odds of that? It's amazing. Like Mike Tyson,

76
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.930
one of the goats fury six, nine.

77
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.020
<v 1>Crazy greatest name of all time. Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.120
<v 0>That's like, that's like a great comedian.</v>

79
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.040
Literally his parents named him like funny pants Smith or something joking.

80
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.440
Hey, we know a joking.

81
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.720
<v 1>Well, his whole family was into fighting.</v>

82
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.990
Like he was learning how to box one time. He was a small, small boy.

83
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.700
Like he's always known how to box

84
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.090
Deontay Wilder didn't even take up boxing until he was 19 and Deontay Wilder

85
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:32.590
won a bronze medal in the Olympic games a year and a half after boxing.

86
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.860
Wow. He's a special talent. Just,

87
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.720
just insane power.

88
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.640
But the difference in the level of understanding of where to be and where not to

89
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:43.600
be, how to move,

90
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:48.430
how to have a faint and how to draw reactions is set traps the differences

91
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.140
out of this world. But Deontay hits so hard. It almost didn't matter.

92
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.400
It almost didn't matter.

93
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.940
The Tyson fury was so much more skillful and so much slicker with so much more

94
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.780
experience. Tyson fury hits so hard that it almost didn't matter.

95
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.370
<v 0>My dad's girlfriend had her head in her hands.</v>

96
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.960
After that round we're fear, he got knocked down twice. It was crazy.

97
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.740
Cause she just like, was she felt bad for this guy that was getting beat up on.

98
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.480
And I touched her shoulder and I go,

99
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:19.570
that guy is going to come back and win this fight. And she goes, really.

100
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.033
<v 1>You might've been wrong.</v>

101
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.320
<v 0>I could have easily been wrong, but now you're talking.</v>

102
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.210
Now I know what the hell is going on.

103
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.660
<v 1>Jack. No one knew Jack. And that fight when he got dropped,</v>

104
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.580
we all thought it was over. I was like, oh my God, he's. Cause he got hit hard.

105
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.220
You could tell like when he got up, he was not really there.

106
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.920
And then when he got clubbed in the back of the head and fell down again or

107
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.980
behind the ear and fell down again, I was like, oh my God.

108
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.500
But then he came back. He did come back.

109
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.800
The craziest comeback ever was him in the 12th round of the first fight.

110
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.580
That was the craziest that's nuts. That didn't even make sense.

111
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.830
But there was some controversy about this fight.

112
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.860
And one of the controversies was the extremely counts.

113
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.230
When a Tyson ferry went down, Cormier,

114
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.630
I believe fairly benefited from crazy slow count.

115
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:04.910
That's right after being knocked down by Wilder,

116
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.620
Daniel Cormier believes the referee made a bad call in the fourth round versus a

117
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.830
fury versus Wilder three. Well he's correct. This is what happened.

118
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.810
The count is supposed to the referee is supposed to go one,

119
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:18.830
two when the guy goes down.

120
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.750
But if for any reason he has to interrupt the count because like there like

121
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:25.400
another, the fighter, the, the other,

122
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.580
the opponent needs to be told to go to the neutral corner.

123
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.620
You're supposed to pick up the count where the ringside counter has it.

124
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.520
So there's a guy who's counting ringside and he'll keep the count going.

125
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.930
So if you are at one two, and then you like go to a neutral corner,

126
00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.310
that guy is supposed to be like 3, 4, 5. That should,

127
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.570
but he didn't. He went back to it three, four,

128
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:53.390
but the guy had already been down for a couple of seconds without a doubt.

129
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.560
It was a long count. That's.

130
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:57.950
<v 3>The problem with boxing though. That's what people have a problem with.</v>

131
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.600
That's like considered kind of like.

132
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.580
<v 1>It's one of two things.</v>

133
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.530
It's either a mistake and the guy made an error or maybe there's

134
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:10.970
a, I don't think, I don't think those there's a different law in new,

135
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.980
in Vegas. I don't think the law.

136
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.610
I don't think there's a rule that allows them to do that. I think it's an error.

137
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.840
It or corruption. Most likely an error.

138
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.990
Most likely the guy's panicking. He's in this huge fight.

139
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.230
I don't know how many big high profile fights.

140
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.490
I'm not that well-schooled on a boxing. Referees. I know a few of them.

141
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.950
I used to know more of them back in the day, but I know a few of them.

142
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.980
I didn't haven't I don't know if I've seen that guy work before,

143
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.320
so I don't know if he's panicking, but boxing's got.

144
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.170
<v 3>There should be somebody overseeing him though. That goes, Hey, you can't do.</v>

145
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.670
<v 1>Exactly. This should be a thing that's like loud. As a guy goes down,</v>

146
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.000
here's my take on it. It shouldn't be up to the referee account.

147
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.140
It shouldn't be, he can go 1, 2, 3,

148
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.620
or you can go one, two.

149
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.520
It shouldn't be that there should be a count, right? It should be 10 seconds.

150
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.900
And there should be like a LCD screen. And when a guy goes down,

151
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.210
it starts at 10. And when he, you know,

152
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.790
when it gets to or starts at one or zero or whatever.

153
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.780
<v 0>Japanese or Chinese, they do that. Right. Something like that.</v>

154
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:19.280
I feel like I've seen that before.

155
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.530
<v 1>In what? In boxing? I think.</v>

156
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.270
<v 0>I feel like it's a different thing. It's like a loud over the wan,</v>

157
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.440
but it's like Chinese.

158
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.990
<v 1>Well, I know they've done that on some boxing telecasts where you hear</v>

159
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.490
the ringside count.

160
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.630
I know that for a fact and I know guys have picked it up at certain.

161
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.790
Kelly picked it up at five six, but in this case there was without a doubt,

162
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.290
like a gap where he was directing some stuff inside the ring.

163
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.800
And then he came back and picked up the count. So it was definitely long.

164
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.710
The question is could fury have gotten up maybe,

165
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:59.130
but could he have gotten up two seconds earlier, three seconds earlier,

166
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:02.130
whatever the extra count was and could Wilder have jumped on him and hurt him

167
00:09:02.131 --> 00:09:05.490
again? Yeah, that's possible too. You don't know. I mean,

168
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:09.060
when a guy gets to that hurt, if you give them any extra time is a bonus.

169
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.490
Any three seconds, four seconds. That makes a big difference.

170
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:14.700
That's between the world's spinning and all of a sudden the world's not spending

171
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.150
any.

172
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.610
<v 0>Well, I noticed that ref kept doing that. Put your gloves up.</v>

173
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.130
Now walk towards me with your gloves up now.

174
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:22.680
And then he would wipe the gloves like he did at each free.

175
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.410
At least he kept it sort of consistent, but that's still.

176
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.290
<v 1>Yeah. That's standard. Cause you got to find out if a guy,</v>

177
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.870
if a guy goes down and then you go put your gloves on,

178
00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:33.120
walk towards me and he walks towards you and he's like, start stumbling,

179
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.880
stop the fight. Right? Because you don't know, it's just,

180
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.460
it's just guesswork and it's all subjective. Right?

181
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.380
One referee will stop a fight when a guy is getting up and another referee will

182
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:47.340
let it go. There's a lot of referees who would have stopped this fight earlier.

183
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.910
There's quite a few referees where when Tyson fury was battering,

184
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.510
Deontay Wilder, they would stop the fight. You know?

185
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.920
And this was a Wilder's argument about the first fight or the second fight.

186
00:09:58.921 --> 00:09:59.850
When he did get stopped,

187
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.480
he felt like he could have kept going judging by this fight.

188
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.380
He probably is correct. He probably could have kept going,

189
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.650
but he might've gotten knocked out there, but he could have kept going.

190
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.140
Like in this fight, it looked like in that one round,

191
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:17.460
I think it was the second or Tyson fury drop Deontay Wilder and he barely

192
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:19.560
survived and he made it to the, to the end bell.

193
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.340
What if that was the beginning of the round? You know what if, what if you know,

194
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.860
who knows? It's it's you never know.

195
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.250
So could he have gone on from the second fight when they stopped the fight?

196
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.870
Probably, you know, maybe it was like for his health, that is a corner,

197
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.280
threw the towel and stopped the fight.

198
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:37.140
Maybe they know him and they know how tough he is.

199
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.500
That's what you see in this fight. You see how tough he is,

200
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.730
how much pain and how much punishment he endured and still was dangerous.

201
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.040
Still hurt fury. And still heard him again after that. Right? He,

202
00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:52.650
he heard him one other time later. Didn't drop him, but hurt him.

203
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.910
So you heard him on a few occasions, but when he went out, man,

204
00:10:56.911 --> 00:11:01.680
he went out bad that he went out, but that's a bad knockout. That was a bat.

205
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:02.940
And Tyson fury said it best. He goes,

206
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:06.630
that's the kind of knockout that can end a career. Yeah. I mean, it might not,

207
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.620
but that was a bad knockout show. Show the knockout,

208
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.810
he wings a left hook,

209
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.550
misses it and steps in with a right hand that just spins his head around.

210
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.020
It was.

211
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.830
<v 0>Yeah. Hitting the map, like woke him up. He was out on his way down.</v>

212
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.200
<v 1>And when we were watching them, we were like,</v>

213
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.420
this is the greatest fight I've ever seen in my life. Yeah.

214
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.913
<v 0>So fun.</v>

215
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.940
<v 1>The thing is it's like, how does he comes back from that?</v>

216
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:34.830
Like he's 35.

217
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:37.350
I think his trainer said he doesn't want them to even think about it.

218
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.440
He just wants him to do nothing. But rest don't even think about boxing,

219
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.790
just take a rest, you earned it. Like let's just, don't don't get all anxious,

220
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.550
anxious, and ramp up for the rematch. Cause that's what he did for this,

221
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:48.211
this fight.

222
00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:52.050
Apparently when he got beaten in the second fight and he felt like there was all

223
00:11:52.051 --> 00:11:56.440
sorts of controversy attached to it and it got real ugly with the accusations.

224
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:00.400
Like he accused all, but accused his trainer of being involved in it.

225
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.970
It was his trainer who was mark Breland. Watch this again. Look at this.

226
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.620
Watch the end, the left. Here's the right. Boom. I mean bro,

227
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.210
Al that is crazy. That is a crazy knockout.

228
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.020
And in a fight. Look at one more time. Say it again.

229
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.540
He hits him with a right hand. He knows he's got them hurt. Let them go.

230
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.390
Left-hand here's the left misses with? Well that boom.

231
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.210
He clipped him with the left too, but the right was perfect.

232
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.380
What a fight. When it was over, we were like, holy. What a rollercoaster ride?

233
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.670
Well, one of the most exciting boxing matches of all time, for sure.

234
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.540
<v 0>Yeah. Crazy. That a guy is six, nine going up against the guy.</v>

235
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.440
6, 6, 7. True heavyweight. Yeah. Crazy. True.

236
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.160
<v 1>The other thing was Deontay while there was 2 38 for that fight,</v>

237
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:53.020
which is the heaviest of his career. He was 2 0 9 for their first fight. Yeah.

238
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.980
And it's like, you know, is that good?

239
00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.130
Is it good to put all that extra weight on like maybe,

240
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.820
maybe it helped him fight him off. Maybe it hindered his movement.

241
00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.880
If you could teach Deontay Wilder, footwork, like real foot look well,

242
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.960
how to bounce and move and slide in,

243
00:13:10.961 --> 00:13:15.550
slide out and not be awkward at all to be slick God with that punch.

244
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.140
It's almost like the punches.

245
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.730
It's almost like it hinders a fighter in a certain way have that kind of power

246
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.620
because you know, all you have to do is hit a guy.

247
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:28.090
So all you're thinking about doing is hitting him and it worked 49,

248
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.630
41 times he's knocked out 41 guys or 40,

249
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.480
I think he's like 41. Yeah.

250
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.800
He had one decision out of his 41 victories, which is crazy.

251
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:41.080
That's the craziest record in the history of the sport.

252
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.180
There's not a single guy. That's knocked out as many guys as Deontay Wilder has.

253
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.020
If you could teach that guy how to move like Tyson fury does.

254
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:52.840
If you could teach that guy how to pretend he doesn't have any power,

255
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.800
like just really develop real boxing skills, just move.

256
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.090
And just almost pretend you can't break an egg, just be in the right position,

257
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.010
always and just touch people, just touch because he hits so hard, man.

258
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.520
But people that have that kind of power for whatever reason,

259
00:14:09.521 --> 00:14:11.680
they always not always,

260
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.860
but a lot of times they rely on it because it's so extraordinary.

261
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.570
They just know that all they have to do is land.

262
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:20.650
That one shot the guys who were like the masterful boxers. They never have the,

263
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.690
like the Julio Cesar Chavez is of the world.

264
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.610
He's one of the most masterful boxers ever,

265
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.600
but he never was like a one punch guy. He would break guys down.

266
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:31.630
He would very rarely stop someone with one punch in the first round.

267
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.070
Most of the fights,

268
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:36.610
it was just him just beating the out of people like super technically.

269
00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:40.780
And he would just move in and throw shots and every shot was coming your way was

270
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:43.720
accurate. And eventually it break fighters down, smash them.

271
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.920
But if you can get a guy like Deontay Wilder to pretend he doesn't have power

272
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.650
and to learn how to box like a Julio, Cesar Chavez,

273
00:14:50.651 --> 00:14:52.450
he definitely one of the greatest fighters of all time.
