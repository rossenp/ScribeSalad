1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.240
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That's why I get, so, I mean, if you,</v>

2
00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:08.760
Barack Obama's entire cabinet, uh, came from an email from city group.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.300
Okay.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.200
So people trying to say that somehow corruption started on January 20th when

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.520
the not 2017 are fooling themselves. And that's what I'm fighting against. Yes.

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.020
On my.

7
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.070
<v 1>You are. And you're one of the only people doing that.</v>

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.830
You're one of the only people that are online, that, that you, you're not,

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.110
you're not obligated to, to chill for the left. You're not,

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.990
you're not doing it, but everybody else seems to be.

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.670
I don't mean everybody else. If you're one of the people that are not like, you,

12
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:36.590
Joe Rogan. There's.

13
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.990
<v 0>Just a handful of people who are not Joe. There's so few.</v>

14
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.700
<v 1>There's so few that are calling out people in the democratic party for what</v>

15
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:44.461
really is going on.

16
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:49.060
Like I was infuriated when people that I knew that I was friends with were

17
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:52.380
trying to tell me that, that Hillary Clinton was a good choice.

18
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.420
And that's the same choice. I'm like, look,

19
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.740
I don't know if she's murdered people,

20
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.820
but I know that I worried that she's murdered people. That's a real,

21
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.650
I really wonder like this Seth, Seth rich.

22
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
<v 0>I know, first of all, just leave. You don't even need to.</v>

23
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.210
<v 1>Go there. You know, you there's so many other things. There's.</v>

24
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.770
<v 0>So many other things that we'd know for a.</v>

25
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.370
<v 1>Fact, the Clinton foundation, for instance.</v>

26
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.850
<v 0>So the Iraq war, I I'm old enough Joe,</v>

27
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:20.250
to remember when being for the Iraq war was a disqualifier in a democratic

28
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:23.680
primary I'm that's, that's where I'm from. That's why she lost to Barack Obama.

29
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.640
The first God time she ran. Right.

30
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.960
And all of a sudden we're supposed to now people like Joey Behar says that was a

31
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:32.120
long time ago. Forget about it. Why don't you go tell that to a soldiers, uh,

32
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.760
to a mother who's got a dead soldier. Why don't you go tell 'em at,

33
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.200
just died in illegal war?

34
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.960
Why don't you go tell that to a couple hundred thousand Iraqi who are dead get

35
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:44.350
over. It was a long time ago. You. Anyway. So I remember when that, that, uh,

36
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.230
also, uh, the bill Clinton was no friend to the working man. In fact,

37
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.030
he was this demise starting of the demise of this country. So at bill,

38
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.431
you know,

39
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:57.750
Ronald Reagan scared the out of the Democrat so much that he decided to become

40
00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:01.030
like them. And so what bill Clinton did was he got in bed with wall street,

41
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:05.260
the military industrial complex pharma health insurance, and the Koch brothers.

42
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.780
He started a thing called the democratic leadership council with Al gore.

43
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:12.060
They had executives from the Koch brothers on the democratic leadership council.

44
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.620
They completely turned their back on the working man.

45
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.860
And what happens when you have two parties that are in bed with management,

46
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.100
you get Donald Trump and that's exactly what happened. They gutted welfare.

47
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.690
At the same time, they explored the prison. Popul called black kids,

48
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.490
super predators. At the same time they did NAFTA.

49
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.650
And then they deregulated wall street,

50
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:33.210
which crashed the economy within 10 years. That's what Democrats did.

51
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.610
Democrats did that Ronald Reagan could only dream about in his wet dreams.

52
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.410
They couldn't pass NAFTA. George Bush couldn't pass NAFTA.

53
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:42.010
It took bill Clinton to do it.

54
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.080
Bill Clinton gave the cover to the other for Democrats to go along with it.

55
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.760
So that was the beginning of the end for the working class in America. In fact,

56
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.760
now, you know,

57
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.880
I wouldn't vote for Hilary Clinton and that's why a lot of people on the left,

58
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.560
uh, came after me and they still do.

59
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.960
<v 1>Well. It was confusing to me that you were saying, Hey,</v>

60
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:01.360
if you want to vote for a real progressive, what about Jill Stein? Yeah.

61
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:01.880
If you vote.

62
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 0>For a party vote, here's a pro program.</v>

63
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.360
You actually agree with the great new deal, right? So.

64
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.000
<v 1>And we Don, but everybody's like, no, that's a, you're throwing away your vote.</v>

65
00:03:09.001 --> 00:03:11.320
Like how, how are you throwing away your vote?

66
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.840
<v 0>So we all know for a fact,</v>

67
00:03:12.841 --> 00:03:16.880
because of the Wiki leagues emails that Hillary Clinton had a thing called the

68
00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:21.270
PI Piper strategy, which what she told her minions in the press,

69
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.830
please prop up Donald Trump, prop him up.

70
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.910
Why did she want Donald Trump to be propped up?

71
00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:29.470
Cuz she wanted to run against Donald Trump because she knew that, uh,

72
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.630
she was so repulsive to most of the country.

73
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.390
She needed someone who was more repulsive than her turns out.

74
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.310
That was a bad calculation. That was terrible calculation.

75
00:03:37.311 --> 00:03:40.180
So that's called the PI Piper strategy and everybody, that's why the,

76
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.940
you turn on Chris Hayes and he would show Donald Trump's empty podium for an

77
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:45.460
hour instead of a Bernie Sanders.

78
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.260
And then he wags his finger at people with no money and no power for not voting

79
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:52.500
for a cist war Moner like Hillary Clinton. Who just, why,

80
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.580
why do you think the people in Michigan wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton?

81
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.090
Maybe cuz she put half of them in prison because she passed NAFTA and rock Obama

82
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.330
was trying to sell TPP at the top of his lungs. At the same time,

83
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.290
she was trying to get working people to vote for her.

84
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.650
They know what the was going on and that's why if the country doesn't vote,

85
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.410
but you're gonna wa their finger at the people who actually do vote,

86
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.170
who come out and vote their conscience and they don't prop up evil.

87
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.050
You know what? The voting lesser of two evil gets you, Donald Trump.

88
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.841
<v 1>Well,</v>

89
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:25.280
there's also a really sneaky thing that happens where you have two parties.

90
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.000
And one of 'em you think of as this conservative war monering party,

91
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:33.840
which automatically makes the other party, the, the enemy of that. Yeah, but.

92
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.600
<v 0>They're not, they're not, well, we have two pro-war parties and that's the,</v>

93
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:40.360
there's not an opposition party. They oppose Trump on the most ridiculous bull.

94
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.751
It,

95
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:45.470
they just voted for an extra 160 billion to go to the war machine 160 billion.

96
00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:48.270
Let's remember Bernie Sanders wanted to pay for free college,

97
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:52.710
which was somewhere around 65 billion. So, and everybody said, he's crazy.

98
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.950
How you gonna pay for that? They just did that in a blink of an eye,

99
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.950
they passed 160 billion to a war machine that we don't have an enemy to fight.

100
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.100
You know, Russia spend 65 billion a year on their military.

101
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.780
There are paper tiger. We got no enemies out there.

102
00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:07.900
We have to keep inventing them. And the last,

103
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.900
the last enemy they invented was ISIS. ISIS. I don't know if we're supposed to,

104
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.300
our pants over them, Joe, because they have kitchen knives.

105
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.220
They'll cut your head off with a kitchen knife.

106
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.060
That's what I'm supposed to be afraid of. What the, what it's it's it's amazing.

107
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.730
How can keep us scared so they can keep perpetual war going.

108
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.210
This is an or willing and nightmare.

109
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.450
And the Democrats right now should be screaming about the Pentagon budget,

110
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.890
but they're not screaming about it because they're complicit. They're in it.

111
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.090
And that's what's wrong with this country. That's why we can't have nice things.

112
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.810
So when, when they tell you that you, we are broke and we can't afford stuff,

113
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.880
they don't mean we can't afford trillion dollar wars, trillion, dollar bank,

114
00:05:44.881 --> 00:05:47.800
bailout, billion, dollar oil subsidies, and prison construction.

115
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.840
That's not what they mean.

116
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.840
They mean we can't afford like healthcare or education or roads or bridges or

117
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:56.480
firemen or libraries or anything that makes your life better because whenever

118
00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:59.160
they need bombs, they got it. Hey, we're broke for social security.

119
00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:01.920
We're broke for Medicare. How about for bombs? Oh, we got bomb money.

120
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.853
We keep it right to our.

121
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.280
<v 1>Drinking running because we're not really in a war in the sense of like world</v>

122
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.600
war II or world war I we're in this weird war of

123
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.000
it's like a calculated war. They're all.

124
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.870
<v 0>Economic wars, Joe. They're all. So we went into Iraq for of the, for the oil.</v>

125
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.830
Libya is because he wanted to go off the Petro.

126
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.990
<v 1>Dollar, but it is stunning. How much funding,</v>

127
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.230
this kind of war gets versus all the different social programs that we need in

128
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:29.070
this country. Yes. Infrastructure programs.

129
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.630
<v 0>Yes. We, and, and people always think like, well,</v>

130
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.870
how are you gonna pay for that? We don't have to spend any more money.

131
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.950
We can actually spend lend less money. We don't have to spend.

132
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.100
And 750 billion a year on a military. That's bloated.

133
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.420
We have thousand bases around the con around the world.

134
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.660
We don't even know how many bases there are because lots of 'em are secret.

135
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.180
<v 1>So what do you say to the argument that we need them in order to stay safe?</v>

136
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.500
It's not true. &lt;laugh&gt; that's the big argument, right?

137
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.660
The big argument is this is the way we we've destroyed ISIS.

138
00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:57.060
Cuz ISIS was on their way to building up invent.

139
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.330
<v 0>We invented Al-Qaeda and then we invented ISIS. We certainly.</v>

140
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.050
<v 1>Aided in their development, their.</v>

141
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.850
<v 0>Development. And we, then we, we directly funded them. We.</v>

142
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.770
<v 1>Know the whole Mujahadeen story,</v>

143
00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.610
which was Osama bin Laden was our guy that's guy. He was, our guy was.

144
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.890
<v 0>He was an anti, anti Russian, uh,</v>

145
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:19.240
anti Russian freedom fighter is what they call bin Laden. Yeah.

146
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.560
And then all of a sudden they didn't need him anymore. So why?

147
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.560
And we're still in Afghanistan, 17 years later, three more years,

148
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:27.840
that war gets a gold watch. And.

149
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.880
<v 1>What do they do? I mean, what, what do they do to get us out of there? I mean,</v>

150
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:35.840
literally what is, what is exit strategy? There is, there.

151
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.760
<v 0>Is no exit strategy, never was an exit strategy.</v>

152
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:39.830
There's no exit from the mid east. In fact,

153
00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.190
they just announced we're gonna be permanently in Syria. So, and by the way,

154
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:48.430
the Syrian war complete. Those gas attacks now have been completely debunked.

155
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:49.590
I didn't believe 'em the first time.

156
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.990
<v 1>So what happened during those gas attacks?</v>

157
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.910
<v 0>So what that's called a false flag.</v>

158
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.030
So what happens is they wanted the United States to come in on their side to

159
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.220
basad to overt the throw 'em right. And uh, so what they would do is a,

160
00:08:02.221 --> 00:08:05.220
they would do a gas attack on their own people and then blame it on Asad.

161
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.460
And then, uh, has.

162
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.260
<v 1>This been, this has been proven yes. That they did it.</v>

163
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.780
<v 0>Yes. And then, uh, Jesus Christ and the first time was in,</v>

164
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:16.740
I think 2013 and Barack Obama wanted to bomb. And uh, and I, I knew it was.

165
00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:17.843
Then. Do you.

166
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.970
<v 1>Remember when everybody freaked out about that? That.</v>

167
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.010
<v 0>He didn't bomb them? Yeah. Remember he didn't get to bomb them.</v>

168
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:24.050
Cause everybody was like, you. Yes. He goes,

169
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:27.210
let's put it to a vote in the Congress and the people don't want war. No.

170
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.330
So the people said, you. And he was like, Hmm, we're gonna do it anyway.

171
00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:32.250
Guess what? They did it anyway. They bombed, they,

172
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:36.290
they dropped so many bombs on Syria. They ran outta bombs. That's its fact.

173
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.330
Right? So the air force was out of bombs, which year was this? They did.

174
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:43.280
So was it 2015 that they dropped so many bombs in the mid east.

175
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:45.680
They ran outta bombs. That's just a fact. Look it up.

176
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.920
<v 1>Well, if you buy all these bombs, you, you gotta use them use 'em. I mean,</v>

177
00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.800
what are you gonna do with them? They're just gonna sit around.

178
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.680
And what if somebody accidentally sets one off while they in American soil, we.

179
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.200
<v 0>Don't want that. We can't have that happen. We can't have that. So,</v>

180
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.440
and here's the weird thing that the left is doing right now.

181
00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:04.720
They're attacking Donald Trump from the right. And what do I mean by that?

182
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.120
So when they want, so they say Donald Trump is a Putin puppet.

183
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.640
And the only way you can prove you're not a Putin puppet is you gotta bomb

184
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.150
somebody. You gotta bombs Syria. Remember that? They were like, oh,

185
00:09:16.151 --> 00:09:17.830
he's president today. Cuz he bombed Syria.

186
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.670
Remember that Brian Williams almost nutted in his pants.

187
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.790
<v 1>Well he, all he bombed was airstrips.</v>

188
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:26.750
<v 0>So that's what they're saying. Right? So they go, oh, oh they bombed airstrips.</v>

189
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.390
Oh you didn't, you bombed the old planes and not the new planes.

190
00:09:29.391 --> 00:09:32.350
So what that is, you're attacking Donald Trump from the right. Right.

191
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:35.820
Because left people are supposed to be for Daytona and you're supposed to be

192
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.260
anti-war and anti um, anti empire. Right.

193
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.260
So when you attack Donald Trump and oh, you didn't really bomb them,

194
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:44.500
you're attacking them from the right.

195
00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:47.580
You're saying he should be more alistic which is up.

196
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.100
<v 1>Well, it supports the argument that everything is circular, right.</v>

197
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:52.620
That as far right, as you get as far left, as you get,

198
00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:57.370
you really come to some sort of strange ideological point like zero point. That.

199
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.330
<v 0>Can't be true. But not in this instance because what's happening.</v>

200
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:01.810
There is corporate right ring.

201
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.730
Democrats are attacking Trump for not being right enough.

202
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.970
What you're talking about is where I'm at,

203
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:12.010
where I'm anti-war and then there's also anti-war anti intervention as people on

204
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:15.090
the right. So a lot of people voted for Donald Trump because of that,

205
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.800
because he, he said was an anti interventionist.

206
00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:19.160
He was gonna get us outta the middle east.

207
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.120
It was crazy to be there and bring our boys home and all.

208
00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.880
And that's why a lot of people did vote for Trump because of that. Right.

209
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.400
And um, and that's why, uh,

210
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.840
a lot of people said they felt more comfortable voting for Trump cuz he was cuz

211
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:33.760
Hillary actually promised more war in Syria than he did. And we, and,

212
00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.790
and that's turned out to be true, uh, because she wanted a no fly zone,

213
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:42.390
which means we're gonna shoot down a Russian jet. Are you crazy? Right. So, um,

214
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:47.030
I I'm on the I'm on the left.

215
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.030
Anti-war there's no anti-war movement in, in the country.

216
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.350
That's represented by a political party right now.

217
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:57.420
<v 2>I.</v>
