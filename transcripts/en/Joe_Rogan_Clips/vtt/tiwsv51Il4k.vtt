00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.690
<v 2>And this is the same guy that just passed this law in New York city,</v>

3
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:09.510
where you have to have a vaccine passport to go everywhere.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.980
You have to have a vaccine to go to a restaurant, to a gym,

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.570
to any place where people gather it is crazy. And meanwhile,

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.010
the vast per se,

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.930
the biggest percentage of people that don't have vaccines or haven't been

8
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.200
vaccinated are people of color. So this guy,

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.970
people of color and immigrants,

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.080
this is what he's always supposed to be pro you know,

11
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.440
pro people of color, pro diversity, pro immigration.

12
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.510
Those are the people that don't have vaccines.

13
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:43.770
And now you're precluding them from going to gyms and restaurants.

14
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.540
And what about the people working in the restaurants?

15
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:48.810
What about all these it's madness?

16
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:50.430
And then you have a bunch of people that are supporting it.

17
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.600
<v 0>Like, yay. Finally, meanwhile, you have science has coming out.</v>

18
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.820
There's legitimate articles. Jamie, I'll send this to you.

19
00:00:56.821 --> 00:01:01.440
Now there's legitimate because doctors have been sending me these things

20
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.190
and you know, this is neither pro nor con vaccine. I'm not,

21
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.290
this is not a judgment statement,

22
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.270
but imperfect vaccination can enhance the transmission of

23
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:16.830
highly virulent pathogens, right? So this is a scientific paper, um,

24
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.430
from 2015,

25
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840
that shows that

26
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.950
if here's it's, there's, there's one important quote,

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.370
vaccines that keep the host alive,

28
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.470
but still allow transmission can thus allow virulent strains

29
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:39.420
to circulate in a population.

30
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.520
So vaccines that don't kill the virus

31
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.120
vaccines that allow people like this is one of the things we're finding out

32
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.430
about what they're calling breakthrough cases, right?

33
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.260
So people who are vaccinated can still get COVID and they can still transmit

34
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:57.690
COVID is recently happened at the comedy store.

35
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.850
A vaccinated comedian gave COVID to like 12 different people to

36
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.370
comedy store. Some of them vaccinated, some of them,

37
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:09.840
not that situation where the vaccine just kind of

38
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:12.480
protects you from serious damage,

39
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.130
but D protects you from really being like badly, uh,

40
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.960
hospitalized or death.

41
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.850
But doesn't stop you from getting the virus can possibly lead to

42
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:25.770
more potent viruses.

43
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.000
So these people that are saying, oh,

44
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.930
it's these unvaccinated people that are responsible for the variants. Well,

45
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:36.150
there's actually scientific papers.

46
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.650
That point to the very sort of environment that we're

47
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:45.420
creating by having so many people vaccinated with a vaccine that

48
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.820
doesn't kill off the virus,

49
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.390
it actually can lead to more potent viruses.

50
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.580
Try finding that story anywhere. Other than doctors I'm,

51
00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.350
I'm getting a PhD sending me these things guys,

52
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:00.970
who won't speak about it publicly,

53
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.930
because they're worried about the blowback people who are physicians,

54
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.200
people who are even, even epidemiologists,

55
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.710
even people that deal with diseases and viruses they're concerned.

56
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.430
And they don't want to talk about it publicly because people call them

57
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.890
anti-vaccine, it's really why.

58
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.030
<v 1>Oh, it's wild because they've somehow managed.</v>

59
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.960
And when I say they meaning the political elite,

60
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.370
and then I think their established media representatives have somehow managed

61
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.630
to turn this into a political issue. Right. And

62
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.120
that's dangerous.

63
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.160
It's dangerous for any politician to play in that game where they're using

64
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:47.140
something as meaningful and possibly dangerous for the country

65
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.500
as political posturing or for two signaling. Right.

66
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.980
And you see it all the time because you see these guys are wearing their masks

67
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:55.510
for the camera, but then they take them off.

68
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.270
<v 0>So doing that yesterday, you see the video,</v>

69
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.760
she was no mask on hanging out with everybody.

70
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:01.990
And then they go to take a picture.

71
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.920
She puts the mask on and then takes it off after the pictures done, or.

72
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.330
<v 1>They can have parties, you know, what is it, uh, you know about Obama? Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:14.050
Obama's having that 700 guest party or whatever.

74
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.180
<v 0>Yeah. Because of, because of the pandemic, make it a little lighter, but.</v>

75
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.020
<v 1>You can't go to a gym in New York, right.</v>

76
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.590
Unless you have a vaccination card or you can't go out to eat, uh,

77
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.610
we're going to shut down small businesses. You can't go to a comedy club. Uh,

78
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.890
and I think it's it's rules for the,

79
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:37.420
and not for me scenario and people read right through that because

80
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.250
some people I think.

81
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.110
<v 0>Plotting it, which is terrifying. I know smart people that are applauding it.</v>

82
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.550
It's, it's so strange. And th the problem with applauding vaccine passports,

83
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.500
this is, this is part of the problem. They are not going to give that power up.

84
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.270
No, they're not going to,

85
00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.460
they're going to find a reason to continue to use that.

86
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.450
If they can figure out a way to force you into carrying papers,

87
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.490
into carrying something that lets you enter businesses or lets you do this,

88
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:08.440
or lets businesses open.

89
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.450
As soon as you give politicians power in any kind of power that didn't

90
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:17.500
exist previously, historically they don't relinquish that power.

91
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:19.480
They find new reasons to use it.

92
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.240
<v 1>Y I think that's the history of lawmaking and political power in the</v>

93
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.230
United States.

94
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.000
And I think that's why I tend to be bucketed in

95
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.170
conservatives because it means smaller government to me, right? There's,

96
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.890
there's multiple reasons why people classify themselves as that. Uh,

97
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.380
but I look at things and I look at the preservation of individual Liberty.

98
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.160
You know, how do I preserve more of my freedom?

99
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:50.230
Because I feel like I'm in a responsible adult.

100
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.600
And I feel like I'm going to raise responsible adults.

101
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:56.690
And I feel like I spend most of my time around responsible adults. Uh,

102
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.870
I don't, it's such a disconnect in, uh,

103
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.260
individual philosophy. When I find people that,

104
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.900
that are actively looking for ways that they can forfeit their

105
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.830
individual Liberty and handed over to somebody where they feel like they have a

106
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:19.570
better interest in running their life than they do. Right. And I,

107
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.860
I understand the balance between, uh, you know, we,

108
00:06:22.861 --> 00:06:26.810
we have to have certain laws and regulations that protect people against,

109
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.400
you know, overt dangers.

110
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.470
But I also understand your statement where I think politicians and I would say

111
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:35.870
lawmakers and, uh,

112
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.350
government bureaucrats have a really hard time

113
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:43.400
relinquishing control once they have it, because of.

114
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.150
<v 0>Yeah. It makes her job easier. They can just tell you to shut the up,</v>

115
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.120
do what I say. And you have to, you know,

116
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:52.520
you can't work anymore unless you do what I say.

117
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.070
That's essentially what the vaccine passport is. Right?

118
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.450
You can't do what you want to do unless you do what I want you to do.

119
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.890
I mean, Don lemon was talking about that openly on CNN. Yeah.

120
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.610
Don't have a vaccine. Can I go to the supermarket? Don't have a vaccine.

121
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.653
Can't go to work.

122
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.310
<v 1>It's so strange that people want to say things like that. Like,</v>

123
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:16.640
that's the thing that blows me away. Why do you, why do people want to?

124
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.390
Because of.

125
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.850
<v 0>Dumb, they're dumb. They don't understand history.</v>

126
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:22.550
They don't understand human beings. They don't understand human nature.

127
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.530
They don't understand the history of every single country that's ever

128
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:32.450
existed. Other than the United States up until 1776,

129
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.040
every country that has ever existed was run by

130
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:38.990
dictators. Right? All of them.

131
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.470
This is the first one where you had elected officials.

132
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:46.310
This is the first experiment in self-government that actually worked.

133
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.590
And he created the greatest superpower. The world's ever known.

134
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.260
It created the greatest cultural machine,

135
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.280
the greatest machine of art and creativity and innovation,

136
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.890
right here. And how did it do that?

137
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.710
It did it through freedom because when you give people freedom,

138
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.690
you let people do whatever the they want to do.

139
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.800
They actually find ways to succeed and grow and thrive.

140
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.680
But as soon as you put the boots to them, as soon as you tell them,

141
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.130
you have to do this, or you can't do that. You have to listen to me.

142
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:18.050
Now you have a mini dictator. You have one step away from a king.

143
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.160
You have a one step closer, you moving one step closer to dictatorship.

144
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.660
That's what the is happening.

145
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.700
That's what's going to happen with a vaccine passport.

146
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.610
That's what's gonna happen. If they close borders,

147
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.980
you can't enter New York city. Unless you have your papers.

148
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.840
You can't go to here. Unless you have that,

149
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.070
you can't get on a plane unless you do what I say. And people say, whoa,

150
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:38.510
it's all about protecting people from the, no, it's not.

151
00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:43.160
It's not because we've shown. This is a fact. It just a couple of months ago,

152
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.140
the idea of a breakthrough case was unheard of nobody heard of anybody

153
00:08:48.141 --> 00:08:51.410
catching COVID that had a vaccine, right? That was the whole idea.

154
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.780
You get a vaccine, you have to worry about it. Now we know,

155
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:58.020
not only do you get it, but you can spread it. And some people have died.

156
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.310
Apparently it's a small number. I don't know what the numbers are,

157
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.300
but I know that most people who get vaccinated when they do have the disease,

158
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:09.120
they have a better time of it than the people who are unvaccinated.

159
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.450
But where are the people out there calling for people to get healthy?

160
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.760
Where are the people out there calling for people to lose weight?

161
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:19.500
78% of the people in the ICU for COVID are obese 78%.

162
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.760
Where's that information being shared where someone who's a leader who gets on

163
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:27.180
TV and says, ladies and gentlemen, we've got to decrease our body mass.

164
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.890
We've got to decrease our fat.

165
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.290
We've got to make sure that people aren't overweight.

166
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.320
We've got to make sure that people are healthy. Walk around your block.

167
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.650
You don't have to do something complicated. Start drinking, more water,

168
00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.500
stop eating, sugar, start taking vitamins.

169
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.260
You can increase the strength of your immune system.

170
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:47.220
We can fight things off better. We can be a healthier civilization,

171
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.920
better for everybody, right? You don't hear a peep.

172
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.240
All you hear is take this vaccine that doesn't even prevent you from getting the

173
00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:58.170
disease or you can't go to the sauna,

174
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.120
wherever the you want to go, you can't go to the Broadway show. It's madness.

175
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:03.990
<v 1>It's madness.</v>

176
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.800
<v 0>And it really is mad it's because if it was a vaccine, that really was like a,</v>

177
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.580
like, here's a V like it's more of a treatment than it is a vaccine. Really?

178
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.414
If you look at it,

179
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.780
because you're saying you need a booster now every six months, look,

180
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.470
if you get vaccinated for polio, you get vaccinated for the measles.

181
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.200
You don't have to worry about it anymore. You're good.

182
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.530
This is not that this is a totally different kind of thing.

183
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.170
And it's a completely new kind of vaccine.

184
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:32.340
The idea that people shouldn't be skeptical or nervous about that is kind of

185
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:33.174
hilarious.

186
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.310
<v 1>Well, it's kind of hilarious that people won't try on</v>

187
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:41.790
skepticism in general. Like they need to be more skeptical.

188
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.870
They need to push people in authority and power and hold them

189
00:10:45.871 --> 00:10:49.290
accountable for their words and their actions.

190
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.480
And there's this reluctancy, I think, across the board to question power,

191
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.920
either on both sides, right? So it's like the blue likes to question,

192
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.270
read red likes to question,

193
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.620
but now you'll follow lock-step in party line.

194
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.630
If one is saying something or the other, that's a problem too,

195
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.070
to your point. I was reading,

196
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.430
I was reading the history of the Nez Perce Indian tribe.

197
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:17.820
And I've read a few books on this. And just recently I'm from Northern Idaho,

198
00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:21.060
where, where the Nez Perce, Indian tribe, ferocious people,

199
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:25.860
amazing like amazing warriors. Chief Joseph was an incredible leader, uh,

200
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.940
incredible history, but it struck me.

201
00:11:29.941 --> 00:11:34.050
There there's a there's one chapter in the books that I was reading about how

202
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.720
the us cavalry,

203
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:41.520
they were putting the native Americans on reservations for their protection.

204
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.030
And I'm not trying to equate this in direct correlation,

205
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.060
but this was part of the narrative because they were saying,

206
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:52.140
we want to put you guys on reservations to protect you from the Sadler's

207
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.700
and from a retaliation. So we want to put you guys on this,

208
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.820
you know, 400 square reservation,

209
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:04.240
400 miles square reservation for your protection. And they're like, dude,

210
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.660
we want to be free. I don't know what you're talking about.

211
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.120
And they go in and they trace the over thousand miles.

212
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.640
The chief Joseph led his, his, uh,

213
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.230
his tribe through Idaho and Montana, and then up close to the, uh,

214
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.360
the Canadian border. But I couldn't help.

215
00:12:22.361 --> 00:12:27.250
But think about there's one sliver of history in the

216
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:31.480
late 18 hundreds, which in 1873, I believe it was,

217
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.980
which was also connected to the, the son of, uh,

218
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.340
Meriwether Lewis was also part of the Nez Perce Indian tribe,

219
00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.070
because he had a son there. But I thought about how

220
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.330
us not us as a country,

221
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:51.340
how we need to be pushed to ask more questions and we deserve more answers.

222
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.500
And we have to hold skepticism.

223
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:56.680
I think in a very high regard and we can't beat it down.

224
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.690
I think anytime that you question authority, it's a good thing,

225
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:05.500
especially as a society, because it also says that you have a healthy society.

226
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:10.600
If you have this complex narrative, you know, moving up from underneath,

227
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:14.260
I think the groundswell of information from people,

228
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.780
you can have these complex discussions,

229
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:20.620
but you also have to have very good answers to what's going on.

230
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.170
I think you've got conflicting information.

231
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:27.550
That's being politicized and it's being gas lit by both sides of the media,

232
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.900
which I don't blame people for being off and confused because

233
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.780
man, I'm confused. Yeah. Like this is confusing as. The CDC releases something.

234
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.600
The president will say something else,

235
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:43.120
some random governor somewhere that I've never heard of will say something else.

236
00:13:43.121 --> 00:13:46.300
And you're like, what the hell is going on? What is going on? Yeah.

237
00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.810
That's why I listened to a crystal and saga because they typically.

238
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.190
<v 0>Well, they typically know what's going on. And they're,</v>

239
00:13:53.191 --> 00:13:57.040
they're a great example because that show breaking points, you got saga,

240
00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.980
who's on the right and crystal who's on the left, but they're good friends.

241
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.790
They get along well. And they're both super honest and objective,

242
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.470
rational and intelligent.

243
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:10.360
And they can discuss all the finer points of these issues,

244
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.440
honestly, openly. And it's, that's why they're thriving.

245
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.840
It's why CNN, like some of their shows there,

246
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.850
some of their shows or they get a hundred thousand views in the key demographic,

247
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.850
less than a hundred thousand, even that's crazy.

248
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.880
Since Trump is out of office and they don't have a boogeyman,

249
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:31.030
their bogeyman is unvaccinated people. That's what they're doing.

250
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.180
They're bogeyman is different, different things that they can attack.
