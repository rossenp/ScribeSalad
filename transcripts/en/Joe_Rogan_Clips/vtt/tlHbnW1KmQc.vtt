00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.040
<v 3>You know why they got rid of it, right?</v>

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.080
Why black people really mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's really good. So I, yeah,

4
00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:08.560
this.

5
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.120
<v 1>Actually, this is, hold, hold. These thoughts. Hold these thoughts.</v>

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.160
Tell me what you good. Okay. We're rolling. Did he get that already? Oh,

7
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:16.240
Jamie already got that. All right. So finish.

8
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.480
<v 0>Thought. Yeah. So, uh,</v>

9
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.110
the reason the 45 caliber bullet exists and the reason they got co or the reason

10
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:21.591
they, uh,

11
00:00:21.591 --> 00:00:25.950
made cocaine illegal is because when blacks were working the docs in the late 18

12
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:30.390
hundreds, early 19 hundreds, um, they had these things, uh, there was a rape,

13
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:33.270
obviously. That's what always happens, right? Yeah. In till all of 'em. Right.

14
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.990
So, uh, one reported a rape and, uh, a cop came up and he was,

15
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.630
there was a black dude on cocaine, cuz they would give the doc workers.

16
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.580
Cocaine had to keep him up all night. Yeah. That's when it was legal. Oh.

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.580
And then there was a, uh, a coked up black dude. Right? Real big dude, I guess.

18
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.580
And uh, a woman was saying he's chasing me. Right. And he was just, he was,

19
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.460
I don't know what the was going on.

20
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:56.100
But the cop was shooting at him and there was no stopping power enough.

21
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.620
They said for the bullet. So they didn't make a bigger bullet. Uh,

22
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.770
the 45 caliber bullet, because what they're using was like some little,

23
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:02.730
like a little over a 22.

24
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.051
<v 2>And you know,</v>

25
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.850
this is some real because it is a crack head back in the day I shot the nine

26
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:10.290
times with a tech nine and he kept running down the alley.

27
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.690
<v 0>Hmm. Different, different crack though. Different.</v>

28
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.530
<v 2>That was crack. They said that was Coke. This was crack.</v>

29
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.490
<v 0>Medicinal.</v>

30
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.370
<v 1>Cocaine crack. According to Carhart. They're the same thing. They are.</v>

31
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.760
<v 2>The same thing. Just really just has bacon soda. That's all. It's just,</v>

32
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.520
you're just freeing the base of the powder. That's why it's called free base.

33
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.080
Yeah.

34
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.760
<v 0>You know what I'm saying? But you probably made it famous. Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.800
But crack crack is cocaine. Ks ne oh cocaine CRA Negros. That's what they.

36
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.200
<v 1>Called them. The difference is the, the in sentencing. Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.600
That's the difference? The difference in sentencing. It's.

38
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.080
<v 0>Crazy powder to yeah. It's rock. It's crazy.</v>

39
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.310
<v 2>Know Obama changed.</v>

40
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.230
<v 1>That. Somebody must hope. I don't believe it's the same anymore.</v>

41
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.550
<v 2>I think Obama changed it. I think I want to say he did, but I don't know.</v>

42
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:52.190
You know what I mean?

43
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.950
<v 1>Let's find out if the, if the same sentencing for crack and cocaine, you know,</v>

44
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:57.790
that's the same they did with marijuana. Yeah.

45
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.550
When William Randolph Hurst was trying to make marijuana illegal,

46
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.220
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they put out these stories saying that and Mexicans exactly

47
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.180
were raping white women and they blamed it on this drug.

48
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.460
They blamed it on marijuana.

49
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:12.700
When marijuana wasn't even called marijuana back then &lt;laugh&gt; that marijuana was

50
00:02:12.701 --> 00:02:16.740
a wild Mexican tobacco. Right. So they made this new name.

51
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.700
So when Congress was making marijuana illegal,

52
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.460
they didn't even know they were making, he illegal. The I, what the target was,

53
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.490
was hemp, the commodity that's right.

54
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:29.090
They were trying to make the paper illegal. And they were trying to make the,

55
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.010
the textiles illegal because William Randolph Hearst,

56
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:33.490
not only did he run Hearst newspapers,

57
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.650
but he also had paper mills mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then on the pop popular,

58
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.570
uh, science magazine on the cover, it said hemp, the new billion dollar crop,

59
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.570
cuz they came up with a new way of processing it. Right.

60
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.000
And new machine called a decor. And so when they invented this decorticator yes,

61
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.920
exactly. The same kind of thing. Right. And then when they invented this thing,

62
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.640
people were all gonna start growing hemp and they were hemp is superior paper.

63
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.240
It's better for clothing and William handed it off first.

64
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:58.200
Like not so fast really.

65
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.000
So we made it all illegal so that he could just keep his paper mills and keep

66
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.560
making him with wood and keep using all the things that he's already used

67
00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:09.360
before. Instead of him controlling the industry. That's amazing.

68
00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.280
<v 0>That they could literally just say that about black people back capital they're</v>

69
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:13.160
everybody. Well, we gotta get.

70
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.560
<v 1>Rid of it. Then didn't believe made up a name for the plant.</v>

71
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.560
Oh the plant already had cannabis.

72
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.310
It was so they're like they called it marijuana. It was like, oh my God,

73
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.510
like bath salts, like, oh geez. It's a new thing.

74
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.510
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what is this PCP? That's that's what, what, you know,

75
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.310
PCP is the same thing as ketamine. Yeah. I didn't know that.

76
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.590
<v 2>Either. Yeah. Ketamine special. K. When I went to Australia,</v>

77
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.630
that's all the was snoring. They ain't had no real cocaine,

78
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.830
but it's a tri that's. They was snoring. All ketamine. I said, they said,

79
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.020
you want some Coke? I said that ain't real Coke. I said,

80
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.900
we are all the way in Australia. We are thousands of miles from Columbia.

81
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.020
You don't have real cocaine here. I don't believe it.

82
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.860
They don't get real cocaine Australia. They snorting special. K really? Yes.

83
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.620
Kidding me.

84
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.460
<v 0>K. Cause they, every time I go out there, they always have Coke, but I'm like,</v>

85
00:03:55.461 --> 00:03:56.260
there's no way. You.

86
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.650
<v 2>Know what? All the big Colombian drug dealers, they ain't with America no more.</v>

87
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:03.730
They going to Europe. It's easier. Easier to import the drugs. Really.

88
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.331
It's easier to yeah.

89
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:09.250
It's way they making way more money and you get less time when I was

90
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.010
locked up in Europe, you know what I'm saying? For that. I was locked up for.

91
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.600
Yeah. That's crazy.

92
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.890
Like it was guys in the cell that was there on drug offenses and I'd be like,

93
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.090
how much you get caught for? Uh, they were like, man,

94
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.800
I got caught with like four are keys. And I'm like. I'm like,

95
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.160
well how much time you about to get he? Like 18 months. I'm like, what?

96
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.720
The way it should be. That's what it be.

97
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.880
But you get caught that over here do 18 years. You do 18 years. Ke.

98
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.520
<v 0>Winslow. Junior's getting 14 years for rape. Who is ke win. Ke Winslow,</v>

99
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.240
junior Kell. Winslow's son. Right. He played, uh, he played for Miami.

100
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.190
<v 2>He raped somebody. He raped. He rape. Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.190
<v 0>But they're &lt;laugh&gt; he raped, uh, homeless women. Oh my God. Like in.</v>

<v 2>Their fifties, Jesus, give him a, give him 20 years. Yeah. He.</v>

103
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.310

104
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.510
you know, cuz if you, yeah, if I, if I go four kilos,

105
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:57.830
I'm probably going to jail for 30.

106
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.670
<v 2>Years. Definitely. For sure. See what I mean?</v>

107
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.660
<v 0>If I rape a woman three, I'm going for 14 years. Yeah.</v>

108
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.340
<v 1>The thing about kilos is, and they get rid of cocaine.</v>

109
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.020
The other thing about kilos is like,

110
00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:08.740
it's only valuable if somebody wants to buy it. Right, right, right.

111
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.780
Like somebody has to want it. Like you're not really doing anything wrong.

112
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.340
You're just getting something to them that they want.

113
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.980
You're not really hurting them. No, you're you're allowing them. Yeah.

114
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:22.490
You're allowing them to do Coke. Right. And, and how many, I mean,

115
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.090
if you were just doing Coke, that's the thing. Wasn't my, yeah.

116
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.450
The thing about Coke is like, if you're just doing Coke, like real Coke,

117
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.370
not all this cut up. This is the other thing that Dr. Carl Hart, who's,

118
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.250
he's actually a professor at Columbia. And uh, he'll do that. Does, uh,

119
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:41.050
heroin does heroin. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.760
<v 2>He's seen that out. I was like, what the?</v>

121
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.600
<v 1>He said I'm functional. Interesting guy. Oh yeah, because he's, first of all,</v>

122
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.480
he wasn't doing any drugs at all until in his thirties when he was a research

123
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.320
scientist and he realized while he was studying these chemicals,

124
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.840
that all the propaganda were we're spreading about him. It was all.

125
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.360
So he started trying them. &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; I mean,
