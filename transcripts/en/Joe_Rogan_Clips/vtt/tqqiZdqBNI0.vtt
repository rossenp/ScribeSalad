1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. That is the place. Like, I think if I had the choice,</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.130
if there was one place where I could go on a time machine,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.720
just peak for like an hour and just look around and then come back to present

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.520
day. I think that would be the spot.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.080
I'd want to see what Egypt was like when they were building the pyramids,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.450
like in the middle of construction, when they were at their peak,

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:25.080
when they were building the great pyramid of Giza, like, what was society like?

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.190
Like what were the people like,

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.210
if you could just be a fly on the wall and no one knew you were there,

10
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.490
see if they saw you, they'd be like, what are you doing?

11
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:37.110
What is this thing on your wrist? Who are you? Why are your teeth look so good?

12
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.700
How come you don't look deformed?

13
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.850
<v 1>I'd go back to the jail. I'd be on the grassy Knoll that day, JFK,</v>

14
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.313
Dallas.

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.280
<v 0>On the grass, you know, or be in the book depository.</v>

16
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.900
See if you're in the book depository,

17
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:53.540
then you know that Lee Harvey Oswald isn't there.

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.380
<v 1>I think he may have even been there. I think he may have even been firing,</v>

19
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:01.400
but I don't, I, I don't believe that he was the only one I'm with.

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.110
<v 0>You. That's exactly what I think.</v>

21
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.350
I think he could have been in on it and maybe he didn't even fire it. Right.

22
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.100
But when they set, when he said that he was a Patsy, you know,

23
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:14.720
the way he said it, when he got arrested, he said, I'm just a Patsy. That is,

24
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.260
that's like a guy who knew he was going to get in trouble for something.

25
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.280
That's not like a regular guy. He was not a regular guy. He,

26
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.910
they easily could have talked him into doing something up.

27
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.910
And then they did something as well and blamed it all on him.

28
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:32.330
And they had him set up for it. Yeah. He seemed like a wacky.

29
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.660
<v 1>Dude,</v>

30
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.380
someone that did that and made that shot and really wanted him dead would own

31
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:40.790
it. Quite the opposite. At that point, you're not trying to not go to prison.

32
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.410
<v 0>Well, maybe he is, but it didn't seem like it.</v>

33
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:47.360
He didn't seem like a guy who just shot someone.

34
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.070
He also didn't seem like a guy who was shocked that he was getting arrested for

35
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:56.120
something, but you can make someone a Patsy back then.

36
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.800
That was real. You could set someone up and then you hired Jack Ruby,

37
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.500
just run up on the guy and shoot him. And he just did it. Now, the guy's dead.

38
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.220
Jack Ruby drops the gun. They put him in a nice jail cell.

39
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.710
I don't know if it was a nice jail cell.

40
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.130
<v 1>I have no idea what happened at Jack Ruby. Something happened to him in jail,</v>

41
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.993
got cancer.

42
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.070
<v 2>How much you know about those three guys that they thought,</v>

43
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.200
maybe that's John God, three hobos. One of them was Woody Harrelson's dad.

44
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.890
They were in the CIA red, or that thought something who knows.

45
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.241
<v 0>Look,</v>

46
00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:29.600
Kennedy was not a popular guy by any stretch of the imagination with a giant

47
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:33.110
chunk of the population. Think about his men.

48
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.370
Like if as many people hate Trump right now,

49
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.830
if that's the only, like, I mean, I don't know how many people hated Kennedy,

50
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.950
but I know that the bay of pigs was a huge disaster.

51
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.810
A lot of military people hated him for that.

52
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.040
This supposedly he wanted to get rid of the NSA.

53
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.030
Supposedly he wanted to get rid of, um, uh, there was,

54
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:58.910
he wanted to do something about the federal reserve.

55
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.980
There was a lot of things that he wanted to do. Apparently, maybe it was a CIA.

56
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.680
I mean, I think it was a CIA who was trying to disband one of those,

57
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.300
but he just, he didn't,

58
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.830
he had a disdain for secrecy and secret societies, you know, like that,

59
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.400
there was a lot of these like skull and bones type things that like George W.

60
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.990
Bush was in or Herbert Walker, Bush,

61
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.460
rather his dad was George GW in skull and bones too. Yeah.

62
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.610
I mean all that wacky, like what are you doing? You,

63
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.600
you dressing up like a Druid. What are you doing? Are you burning an effigy?

64
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.590
You know, a lot of people thought that was all fake until, uh,

65
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.670
Alex Jones and John Ronson was with him right.

66
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.630
<v 2>At the, uh, I don't know who was with them. Yes.</v>

67
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.020
I'm pretty.

68
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.530
<v 0>Sure Google that. Make sure I'm right. I think I'm pretty sure it was Ronson.</v>

69
00:03:46.531 --> 00:03:49.740
I'm pretty sure Ronson was. I know it was, he was talking about it.

70
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.340
We talked about it on the podcast about, you know,

71
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:55.080
like that they couldn't believe what they found.

72
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.400
So this is place Bohemian Grove. And the idea was that, uh,

73
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.670
there all the elites would go there and they would engage in these occult

74
00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:06.090
rituals. This is in America. Yeah. Yeah. It's in California.

75
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.740
It's like Northern California. And so you hear about this and you're like, what?

76
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.720
Like if you heard about that, like, Hey,

77
00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:16.770
there's a place former presidents go top,

78
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.820
top ranking generals and heads of state and bankers,

79
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.260
famous artists. They go to this place and they, they do a cult rituals.

80
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.670
They perform a coat rituals.

81
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.110
<v 2>Yep. Part four of the secret rulers of the world directed by John Ronson.</v>

82
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.850
He travels with Alex Jones, uh, Netflix, uh,

83
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.440
I don't know where he could find it. The moment it was on.

84
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.620
<v 0>Please see it on YouTube. Right? You can definitely see the interaction.</v>

85
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.180
So Alex films,

86
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.650
these people worshiping Molik the owl God.

87
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.990
And doing this thing completely sneaks in, just acts like he's belongs there.

88
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.800
Just let them in. They have gate guarded gate, just, Hey, Hey, how you doing?

89
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.870
He looks like a Republican. They let him through.

90
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.150
He is there filming them. They have an effigy,

91
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.260
like a bunch of straw and.

92
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.800
That's supposed to represent a person that you're sacrificing to Moloch the Al

93
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.250
God they're dressed in these crazy hoods. They put the effigy down.

94
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:14.790
They say they have those loudspeakers and they have this crazy speech they give

95
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.070
it's so weird. But these are like legitimate, wealthy, famous people.

96
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.820
Politicians. These people are like heads of banks and.

97
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.990
And then they go in there and they're dressing up. This is real, right?

98
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.080
Like this isn't like, you hear things like that. Like, well, that's nonsense,

99
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:34.080
right? That's nonsense. That doesn't really happen. There's not a real,

100
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:35.760
like Bilderberg meeting.

101
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.910
They don't really get together and pretend they're burning hookers.

102
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.400
They really do. They really do. Yeah. And so that he films this and like,

103
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.250
it's one of the first things that got me thinking about conspiracies,

104
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.290
as much as you can think that Alex is a wacky guy and he certainly, uh,

105
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.500
eccentric and he's not always right. You know,

106
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:59.360
and that's part of the problem when being lied to left and right by so many

107
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.290
different things, you can get real off on, on things.

108
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.890
And he did, right. He's gotten, you know, he's, you know,

109
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.730
it's been beaten into the ground, but the,

110
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.590
the fact is that there are a certain amount of these things out there like that.

111
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.700
And if it wasn't for Alex releasing that video,

112
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.590
I think most people would think that's nonsense. But when you see that video,

113
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:29.450
you have to go, okay, what is this? What is going on?

114
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.470
Are they really dressing up? Is this really an, a cult ritual? What is this?

115
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.850
Have you ever seen it.

116
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.370
<v 3>Now? Show video.</v>

117
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.570
<v 0>Bohemian Grove, just so we can watch the video shirts and stuff.</v>

118
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.310
Cause the video that he has is really blurry and yeah. Yeah. But let's but well,

119
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:47.890
you'd have to hear it too. Cause it's like a booming loud speaker,

120
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.840
but see what you can see. It's kind of blurry, but this guy, I mean,

121
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.960
he there's like it's famous this place. So.

122
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.940
<v 1>Do you think these people all work with each.</v>

123
00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.080
<v 0>Other? This,</v>

124
00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:03.790
all the C's got this hidden camera footage of these people with torches

125
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:07.930
dressed up like Druids going over and they're carrying the effigy and then

126
00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:10.240
they're going to sacrifice it in light on fire.

127
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.050
We do this as like really rich, famous,

128
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.910
powerful people are all here watching this. Let me do that.

129
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.130
And then the ma re re back that up so we can hear what it's or we can read what

130
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:26.800
it says, backing up a little bit.

131
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.100
<v 2>Just got other someone's talking. Okay.</v>

132
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.160
<v 0>Yeah. But I don't want to hear it, Jamie. I just want to see the right.</v>

133
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.650
It keeps going. Yeah. But can't you? Um, no, what I'm saying is, uh,

134
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.630
uh, make it, so I can't hear it.

135
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:49.130
And mass wrens, the stones of Babylon, like, so they're like,

136
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.500
what do they even say? Play it out a little bit,

137
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.150
like, look at this for a beauty as a eternal. So they have this and,

138
00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.980
and we bow to beauty, everlasting. It's a very strange.

139
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.260
So they're yelling at us out this, guy's got this on a loud speaker and they're,

140
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:08.890
they're engaging in this ritual.

141
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.770
And then they bring over this fog and they light it on fire.

142
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.190
They have a boat in the water, like it's weird, dude.

143
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.810
Just imagine being a guy who's worth a billion dollars.

144
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:21.370
And this is what you do for fun.

145
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.600
You're going to get together with Mike and Harry who runs Microsoft.

146
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.970
And you're all going to go and pretend you're burning something, but did.

147
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.780
<v 1>They become billionaires and then do this? Or is it a chicken and the egg?</v>

148
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.220
That's.

149
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.340
<v 0>The question. That's what people think about the elites. Right?</v>

150
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.970
People think well, and in some families, it is true. I.

151
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.000
<v 1>Mean, if these people are all meeting up once a year to burn a stack of hay,</v>

152
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:49.710
shaped like a lady, why wouldn't they invest in each other? And uh, you know,

153
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.440
of course they're all bankers and successful.

154
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.200
<v 0>Well, that was the thing about skull. And is that they all had something on you.</v>

155
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.880
Everyone knew something.

156
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.570
Cause you all suck everybody's Dick and took Polaroids of it.

157
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.470
And just up like a munchkin, you know? I mean, that's what they all did.

158
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.160
They did some wacky. It's hard. It's hard to think.

159
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.240
<v 1>It's hard to think like what you could have had on somebody before porn search.</v>

160
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.630
<v 0>History, probably all each other. It probably was one guy.</v>

161
00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:20.540
I was like the top skull and bones guy. And he's just really into dudes.

162
00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:22.940
And he just convinced her, but he knew it'd be a crazy thing, man.

163
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.780
How do we have a group super secret group. And you can't tell anybody about it?

164
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:28.520
How are we going to stop people from telling people?

165
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.640
I know we're going to film me him.

166
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.170
And really he's just trying to these guys in the.

167
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.200
That's his goal was just to guys in the. He's like, man,

168
00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:44.210
this is getting harder and harder to trick these dudes.

169
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.920
I didn't figure out a new way.

170
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.190
So he comes up with this super exclusive elite club.

171
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.390
It's called skull and bones. Do you want in? Yeah. Well,

172
00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:56.840
we got to be able to trust you. He could trust me. I won't tell anybody.

173
00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:59.930
I don't believe you, Timmy, Timmy. I don't believe you.

174
00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:03.110
I think you would tell we're going to have to have something on you. Well,

175
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:03.381
I mean,

176
00:10:03.381 --> 00:10:06.860
what do you mean we're going to have to have you do something that you don't

177
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:10.190
want to do and that way, if you ever say anything about us,

178
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.120
we'll tell everybody about you. I mean,

179
00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:15.650
I really do want to be in the club.

180
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.950
Well guarantee you that's how it went down. That's crazy.

181
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.700
One alpha gay dude just tricked a bunch of guys. Isn't that?

182
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:27.980
If it's not skull and bones, maybe they don't do that.

183
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.980
But there's a group out there that does. It was one of those groups.

184
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.180
One of those crazy groups, that's just run by a dudes, just donk and dudes

185
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.110
right now. He's 35. He's still in college. Everybody's like, Mike,

186
00:10:42.111 --> 00:10:43.370
why are you still going to school here?

187
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.130
Someone's got to make sure that's how everything starts. Right?

188
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:54.830
I'll get the bone yard, the bone house,

189
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.130
the bone house that our ethics are true.

190
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.290
I'm here to uphold the strictest interpretation of the bone yards rules.

191
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.480
No trust. You.

192
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.360
<v 4>Got to show your commitment. Yeah. Everybody bays in oil.</v>

193
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.630
<v 0>First. It's like, why are we in oil? What what's going on?</v>

194
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.960
Just these weird secret societies.

195
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.350
You ever heard the Kennedy speak about secret societies. It's creepy. When,

196
00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:29.540
when it turns out, eventually it gets murdered. It's creepy.

197
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.290
Did you watch the Irishman? No, it's it good?

198
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.540
<v 2>It's about, yeah. It's about that.</v>

199
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.590
<v 1>No, it is good. As so many people told me that they hated it.</v>

200
00:11:38.591 --> 00:11:42.490
That I was shocked when I watched it and it was good. Pull.

201
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.280
<v 0>Up. Kennedy's speech about secret societies</v>

202
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.330
because Kennedy had this speech about secret societies that many people

203
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.250
speculated had to do with the, or had to do with.

204
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.270
<v 2>The movie brings up an angle.</v>

205
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:57.910
I didn't know is that he hired his brother to become the attorney general.

206
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:01.830
And he started going after. Yes, the mom. Yeah. I didn't know that. Oh yeah, he.

207
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:06.660
<v 0>Did right after they helped him get into office. Well,</v>

208
00:12:06.661 --> 00:12:08.160
here's the other thing about the Kennedys.

209
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.060
They were drug dealers a hundred percent. Yes.

210
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.030
They were selling whiskey or moonshine or whatever the.

211
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.940
<v 2>It was as a dad was too old at the time to get ahold of the sons.</v>

212
00:12:17.941 --> 00:12:22.860
Like they were trying to get old man Kennedy to tell us kids, crack the whip,

213
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.540
get them in line, but they couldn't get, get to him.

214
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.220
Cause he was just staring out windows.

215
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.900
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Listen man,</v>

216
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.740
they were illegal alcohol salesman.

217
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.760
They made a bunch of money selling alcohol illegally,

218
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.700
just like a drug dealer does same thing.

219
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:47.160
The fact that those folks went on to become this incredibly powerful family.

220
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.120
And then, uh, two brothers get publicly assassinated,

221
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.150
amen. Two of them,

222
00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.000
the fact that you can keep guys around that, you know, a whack,

223
00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:04.920
somebody for you like that there'll be a Jack Ruby or a sir hands or

224
00:13:04.921 --> 00:13:06.360
hand, just trick a guy,

225
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.620
figure out what are you going to say to that guy to get that guy to run up on

226
00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:11.454
that dude and.

227
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.241
<v 1>I mean,</v>

228
00:13:12.241 --> 00:13:15.930
if you put a gun to somebody's head and you tell them that if they don't do

229
00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:20.360
this, we're going to kill you and your family. That's it pretty much you got.

230
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.130
And especially sometimes, you know, like in the movies,

231
00:13:23.131 --> 00:13:26.250
when they show someone a picture of their family and they show them a picture of

232
00:13:26.251 --> 00:13:28.860
their house or whatever, you know what I mean? Like I know where you live.

233
00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:29.694
I know.

234
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.950
<v 0>I think it's more than that.</v>

235
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.560
I think it's guys that you can tell that they're going to do a good thing.

236
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.630
They're going to go down in history and they're going to live in infamy,

237
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.620
like for their own personal gain. Like you're talking about people that,

238
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.130
that are so dumb. You're, you're willing to, you're gonna,

239
00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:49.110
you're gonna lose the rest of your life.

240
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.260
Cause someone's telling you to go shoot Bobby Kennedy and you're gonna do it in

241
00:13:52.261 --> 00:13:56.730
a restaurant in front of everybody. It was a hotel. No,

242
00:13:56.731 --> 00:13:57.564
it was in LA.

243
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.520
We actually did fear factor in the very hotel where he

244
00:14:02.521 --> 00:14:05.280
was shot because the hotel eventually shut down.

245
00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:08.580
I don't know how long after the assassination, but when we were there,

246
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.300
they would rent it out for television shows. It's just like weird place,

247
00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:15.600
man walked through the kitchen where, where he got shot. Like did he shot,

248
00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:17.490
shot in the kitchen? And they bring him into the kitchen.

249
00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.840
<v 2>I think it was in like the convention part where they're giving a speech. Whew.</v>

250
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.710
<v 0>And that guy is where is it? He didn't kill him, but listen,</v>

251
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.380
but play that play that, uh, that Kennedy speech.

252
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.930
<v 2>Which is a, it's actually like a 20 minute speech. This is just,</v>

253
00:14:33.931 --> 00:14:36.870
I think this is the main highlight or hopefully looking for it. Yeah.

254
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:37.230
Let me hit.

255
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:41.490
<v 5>Very words. Secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.</v>

256
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.280
And we are as a people inherently and historically opposed

257
00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:51.090
to secret societies to secret oaths and to secret,

258
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:57.140
we decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted

259
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:02.030
concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers,

260
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.200
which are cited to justify it. Even today.

261
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.810
There is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating

262
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.500
its arbitrary restrictions. Even today,

263
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.340
there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation.

264
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.460
If our traditions do not survive with it.

265
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:28.100
And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased

266
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:32.960
security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its

267
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:35.790
meaning to the very limits of official sense,

268
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:41.030
censorship ship and concealment that I do not intend to permit to the extent

269
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:45.290
that it's in my control and no official of my administration,

270
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.880
whether his rank is high or low civilian or military should

271
00:15:49.881 --> 00:15:54.200
interpret my words here tonight. As an excuse to sense of the news,

272
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:55.790
to stifled the Sam,

273
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.100
to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public,

274
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.170
the facts they deserve to know what we are opposed around the

275
00:16:06.171 --> 00:16:11.000
world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that

276
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:15.440
relies primarily on covet means for expanding its fear of

277
00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:20.390
influence on infiltration instead of invasion on

278
00:16:20.391 --> 00:16:24.350
severity instead of elections on intimidation

279
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.280
instead of free choice on guerrillas by night,

280
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:33.560
instead of armies by day, it is a system which has conscripted,

281
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.840
vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit,

282
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:44.390
highly efficient machine that combines military diplomatic

283
00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:49.400
intelligence, economic scientific, and political operations.

284
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:55.070
Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried,

285
00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.810
not headlined. Its descent is a silenced, not praised,

286
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.620
no expenditure is questioned. No rumor is printed.

287
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.510
No secret is revealed.

288
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.380
No president should face public scrutiny of his program for,

289
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.400
from that scrutiny comes understanding.

290
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.800
And from that understanding comes support or opposition and both unnecessary.

291
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.080
That's good. I am not asking your newspaper.

292
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.740
<v 0>You get it. Wow, crazy. Right now,</v>

293
00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:28.450
if you had just heard that if someone else was saying that instead of Kennedy,

294
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.290
if someone else was saying those very things in front of you,

295
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.000
about how they have an open budget there,

296
00:17:36.001 --> 00:17:37.840
their findings are all concealed.

297
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.100
They're a tightly wit group knit group that combines the military and

298
00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:46.180
science and all that. You'd be like, what are you on Sam?

299
00:17:46.181 --> 00:17:49.560
Tripoli's podcasts you on tinfoil hat. You know, what are you,

300
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:51.690
what are you doing with this wacky thought?

301
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.480
What do you think that that would be the part he's talking about.

302
00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:58.440
Secret societies talking about the industrial, the, um,

303
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.390
military industrial complex. He's talking about all the gears that are in play.

304
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:07.770
All the pieces that are in play that are making money and causing war and

305
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.570
deciding what information people shouldn't shouldn't have and what overreach,

306
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.760
you know, they're going to be.

307
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.990
<v 1>Put into actions, shadowing, everything.</v>
