WEBVTT

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.511
<v 2>In Nepal,</v>

3
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.810
the reason that you ate a rat was the round was considered the strongest animal

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.440
and, and, uh, you weaned kids on it, um,

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.440
because you want the kid to grow it to be strong. Really? Yeah.

6
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.250
And so they would often wean kids and get to stick tiny little piece. Yeah,

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.320
yeah. Uh, the cow year.

8
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.200
And that was the only time I actually took antibiotics prophylactically,

9
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.050
which is something you're not, you're not supposed to do. Uh,

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.590
but I just decided that, you know, I, it was my second year.

11
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:29.460
I didn't want to get ill.

12
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.760
<v 0>Cal urine has some weird, uh,</v>

13
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.440
pseudo medicinal purposes over there. They're using it for people that are,

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.790
that are suffering from COVID. And there was a, yeah, there was this like, uh,

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.100
this guy from I'm trying to remember the country,

16
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:47.911
I don't remember,

17
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:52.650
but he was criticizing like how ridiculous this practice is of, uh,

18
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.430
giving cow urine to sick people.

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.580
<v 1>It was, well, you know, it's, it's funny,</v>

20
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:01.590
you say ignorant because for me really,

21
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:05.610
what was so important about that experience with less learning, how weird I was,

22
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.140
and that is, you know, um, uh, how weird I was to them,

23
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.300
you know, and how many different ways there are to be human. Right. And so,

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.020
you know, um, uh, I, um, uh, you know,

25
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:22.140
I participated in marrying off one of our sisters, right.

26
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.900
Because I'm an older brother and girl 16, you know,

27
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.150
time to get her married at 16. Oh.

28
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.983
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.740
<v 1>Dude. Yeah. Well, you know, people would come by and ask for a hand,</v>

30
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:34.260
this is what the process was and often bring gifts.

31
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.530
And I'm there with the other brothers and a guy would come and leave and

32
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.570
somebody would say to me, well, what did you think of him?

33
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.050
And the first time they asked, I said, valine and I cost it out.

34
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.090
Which means what does little sister fat good. Well, and people just cracked up.

35
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:49.950
And I heard about that for two years.

36
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.010
I would walk to other parts of the district when people would say, oh,

37
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:55.980
I heard about you. You're the guy who asked what boy, he things.

38
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.590
And the point was that wasn't relevant to them.

39
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:01.560
That wasn't what the experience was, right.

40
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.280
That wasn't a relevant variable. And, you know,

41
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.870
I would explain to them that in my country, you actually choose your own spouse.

42
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.810
And they would say, well, how do you do that? And I say, well,

43
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.010
you find somebody that you love. And then they would say, well,

44
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.340
then what if you don't love them? And then I'd say, well,

45
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:23.130
there's this thing called divorce. You know,

46
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.660
and what I realized was that the way I thought about how all this should work,

47
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.100
which is so radically different from theirs and not necessarily better or worse,

48
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.020
right. They were system had its own logic and it was static. It was stable,

49
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.900
right. If you don't marry for love, right.

50
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.960
You're not going to get divorced because you're out of love. Right.

51
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.440
That wasn't the purpose of it. The purpose was, it was social.

52
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:50.340
It was familiar what had to do with Dwayne and communities, you know, and again,

53
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:54.270
I didn't grow up there, so that's not what I do or what I would want to do.

54
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.350
But what I learned was how many different ways there are to do, you know,

55
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.670
how many different ways there are to be human and, um,

56
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.470
always to resist the automatic assumption that, that your way is the better way,

57
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.920
you know, because we all do that too. And by the way,

58
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.900
I did some of that in Nepal. I mean, you know,

59
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.910
one of my other really enduring memories is my best student was of the,

60
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.350
the, um, the so-called Cami cast, which is metalworker, which is an untouchable,

61
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.580
um, it's way down that, right. It's not as low as a Shoemaker. And, uh,

62
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:30.550
you know, they have a caste system, right. And at the bottom,

63
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.730
there are people that are called untouchables because you're literally not

64
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:37.630
supposed to touch them or anything. But yes. I mean, that's how, you know,

65
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.830
shoemakers, especially because they deal with was shooting with cows,

66
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.810
they deal with, they deal with leather. Right. And, and, you know, um, so why.

67
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.590
<v 0>Why.</v>

68
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.420
<v 1>And, and well, because the cow is a sacred animal, right? You need shins.</v>

69
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.170
Yes, you do. Right. And so in the, you know, in the,

70
00:03:56.171 --> 00:04:00.970
the Hindu system evolved to have a cast that did precisely that. Wow. Right.

71
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.043
I mean, you know.

72
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.710
<v 0>Did you communicate with those people at all? Oh, sharp. What was it like? Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.820
It must have felt terrible.

74
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.650
<v 1>Well, I mean, here's the story. Um, the metalworking family,</v>

75
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.570
I actually went down to their house and I had a meal there and I

76
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:19.960
come back and I tell my Ahmad, that means mother of my family.

77
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.140
And we were Chet trees, which is way up there. It's not Brahman,

78
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:26.580
which is the highest. And, uh, that's the priestly caste, but the,

79
00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:28.630
the Chet Reese are second, uh, you know, they're,

80
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:33.190
they were historically the military caste. He's like Babu. That means baby,

81
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:35.860
which is what he called me. Babu. You, you,

82
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.250
you ate rice at a metal workers house.

83
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.360
Do you know how filthy those people are? You know, what were you thinking?

84
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.300
And I'm like, listen to, I just don't believe in cast. You know,

85
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:49.900
I think everyone's the same and PS, you know, what's going to happen.

86
00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:53.650
I wake up in the middle of the night and I'm just incredibly ill and I just go

87
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:56.650
outside and I'm puking my guts out. Um, I can hear me,

88
00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.030
he comes from the other room and she's like, listen, Bobby,

89
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.930
you can say it in Warren. Yeah. You know, I mean, you know, uh, and,

90
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:06.010
and again, you know, it was really useful for me.

91
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.670
It's not like I suddenly believe in the caste system because I don't. Right.

92
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.020
But I think it's really useful just to have all your assumptions challenged,

93
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.680
you know, and that's really what it did for me. And here I was,

94
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.070
I'm this American I'm making this great statement about how all people are

95
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:24.940
equal. Well, you know what I mean, 20 years earlier in my own country,

96
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.200
they had a caste system, right. That went back to the 16 hundreds. Uh,

97
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.800
and that was the other formative experience of being in Nepal.

98
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.530
That was actually the first place that I started to think about American

99
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:36.250
history.

100
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.960
<v 0>What did you, when they were talking about the arranged marriage?</v>

101
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.060
Yeah. And when you were saying that in your country, people get to choose. Yeah.

102
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.950
Like what did you think about, but what is there, like,

103
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.520
how do they explain it to you in a way where it made sense?

104
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.790
Did they attempt to, or did they just say, this is how it's always been?

105
00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.870
<v 1>Will, you know,</v>

106
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.820
I would say that the things that are most common sensical to us often,

107
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:08.180
we don't have to explain. Right. Because they're part of our ether. Right.

108
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.040
But I think the logic was this, you know, that, um, uh, you,

109
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.960
you, you have to create families. Right.

110
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.310
And so you have to yeah. Yeah. Because you've got to, you know, you,

111
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.080
you have to perpetuate the species. Right. And so, you know,

112
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.510
the, the simplest and the most static way to do that is to have the girls, um,

113
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.180
uh, marry guys who can, who have enough wherewithal to take care of them.

114
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.850
Right. That can bring you something, right.

115
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:43.640
Because it's a reciprocal arrangement. Right. Um,

116
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.180
and this is one why in rural Nepal at the time,

117
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.070
people wanted to have boys, not girls. They used to say, Choto boss cha shorty,

118
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.000
John Shaw, which means, uh, the sun stays. And the girl goes,

119
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.510
because of course the system was also Petro local, which means that, you know,

120
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:04.070
you go and live in the house of the guy that you've married. Right.

121
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.380
So in the house I live with the older brothers,

122
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:10.490
they all had wives who live there. Right. But when the girls got married,

123
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:14.810
they had to go somewhere else. Um, so that was, yeah. Well that again,

124
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.650
and it's, it's ironic because believe it, or not, 20 years later,

125
00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:20.630
I went back to my village with,

126
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.360
with my older daughter who was a junior in high school at the time.

127
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.230
And the three-day walk had become about a day's walk because they had,

128
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.650
they had cut a tractor road kind of up half, half into the mountains.

129
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.670
And the first guy that I ran into, he just said, uh, Hey, what are you been

130
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.660
like, I haven't seen you around. They're like, oh,

131
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:42.560
you brought your daughter a great let's drink rice wine. You know, basically,

132
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:46.610
you know, somebody had died and somebody had gotten married and, you know,

133
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:47.540
somebody had a kid,

134
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.530
but the one thing that was really different and this speaks to globalization is

135
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.630
a lot of the younger men had gone to places like the United Arab Emirates to

136
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:00.830
work, you know? Um, and that was ironic too, because you know,

137
00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:04.430
the old story was the sun stays and the girl goes right.

138
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.670
A lot of the sons had gone, but they had gone outside of the country.

139
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.650
And that's the way, you know, so many of these condoms work in,

140
00:08:10.651 --> 00:08:11.690
in that part of the world.

141
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.360
<v 0>And you see if the girl's marriage worked out.</v>

142
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.810
<v 1>Well again, you know, go, it all works out. Right. I mean,</v>

143
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.130
you know, it works out because it was designed for social reasons,

144
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:27.320
not for personal ones, you know,

145
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.120
it's not about what she thinks or about what he thinks. Uh, you know,

146
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:36.140
it's about kind of, you know, bringing together families, creating communities,

147
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.450
uh, bringing up kids, um, uh, it wasn't about sentiment. Although,

148
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:45.170
you know, I, I, as I got closer to people in the community,

149
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.620
I've found out that after a marriage was arranged,

150
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.980
often you did develop feelings for the person often. Yeah.

151
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:55.260
It's just that those feelings, weren't the foundation of it. Right.

152
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:58.500
They weren't what spawned it, they were an offshoot of it.

153
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:59.490
They weren't a cause of.

154
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.370
<v 0>It. Did it make you feel uncomfortable that they were doing that? Not in.</v>

155
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:04.860
<v 1>The waist. And in fact, I mean,</v>

156
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:07.920
that was when I started to read history because of course in most parts of the

157
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.970
world, including where we are right now, historically marriage was a rage.

158
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.780
<v 0>But I would imagine that, like, if you have this conversation with a feminist,</v>

159
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.680
for instance, they would have a real issue with that. And a real,

160
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.500
and also a real issue with your acceptance of it. Right.

161
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.290
<v 1>Well, again, I'm not saying that I accepted for me and,</v>

162
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.560
and, uh, because that, wasn't my expectation, you know? Um,

163
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.300
but you know, uh, I think it's, it's worth asking ourselves, um,

164
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.220
the degree to which we know we're right. And, you know,

165
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.210
I think that at the end of the day, we don't, all of us have opinions.

166
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:47.970
All of us have biases. All of us have learned certain things,

167
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.980
but learn at hand who was a, you know,

168
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:55.980
a famous jurist and a federal court judge. Um, he, one of,

169
00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.070
one of the things he said, that's always stuck with me is that, um,

170
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.270
the spirit of Liberty,

171
00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:04.770
which is really what we're talking about is the spirit that is not so sure of

172
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:09.210
itself. And I'm always love that. Right? So I'm a human being.

173
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:11.670
I have biases opinions, very strong ones,

174
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.410
but I think that the worst human attribute is self certainty.

175
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.240
I think it's the most dangerous one, you know? And, uh, for me,

176
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:26.070
the peace score was just a great way to challenge that and just say, okay, look,

177
00:10:26.071 --> 00:10:28.680
I'm not going to have an arranged marriage. And by the way, I don't,

178
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.770
and I'm not going to marry off my daughters. Um,

179
00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.130
but in another part of the world, they do that. Um,

180
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.980
and that's decreasingly the case by the way, right?

181
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:39.330
Because these places have modernized.

182
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:44.040
<v 0>So they get the internet done. What the I could just meet a guy. I really like.</v>

183
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:49.440
<v 1>Exactly. Right. And so these, you know, I mean, when we went back to Nepal,</v>

184
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:54.000
it had in my village, it was in a remote place. So it was relatively static,

185
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.680
but there had been many other changes. I mean,

186
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:59.400
just think of all these guys going to the UAE to work in construction sites.
