00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So how do you, how do.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 1>You feel about all those? So you weirded out like, no,</v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:08.670
I haven't been here since COVID right. Um.

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.780
<v 2>Yeah, we were, uh, the last time it was, it was before then,</v>

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.240
just before then it started to settle in. Um,

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.110
and then I traveled last was, uh, mid February.

7
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:20.000
I was in New York city and it was starting to,

8
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.300
people were starting to be aware and they were talking about it a little bit,

9
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:26.330
but there were really no changes in behavior. Um, and then it,

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.500
then it really hit and everybody went into to hurry lockdown and, and I,

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.560
you know, the good thing is pandemics don't last, right?

12
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.590
So we're going to get past this. This is not like the zombie apocalypse.

13
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.740
So I'm not one of those people that, you know, as hiding in my bunker,

14
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:42.140
even though I liked my bunker. Um, but.

15
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.780
<v 1>Kind of bunker your gut, that good bunker. I bet you do. Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.150
but you have a real one, right? I, I, I mean.

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.190
<v 3>It looks like a submarine Periscope. It comes up,</v>

18
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:53.510
looks around the compound.

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.970
<v 2>Yeah. We use it for, uh, for a variety of reasons. Well, it it's it's, I,</v>

20
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:02.990
I just not, I'm not, I mean, I'm, I'm worried because it's, it's, uh,

21
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.620
it's serious and of course it's tragic to lose anybody and, and, you know,

22
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:11.150
we've lost over 150,000 people, but you also got to keep this in context, right?

23
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.750
I mean, we've had pandemics before pandemic just means it crossed international

24
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:18.470
boundaries. So there's, there's an element here.

25
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.990
The two things can be true. You can believe the science,

26
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.640
which of course you should do. You know,

27
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.550
you should pay attention to statistics and data and do the best things you can

28
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.250
do, but you can also look at it and go, what kind of,

29
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.470
because part of this problem is the coverage of it because

30
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.430
of political reasons and not to jump right into the political thing. But, um,

31
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.470
you know, I can't help,

32
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:44.000
but think that we wouldn't have quite as much confusion and we wouldn't

33
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.930
have quite as much, uh, um, you know,

34
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:51.650
the axed that people are feeling if, um,

35
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.250
if it weren't for those sort of the,

36
00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:58.280
the visceral hatred that exists out there on some sectors for the president.

37
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.890
And again, I don't have a dog in the hunt,

38
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.360
but I have a feeling like the tone of coverage will change in November if Biden

39
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:09.020
wins, right. And not the science doesn't change. Right.

40
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:11.240
It's still the same virus,

41
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.260
but I just have a feeling that we'll see a tone change. Um,

42
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.300
suddenly it will be a little bit more about if Biden wins.

43
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.040
It will be more about what, yeah. Let's, you know,

44
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:21.680
let's look on the bright side, let's get this coverage, you know, sorted out,

45
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:26.570
let's get the country working, let's do these things. And you know, again,

46
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:29.930
you can believe both things. You can believe that we're because of the politics.

47
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:31.160
And you can also believe the science.

48
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.620
<v 1>Okay. My friend got, uh, tested,</v>

49
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.120
turned up positive and the doctor asked him what his political leanings are.

50
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.370
And he said why? And he said, well, I really believe in hydroxy chloroquine,

51
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:45.140
but a lot of people who are Democrats who don't like,

52
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:49.670
the president don't want to use it. I'm like, that is hilarious. And he goes,

53
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.100
hydroxy chloroquine. When used correctly, he said,

54
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:55.850
particularly in the early stages of the virus seems to be very effective.

55
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.090
Now there's all these people that are coming out and saying, it's not,

56
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.490
there's always people that are coming out.

57
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.920
And I talked to my doctor about it and I said, well,

58
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:06.730
why do you think that it's it's because the doctor that I use currently,

59
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.420
he recommends it for people that are high risk as a prophylactic.

60
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.780
That's the way Trump is supposedly taking it. And he's like, it's actually,

61
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.580
there's a study that shows that it's very effective.

62
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.790
A study from Italy that shows it's very effective as a prophylactic.

63
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.660
And he says also, when you, when you get it, um,

64
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.540
you get the catch the virus and then you can get it quickly.

65
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.920
So if you can get hydroxychloroquine and you quickly, but, you know, look,

66
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.880
I'm a moron. I don't know who the to believe. So I read all this. I'm like,

67
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.410
well, do I believe the doctor,

68
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:37.480
do I believe all these other doctors that say it's?

69
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.650
Do I believe that whole team of doctors, by the way,

70
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.360
Andrew Schultz has a hilarious video on hydrochloric. And like, what is it?

71
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.380
He did one of those Instagram videos. So go check that out. Um,

72
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.870
but it's, it's one of those things where it's like,

73
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:54.910
I wish the president didn't talk about it.

74
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.540
Cause then we would know what the it is. Is it good? Is it bad? I mean,

75
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.610
are people really not taking it?

76
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.630
Just because the president is the one who endorsed it, like that is so.

77
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.530
<v 2>Different. Yeah. I don't think there's any doubt about that. Right? I mean,</v>

78
00:04:07.531 --> 00:04:11.160
there's some, it's it? Yeah. And people don't know to your point.

79
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.120
People don't know what to believe. Right. And it's, it's one thing. If,

80
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.410
if you know the reporting, uh, or the, the, uh,

81
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.070
dissemination of information is partisan during normal times,

82
00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:27.180
but you're talking about a public health crisis and you would think we'd set all

83
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:30.060
of that aside. I mean, if we can't come together as a country,

84
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.050
during a public health crisis, what the hell is wrong, but, and it's both sides.

85
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.820
Both sides are tossing hand grenades at each other.

86
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:37.380
So it's not just one side or the other.

87
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.920
<v 1>I'm going to send Jamie this right now. Cause this is from Newsweek.</v>

88
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:43.830
This is why it's really confusing. This is from Newsweek.

89
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.210
And this is from a professor of epidemiology

90
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.460
from, I believe from yeah, from Yale school of public health,

91
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.950
Yale. And he says the key to defeating, COVID-19 already exists.

92
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.390
We need to start using it.

93
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.680
And he's recommending hydroxy chloroquine pull up.

94
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.410
Yeah, yeah. Look at this. Like, this is a real problem. This is a real doctor,

95
00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:13.950
a professor of epidemiology. Like what the?

96
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.920
<v 2>Yeah, no. I mean, and, and you see,</v>

97
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:19.410
you see some folks coming out at some doctors coming out and saying, well,

98
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.420
it doesn't, it doesn't work in, in, in patients.

99
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:24.060
And then it turns out you read further into the story and it doesn't work on

100
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:28.440
patients who are already seriously ill. Yes. Right. That's what they're saying.

101
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.390
Right. And so, but you have to,

102
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.620
the problem is nobody makes it past the headlines for the most part. Right.

103
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.810
And more and more people are getting their information from Facebook, you know,

104
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.060
uh, user groups and nobody reads down and, and, and you know,

105
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:48.490
to be fair, media outlets know that. So they'll bury the,

106
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.580
the contradictory information, you know, the,

107
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:51.930
in the 20th paragraph or something,

108
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.060
because they know no one's going to venture down down there.

109
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:57.620
Everybody looks at the headlines because they'll see that that convinces me, uh,

110
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.350
or supports my theory. Um, but yeah,

111
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.400
I look at this and we've been doing everything you can do. We've been, you know,

112
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.600
wearing masks, you know,

113
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:10.250
I don't see what the is about the masks wear a mask when you're out in

114
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:11.084
public.

115
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.440
<v 1>You get used to it. Yeah. It's better. Bandanas are way better.</v>

116
00:06:14.441 --> 00:06:15.130
You can breathe it out them.

117
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.610
<v 2>Better. Yeah. Yeah. Plus it just looks good. Yeah. You feel like a basket. Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.780
If got your horse waiting outside.

119
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.920
<v 1>Do you know that whole video where there's a bunch of doctors that keeps getting</v>

120
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:28.060
removed from YouTube, Facebook with a bunch of doctors talking about hydroxy,

121
00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:32.440
chloroquine and Z packs and zinc, everybody's like,

122
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:34.060
you need to listen to this lady.

123
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.070
Then it turns out the lady believes that the cause of impotence is spirits

124
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.450
and she thinks there's alien DNA in vaccines. Is that,

125
00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:48.310
what is that what she said? Yeah. It's a little odd. Yeah.

126
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.910
He's completely off the reservation. Oh, you're not supposed to say that. Right.

127
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.660
I think you're not supposed to say off the reservation. Well,

128
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.733
it's offensive to him.

129
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.920
<v 2>It. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Let me make a note of that.</v>

130
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:02.020
That one I didn't have on my list of what's offensive.

131
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.560
<v 1>Native American lady. Okay. Not supposed to say that one. Oh,</v>

132
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:09.310
she's off the chain. I think you could say that might be offensive to dogs,

133
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.990
but off the chain is good. Right? It's not crazy. I need a new, crazy term.

134
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.750
What's a, non-offensive crazy term. It's not, well,

135
00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:18.970
I shouldn't say not gonna offend anybody because there's no such thing.

136
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.160
<v 2>Anymore. nuts. How about that? We.</v>

137
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.440
<v 3>Just go with that. She's.</v>

138
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.740
<v 1>A doctor. She's a legit doctor, but apparently she is nuts.</v>

139
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.440
<v 2>Yeah. Um, what do you got, Jamie?</v>

140
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.180
<v 1>What did she say? Okay. Summer reported that a 2000, uh,</v>

141
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:39.070
2015 sermon that laid out a supposed Illuminati

142
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:42.550
plan hatched by a witch to destroy the world,

143
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:46.480
using abortion gay marriage and children's toys,

144
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.730
Amman among other things.

145
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.340
Emanuel claim that DNA from space aliens is currently being used in medicine.

146
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.890
She also offered prayers through her website to remove generational

147
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.080
curse is transmitted through placenta.

148
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.010
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. It seems legit. No, I see where she's coming from.</v>

149
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.361
<v 1>Yup. Address the video.</v>

150
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:11.140
Hold on a second saying I think they're very respected doctors.

151
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.080
There was a woman who was spectacular. She was.

152
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.900
<v 2>Spectacular PA center. I played muddy to hear him say placenta.</v>

153
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.980
<v 1>Of hydroxy, Corcoran. I happen to think it works in early stages.</v>

154
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:26.590
So that's the problem. See when he says that,

155
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:30.370
and then the lady who believes in witchcraft says that like,

156
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.750
maybe it does work,

157
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:36.550
but the problem is a lady who believes in alien DNA and witchcraft generational

158
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.350
curse is transmitted through placenta.

159
00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.760
<v 2>It's children's toys. I mean, I've got kids now. I got to worry. I mean.</v>

160
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.480
<v 1>Which ones we do assume I'm going to go with Mr. Potato head.</v>

161
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.090
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, most of my kids,</v>

162
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.780
basically now all we got around the house and Nerf guns. Right. And so like,

163
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:53.590
anytime, you're welcome.

164
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.640
Do you remember the pink Panther where you'd and he'd walked in the house and

165
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:59.790
then Kato would like leap on him. That's what it's like around my house.

166
00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:02.910
Now you got to get popped in the air hole by a Nerf ball with a close range.

167
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.580
Cause you never know when they're going to sneak up on you and use these things.

168
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.700
And so, but that's about all we got anymore that, and uh, we,

169
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:11.610
we do have some Legos, so I'm hope she wasn't talking about Lego. If she's.

170
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.800
<v 1>Talking about Legos, then we know she's really crazy.</v>

171
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.970
<v 2>Yeah. But I think, uh, to your point again, you know, part of this is,</v>

172
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.040
it would be nice if, if, if the messaging from the white house was,

173
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.950
was better, let's face it on that. On a number of things.

174
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.600
We wouldn't have quite the chaos that we do right now. Well, he's basically.

175
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.650
<v 1>Using the same strategy, used to be a famous person. You know, you know,</v>

176
00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:37.520
he says wacky. He speaks off the cuff. He doesn't care.

177
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:40.760
He doesn't have a filter and you can't, you just can't employ.

178
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.110
It seemed like you could do that and become president, but you can't do that.

179
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:47.060
And be president. Okay.
