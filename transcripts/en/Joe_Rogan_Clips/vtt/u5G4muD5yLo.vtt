00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. We talked about the CIA's website yet.</v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.090
What about their website? Have you ever gone to it? No. Jamie,

3
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:13.200
would you mind pulling that up? I have applied for a job. What do I have.

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.120
<v 1>To do you apply for a job with the CIA?</v>

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
<v 0>Well, I want to, I was stoned and it was late at night and I'm like, wait,</v>

6
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:19.500
you can apply online.

7
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.220
<v 1>Whoa, ask Molly. There's a cartoon. Hold on. Back up.</v>

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.900
This is the CIA. Ask Molly, your CIA source on the inside.

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.220
And it's hashtag ask Molly hail and Molly hails like a hot agent.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
This week's ask Molly hill question comes from a writer who wants to know if

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.750
there is a path forward for them at CIA,

12
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.380
since they have done illegal drugs in the past. My question.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.753
<v 0>That's your question.</v>

14
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.780
<v 1>It seems like it's your question. As they have done illegal drugs in the past,</v>

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.890
let's see what Molly's answer is. Oh, let's see. Molly's answer. So it says,

16
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.560
find Molly's answer. What does Molly say?

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.870
Let me be clear in this from the get-go having previously used illegal drugs

18
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:10.410
does not immediately disqualify you from working at CIA.

19
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.380
If working for CIA is your life's goal.

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.510
And we certainly hope it is there could be a path for you here with that said

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.420
there's certain, there are certain restrictions you should be aware of,

22
00:01:21.421 --> 00:01:24.600
especially if you've used illegal drugs within the past year.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.140
Generally speaking to be eligible for CIA employment.

24
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.060
Applicants must not have used illegal drugs within the past 12 months.

25
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.720
This is as with most things,

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.160
a general rule by which to gauge your higher ability. That's on the word kids

27
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.640
type, hopefully an applicant, but, uh, not only an applicant,

28
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:50.400
but as the potential holder of a security clearance,

29
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.140
it might seem a bit archaic,

30
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.760
but consider the access to information we're giving it CA employees, uh,

31
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.940
and consequences of granting access to the wrong person.

32
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.360
How much access to information? Just read that real quick.

33
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.430
It might seem a bit archaic,

34
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.270
but consider the access to information we're giving.

35
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:12.170
It's giving CIA employees. What access.

36
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.010
<v 0>Oh, are you giving them you're in a simulator?</v>

37
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.800
That's probably the first thing they say after you get hired, they're like,

38
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:20.700
it's a simulator. We're just doing like what the programmer wants. It's like,

39
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.380
I know you're going to freak out for two months.

40
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:24.690
We're going to give you like a protocol of antidepressants.

41
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.260
Cause you can go nihilistic or absurd is when you realize you're just a string

42
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:31.440
of code that's running, but you'll get over it. And then there's an egg.

43
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:34.770
You can go. The thing reads your mind. It's kind of cool show you that later.

44
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.370
<v 1>Regularly handle classified information,</v>

45
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:42.930
which if leaked could spell disaster for national security and endangered,

46
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:47.910
the life of CIA officers is my favorite word assets and their

47
00:02:47.911 --> 00:02:50.250
family assets is one of my favorite words they use.

48
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.600
We have an asset in Jerusalem, an asset. You have an asset.

49
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.100
Is it a person? He know a guy he's an asset. He's an asset.

50
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.850
Yeah. He's got a number like what's an asset.

51
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.830
An asset is like stocks. You had an asset, you got a stock.

52
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.560
I got stock in Palestinians.

53
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.330
I got some Palestinians saved up. You've got some assets.

54
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.160
<v 0>Just some people you connected with.</v>

55
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.300
<v 1>I connect with them. They're my assets. And now you may be wondering,</v>

56
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.890
that's all fine, Molly.

57
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:27.460
But I live in a state where marijuana use was legalized under state law.

58
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.930
So why would any of this really apply? In my case, the short answer is,

59
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.090
or would any of this really apply? In my case, the short answer is yes,

60
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.250
marijuana remains illegal under federal law in

61
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.240
every state. The CIA is bound by federal law,

62
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.310
which prohibits CIA from granting security clearances to unlawful users

63
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:52.810
of controlled substances,

64
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.820
including marijuana state laws do not supersede

65
00:03:57.821 --> 00:03:59.680
those of the federal government.

66
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.570
The great Lord who looks over the land with an iron fist for more information

67
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:07.570
regarding the federal government security clearance guidelines regarding drug

68
00:04:07.571 --> 00:04:11.440
use and other considerations, you can check out the w w w w w.

69
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.920
<v 0>W what if the next line was like, Hey, what's up Joe? That's cool.</v>

70
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:17.770
You're showing this on your podcast. No.

71
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.340
<v 1>Simulation. But I.</v>

72
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.140
<v 0>Do think like in there, is there also kind of saying like that being said,</v>

73
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.650
if you can set on fire with your mind or something, when you're stoned,

74
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.350
come talk to us. It's like, you know what I mean?

75
00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:34.240
There are saying like the other cool thing.

76
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:38.690
When you look at him applying for a job is it says, uh, after you applied,

77
00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:42.130
don't tell anybody you apply for the job will like approach you regarding the

78
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.240
job, which is so cool. You can't talk about it when you apply.

79
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.150
<v 1>With me mother. Absolutely. Checking your phone.</v>

80
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.280
<v 0>They're checking your, I applied. And like,</v>

81
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:53.470
I just leaned into the fact that like, it.

82
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.910
They're going to look at everything I do.

83
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.830
And then also like imagining this some point some CIA agent might come up to me

84
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:02.740
like, Hey, what's up, man? Hey, what's going on?

85
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.340
Did you really want to be a bookkeeper at the Pentagon? No.

86
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:08.620
I wanted me to see age and dude,

87
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.940
cause I mean, you know, wouldn't you wouldn't you like to meet? No know one.

88
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.840
<v 1>You know, a CIA agent. I've had him on the podcast multiple times, Mike Baker.</v>

89
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.860
He does a lot of consulting for TV shows and security stuff. So.

90
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.770
<v 0>You're you, you are in it. And is he working for them now?</v>

91
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.860
<v 1>No. Well, yeah,</v>

92
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.830
he's a former CIA operative. What does that mean?

93
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.300
Do you really think they ever stopped talking to each other? No. No.

94
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.990
He does security clearance stuff and security studies got a whole,

95
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.883
has a security.

96
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.850
<v 0>Can I ask you a question that will probably get made into like a YouTube clip</v>

97
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.410
accusing you of being an asset of the CIA? Sure.

98
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.090
So, okay.

99
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.260
Let's imagine this one day you get contacted by somebody who's the

100
00:05:57.261 --> 00:06:01.340
CIA and they show you convincing data

101
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.850
regarding something, you know, whatever. It may be,

102
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.320
meteoric impact some other pending danger that is like,

103
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:12.740
you look at it and it's like, whatever it is, they give you, you,

104
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.270
you believe it. And they're like, listen, I, Joe, we know you're like,

105
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.690
we know that you're like a wild animal. And we know that like, you're you,

106
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:23.090
you don't want to be dishonest. And we understand that,

107
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:27.410
but we gotta figure out a way to get this kind of information out to the world.

108
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.500
Because if we don't like it, it's going to be really bad.

109
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:34.550
And we're just going to people like you and just trying to get whatever the

110
00:06:34.551 --> 00:06:36.470
thing is. They want you to say a little thing,

111
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.830
an idea of how they want you to be. And the fact they're not offering you money.

112
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.350
They're not offering you money there. And they're also like saying like,

113
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:43.880
don't worry if you say no.

114
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.950
<v 1>Did you get that job with the CIA?</v>

115
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.440
<v 0>Excuse me? Did I get the.</v>

116
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.390
<v 1>Did you get that job that you applied for? It seems like you're priming me.</v>

117
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:57.890
What for your you're you're gonna give me a suggestion later.

118
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.620
Listen, I know what you're doing, man. Joe.

119
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.070
<v 0>Have you ever thought of a blue butterfly, Joe</v>

120
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.660
[inaudible] yeah, but seriously, what would your response be? If like,

121
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.920
someone's like, look, we just need your help.

122
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.630
<v 1>Listen, I think central intelligence agency. I think FBI, I think,</v>

123
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.000
I think the DEA, I think they're all necessary.

124
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:22.340
I don't think they're unnecessary.

125
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.380
I think that most of what they're doing is trying to protect us.

126
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.130
I do think also that some of those guys turn to Cowboys and try to fly Coke back

127
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:36.290
from Mexico and crash. CIA jets.

128
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.820
That's true to all that that happened in MENA, Arkansas, you know,

129
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.030
all that that happened when Clinton was governor with Barry seals,

130
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.630
when they were running Coke back and forth and dropping off in MENA, Arkansas,

131
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.850
that guy was a CIA contractor. There's a lot of those guys that were CIA. Look,

132
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.800
they got compromised. I think, but that doesn't mean the whole CIA is bad.

133
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.520
Doesn't mean we don't need a CIA man. If you talk to people, if they're honest,

134
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:04.520
I don't know if they're, let's just assume. They're honest.

135
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.350
Have you talked to people that deal with trying to infiltrate

136
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.630
terrorist groups and deal with tracking terrorists and deal with trying to

137
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:16.580
figure out if someone's trying to make a dirty bomb,

138
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:20.000
trying to figure out if someone's ready to blow up a mall and they're in there,

139
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.990
they're doing this actively every day, all day.

140
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.680
That's essential, right? That's essential. So the CIA,

141
00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.620
oh MK ultra. They,

142
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.400
they dose people in whorehouses that there's not the same people. Okay.

143
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:37.730
This is a giant organization has been around for a long time. Right? Well,

144
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:42.290
you're hearing about from jolly west and the MK ultra, those people are dead.

145
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.130
Those are no's are not alive today, but you know who is alive today, ISIS,

146
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.580
you know, who is alive today? Oh, a lot of threats all around the world,

147
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:53.810
you know, who is alive today? Kim? Jong-un the leader of China,

148
00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:58.650
all these dictators that are heavily armed all over the world.

149
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.730
There's a lot of them. You've got to keep an eye on those. Right?

150
00:09:01.731 --> 00:09:04.350
If you don't think you have to keep an eye on him, you're crazy. Right?

151
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.580
What will the CIA is Eve? No, no, no, no. Humans are evil.

152
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.930
And sometimes you need someone who's paying attention to the evil people, right?

153
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.490
Yeah. That's what you need now.

154
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.900
Does that mean that they're not going to stray across the lines of what is

155
00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:22.260
correct and good and fair and, and, and,

156
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.940
and start spying on regular people too. No, it doesn't mean that, right?

157
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.660
It means that needs to be curbed that on American. Right.

158
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.880
But if you think someone might be a terrorist,

159
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.440
like you should be able to find out before they blow up a school totally. Right.

160
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:42.420
1%, a hundred percent. So the question is, how good are these people at,

161
00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.310
at walking? That line turns out pretty good. Turns out.

162
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:51.720
Pretty good. There's a bunch of. That's happened over time.

163
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.280
But also they've gotten Intel on all these different terrorists and all these

164
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.450
different terrible situations all over the world and probably saved a lot of

165
00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:04.800
people. It's not perfect, but nothing's perfect. It's not a thing.

166
00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.360
That's perfect. Ever,

167
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.220
whether it's the post office or police officers or fire department or

168
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.440
doctors. No, one's perfect. Including the CIA, gluten, the FBI,

169
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.760
including the army, the Navy, there's going to be problems. Right. But overall,

170
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.330
they're trying to protect. I would imagine if I had to ask, like,

171
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.230
what are you guys here for to make sure this doesn't hit the fan w pay attention

172
00:10:28.231 --> 00:10:32.880
to the retention. I do. Do some of them branch out into Coke business.

173
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.920
Yes. I'm sure some of them sell Coke.

174
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.900
I'm sure there's someone for the federal government.

175
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.560
That's selling guns to a bad guy right now. I'm sure.

176
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.120
I'm sure it's the people are people.

177
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.300
If you got a million people you're going to get 30 bad ones or whatever the the

178
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:47.040
number is. It's just part of life.

179
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.770
<v 0>Yeah. I, yeah. Look, I mean all that.</v>

<v 1>Yeah. I wearing a wire, bro. You don't have to wear a wire anymore.</v>

184
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:07.104

<v 0>Wearing a wire on a podcast. I'm monitoring you, Joe.</v>

187
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.100
