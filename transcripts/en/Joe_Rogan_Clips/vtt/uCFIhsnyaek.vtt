00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. One of the things that, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.420
Jack Dorsey has been pretty adamant about is that they really never saw this

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:11.220
coming when they started Twitter.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.880
And they didn't think that they were ever going to be in this position where

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.890
there were going to be really the arbiters of free speech for the world.

6
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.180
Right. Which is essentially in some ways what they are. I think.

7
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.280
<v 1>It's important to, to roll back the clock for people,</v>

8
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:27.890
because it's easy to think, you know,

9
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.830
that we just sort of landed here and that they would know that they're going to

10
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.630
be influencing the global psychology,

11
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.470
but I think we should really reverse engineer for the audience.

12
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.470
How did these products work the way that they did?

13
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.090
So let's go back to the beginning of the Twitter.

14
00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:44.660
I think his first tweet was something like checking out the buffaloes and golden

15
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:46.850
gate park in San Francisco. Um, you know,

16
00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:50.750
Jack was fascinated by the taxi cab dispatch system that you could send a

17
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.310
message and then all the taxis get it.

18
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.180
And the idea is could we create a dispatch system so that I post a tweet and

19
00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.680
then suddenly all these other people can see it. And, um,

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.640
the,

21
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.230
the real genius of these things was that they weren't just,

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.340
uh, offering this thing you could do. They found ways of keeping people engaged.

23
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.970
Um,

24
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.660
I think this is important for people to get that they're not competing for your

25
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.780
data or for, uh, you know,

26
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:21.710
money they're competing to keep people using the product. And so when Twitter,

27
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:22.311
for example,

28
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:26.510
invented this persuasive feature of the number of followers that you have,

29
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.580
if you remember, like that was a new thing at the time, right?

30
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.300
You log in and you see your profile. Here's the people who you can follow.

31
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:36.020
And then here's the number of followers you have that created a reason for you

32
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:38.090
to come back every day to see how many followers do I have.

33
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.750
So that was part of this race to keep people engaged.

34
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.770
As we talk about it in the film,

35
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:44.630
like these things are competing for your attention,

36
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.390
that if you're not paying for the product, you are the product.

37
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.020
But the thing that is the product is your predictable behavior.

38
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.740
You're using the product in predictable ways. And, um,

39
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.600
I remember a conversation I had with, um, someone at Facebook, uh,

40
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.350
who was a friend of mine who said in a, in a coffee shop one day,

41
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.400
people think that we, Facebook are competing with something like Twitter.

42
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.280
That one social network is competing with another social network,

43
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.510
but really he said,

44
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:15.620
our biggest competitor is YouTube because they're not competing for a social

45
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.150
network. They're competing for attention.

46
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.660
And YouTube is the biggest competitor in the digital space for attention.

47
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.170
And that was a real light bulb moment for me because you,

48
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.850
you realize that as they're designing these products, they're finding new,

49
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:30.080
clever ways to get your attention.

50
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.680
That's the real thing that I think is different in the film, the social dilemma,

51
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.120
rather than talking about, you know,

52
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.540
censorship and data and privacy and these themes, it's really,

53
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:43.520
what is the core influencer impact that the shape of these products have on how

54
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.160
we're making meaning of the world when they're steering our psychology.

55
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.380
<v 0>Right. Do you think that it was inevitable that someone manipulates the way</v>

56
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.440
people use these things to gather more attention?

57
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.590
And do you think that any of this could have been avoided if there was laws

58
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:03.130
against that? If, instead of having these algorithms,

59
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.490
that specifically target things that you're interested in,

60
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.820
or things that you click on or things that are going to make you engage more,

61
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.200
if they just allow these things to, if someone said, listen,

62
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.490
you can have these things, you can allow people to communicate with each other,

63
00:03:18.491 --> 00:03:21.100
but you can't manipulate their attention span.

64
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.930
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I think the, so we've always had an attention economy, right.</v>

65
00:03:24.931 --> 00:03:28.440
And you're competing for it right now. Um, and politicians compete for it.

66
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.140
Can you vote for someone you've never paid attention to who never heard about

67
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.950
it? Never heard them say something outrageous. No. Um,

68
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.530
so there's always been an attention economy.

69
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.130
And so it's hard to say we should regulate who gets attention or how.

70
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.590
<v 0>It's there. It's organic in some ways, right? Like this podcast is an organic,</v>

71
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.160
if we're in competition, it's organic. I just put it out there.

72
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:53.340
And if you watch it, you don't, or you don't, I don't, you know,

73
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:56.340
I don't have any say over it and I'm not manipulating it in any way.

74
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.380
<v 1>Sort of. So, I mean,</v>

75
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.580
let's imagine that the podcast apps were different and they actually,

76
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.630
while you're watching,

77
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:06.750
they had like the hearts and the stars and the kind of voting up and numbers,

78
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.460
and you could like send messages back and forth.

79
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:12.630
And apple podcasts worked in a way that didn't just reward, you know,

80
00:04:12.631 --> 00:04:14.310
the things that you clicked follow on,

81
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.330
it actually sort of promoted the stuff that someone said the most outrageous

82
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:20.730
thing. Then you, as a podcast creator,

83
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:22.980
have an incentive to say the most outrageous thing.

84
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:26.310
And then you arrive at the top of the apple podcasts or Spotify app.

85
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.180
And that's the thing is that we actually are competing for attention.

86
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.660
It felt like it was neutral and it was relatively neutral.

87
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.750
And to progress that story back in time with, um, you know,

88
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:39.360
Twitter competing for attention, let's look at some other things that they did.

89
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.110
So they also added this retweet, these instant resharing feature. Right.

90
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.020
And that made it more addictive because suddenly we're all playing the fame

91
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:46.741
lottery, right?

92
00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:49.260
Like I could retweet your stuff and then you get a bunch of hits and then you

93
00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:53.430
could go viral and you could get a lot of attention. So then instead of, um,

94
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.990
the companies competing for attention now,

95
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.170
each of us suddenly when the fame lottery over and over and over again,

96
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.680
and we're, we're getting attention. Uh, and then, um,

97
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.030
I had another example I was going to think about, I forgot it. What was it? Um,

98
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.763
you can jump in.

99
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.660
<v 0>Um, apple has an interesting way of handling sort of, uh,</v>

100
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.400
the way they have their algorithm for their podcast app

101
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.730
is it's secret. It's kind of, it's weird.

102
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.620
But one of the things that it favors is it favors new shows and it

103
00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:30.270
favors, uh, engagement in new subscribers. So comments,

104
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.600
engagement, and new shows, they're sort of like.

105
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.550
<v 1>And that's the same as competing for attention.</v>

106
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.550
Cause engagement must mean people like it and that's yeah.

107
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.250
And there's going to be a fallacy as we go down that road, but go on. It's.

108
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.900
<v 0>Interesting because you could say,</v>

109
00:05:42.901 --> 00:05:45.510
if you have a podcast and your podcast gets like,

110
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.160
let's say a hundred thousand downloads,

111
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.930
a new podcast can come along and it can get 10,000 downloads and it will be

112
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:53.250
ahead of you in the rankings.

113
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.710
And so you could be number three and it could be number two. And you're like,

114
00:05:57.711 --> 00:06:01.580
well, how was that number two? And it's 10 times less,

115
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:04.040
but they don't do it that way.

116
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.970
And their logic is they don't want the podcast world to be dominated by,

117
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.210
you know, New York times and the big ones. Yeah. And whatever.

118
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.380
Whatever's number one. And number two, and number three forever, we actually.

119
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.340
<v 1>Just experienced this. Um, we have a podcast called urine divided attention.</v>

120
00:06:18.341 --> 00:06:21.730
And since the film came out in that first month, we went from being, you know,

121
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.180
in the lower 100 or something like that till we shot to the top five,

122
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.250
I think we were the number one tech podcast for awhile.

123
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:29.200
And so we just experienced this through the fact,

124
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.250
not that we had the most listeners, but because the trend was to wrap it,

125
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:36.010
that we sort of jumped to the top. I think it's.

126
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.990
<v 0>Wise that they do that because eventually it evens out over time.</v>

127
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.900
You know, you see some people rocket to the top and like, oh my God,

128
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:46.690
we're number three. And you're like, hang on there, fella,

129
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.450
just give it a couple of weeks. And then three weeks later,

130
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:52.840
four weeks later now they're number 48. Right. They get depressed. Right.

131
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.080
But that was really where you should have been. But the,

132
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.970
the thing that apple does that I really like in that is it gives an opportunity

133
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.470
for these new shows to be seen where they might've gotten just stuck.

134
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.310
Cause these, these rankings and the ratings for a lot of these shows,

135
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.910
these shows are so consistent and they have such a following already. Yeah.

136
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.150
It's very difficult for these new shows to gather attention. Right.

137
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.310
And the problem was that there were some people that game, the system,

138
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.900
and there was companies that could literally move like Earl Skakel.

139
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.330
Remember Earl became the number one podcast.

140
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.680
And like no one was listening to it. Earl has money. And he,

141
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.200
he hired some people to game the system and he was kinda like open about it

142
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.330
and, and laughing about it now, isn't he banned from iTunes now or something?

143
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.000
I think he got banned because of that,

144
00:07:46.001 --> 00:07:47.860
because it was so obvious he gamed the system.

145
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:49.780
He had like a thousand downloads and he was number one.

146
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.680
<v 1>The thing is that we're apple podcasts.</v>

147
00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:56.830
You can think of as like the federal reserve or the government of the attention

148
00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:59.860
economy, because they're setting the rules by which you win. Right.

149
00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:03.100
They could have set the rules, as you said to be, uh, you know,

150
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.170
who has the most listeners,

151
00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:08.470
and then you just keep rewarding the Kings that already exist versus who has the

152
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:12.070
most trending. There's actually a story. Um, a friend of mine told me, I don't,

153
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:14.650
I don't know if it's true. Although was a fairly credible source.

154
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:18.970
Who said he was a meeting with Steve jobs when they were making the first

155
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:22.810
podcast app and that they had, uh,

156
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.260
made a demo of something where you could see all the things your friends were

157
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:26.831
listening to.

158
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:30.880
So just like making a newsfeed like we do with Facebook and Twitter. Right. Um,

159
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.700
and then he said was, well, why would we do that?

160
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.470
If something is important enough,

161
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.020
your friend will actually just send you a link and say,

162
00:08:38.021 --> 00:08:40.360
you should listen to this. Like,

163
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:43.870
why would we automatically just promote random things that your friends are

164
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.800
listening to? And again, this is kind of how you get back to social media.

165
00:08:47.801 --> 00:08:50.980
How has social media is so successful because it's so it's much more addictive

166
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.560
to see what your friends are doing in a feed, but it doesn't reward.

167
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:56.100
What's true or what's meaningful. And this,

168
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.920
and this is the thing that people need to get about social media is it's,

169
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.660
it's really just rewarding.

170
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:03.690
The things that tend to keep people back addictively the business model is

171
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:06.330
addiction in this race to the bottom of the brainstem for attention.

172
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.960
