<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.400
<v 2>The problem is those preppers.</v>

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.360
They're just a little too paranoid and they it up for everybody else. Yeah.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.420
&lt;laugh&gt;.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.640
<v 1>You know what I'm saying? That's why you can't buy bullets right now.</v>

6
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.560
<v 0>You can't buy bullets right now.</v>

7
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.480
I need people need to know this people out there that don't own guns.

8
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.190
First of all, gun ownership, radically priest in 2020, correct.

9
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.750
And gun purchases went up and then bullet purchases

10
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.584
went up and.

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.150
<v 1>And they're hoarding. 'em all. I mean, they can't even make 'em fast enough.</v>

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.110
I mean, you're talking to a guy who got shot in 92. I how'd. You shot ah,

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.630
carjacking. Uh, yeah. I was a police officer, officer.

14
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.750
Where'd you show me an arm came in, uh,

15
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.060
back here on my shoulder and came out down here.

16
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.620
<v 0>You were a police officer back then.</v>

17
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.220
<v 1>Dude.</v>

18
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.020
I was a police officer firefighter and paramedic before I was old enough to

19
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.180
drink. That's crazy. Little bit of an overachiever.

20
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.380
<v 0>Wow. That's CRA how you get involved in that? How old were you when you joined.</v>

21
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.780
<v 1>The force? Uh, I went in the police academy in 18.</v>

22
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.210
<v 0>Yeah. You could be a cop at, uh.</v>

23
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.530
<v 1>I got my certification when I was 19.</v>

24
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.610
<v 0>That is crazy. When did you, when were you on the force pulling people over?</v>

25
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.890
<v 1>Uh, late 19. That.</v>

26
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.620
<v 0>Is so.</v>

27
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.490
<v 1>Crazy. Yeah. I spent some time in, uh,</v>

28
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.650
a little suburb of Dallas called Alvarado and then I ended up at the Tarran

29

county constable's office. Uh,

30
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.720
and then I ended up getting hired on a city up there at Capel and, uh,

31
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.680
spent, uh, they put me through the fire academy and, uh, uh, medic school.

32
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.360

35
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.230
<v 0>So you were 22 and you were stopping a car.</v>

36
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.710
