00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.530
That was trying to get to know that the crime element is more than so I knew all

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.270
the lawyers and I went over to Bimini one day to, uh, to,

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.500
to get some real information about them because they couldn't in the U S they

5
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:20.760
were scared to talk. So I, I located through a defense lawyer,

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.300
a couple of some guys in, uh, in Bimini.

7
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:29.150
I went down there and I met with them and they were talking and because Bimini

8
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.920
was another kind of world, there was, the government was on the take there,

9
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:32.754
I think.

10
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.780
And they had a lot of speedboats going out of there every night at the hotel

11
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.853
towards the, you know,

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.780
Bimini is very close to Miami and I was doing Coke at that time. And I got,

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.300
when my wife, she was my cover and I, you know, and I,

14
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.520
a Hollywood screenwriter, he wants to talk to you. He did midnight express.

15
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.160
They liked that, you know, they want to know about the business,

16
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:57.330
but then in the middle of this, we're all coked up in the hotel. You know,

17
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:01.440
the way conversation goes and I drop a name, uh, just like that. You know,

18
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:05.340
a guy I talked to, well, he'd been a defense lawyer when I talked to him,

19
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.480
but in the past,

20
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.710
he'd been in a prosecutor because prosecutors often flipped to defense attorneys

21
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:13.510
to make more money. So when I mentioned that name,

22
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.670
two of these three guys got really uptight and they walked, they,

23
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.150
they excused themselves, went in the bathroom. When I, I said, I up,

24
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.810
I knew I'd up. And I didn't know what was going to come out of that bathroom.

25
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:27.420
You know, if they thought I was some kind of cop,

26
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.930
some kind of undergrad informer, because they didn't,

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.320
they hated that prosecutor that put them on, you know, put one of them away.

28
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.080
So a few minutes went by there and it was pretty hairy. Uh, but, uh,

29
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.970
I think I was paranoid,

30
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.660
but because they came out and they didn't have guns in their hands, but they,

31
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.050
they cut the meeting off. And, you know, I went back to my room.

32
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:52.950
They were staying in the same hotel all night. I was tense because I, you know,

33
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:55.470
I knew they could come and get me. It was their hotel. They own,

34
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.330
they own the island. Right. But it was nerve wracking. And I got out of there.

35
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:04.830
First thing in the morning, the whole point is you say the wrong word sometimes,

36
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.610
and you're dead. That's the, that's the kind of tension I wanted for this movie.

37
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:12.780
I put it into the scene early in the picture where Mr. Pachino Alica,

38
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:17.760
what goes into make a pickup, make us a trade. And, uh, he says, you know,

39
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.160
he senses something's off in this meeting.

40
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.450
And it becomes that blood blood bath with the dismemberment you remember,

41
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.790
and the chain saw.

42
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.970
<v 1>There was a chain sauce murder at one point. Yeah, no,</v>

43
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.160
there was two moments where I was like,

44
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:36.170
this is a real opportunity for us to come together.

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.560
And one of them was the moment the lockdown happened.

46
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.060
It felt to me very similar to right after nine 11,

47
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:48.860
where everybody was confronted with their own mortality, like holy, like we,

48
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.560
we might be on the verge of a pandemic,

49
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:56.480
like in a movie where a lot of the people we know die and here we have to

50
00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:58.460
be kind to each other. We have to be, now, this is what's important.

51
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.020
Family's important. And I remember thinking I've never been closer to my family.

52
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.850
Never been closer to my friends.

53
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.790
We're calling each other all the time where we were. It was like, it was,

54
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.840
there was, there was real hope in that. I was like, if we get through this,

55
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.030
we're going to be tighter. We're going to know what means something,

56
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:17.110
what counts it does. standup comedy, everything else, man.

57
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.480
What's important is love and friendship.

58
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.170
Then it started to get angry.

59
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.030
It only took like three or four weeks where people started getting like they

60
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.270
were scared. So people started getting shittier with each other online.

61
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.390
And then I basically swore off Twitter. I was like,

62
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.180
this is just too toxic and too hostile.

63
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.530
The second moment where I thought we had the opportunity to come together was

64
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.930
George Floyd. So George Floyd died.

65
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.820
And all of a sudden you have these black lives matter protests. And I'm like,

66
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.720
maybe we can finally make a dent on racism.

67
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:55.960
Maybe we can finally make a dent in police brutality.

68
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.830
Maybe this is a moment where we can come together and realize what's important

69
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:04.660
is community solidarity, that we were all in this together. Like this is crazy.

70
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.680
And then the cops need to be reformed. Like they can't live like,

71
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.950
and maybe we should take into account PTSD. Maybe we should take into account.

72
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.520
The fact that these guys are pulling up on people every day that might shoot

73
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:16.061
them in the face.

74
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.090
They might never be able to see their family and their kids let's rework.

75
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:22.900
This let's think this through. Nope. Then chaos.

76
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:25.750
And then all of a sudden it became like what we saw yesterday,

77
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.140
where they're breaking into Amazon, go in Seattle.

78
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.560
Like that guy owns the Washington post.

79
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.630
He owns the most left wing newspaper in America. And you're like,

80
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:38.830
not good enough.

81
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.980
<v 2>Well, you saw these set up by like a fake guillotine outside of,</v>

82
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.670
besides his house in Washington, DC. And it's, it's just, it's madness.

83
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:47.730
I told rich, I totally agree with you, by the way. Like when, when the,

84
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.481
when COVID happened,

85
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.390
I thought I can't really see how we're going to split in partisan fashion over

86
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.140
this thing.

87
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.860
Like everybody wants to live and everybody would also like to eventually get

88
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:57.900
back to regular life and the better we can live,

89
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.720
the better we can get back to regular life. So it seems like, okay,

90
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.450
we're on board. When it came to the lockdowns, the original lockdowns,

91
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.200
I was like, okay, I'm on board. You know, I'm,

92
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.510
I'm taking this thing really seriously.

93
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:08.790
I've got parents in they're in their sixties. I feel like, you know,

94
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:12.660
I'm in good health. I'm, I'm fairly young. I'm 36. But for my parents, I don't,

95
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:13.830
I don't want my parents getting this thing.

96
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.230
And so we're still taking this thing real seriously. I mean,

97
00:05:16.231 --> 00:05:18.840
I'm still wearing a mask around in public places. And I think people should,

98
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:20.100
I think that's a responsible thing to do,

99
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.880
but it immediately turned into who can we blame for this? Who can we blame?

100
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.990
Who's doing it wrong.

101
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.710
And it seems like there were only like a couple of things that you really can do

102
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.980
that are obviously wrong. Like nobody has a good solution on this thing. Okay.

103
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.680
Ravaged Italy. It ravaged Spain. It, it ravaged New York. Like there,

104
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:37.590
there are a couple of things you shouldn't do.

105
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:39.930
Don't take the olds and send them back into the nursing homes with COVID. Right.

106
00:05:39.931 --> 00:05:42.540
I mean, that's like an obvious one, but beyond that,

107
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.170
like just staying away from each other and socially distancing. And we're like,

108
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.380
this is all kind of common sensical stuff that people have known since the flu

109
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.900
pandemic event, 1918, like nothing, nothing has really changed.

110
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.330
And yet it immediately turned into who can we blame?

111
00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:56.250
Who's who's to blame for all these dead people.

112
00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:59.300
Maybe it's Ron DeSantis or maybe it's Cuomo, like who, who can we blame?

113
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.120
So that was terrible. And then on the Floyd stuff, I had the same feelings.

114
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.090
Like, I don't know, a single human being who watched that tape and didn't think,

115
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.520
okay, that guy deserves to go to jail Shelvin right there.

116
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.370
The officer in that case, in the George Floyd test, everyone,

117
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.370
I know every single person was like, yeah, that's that's real bad.

118
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:14.630
Like that's cops,

119
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.780
like I know tons of cops I'm friendly with tons of cops and not one of them was

120
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:19.880
like, yeah, that's good police procedure. I'm glad he did that. Like,

121
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:22.630
no one thought that. And so when people are like, okay, well,

122
00:06:22.631 --> 00:06:23.990
we're going to look at police brutality.

123
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.910
Maybe we'll take a look at qualified immunity.

124
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.000
Maybe we'll take a look at police unions and the kind of restrictive covenants

125
00:06:29.001 --> 00:06:32.270
that they have with the cities and how we make sure that everybody knows who's

126
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:34.400
the bad cops are. So they can't get hired at different places.

127
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.580
Like all those are solutions, but it quickly turned from, well,

128
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.890
we don't want to talk about solutions. Solutions are a bad idea.

129
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:43.910
What we need to do is we need to shout about everything we can possibly imagine

130
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.300
all at once. And you know what, instead, let's have a conversation about like,

131
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.710
was George Washington, a bad guy? Let's have a conversation instead about like,

132
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.180
just completely defunding the police.

133
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.910
We don't have like a responsible conversation about things that make sense.

134
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.860
We'll talk about like, what if we just got rid of the police?

135
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 3>So the map is what we call semi malleable.</v>

136
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.710
It's not a rigid concrete hardwired map.

137
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.530
<v 1>So what makes you think that this ups peak is like damage?</v>

138
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.370
<v 3>Well, so I asked Eddie about this, um, Eddie Chang, my friend,</v>

139
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.250
this neurosurgeon who has, you know, kind of premiere world, not kind of,

140
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:18.310
he is the world expert on speech and language and the neural transformations and

141
00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:21.250
how it controls the pharynx, all that stuff. And I said,

142
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.840
what's with the up speak thing. He said, yeah, you know, we see that sometimes.

143
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:29.200
And I'm concerned about that. And when a neurosurgeon tells you their concern,

144
00:07:29.201 --> 00:07:30.700
you kind of go, okay, what are you concerned about? He goes,

145
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.830
there's something wrong with the map and this kind of, you know, well,

146
00:07:35.831 --> 00:07:40.010
he just thinks that the map would shows up kind of normally in, in most,

147
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.890
this is probably the first time in human history.

148
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:44.530
People have used this up speak. It's also the first time in human history.

149
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:46.060
People have, you know, typed with their thumbs.

150
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.930
<v 1>Two guys at the airport back when you can go to the airport. And these two guys,</v>

151
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.250
the airport we're talking in ups beak. And it was like, as clear as day to me,

152
00:07:54.251 --> 00:07:57.940
like they were letting each other, know that they're in the tribe. And, uh,

153
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:58.211
you know,

154
00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:02.020
I remember Jamie had a tech problem once and he was on the phone with this lady

155
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.450
who was doing ups speak when she was talking to him.

156
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.570
And we both looked at each other like, okay, yuck.

157
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.890
<v 3>It does kind of create a kind of visceral, like, like nauseous.</v>

158
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.210
<v 1>You trust those people.</v>

159
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.230
I can't trust someone who talks like that because I know you're on original.

160
00:08:17.231 --> 00:08:18.970
Like you're not, not what not.

161
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.310
Most of us are clearly at least mostly influenced by the people around

162
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:26.680
us. But it's not just that. It's like,

163
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:31.210
you've changed how you talk to fit in with this.

164
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.890
There's a tech world. There's tech language, that's tech speak,

165
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:39.850
it's English, but it's tech speak English. It's letting you know.

166
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.630
And there does seem to be a body response to spinal extension.

167
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.380
I don't trust them. I don't trust them. I think they're sneaky.

168
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.980
<v 3>Well, I'll try and get the data from I'll try and get the data from Eddie.</v>

169
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.000
<v 1>Halfway, joking here. If you're like a ups speed person, like, Hey man,</v>

170
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.020
I've always loved your show, but then you said you don't trust people to talk,

171
00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:01.590
like meet joking, but also stop doing that.

172
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.900
Stop doing that. I know what you're doing.

173
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.263
<v 3>I think, um,</v>

174
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.070
I think Eddie would say that there's some distortion in the way they're using

175
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:10.790
this map, but.

176
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.630
<v 1>How did it start? I think it started with one really smart person.</v>

177
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.980
Who's probably a little autistic who talked like that because they were trying

178
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:21.800
to keep it together. And then everyone else was like,

179
00:09:21.801 --> 00:09:25.190
I want to be as smart as John. And then they started talking like that.

180
00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:26.690
And then it became a thing.

181
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:31.580
<v 4>Yeah. I tend to, um, I like broken wingers. I like, uh,</v>

182
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.740
help folks that, you know, I had, um,

183
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.300
I grew up in Queens and Howard beach and it was a for whatever reason,

184
00:09:38.301 --> 00:09:40.700
organized crime capital, a world. And this is gonna sound crazy.

185
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:44.510
But my neighbor was one of the big bosses. And one day I was preteens,

186
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:47.450
he said to me, you know, the best thing we could do on this earth, I said, well,

187
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.200
he said help people. There's a guy that killed people for a living. And um,

188
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.860
because that, that was his, his perspective was he, he was a protector, right.

189
00:09:54.861 --> 00:09:58.670
He would help people, even though from the outside, we know what they really do.

190
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.970
But, um, but it stuck with me. You gotta help people.

191
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:04.550
So this was one of those people I helped.

192
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.800
<v 1>Isn't it crazy that sometimes even people that are just, you would look at them,</v>

193
00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:13.130
they're like, they're bad people. They have some good advice.

194
00:10:13.131 --> 00:10:17.840
Like even morons can occasionally say something like, huh, all right.

195
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.900
I got that. You know, like every now and then, like, even,

196
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.890
even a real fool will say something that makes a whole lot of sense.

197
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.010
<v 4>Changed my life. This guy, he, he, um, he said to me,</v>

198
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.070
my parents were going through a divorce. I'm 12 years old and he,

199
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.750
he wants to help me. So he says, come over him.

200
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.800
You're going to clean our swimming pool for us. I don't pay a $35 a week. So,

201
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.350
um, I come over on Saturday morning. He says, all right,

202
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:46.880
the first lesson he sent me down for lessons. First lesson is, uh,

203
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:51.320
if you're going to come at eight, am you show up 7 45, right on time is late.

204
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.620
Great lesson for life. Second lesson is, uh,

205
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.890
if I'm paying you to clean the pool, I want you to straighten up the shed,

206
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.380
straighten up all the lawn furniture, clean the windows,

207
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:03.470
do whatever the you have to do, but make it so that when I get home,

208
00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:06.320
I can't live without you. You are irreplaceable.

209
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.890
As far as the service provider and number three, never asked for money.

210
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.290
You'll get paid. If you do a good job.

211
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.870
And it just stuck with me for life and really, really good lessons from an, an,

212
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.540
like you say, like a most unlikely source. Yeah.
