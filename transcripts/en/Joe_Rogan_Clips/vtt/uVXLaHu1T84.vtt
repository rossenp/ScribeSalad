00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Oh, who's the surgeon.</v>

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.640
<v 1>Who's the surgeon general right now. I don't know. Or CDC is that Redfield?</v>

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.920
I don't know. I'm sure he is a competent physician.

4
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.760
I also think that there's a whole thing about pretending that masks don't work

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.000
masks don't work in the general population. Please don't buy them.

6
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:21.630
Our healthcare. People need them. Is that what they're saying? Well,

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:23.790
that's what they've been saying. Right? And so the,

8
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.430
the issue is that you have some piece of nonsense. So the.

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.750
<v 0>The, that is a piece of nonsense because California's now changing their</v>

10
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.430
recommendation and saying, if you're going.

11
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.990
<v 1>Out in public, you should, it's not just nonsense. It's deadly nonsense.</v>

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.870
It's deadly physician killing nonsense. I mean,

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.380
I'm trying smiles, everyone smile. &lt;laugh&gt; um, yeah,

14
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.820
I mean, what we have is a,

15
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:51.140
is a situation in which we knew that the mask and personal protective equipment

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.660
supplies are wildly off to say nothing of ventilators and ICU beds.

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.460
And now what do we do about it? So we have rules, like,

18
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:04.730
please don't bring S to work because it scares the patients or,

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.010
um, please don't, uh, wear homemade masks, um,

20
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.050
because they might actually be more, uh, germ filledll &lt;laugh&gt; or virus filled.

21
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.690
So you're back propagating what you wish to be true,

22
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.560
to get the action that you're looking for. What we have is a prisoner's dilemma,

23
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.000
where if everybody runs and buys up masks,

24
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.760
who like the people we need to be protected most are the heroes who are actually

25
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:32.920
dealing with, you know,

26
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.000
multiple COVID patients and taking huge amounts of viral load.

27
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.600
So there's no question in my mind that those,

28
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.720
those are the people that is a society.

29
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.910
If you would level with us that there is a speech to give,

30
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.390
which would go like this. Um, you know, my fellow Americans, uh,

31
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.390
as readiness are,

32
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.110
I am forced to tender my resignation effective Friday this week. Uh,

33
00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.150
I have failed to heed many of the warnings in our academic literature because

34
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.430
our reserves are severely depleted.

35
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.420
It is Herve that we not suffer further loss of life. And therefore I am, uh,

36
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.460
forced to make an unusual request. Having failed you.

37
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.380
I'm asking everyone who stockpiled masks for personal use to think about

38
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.500
doing something sacrificial for the good of us.

39
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:23.420
All our heroes are currently exposed to the coronavirus and taking huge amounts

40
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:24.254
of our load.

41
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.490
And I'm asking you to donate any unused masks that you have, uh,

42
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.810
to this population. As we are desperately trying to replenish our stocks,

43
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.610
please continue to shelter in place and recognize that the benefit to you is

44
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:39.450
minor. And the benefit to us all is major.

45
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.840
And this will be following your heroic impulse to bring us together as a nation.

46
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.880
First of all, is there a.

47
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.520
<v 0>Readiness Asar? No. Okay. Second of all, no, one's gonna say that.</v>

48
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:53.400
They're they're never gonna admit, they're gonna say we are to hell adjusting.

49
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.440
I don't care. Our we're adjusting our recommendations based.

50
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.320
<v 1>On the new, no, Joe, I am. I'm gonna be completely unreasonable.</v>

51
00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.600
I know I have this mode where I just, I become completely unreasonable.

52
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.000
Go ahead. This is, if, if that's where we are, then it's time to revolt, revolt.

53
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.960
How? I don't know. Well, we need people, civil, civil, civil disobedience,

54
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.720
like to put our healthcare people. I mean,

55
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.590
I have not been off my property for weeks reason. I'm here in part is,

56
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.390
um, to do what little I can.

57
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.550
And it's very little to support the people who we,

58
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.590
who are our literal heroes, our life and death,

59
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:32.590
putting theirel themselves in harms way.

60
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.270
The idea of hospital administrators abusing our physicians and nurses

61
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.980
makes me app oplectic with rage.

62
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.220
The fact that these people are told that they can't talk to the press and they

63
00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:45.900
write to me and their, their family and their children write to me.

64
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.660
My mother was asked to do this. My uncle works in a prison.

65
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.980
He's not allowed to wear a mask. He's not allowed to bring a mask.

66
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.860
I send a mask, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah,

67
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:56.660
there's a lot of those stories. Okay. Yeah. What the hell is wrong?

68
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.340
It is time for these people to resign and it is.

69
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.530
And for us to remember that we have the ability to turn over our own government.

70
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.250
This is, we are so unprepared as a nation,

71
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.330
and we have been sold out for so long by our self-appointed leadership class,

72
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.180
who nobody wants that.

73
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.930
We either remember who we are and how this game is play. I mean, this is like,

74
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.690
this is a pre-war footing and this can easily lead to war.

75
00:04:26.691 --> 00:04:31.490
The transmission mechanism is you have everybody stay indoors because you're

76
00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:34.930
worried about deaths of accountability, which is, you know,

77
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.930
I don't think they're worried about the number of deaths.

78
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:40.130
I think they're worried about deaths that result from triage and that would

79
00:04:40.131 --> 00:04:43.480
result in career ending action. Yeah. This.

80
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.240
<v 0>Is what you were saying on the phone. You,</v>

81
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:47.360
you think that's really what's bothering.

82
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.720
<v 1>Them. Yes. And then,</v>

83
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.600
but if we all have to stay home while they replenish our supplies,

84
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.680
then the economy goes into recession. Recession can become depression,

85
00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.560
depressions lead to armed conflict. And our armed conflict leads to war.

86
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.750
That would be a transmission mechanism from these stupid masks to

87
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.550
stump something that nobody can handle. And my it here,

88
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:09.030
here's the thing we are coming up on Passover.

89
00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.230
And we Jews have a tradition that I wish everybody had,

90
00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:15.590
which is that we read one stupid story every God year,

91
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.190
just to drill it into your head, to make sure it's always fresh.

92
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.780
And this is when it's time to leave. When it's time change,

93
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.820
don't wait for the bread to rise. This is what I say to every Jewish person.

94
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.500
Like you're sitting around waiting for the bread to rise because they all know

95
00:05:30.501 --> 00:05:30.901
the story,

96
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:35.860
which is you eat the Moza because the people who waited for the bread to rise

97
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.540
are no longer with us. And their descendants are no longer with us.

98
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.450
And it is time to revolt. This ship class is unworkable.

99
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.610
The reason that you and I both came to the word ULSI instantly,

100
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.810
I don't think you took much deliberation is because ULSI would know what

101
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:53.644
to do.

102
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 0>Well, she's also the least encumbered. Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.800
She's the least burdened by yeah. The, every.

104
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.840
<v 1>Everybody in the system hates her. Yeah. You know,</v>

105
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:06.520
and the whole point is it's kinda hilarious. She would put heads on Pikes. Yeah.

106
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.360
This is the moment for heads on Pikes and, and, and it's important.

107
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:13.400
It's not a vengeance thing. The,

108
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.990
the importance is what is the cost to you?

109
00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:21.550
Killing people by failing to heed the academic literature. If, if a supply was,

110
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:26.070
was, um, depleted and you didn't replenish it, what is the cost to you?

111
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.990
<v 0>Well, there's lessons in how other countries have,</v>

112
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.030
have viewed this and how they chose to act particularly South Korea, right?

113
00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:37.660
South Korea acted quicker. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, um, smaller popul than us,

114
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.740
but a much smaller impact to the virus. They shut things down very quickly.

115
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.723
Yeah.

116
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.780
<v 0>Singapore, I don't know how Singapore does very, very aggressive, same thing.</v>

118
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.180
<v 1>Uh, I think that they, you know, they use surveillance and tracking and,</v>

119
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.020
you know, making sure that they visited anybody was known. I mean,

120
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.780
they had a different system and, and,

121
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.170
and as people like you and me who love our civil liberties,

122
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.170
I believe that in part Singapore's draconian society lives off

123
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.410
of things that only we can do due to our freedom. Hmm.

124
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.770
So you have to realize that freedom is itself an export.

125
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:12.170
And one of the great dangers is,

126
00:07:12.171 --> 00:07:16.890
is that China has been exporting the benefits of freedom from the United States

127
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.760
into an authoritarian system so that they get the benefits of both worlds.

128
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.760
They get the benefits of our middle finger,

129
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:25.920
which I think is the secret of American innovation.

130
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.000
And they get the benefits of authoritarianism where they can do things that we

131
00:07:30.001 --> 00:07:32.840
can't because they can order people to do the unconscionable. Mm.

132
00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.720
So my feeling is I'm on team,

133
00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.030
civil liberties and team civil liberties has to be

134
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.550
somewhat nationalistic, more militaristic, more command and control.

135
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.590
Like who would you take orders from? So in a lot of fields,

136
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.510
I'd take orders from you. You're the big dog in this space, you know,

137
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.790
and to the extent that you wanted to coordinate something,

138
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.870
I would use my channel. I would subordinate to you.

139
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:00.460
And I would want sometimes people to subordinate to me if I have,

140
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:04.420
if I was taking a lead on something important when we have this fear of

141
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:04.981
leadership,

142
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:08.580
because we're all so individualistic that we never want to take an order,

143
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.660
like whenever I'm training a new assistant or something,

144
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.380
one of my always best practices is, uh, can I get you coffee?

145
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.130
You know, it's very important to that.

146
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.050
The ability to ask to serve somebody else,

147
00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:26.370
and the ability to lead are tied.

148
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.090
You have to be a follower to be a leader and a leader to be a follower.

149
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.730
You can't, you shouldn't be one or the other we need right now,

150
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.970
a more war. We need more of a war footing. We need a war president.

151
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.920
We need, we need war senators.

152
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.560
We need people of this mentality because the nap is coming to an end.

153
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.000
And I do think Nancy Pelosi needs to resign. And bill de Blasio needs to resign.

154
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.360
I think that this administration, uh, you know,

155
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.800
made some good moves and fumbled the ball.

156
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.080
And I believe that past administrations made some good moves and fumbled the

157
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.960
ball and the, the,

158
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.520
the imperative is to stop back propagating what you want to have,

159
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.800
what you want us to do,

160
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:12.760
like defeat a prisoner's dilemma and come up with the lie that

161
00:09:12.761 --> 00:09:15.310
would cause us to act self rationally.

162
00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:18.390
Like if you tell me that a mask is actually more dangerous in my hands,

163
00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.790
because it becomes germ filledll, then the idea is like, oh, okay.

164
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.150
So I guess I won't use the mask. Well, yeah, because you lied to me.

165
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.830
And the idea is that that's what you're trying to do.

166
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.670
You're F you're trying to say what would need to be true to get you to do what I

167
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:31.504
want.

168
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.110
<v 0>I don't understand what you're saying about these masks. What are you saying?</v>

169
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:39.300
<v 1>So if I, for example, um, let's imagine that I don't want to put belts in cars.</v>

170
00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.300
Okay. And I say, you know, Joe, a seatbelt could trap you,

171
00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:45.660
should your car go into the water off of a bridge.

172
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.020
You could in fact die from the seatbelt because you'd become entangled and would

173
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:50.460
not be able to save yourself. Right. But.

174
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.900
<v 0>The problem with that analogy is belts actually do save lives on belts,</v>

175
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.720
but is it,

176
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.530
is it possible bull that they're just acting poorly with this mask

177
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:00.030
thing,

178
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.610
but that masks actually can contain a lot of viruses and they can hold onto

179
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:04.850
virus.

180
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.130
<v 1>See that can kill you, but do you believe that's what I'm trying to do?</v>

181
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.930
I'm trying to say it as a related rate problem.

182
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.290
Let's talk about everybody who gets sick and dies from contaminated masks.

183
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.810
Everybody who gets sick and dies from a, feel, a false feeling of safety.

184
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.240
Let's just go through a huge list of every bad thing.

185
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.273
<v 0>I see the analogy. Okay.</v>

186
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.960
<v 1>And now the idea is, think about all the lives saved because of masks,</v>

187
00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:26.240
both in terms of transmission, which I don't cough on you.

188
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.880
I cough into the mask mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or in terms of,

189
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:32.120
I don't breathe in either aerosolized or droplets, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

190
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.960
And now the, the two are real,

191
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.030
but you're focusing on like the seatbelt deaths of entanglement,

192
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.790
right? Because you actually have a, uh, a covert agenda and like.

193
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.990
<v 0>And you're, what do you think their covert agenda is?</v>

194
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.790
<v 1>Oh, I don't know exactly. But if you, if I had to speculate, I'd go like,</v>

195
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.190
go like this one were terrified of triage deaths,

196
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.740
deaths that occurred simply because we didn't have enough horses that were

197
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.620
mandated to be stockpiled or talked about in the literature.

198
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:03.300
That's one thing they're cause there's liability, then there's liability,

199
00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:04.061
which is, oh,

200
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:08.420
we were following the surgeon General's recommendation at the time. Now,

201
00:11:08.421 --> 00:11:11.500
if somebody suddenly found, you know, like all the masks in the world,

202
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.220
I think that the surgeon general would suddenly say the science has become

203
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:15.054
conclusive.

204
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:21.330
<v 0>Mm &lt;affirmative&gt;. Because there would no longer be a worry about liability.</v>

205
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.570
You would just get those masks to the.

206
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.890
<v 1>People. You'd, you'd get the masks to the people who need them.</v>

207
00:11:24.891 --> 00:11:27.850
And then you'd stop transmission. You'd slow. Transions, uh,

208
00:11:27.851 --> 00:11:29.650
transmissions by don't you think there's.

209
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:33.570
<v 0>Also a lot of just figuring it out as they go along. No, I'm not tired.</v>

210
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:34.130
That's a lot of what's.

211
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.730
<v 1>Going on with that. No, there is figuring this out.</v>

212
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:37.970
As it goes along as regards the masks,

213
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.000
I believe that everybody knows that masks save lives on balance.

214
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.280
They know that the people who need the most, um, have very weird rules.

215
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.920
Um, there's this whole thing about the states versus the federal government.

216
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:55.680
There's this issue about price gouging and price mechanisms? Uh,

217
00:11:55.681 --> 00:11:56.920
they're all sorts of things.

218
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.720
Stopping the mask problem from being sorted out.

219
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.480
One of which is the number of masks that are produced in China.

220
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:09.200
And the fact that we may have sent masks and personal protective equipment to

221
00:12:09.201 --> 00:12:10.034
China.

222
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.420
So there's a hu huge issue of accountability and responsibility,

223
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:19.260
and that we're back propagating our response. How much are we quarantined?

224
00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:22.980
And how much are we locked down? What are we saying about, um,

225
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.103
about what,

226
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.020
why the physicians are being told not to wear masks when they're seeing

227
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:32.500
patients? I mean, I'm talking about deadly nonsense,

228
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.690
deadly struck nonsense. And if people like you and me,

229
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.050
don't call this out,

230
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.930
using like these crazy channels that we have,

231
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.370
then the, then the narrative just stands.

232
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.050
And so partially what we're doing is a parallel sense,

233
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.890
making operation to the standard media, which is Twitter said, we,

234
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.640
we will now be removing tweets if you contradict official authoritative health

235
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:02.840
sources. So that's just what I did search in general is lying.

236
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.760
CDC's lying. W H O is lying. Come at me.

237
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.590
<v 2>Okay.</v>
