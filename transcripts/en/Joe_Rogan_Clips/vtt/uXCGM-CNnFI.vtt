00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 2>Is just amazing, you know, on paper I was telling,</v>

3
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.580
I was telling Charlotte them all, they're like on paper, on paper,

4
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:11.550
you put down my stats. No, one's going to pick me on a fight.

5
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.810
What the is this guy next? You know what I mean? But, but then,

6
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.040
but then there's one thing there's that there's that mental part and end that

7
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.460
hard part that you can't measure. You can't measure the mental whatever,

8
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.950
and that's that crazy land part. You know what I mean? Like,

9
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:29.730
people don't know what the crazy land is. So if they see this guy like, okay,

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.290
well he got a passport to crazy land, but this is that all, you know, out of 10,

11
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:38.220
like threes. And, and this is the guy he's like nine, nine, all nines,

12
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.530
but he w maybe couple of tens in there,

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.140
but he don't have a password to crazy night and be like, crazy land.

14
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.190
This guy is great. Right? And then when you go in day, you find out that like,

15
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.910
most of the time, the guys with the passport, the crazy lads is, uh, the crazy,

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:51.744
you know.

17
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.940
<v 0>I think figure out a way to, they figure it out.</v>

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.870
Like the sum of all your parts is not that, that like,

19
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.300
that doesn't equal a championship fighter.

20
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.000
Like the mind is such an important part of.

21
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.110
<v 1>And I, and I was, uh, I was talking to him outside, back to that conversation.</v>

22
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:10.870
I was telling him like, whenever I talked to an upper calmer or, or,

23
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:11.820
or my friends,

24
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.750
or I see people training and they training hard or doing this and that.

25
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.470
And I'm just like, bro, this is crazy. Like, like most of us in the UFC already,

26
00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:23.880
right. I was like, guys, there comes a point where like, you pretty much good.

27
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.960
Like everything can get you by, you got here ready, but not only two different.

28
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:32.850
That's gonna get you to the top. 15 is mental. And then from 15 to 10,

29
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.930
the only difference between those guys is mental. And then from,

30
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.930
from 10 to five, same day and it from champion and everybody else,

31
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.720
it's a mental, it's a mentality thing.

32
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:45.170
Is this something that to do with IQ and something?

33
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.670
That's the only thing to changed? Like, we're all good.

34
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.480
We're all at the Mecca of fighting. The UFC is where everybody wants to be,

35
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.240
but what makes you a champ? What makes me a champion?

36
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:57.750
You not something I'd be like, you can live more wasted meatal.

37
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.000
You know what I mean? Like we were to see if we're the same way class.

38
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.940
You're stronger than me. You're faster than me. What is the difference?

39
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.803
What is the difference?

40
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.160
I believe it's that passports crazy line is that mentally is that,

41
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.080
is that things like I'm willing to do something that I don't know if you even

42
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:14.010
thought of doing it,

43
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.370
or if it's presented with you that if you're going to take that chance,

44
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.030
you know, and.

45
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.410
<v 0>And it's, it's that,</v>

46
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:23.580
but it's also your willing to put the intensity into your training camps and the

47
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:27.840
focus and dedication into your craft that maybe some people aren't,

48
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.260
and maybe sometimes people that are really talented things come a little too

49
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.320
easy for them and they don't want to work as hard.

50
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.200
<v 1>Exactly. That's, that's the, that's the downfall with a lot of these guys,</v>

51
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.610
you know, a lot of these guys is like,

52
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.140
they're just like all stars in their town and playing regular sports.

53
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.810
You know what I mean? She had all the time, they're just all sorts of towns,

54
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.160
whatever. And then they go to the other stuff. And then to just another guy,

55
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.400
there's somebody that's faster, stronger embedded in you. You know what I mean?

56
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:57.480
And then when they get their sort of pushing duty, they never had to.

57
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.440
And then there's that kid that was just always just kind of made the team and

58
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:06.280
then he's there with you. And he sees that and he see you break and pushes him.

59
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.980
And then now he's about he's with those guys. That's just,

60
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.160
who's those guys whose freak athletes, but they all have the mind,

61
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:13.960
but this guy don't have the freak at this,

62
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.640
but he get the mind and he's hanging with him.

63
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.070
Cause he's figuring out a way to do it. You know,

64
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.480
you have some of the toughest guys or younger brothers have tough guys. Oh yes.

65
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.040
Cause you had to take the. You got to take the. You know what I mean?

66
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.360
Like it is, they become durable. Yeah. It was, it was kind of backwards,

67
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.510
uh, growing up when my brother like I'm the middle child,

68
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:37.240
but my brother is four years older than me and my older brother and my,

69
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.210
my younger brother is a one year younger than me.

70
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.360
But so it was kind of backwards. Like it wasn't like, uh,

71
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.890
my older brother wasn't really tough on us,

72
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:49.030
but it was a point where my younger brother was like such a spoiled little prick

73
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.840
that he would always get me into trouble from, uh, from my grandma.

74
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.310
Like he would do my grandma, grandpa.

75
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.460
So like he would do something and he'd cry and be like, no, I did it.

76
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:58.810
So I would get to Lickin's. You know?

77
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.540
So I think so that's where my mentality came by. Like I always,

78
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.970
I was like do y'all. So like, even like,

79
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.150
even when I fight with my younger brother, he would beat me. Cause he was like,

80
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:11.200
I was smaller than him. Like he'd beat me up growing up. And the funny thing is,

81
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.920
is like I told you last time, it was that every time, uh, when my mom,

82
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.010
when I started getting to kickboxing and my mom was telling people like, Hey,

83
00:04:18.011 --> 00:04:20.530
let's go. We're going to, um, all my son is going to go,

84
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.410
watch fight is going to go fight this weekend while buy tickets, they'd be like,

85
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.320
oh cool. Who's kind of fighting. And then they'd be like, oh no,

86
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:28.810
Clemson not fighting Max's and they'd be like, what the?

87
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.740
Like max don't fight me. Like, why is he

88
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.610
here? Is he funny? You know? But it comes because I just,

89
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.960
I got so abused and stuff. I never thought of that. You just pointed out to me.

90
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.780
Like my grandma, grandpa gave me, like this guy got get,

91
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.110
he would get away with murder and I always got it.

92
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.800
And then whatever he do something stupid, like outside, we play on our friends.

93
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.570
It's like, there's a place on our street where we could have passed.

94
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.660
And my grandpa would like just be seen in the gazebo and catch my,

95
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.590
my brother coming back and being like, cause he would go in the main road.

96
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.740
It's so stupid. There's a dirt road. I was like, bro, take the dirt road.

97
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.370
That grandpa was always up there drinking his beer,

98
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.970
take this dirt road till we don't want to get into trouble. He's like, nah,

99
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.900
I'm not going to be there.

100
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.770
But I know all after all these years I put together a went to the road cause he

101
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.010
wants to see me get liquids. So at the time he was like, max made me to go with,

102
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.570
I didn't want to go. And I ended up getting lickings. It brought me out.

103
00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:25.520
I was like, bro, you told me go. But the tables is,

104
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.940
turn your little. What is he like now? He just he's crazy. And now he's uh,

105
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.890
uh, he, um, we, we had to deal with some stuff like, uh, I,

106
00:05:35.891 --> 00:05:38.170
you know, my family and stuff would come from drugs and whatever,

107
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:40.630
my mom and stuff and stuff. And my grandma and grandpa was great for them,

108
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.750
but he got into his trouble and stuff. But he's recently like he'd been out,

109
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:47.560
he'd been cleaned, he'd been doing his thing. So I I'm proud of him.

110
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.850
I have this vision. So it's like, it's, it's not, I always tell him to,

111
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.540
you know, it's not how you start the races, how you finished,

112
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:56.410
bro is like finished strong, bro. You got kids. You got focused. Now I know,

113
00:05:56.411 --> 00:05:59.330
I know you, you think you up and you never let nobody down here. You know,

114
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:02.060
you got, you got time and just make everything right again.

115
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:05.360
