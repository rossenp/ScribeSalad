00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. There.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
<v 1>Seems to be a lot of discussion now about police brutality,</v>

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.340
but there's not a lot of discussion about the psychological

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.320
troubles and that the really the difficult path of being a police

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:20.820
officer and appreciation for the people that have to do that job.

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.130
Um, all this defunding,

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.990
the police talk scares the out of me because I see what's going on right

8
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:32.730
now in New York city. And it's a shooting gallery. It's crazy.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.890
And the reason why is because the police officers have no trust in the mayor,

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.950
they want to quit. They don't feel like they get any respect.

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.210
They feel like they,

12
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:47.190
they have all been lumped in with this one murderous cop from Minneapolis right

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.230
now they're all bad cops and there's a license to call them bad. Cops scream,

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.540
terrible things out. Then when they've done nothing wrong, when they're,

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.050
they're just there to protect and serve. A lot of them are good people,

16
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.580
the vast majority.

17
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.420
So when you're seeing this giant uptick in murders in New York,

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.850
see city in giant uptick in shootings,

19
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.200
and then you still have that of a mayor calling for the defunding of the police.

20
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:13.650
Like my God, like what did I know?

21
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:16.980
So much of the things they say are just political because they just want to

22
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:18.090
appeal to their base.

23
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.040
And there's so many people out there that have this very narrow minded

24
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.140
perspective. They just have blinders on.

25
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.980
And their idea it's like racial justice, social justice defund the police.

26
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.130
He said like this mantra that they have to say with no depth to it,

27
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.210
they don't understand the consequences of saying such a thing or implementing

28
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:37.044
such a thing.

29
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.210
Now we're seeing a call for police action because

30
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.370
there's a lot of people. There's a lot of community groups,

31
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.120
a lot of people that are community leaders that are in these communities that

32
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:52.680
are just experiencing unprecedented gun violence and crime.

33
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.770
And now they're saying we got to do something about this.

34
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:59.190
So they're trying to reinstate some of these policies that they had pulled

35
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.700
before. I am hoping that through this,

36
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.680
what we had talked about with training and with funding the police

37
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:12.660
more, instead of defunding the police, train them better, fund them more. We,

38
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.520
you obviously need police.

39
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:17.730
This idea that you don't need police where a criminal just going to go away,

40
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.390
like is crime going to go away? We have a problem.

41
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.650
We have an enormous number of people. And out of that enormous number of people,

42
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.100
there is a certain percentage of them that will victimize other people.

43
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.880
They will steal. They will kill. They will. And if they don't get caught,

44
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.340
then you develop a culture of crime.

45
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.030
And then you develop a thing where you, you, you,

46
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.830
you basically have what's going on in Mexico where the cartels have more power

47
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.800
than the police, which is a terrible situation.

48
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.800
If you have that in individual locations, like in New York city,

49
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.590
if all of a sudden this criminal gangs, these,

50
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:56.790
these criminal gangs develop more gun power, more, more supportive,

51
00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.520
the community, they have more people than police officers.

52
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.260
You've got a giant problem.

53
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.160
And the actual peaceful citizens are the ones that are going to be in trouble.

54
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.700
And all those people that are out there protesting that think they're immune

55
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:12.640
from it because they're the ones saying defund the police, Hey man,

56
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.220
they'll Rob you too. They'll shoot you too.

57
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.190
Like you don't understand humans and you don't understand violence.

58
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.180
And so this utopian world that they're trying to push, like defund the police,

59
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:23.720
we're just going to, we're going to refund.

60
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.960
We're going to put that money into the community and everything's going to be

61
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.920
fine. And it's not going to be fine. You need to fund the police more.

62
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.950
You need to train the police better. We need more oversight.

63
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.610
And we need to recognize that this is a time where everybody's got to come

64
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:40.360
together on this and we've got to figure out what's wrong. Fix what's wrong.

65
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.990
Recognized. There's some problems, but you can't blame all cops.

66
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.890
And you can't say defund the police. Cause that's nonsense that this, that is a,

67
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.810
a silly, like a version of life that doesn't,

68
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.350
it's not real. Yeah. You need good cops, better cops.

69
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.560
Are you saying we need to get rid of bad cops? Yes, definitely.

70
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.990
I think everybody agrees with that. How do you do that?

71
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.440
That's where the question starts, right? And training.

72
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.250
The more like this idea that you can't spend 20% of the time training them.

73
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.160
Well, if you did spend 20% of the time training them,

74
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.110
and there was a lot less crime because of it.

75
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:17.350
And the interactions with people were much better.

76
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.340
Wouldn't that just be overall better? Is that an impossible task? I mean,

77
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.680
how much money goes into the police department?

78
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.840
You tell them you can't add 20% to that and train the more I bet you can.

79
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.150
I bet you could find it financially beneficial. I would see overall,

80
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:39.100
if you could reduce crime that way and reduce the animosity between citizens and

81
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.900
the police, wouldn't it be better for everybody? It would.

82
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.090
<v 2>And I agree. I agree with, with you. I mean, on the defunding thing, you know,</v>

83
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
I think, and you've had other people say this too, and you know this,

84
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:54.000
I'm not saying anything amazing here that like,

85
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.010
it means different things to different people.

86
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.040
And I wholeheartedly agree the folks who think defunding means like,

87
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.490
just get rid of them like that, that that's silly.

88
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.180
What's your plan B what do you do? They really mean that I don't,

89
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.350
I don't understand what happens next and I haven't heard anybody articulate.

90
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:11.610
So then what, and again.

91
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.900
<v 1>No one has a, then what? Those are.</v>

92
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.980
<v 2>The emails I get that talk. The headlines.</v>

93
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:20.130
I saw one yesterday or the day before that in Minneapolis.

94
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:23.820
Now there are groups of citizens banding together, armed citizens,

95
00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:26.970
banding together to patrol the streets for crime. And I thought, oh my God,

96
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.890
oh boy,

97
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.010
that's a show waiting to happen because then you're going to have community

98
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:34.470
members shooting people. And then they're charged. It's.

99
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.660
<v 0>Charged with murder. It's a fourth, just.</v>

100
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.660
<v 2>A horrific thought. And I can't quite imagine like that.</v>

101
00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.550
So I completely understand that the anger and the

102
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:46.770
frustration, because you're right, we don't need bad cops.

103
00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:50.310
There's nothing worse than the end of the person you call to protect you.

104
00:05:50.311 --> 00:05:54.330
And to help you when you're in an emergency doing the wrong thing and doing

105
00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:57.090
harm, right. You know, that we, we don't need or want that.

106
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.240
And I wholeheartedly agree that more training and the right type of training

107
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:03.650
and, and spending that time,

108
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:07.910
because I also think that the training gives you access to see where people are

109
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.360
and if they're on a good path or if they are that problematic person.

110
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.100
<v 0>What kind of character they have to, if you test them during this training.</v>

111
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.330
So if we're still, if.

112
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.840
<v 2>We're seeing them on a regular basis and pulling them out and giving them the</v>

113
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:22.390
tools that they need, then, then absolutely.

114
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:25.930
I think that is an exceptional thing to do. That was part of what your,

115
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.050
your podcasts with Jocko just blew me away with, you know,

116
00:06:29.051 --> 00:06:31.770
the way you talked about, you know, and the other thing that,

117
00:06:31.771 --> 00:06:35.890
that sort of has gotten lost is this whole idea of, you know,

118
00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:39.910
the interaction with the community, with community oriented policing. Um,

119
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.570
you know, and it's,

120
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.780
it's exactly what Jocko was talking about when he was talking about being

121
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:46.660
overseas. And I think he was talking about Patraeus and the order of, you know,

122
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:49.930
you don't just roll up in your tank and cruise through you,

123
00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:54.730
stop and you talk and you humanize yourself and you engage with these, you know,

124
00:06:54.731 --> 00:06:57.970
with the folks here. Um, and you let them know that you're,

125
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:00.670
you're here to protect and to serve, and you connect with them.

126
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.640
And that helps both the community citizens and the soldiers.

127
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.950
That's the same thing that we're wanting here at home in this country, that,

128
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.630
that your police are supposed to be your supporters and your resources and the

129
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:15.490
people that you trust and are connected to.

130
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.410
And that is what community oriented policing is. It's not a new idea.

131
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.600
It's been around for decades,

132
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.550
but we somehow still don't have that going on. Now. It's still,

133
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.480
well, what seems like everything in society is now it's us versus them.

134
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.460
You know, it's the police versus the community.

135
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.170
Instead of we are a community together and we need to work with each other

136
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.500
to, you know, to,

137
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.580
to keep this place safe and to understand what the biggest problems are,

138
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:45.820
what are the citizens concerns? And it isn't easy to do.

139
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.850
It's not an easy thing to do, but it works.

140
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.950
<v 1>Yeah. Um,</v>

141
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.810
I go to a tactical range where they teach you how to shoot

142
00:07:55.811 --> 00:08:00.460
handguns. And, uh, the guy who teaches me was telling me,

143
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.390
you would be stunned at how inept,

144
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.000
some of these cops are the come here. He goes,

145
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.180
they literally barely know how to shoot a gun.

146
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.910
And I wouldn't believe him,

147
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.560
except I've seen so many cops that are so fat and so

148
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:21.580
sloppy. And I'm like, how are you going to defend yourself?

149
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.940
Like the idea of you serving and protecting like, dude,

150
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.640
if someone throws you on the ground, you're not even getting up. Like,

151
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.050
how does that happen?

152
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.180
How do they now have standards for like being able to shoot a

153
00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:37.090
gun, knowing how to handle it properly, being accurate,

154
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.990
being consistent with your training and also physical fitness.

155
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.910
Like that's the job of a police officer is dealing occasionally with violent

156
00:08:45.911 --> 00:08:50.530
criminals. When you have no capacity to defend yourself,

157
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.260
how are you able to help people.
