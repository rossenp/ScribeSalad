00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.510
<v 2>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.400
this recent thing where those folks went to the capital when they were standing

4
00:00:08.401 --> 00:00:12.210
up on his behalf, and then he throws them on the Dubai.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.330
<v 0>Yeah. I threw them all into the bus after it was over. Yeah, it's crazy.</v>

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.530
I watched a video of it. I had not seen much video of it. Yeah.

7
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.740
I'd only seen like a couple of videos on Instagram. I was like, what the?

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.160
I didn't want to get depressed and watch it. But today I said,

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:28.410
let's get depressed. And I watched a bunch of it.

10
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.880
I had no idea how bad it was in terms of like the, the sheer number of people,

11
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:33.541
extorting,

12
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:37.140
the gates and screaming and these small handful of cops that were supposed to

13
00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:39.510
protect it. And that one cop that got beaten,

14
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.580
it was like a video of them hitting the cop at flags and. It's like, what the?

15
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.720
Like what, how did that happen? How did it deteriorate to that?

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.450
<v 1>I know, man. It's, um, it's really sad to me that,</v>

17
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:55.890
that that kind of thing happened.

18
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.660
And then you have these cowards, Rudy Giuliani, uh,

19
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.980
Ted Cruz, uh, Josh Howley, all these cowards.

20
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.720
They are allowed to stand on their pulpit and

21
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.120
say these things like they're tough,

22
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.480
but they're nowhere around to support these folks in the first place.

23
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:20.100
And they're sending them into the battle and now they will, um,

24
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.220
uh, complete comfort.

25
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.250
The belief joined the ranks of their members of Congress while these other

26
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:30.030
people are gonna go to jail and have these, these charges, uh,

27
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.210
which should they should have, of course. But, um, uh,

28
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.690
these leaders who manipulated them, th there was no consequences to them.

29
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.340
I mean, I think that's the real crime.

30
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.950
<v 0>Yeah. Well, we'll see if there's consequences. Cause I've,</v>

31
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:44.160
I have a feeling that will be for Trump. I think this is going to be the end.

32
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.680
I really do, because I think there's a,

33
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.270
there's very little chance that he's going to run in 20, 24 after this.

34
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.830
Cause a lot of people were hoping for that.

35
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:56.060
A lot of his supporters were hoping for that, but after this, I don't,

36
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:56.880
I don't even think.

37
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.430
<v 1>Yeah. I think the useful idiot is done. I mean,</v>

38
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.160
I think like the people like Mitch McConnell and those people,

39
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.460
they don't have no more use for him. So he's done. I mean, he's already,

40
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:08.400
he's done enough for them. They're, they're happy with what he's done.

41
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:12.210
He's delivered with the Supreme court and so forth. His time is over.

42
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.340
<v 0>It's interesting to see, you know,</v>

43
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:16.800
we've always known that there's a certain faction of this country.

44
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:21.540
That's fairly simple. Not that sophisticated,

45
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:22.560
not very smart.

46
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.360
And they like thinking in like a real narrow box and these guy came

47
00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:31.290
along and was their guy, you know? And then we realized like, oh,

48
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:34.560
like the of this country were unrepresented.

49
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.410
And now all of a sudden they got represented. Like there was a lot of people,

50
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:40.680
like a lot of those folks that storm the castle, that stormed Capitol hill.

51
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.430
Like if you see, like when they get arrested and you find out who they are,

52
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.370
like guy living with his mom, believe in Q Anon,

53
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:50.640
conspiracies thinks the FBI sending out pedophile codes, that kind of.

54
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.610
Like those guys didn't have a king before. What do you realize?

55
00:02:53.611 --> 00:02:55.440
How many of them there are, but what about the gun?

56
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.870
<v 1>Who was, I don't know, a Latina,</v>

57
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.340
a retired Laturnus Lieutenant Colonel from the army or the air force. I mean,

58
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:07.960
so there are people there who also had education and they were plugged into

59
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:10.150
society. Right. There were a number of those.

60
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.130
<v 0>People too, right. I'm sure there was a few.</v>

61
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.090
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I, I think that, um, um,</v>

62
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.850
I, you know, I,

63
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.900
I think most of us are simple people and that that's okay.

64
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.580
I think you should be able to be simple and have a decent life and,

65
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.510
um, uh, and enjoy yourself. I think that there is no crime there.

66
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.470
I think that's fine.

67
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.260
The real problem is that we allow our leaders to

68
00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:42.160
lie and then you can manipulate even the most

69
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.050
sophisticated among us can be manipulated. And I think that's the real crime.

70
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.490
So it's like, not that these people were simple. It's okay. To be simple.

71
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.570
<v 0>Um, maybe symbols is the wrong word. Maybe was the right word.</v>

72
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.010
There's a lot of people that are. Honestly, there was never a guy who, who said,

73
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:02.590
it's okay to be an, but I'm an to.

74
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.800
<v 1>I think, do you think that the majority of these people were?</v>

75
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.610
<v 0>I think they could be if they were led the right way.</v>

76
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.550
<v 1>But can't most of us be, I think.</v>

77
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.620
<v 0>At the worst moments of your life. Yeah. Yeah. I.</v>

78
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.050
<v 1>Think so. But, but, you know, I think that when you have,</v>

79
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.720
I'm telling you, man, uh, I'm putting a square on those people in Washington.

80
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.550
Trump is one of them, of course,

81
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.590
but I'm talking about the Ted Cruz's and all of those people as well. I mean,

82
00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:37.340
those people, uh, they should be, they should face, uh, uh,

83
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.840
the criminal justice system for what they did. Um,

84
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.280
because these folks who are out here, we all have the potential to be.

85
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.400
And then if you think that what you're doing is holding up the

86
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:52.390
Liberty that we,

87
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.860
we promise in this country that you are being a real Patriot and you really

88
00:04:56.861 --> 00:05:00.220
believe that you've been manipulated to do that by these leaders,

89
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.850
they should pay the price. And that's the thing that's really,

90
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.830
I'm really disturbed by is like, yeah, we'll we, we, we should get Trump. Yup,

91
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.020
absolutely. But we should go out to those other.

92
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.230
<v 0>People. What did Ted Cruz do that? Oh.</v>

93
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.180
<v 1>What the election, um.</v>

94
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.120
<v 0>Oh, we're saying that election fraud, election.</v>

95
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.140
<v 1>Fraud, when he knew that he knew what time it was, those guys,</v>

96
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.380
um, they know they were being dishonest.

97
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.570
<v 0>Well, I think as a political ploy, right.</v>

98
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.740
There's politicians take stances based on where they think their

99
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:35.290
constituents lean and, you know,

100
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.100
stop the steel and all that was trending on all these social media sites.

101
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.420
And I feel like for a prominent politician, that's, uh,

102
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.510
a manipulative person that looks at these things and goes, yeah,

103
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.610
that's an angle that I can use. Yeah.

104
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.420
<v 1>Absolutely. Right. Joe, that's exactly what politicians do.</v>

105
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.170
And we should expect more of them. And until we do,

106
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.210
they're going to continue to do that when they know that is.

107
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.200
And so you're right. That's what politicians do. So.

108
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.050
<v 0>So what do you, what do you think they were trying to do you think,</v>

109
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:11.030
just posturing to try to get those people on their side for the future?

110
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.103
<v 1>That's right.</v>

111
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.850
I think that Ted Cruz and those folks were setting themselves up for a future

112
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.080
presidential run or what have you, and hoping that they get Trump,

113
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:26.060
the king maker to endorse them, even though Trump called his wife ugly,

114
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.820
I would have beat Trump's ads. I mean, I'm telling you, I mean,

115
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:30.440
it's like what kind of man allows.

116
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.030
<v 0>That? I call them lion, Ted.</v>

117
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.940
<v 1>I mean,</v>

118
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.830
what kind of man allows another guy to call his wife ugly and not do anything.

119
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.260
<v 0>And also infer that he was a serial killer or something.</v>

120
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.770
His dad is that Zodiac killer that's yeah.

121
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.730
<v 1>His dad helped kill Kennedy Assam. He said, yeah. Uh,</v>

122
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.860
w what kind of man does that, I mean, allows that, I mean,

123
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.330
I don't understand that.

124
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.000
<v 0>Well, what kind of man wants to be a Senator? You know, it's,</v>

125
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.230
it's a weird business and you get deeply entrenched in that business and there's

126
00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:02.960
compromises that you make. And a lot of weirdness.

127
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.380
<v 1>I understand, but you know, like what kind of person want to be president?</v>

128
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:09.860
That's fine. I don't want to do that, but I'm glad there are people that,

129
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.080
that do it. And the thing is,

130
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.770
I think we should require them to be more honorable than we do.

131
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.020
We certainly should. And, and so like when,

132
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.110
when people are posturing politically,

133
00:07:21.111 --> 00:07:25.490
when they know that there is no, that this is just a,

134
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:26.390
there's no opera,

135
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.950
there's no chance that this election can be overturned because there's no

136
00:07:30.951 --> 00:07:35.840
fraud. I think they should pay a price. I think that is just too manipulative,

137
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.790
but, and I think their position requires that they be more honest,

138
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.920
uh, and until we do, until we require them, require them,

139
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.820
disab them, then I think that they will continue.

140
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.610
<v 0>I think there's a, uh,</v>

141
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:56.630
a style of behavior that lends itself to

142
00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:59.630
success, like business success and financial success.

143
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.850
And it's like a speed style,

144
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.930
like people that are into amphetamines and people that are into like getting

145
00:08:05.931 --> 00:08:09.170
ahead and pushing. And, and I think that there's a,

146
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.890
a style of behavior that leads itself to be compassionate,

147
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:14.720
thinking more about community.

148
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:19.250
And I think that is more like a marijuana style or a mushroom style.

149
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.270
You think something? Yeah.
