00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Don't you agree? There.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.160
<v 1>Should be a minimum wage.</v>

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.790
Th there's plenty of people that are bidding against me for those same workers.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.320
Right. And so I have to pay the market rate. I can't just underpay them.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.390
They'll go work someplace else. I understand.

6
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:20.720
But do you think there should be a minimum wage? No,

7
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:24.530
there should be zero minimum wage. Wow. That's, we've discussed that before,

8
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.810
but I still think there should be a minimum wage is because I think

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.610
individuals should be free to accept employment opportunities that they

10
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:38.120
want to accept. See the minimum wage doesn't hurt businesses.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.930
It hurts individuals that have low skills, right?

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.330
And that's always the problem. When you,

13
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.380
when you have people defending the minimum wage bail are opposing minimum wage

14
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.710
hikes. They always say, oh, it's going to hurt businesses because you know,

15
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:54.170
it's going to increase their labor costs. You know what?

16
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.530
It doesn't necessarily increase their labor costs because they don't hire as

17
00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:01.460
many workers. They hire skilled workers instead of unskilled workers,

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.520
they automate, they find ways to do without workers. They outsource, uh, they,

19
00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:08.630
they, they hire people in other countries.

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.910
The minimum wage law hurts the most low skilled people.

21
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.230
And they tend to be young people, teenagers, minorities,

22
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.050
uh that's who get, get hit the hardest, you know,

23
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:23.210
before we had all these programs, you know,

24
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.800
that the black teenage unemployment rate once upon a time was actually lower

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.660
than the white teenage unemployment rate.

26
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.220
Now it's like double or triple as high. But before we had all these laws,

27
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.230
it was actually lower because they got disproportionately impacted by

28
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.500
the minimum wage law, which prices them out of work. I mean, basically.

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.180
<v 2>When were these laws implemented? Well.</v>

30
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.000
<v 1>The minimum, which didn't really start until the great depression, right?</v>

31
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:51.580
So it started, but it didn't apply to,

32
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.720
there were a lot of jobs that it were exempted from it.

33
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.010
So it really started kicking in more than 1960s. And then it really, you know,

34
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:00.770
started. Can I ask you this? Has.

35
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.010
<v 2>Anybody ever tried to have no minimum wage as an experiment?</v>

36
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.710
Like maybe a town or a city?

37
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.960
<v 1>Well, first of all,</v>

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.060
we had no minimum wage before it was implemented and we had much lower rates of

39
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.620
unemployment, real unemployment.

40
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.170
When you look at countries that don't have a minimum wage,

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.360
there's not that many left anymore. I mean,

42
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:24.260
most countries have made this mistake because the minimum wage is good politics.

43
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.450
Cause it sounds good. Right. If you're for the minimum wage,

44
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.980
it sounds like you care, right? Oh yeah. We, you know, who is anybody against,

45
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:34.730
you know, people working for low wages now. Okay. So it sounds good. Right?

46
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.600
But all you do is you destroy jobs and you destroy employment opportunities,

47
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.260
but there are countries like Singapore for an example has no minimum wage,

48
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.330
you know, but wait a minute. They don't, they.

49
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.220
<v 2>Don't, they come in you Singapore, don't they cane you if you graffiti.</v>

50
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.980
<v 1>Right. I know they frown on that over there. That was,</v>

51
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.890
that was a famous Alison talking about that. We talked about,

52
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.970
I know we're talking about wage. Carolyn does it really? I mean,

53
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.690
there's other countries that have some kind of weird minimum, but you know,

54
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.300
it's not the same as is ours. I feel like.

55
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.780
<v 2>I feel like there could be a minimum wage and we still hold the same values</v>

56
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.970
that you're talking about in terms of competition,

57
00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:17.880
to keep people from getting with their employees.

58
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.470
Have you ever seen an employer like yelled their employees or like being like

59
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:23.280
one of those, uh,

60
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.480
corporate gathering situations where someone has a lot of

61
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.160
control over their employees.

62
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:33.330
Now imagine if that guy was making all the money and he was only giving these

63
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:35.580
employees a dollar an hour and making them.

64
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.720
<v 1>Live in poverty, but slavery, I agree.</v>

65
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:42.480
You only remain at your job if you like it.

66
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.790
If you think it's the best alternative, look,

67
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.170
people quit all the time because they can get a better job. So by definition,

68
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.510
if the best job I can get is the job I have and nobody will offer to pay

69
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:58.350
me more money than I'm not underpaid. If, if nobody will pay me more,

70
00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:02.940
it's a free open market. There's all kinds of employers out there. And remember,

71
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.320
you're free to work for yourself. Nobody forces anybody to accept a job.

72
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.130
Everybody can start their own business. Everybody can be self-employed right.

73
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:14.310
So if you don't think your boss is paying you, what you're worth,

74
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.190
then quit and start your own business.

75
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.460
<v 2>I completely feel where you're coming from,</v>

76
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.620
but couldn't we just say that there's a level of

77
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.950
pain.

78
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.180
If you make someone work 40 hours a week and they don't have enough money for

79
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:33.090
food or shelter after 40 hours a week,

80
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.370
could we say that maybe that is not a good level? Like let's,

81
00:04:37.371 --> 00:04:41.280
let's just as a community. So everybody agrees. We're all competing, but let's,

82
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.110
let's make it so that if someone is under your employment and it's a human being

83
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.110
and they're doing 40 hours of work every week,

84
00:04:49.111 --> 00:04:51.240
they should have enough money for food and shelter.

85
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.610
That seems reasonable as a community. I know what you're saying in terms,

86
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.500
I know what you're saying from like this economic standpoint,

87
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.550
I know what you're saying. Like let free market capitalism, let it ride,

88
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.680
figure it out, get paid, what you're worth.

89
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.410
And if you don't feel like you're getting paid enough, quit.

90
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.350
I understand what you're saying, but wouldn't it be nice.

91
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.190
<v 1>Backtrack then. Okay. So go ahead in general, right?</v>

92
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.800
If you don't have any skills, right?

93
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.940
If the most you're able to earn at your job and let's say there's no minimum

94
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:23.340
wage and you're just a young kid, you don't have any skills.

95
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.560
And the most you can earn is $4 an hour. That's because again, it's,

96
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.450
you're paid based on your productivity.

97
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.100
Businesses are there to make a profit for the owner of the business because that

98
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.660
businessman is taking a lot of risk is bearing the potential for losing money.

99
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.040
Of course it has to provide, you know,

100
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.110
and so a businessman is not going to hire somebody if they're not adding

101
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.250
value to the business.

102
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:51.270
So if somebody can add $5 of value to my business,

103
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.130
I'm not going to pay him 7 25 an hour because I'm going to lose 2 25 for every

104
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:56.964
hour, that person.

105
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.390
So the only way I can hire somebody who is providing a $5 worth of

106
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.350
value is if I can pay him $4 and then I can make a dollar for every hour,

107
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.200
he works. I'm not, the business is not there to lose money.

108
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.273
They're there to make money.

109
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.540
So let's say you're a young kid and you could only provide $5 worth of value.

110
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:18.290
And so you get a job for $4 and your employer makes a buck an hour off of you.

111
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.950
Chances are you don't have a family. You're young,

112
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.280
you're living with your parents. You don't have rent. You don't have, you know,

113
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.920
so making a little bit of money is okay.

114
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:31.250
You just need some spending money to go to a movies or maybe go out on a date or

115
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:32.570
something. You don't need a lot of money.

116
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.920
What's important is the work experience, having that job,

117
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.250
developing some skills, getting your foot in the door.

118
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.430
Step on that first ladder of the job, the rung of the job ladder.

119
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.500
So that by the time you're 30 and you're ready to settle down and get married

120
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:49.334
and have kids.

121
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.080
You've now increased your skills to the point that you can make $50 an hour

122
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.960
where you can afford to support a family.

123
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:02.180
If you try to tell a business that you need to pay somebody who has

124
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:05.510
no skills and as minimal economic value,

125
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.990
if you have to pay that person enough so that you can support a family,

126
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.670
nobody's going to hire that person.

127
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.310
All you're doing is pricing those people out of a job.

128
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.440
So it's really good to say, it's not right. If somebody is working, uh,

129
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.160
and only making, you know, $10 an hour and they can't support a family,

130
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.920
it's not the employer's responsibility.

131
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.610
It's not his fault that he's hiring somebody that doesn't have a lot of skills.

132
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.830
And if you impose that minimum wage,

133
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.490
all you're doing is making it impossible for this guy to get a job.

134
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.650
It really what the minimum wage law is,

135
00:07:36.651 --> 00:07:40.100
is it makes it illegal for you to work unless you have enough,

136
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.850
a certain amount of productivity. So if the minimum wage is $15 an hour,

137
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.560
what that means is if you only have $10 an hour work of productivity,

138
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.700
right? You can't work that you have to turn down every offer of employment.

139
00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:56.660
You get. If someone offers you $10, $12, that's the illegal.

140
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.450
You can't accept those jobs. Even if you want them.

141
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.120
Even if you think that that's the beginning of the first step on a road to a

142
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.950
higher wages in the future, the government says, no, you can't accept that.

143
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.250
Unless you can find somebody who will pay you $15 an hour,

144
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:14.570
it is illegal for you to have a job. And that is not good economic policy.

145
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:15.020
That is,

146
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.100
and it's not even compassionate because now you've taken away all the honest

147
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.190
ways that somebody can make a living and they end up turning to crime.

148
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:23.860
A lot of times, I see what.

149
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.990
<v 2>You're saying. And that, that actually makes a lot more sense.</v>

150
00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:27.850
The way you're framing it about like,

151
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:32.680
if you only provide $10 worth of value to the company,

152
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:36.820
why should they pay you $15? And I think I agree with you.

153
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.380
I see what you're saying. I see what you're saying.

154
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.050
And you're making me think about it in a different way, for sure. Um,

155
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:42.700
I think a lot of people would say, well,

156
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.510
if they're really only providing $10 worth of value,

157
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:48.850
do you really need that person? [inaudible].

158
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.910
<v 1>I mean, $10 worth of value is still value. Yeah.</v>

159
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.940
I see what you think of all these look, I get very, all the time. You know,

160
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:59.910
when I make phone calls and I can't talk to a human being,

161
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.270
I have to talk to a computer. And,

162
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.630
and the reason for this is because we've priced the human beings out of the

163
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:08.970
market. We don't know what else, kids.

164
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:10.161
<v 2>What's a,</v>

165
00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:14.180
what's horrible about this for all of us is when you do do that and you know,

166
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.390
you're dealing with these computers. It's like, we're,

167
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:21.530
we're losing part of our connection. When it comes to doing business,

168
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.530
we're doing, I like if I do business with a company,

169
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.560
I like to be able to call them up. I like theirs. I'd love it.

170
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:28.970
If there's a thing, when I'm,

171
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.300
when I'm doing something I'd like to make contact with the person,

172
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:34.640
if everything is being done through automated systems,

173
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.370
it's getting weirder and weirder for us more.

174
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.110
<v 1>And more detached. You remember,</v>

175
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.520
do you remember the original batch of the future movie? Remember when, when he,

176
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:46.310
when he goes back to 1955 for the first time,

177
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.420
and he sees that car pull into a gas station and like five people descend on the

178
00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:54.050
car and start washing the windows, checking the tires, doing all that stuff.

179
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.420
Right? What happened to all those people?

180
00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.850
Because that's what the gas stations were like,

181
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.300
sort of for the minimum wage jobs. I worked.

182
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.430
<v 2>In a gas station. Do you ever work in a gas station?</v>

183
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.630
<v 1>I never did, but I like, I delivered groceries. I delivered pizza.</v>

184
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.490
I worked in a shoe store. I had all kinds of jobs in high school that, you know,

185
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.460
they'd probably kids don't have those opportunities today. They just, they,

186
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:19.280
they, you know, they think they can't get it. But going back to the gas station,

187
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.710
right. Be like pumping your own gas.

188
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.950
<v 2>Um, I do because I used to,</v>

189
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.030
I used to work at a gas station and I know what happens when you let kids pumped

190
00:10:29.031 --> 00:10:32.510
your gas. I don't want anybody open. They spill it.

191
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:37.460
They up there at some weirdo has got a highly flammable fluid next to a piece of

192
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:39.350
your property and they get to stick it in there.

193
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.690
<v 1>Look, I think if we didn't have a minimum wage,</v>

194
00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.440
you'd have a lot more kids working mostly for tips. And we used to tip.

195
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.280
If you remember, I'm still old enough to remember tipping the guy, then one,

196
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.290
my gas, right? Check your tires. But, but you know what used to happen?

197
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:58.850
These young kids that got low paying jobs as pump jockeys,

198
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.390
what they would do between Philips is they would go and hang out with the

199
00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:06.530
mechanic was they're working on cars and they would get a free education and

200
00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:09.440
auto mechanics. And they would actually learn a trade.

201
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.270
Have you been some of his guys? I mean,

202
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.370
we'd have more auto mechanics that get a skill.

203
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.360
Some of these guys would end up opening up their own service stations. Look,

204
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.530
it's, it's good to allow young people to have employment opportunities,

205
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.880
not the price them out of the market by just by mandating a minimum wage.

206
00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:29.780
I mean the minimum wage benefits, high skilled workers unions by,

207
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.020
by eliminating competition with younger, lower skilled workers.

208
00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:37.790
You're forcing employers to hire high skill people instead of a

209
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:41.480
more numerous, uh, number of lower skilled people that that's what happened.

210
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.430
<v 2>Have you ever seen the movie, the hustler with Paul Newman? Jackie Gleason?</v>

211
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:52.490
<v 1>Yeah. It was a great movie. In fact, I saw the remake with, uh, with, um, um,</v>

212
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.870
what's his, um, Tom cruise, um, cruise. Yeah,

213
00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.870
but the point, my point is both good movies. They're great movies.

214
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.910
<v 2>But in the beginning of the hustler,</v>

215
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.040
Paul Newman pulls into a gas station and he tells the guy,

216
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.760
check the air and tires, check the oil, do all this. And the guy fill up Mr.

217
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.510
They go out there and they have like, they, they, they do all kinds of for you.

218
00:12:15.511 --> 00:12:18.720
It's not just as simple as they pump your gas. They pump your gas,

219
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.440
check your tires, check your fluids. They do everything. But there was less.

220
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.530
<v 1>People kept car. Two cars were in better shape because you know,</v>

221
00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:29.040
every time you went into a gas station, somebody made sure you had enough oil.

222
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.670
They made sure your tire pressure was good. Okay. More reliable.

223
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.750
<v 2>Today. Those are, those cars were. Those cars like you had to check the air,</v>

224
00:12:36.751 --> 00:12:39.390
you had to check the tires. It was bleeding oil,

225
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.030
but it's just interesting to see the difference.

226
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.910
<v 1>Look, they used to have ushers in movie theaters.</v>

227
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.060
They would just show you to your seat with w w the,

228
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.260
there was the service sector has really been obliterated all these low skill.

229
00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:54.750
Look, they're working on these kiosks. Now look,

230
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.030
they're going to get rid of all the workers. Anyway,

231
00:12:57.031 --> 00:12:59.010
ultimately all these fast food restaurants,

232
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.030
there's not going to be anybody there.

233
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.810
They're all going to look like self-serve gas stations. You're going to go in.

234
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:07.770
You're going to order off your smartphone. And the food is going to come,

235
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.410
come down a shoot through some machine. You know,

236
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.290
th there's there's going to be nobody there.
