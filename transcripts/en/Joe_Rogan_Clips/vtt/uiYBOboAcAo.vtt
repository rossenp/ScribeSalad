1
00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The story's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy.</v>

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.760
And I think it's also a really important part of human history.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.640
Imagine if the whistleblower had not come forward and we didn't know

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.480
about MK ultra and, and, and all those documents didn't get,

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.280
they didn't find the warehouse where the documents were. Right, right.

6
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.114
Just imagine.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.870
<v 1>Oh yeah, we never, would've known about be lost.</v>

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.093
<v 0>Like Kaiser. Nobody.</v>

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.870
<v 1>Will say nobody in the program has ever come out and, and talked about it. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.590
I mean, I went to a couple of the guys who were still alive.

11
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:34.110
Wouldn't talk to me. Of course. I mean, they always fall back on, you know,

12
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:38.350
we sign an oath with the agency, right. If we talk to you without permission,

13
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:40.670
and they're not gonna give us permission, we could go to prison.

14
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 0>Just imagine what life must have been like for them,</v>

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.180
knowing that this is what they were doing to people. Oh yeah.

16
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.860
It's so that's such a strange way to it. Also,

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.660
these people are agents for the federal government. I mean,

18
00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:57.300
what kind of precedent does this establish?

19
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.260
<v 1>Well, most of the people doing the research were subcontracted researchers.</v>

20
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.570
Atpri, you know, medical personnel at prisons. And in the case of jolly west,

21
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.170
he was first in the air force.

22
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.330
And then he was in university settings and jolly was &lt;laugh&gt;, you know,

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.410
once he got to university of Oklahoma, he was experimenting on patients.

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.290
And in one of his letters to Gotley asking for more funding,

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.520
he's saying working with psychiatric patients actually benefits us

26
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.120
because people can't I'm, um,

27
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.640
not quoting directly here, but he's,

28
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:36.120
he was making the argument that their weird behavior wouldn't be noticed by

29
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:39.800
anybody at the hospitals because they're psychiatric patients.

30
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.080
So these people are getting LSD,

31
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:46.230
which is a pretty powerful drug and other drugs he was using. Uh,

32
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.270
and he was hypnotizing them in some of, many of his experiments without,

33
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.150
without their knowledge and their psychiatric patients. I mean,

34
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.230
it's worse than Nazis. Your mind is, you know, the next,

35
00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.070
most important thing besides your soul and they're tampering with it. Hmm.

36
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.630
You know, uh,

37
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.620
one of Jo's co was a guy who actually took over the department when jolly in 69,

38
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:11.620
came out to UCLA, from Oklahoma, uh, said to me, cuz I,

39
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.820
again, I would do this with people. I would show them all the documents. And,

40
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.980
and he said he always, west was one of his best friends. He'd known him for,

41
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.010
I think 45 years when Wests died in 99, he said, but he said to me,

42
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
um, Jo,

43
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.650
it doesn't surprise me that he would've done this.

44
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.810
This is the Jack Ruby's stuff, which I guess you haven't gotten to yet.

45
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.010
Mm-mm &lt;negative&gt; jolly was Jack Ruby's psychiatrist. Oh, Jesus.

46
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.203
&lt;laugh&gt; it's a whole.

47
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.210
<v 0>That makes sense too, right? Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.960
<v 1>Jack. Well, uh, actually I won't spoil was shoot a photo of.</v>

49
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.793
<v 0>Jack Ruby out in the hallway.</v>

50
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.000
<v 1>I did. I was impressed. Yeah. Yeah. Well,</v>

51
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.440
you're gonna get to about 30 or 40 pages on Jack Ruby and jolly west. I,

52
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.320
I, I'll just,

53
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.360
I don't wanna spoil it for you or for the listeners if they haven't read the

54
00:02:57.361 --> 00:02:58.360
book yet, but, um,

55
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.920
jolly west inserted himself into the Ruby case after Ruby was

56
00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:05.520
convicted of shooting and,

57
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.640
and killing Oswald in the spring of 64,

58
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.360
before he was gonna testify to the Warren commission, he had never told, uh,

59
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.030
he had never testified at his trial about why he, he killed Oswald.

60
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.470
His defense argument was that, uh,

61
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.030
he had epilepsy and he had had an epileptic fit and shot him and was amnesic

62
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.870
O of the, of the, the shooting. Holy. Uh,

63
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.030
yeah. So, and that fits right into the narrative, like a key, well,

64
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:41.020
this gets better. So Wes in certain pull that microphone out towards your face.

65
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.300
Oh, sorry. It's all right. So what she just youre getting to this? Yeah, yeah.

66
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.163
Move.

67
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.100
So west inserts himself into the case gets a sign through his connections to

68
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.700
Ruby's new lawyer, Hubert Winston Smith. Who's a whole other kettle of Phish.

69
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.570
But anyway, goes to the Dallas county in,

70
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.970
I think it was April of 64 to examine Ruby in preparation for

71
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.570
not the Warren commission testimony, which he was giving in a couple months,

72
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.370
but for his next trial, cuz he, he had gotten a new, uh, or an appeal, uh,

73
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:19.330
for a psychiatric review and west who had told Sidney Gottlieb

74
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.400
in, in these early letters from the fifties that part of his experiments were

75
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.400
inducing insanity and a person without their awareness.

76
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.560
Wes goes to examine Ruby emerges from the county jail and there's press

77
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.920
waiting for him. And he announces that within the proceeding 48 hours,

78
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.280
um, Ruby had had an,

79
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.070
a psychotic break that was, uh, irrevocableable it,

80
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.070
it couldn't, he couldn't return to sanity.

81
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.750
He had audio and visual hallucinations during the exam. He said,

82
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.750
Ruby hit under a table cuz he thought there were people in the room trying to

83
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:57.584
kill him,

84
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.540
told Wes that he could hear children screams outside his jail cell as

85
00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:06.460
Jewish children, as they were boiled alive. And Wes said,

86
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.140
he's completely insane.

87
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.740
That was the day.

88
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.060
I mean there was no evidence of Ruby being mentally ill

89
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.500
prior to Wes's exam. Wes was alone with him in the cell and they,

90
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.530
and treated him for about six months when Ruby finally

91
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.130
gave his testimony to the Warren commission. So, uh, Earl Warren, chief justice,

92
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.090
Warren, who was head of the commission, flew down to Dallas with um,

93
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.210
Gerald Ford who was, uh, in Congress and,

94
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:42.440
and on the commission and AR inspectorter the young AR I specter who was as an

95
00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:45.280
investigator for the Warren commission who eventually came up with the,

96
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.120
the magic bullet theory. Uh,

97
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.240
he called it the magic bullet conclusion anyway, um, the three of them,

98
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.940
uh, you know,

99
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.440
put Ruby under oath and Ruby bble was incoherent,

100
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.080
grabbed a inspectorter who was like him Jewish. And he said, don't, you know,

101
00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:06.280
they're killing Jews. Uh, and,

102
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.120
and they've killed my brother and cut off his legs.

103
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.040
I hear them being tortured outside my, myself. They couldn't use anything. Um,

104
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.703
west,

105
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.110
that was one of his objectives in his MCAL to research was to make people

106
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.430
in, do insanity without a person's awareness.

107
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.390
<v 0>Was there any contact with Jack Ruby before he killed.</v>

108
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.351
<v 1>All? That was again,</v>

109
00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:33.230
that was one of the things I can't tell you how hard you no. Oh,

110
00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:36.310
you mean we before you mean we and Ruby, anyone.

111
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.940
<v 0>Anyone, it could have done something to get Osal yeah. To kill Ru Ruby, no.</v>

112
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.620
<v 1>Ruby to kill O Ruby to kill Osborn. Uh, Ruby. Yeah. Ruby had a lot of, uh,</v>

113
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.060
connections, toorganize crime and federal.

114
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.260
He was part of which later emerged of the anti Castro Cuban effort

115
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.300
to overthrow Fidel Castro, which was run.

116
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.690
It was operation Mon goose by the CIA. It was an,

117
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.450
an illegal assassination program. Ruby denied being in it.

118
00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:04.284
And that's in the book.

119
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.330
I found out that again through west papers that I got access to Ruby

120
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.370
admitted, never, that he stalked and killed Oswalt on the orders

121
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:16.610
of, of anyone,

122
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.200
but that he working with these people who were suspected of being involved

123
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.120
in the assassination,

124
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.840
if there was a conspiracy and he had never admitted that to anyone. Uh,

125
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:29.720
it's only in, in west file and Wes withheld that.

126
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.200
<v 0>So let's break that down. So for people that don't know, the, the,</v>

127
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.320
the primary theory of who was responsible,

128
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.310
if there was a consnspiracy nspiracy to kill Kennedy.

129
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.550
And one of the thoughts was that it had to do with some sort of

130
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.430
a CIA operation to overthrow Castro.

131
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.990
<v 1>Yeah. Well, there was,</v>

132
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.790
so the Warren commission concluded that Oswald acted alone was no conspiracy.

133
00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.390
Alan dolls, Dallas,

134
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.500
the former head of the CIA who was fired by John AF Kennedy,

135
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.620
um, was second in command to,

136
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.180
to judge Warren and the commission Richard Helms,

137
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:13.780
who was actually jolly west employer for MK ultra was the liaison

138
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.220
between the CIA and the commission.

139
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.980
So Helms knew that Ruby,

140
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.130
who they had call their most important witness in their investigation,

141
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.410
the Warren commission investigation,

142
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:26.330
because he was the one who silenced the killer.

143
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.370
There could be no trial for Oswal cuz he was dead.

144
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.410
So they tried to learn everything they could about, uh,

145
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:37.410
Ruby to see if he had had any meetings with Oswal prior or if he had

146
00:08:37.411 --> 00:08:41.800
connections beyond the superficial ones to organize crime.

147
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:46.600
Was there something deeper? Um, the commission,

148
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:50.560
which I believe was, you know, a joke from the beginning,

149
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.440
it was set to determine, I mean they said in the beginning,

150
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:57.240
their objective was to prove that Oswal acted alone. Um,

151
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:02.320
they came up with that conclusion, but after the first intelligence,

152
00:09:02.321 --> 00:09:04.280
Senate intelligence hearings in the,

153
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:08.320
in the early seventies that exposed MK ultra chaos,

154
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.160
cotel pro primarily that the Frank Church hearings, uh,

155
00:09:13.161 --> 00:09:17.910
they found out that in dull and Helms and others had lied about the

156
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.110
CIA's involvement with Oswald and,

157
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.950
and with their own agents who had had these peripheral. Um,

158
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.110
we don't know if they were peripheral or not,

159
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.030
but definitely encounters with Oswald. They withheld all that.

160
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.870
So the house voted to have what they call the house select committee on assassin

161
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.540
nations that began in 77, in 78, they released their report,

162
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.020
which they concluded there was a,

163
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:47.020
a probable conspiracy to kill Kennedy that Oswal didn't

164
00:09:47.021 --> 00:09:51.460
act alone. And you know, it's, there's lots of books about that. Yeah. Uh,

165
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.340
and in their findings. And then later the two, the head of the committee,

166
00:09:56.110 --> 00:10:01.050
Robert Blakely wrote a book where he said that that Ruby had acted

167
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.250
on behalf of, um,

168
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.650
the conspiracy to silence Oswald that he had stalked him,

169
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.570
premeditated the murder. And, uh, that the whole thing was part of, of,

170
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.840
of keeping the secret was Wes a part of that,

171
00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.160
you know, again, I can't prove it.

172
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.520
I wanted to find out if Wes had had any encounter or any, you know,

173
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:28.920
interaction with Ruby prior to Ruby committing the murder.

174
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.640
Couldn't find that. And that's the kind of thing that maybe there's no evidence,

175
00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:35.320
maybe it happened, but there's no evidence,

176
00:10:35.321 --> 00:10:38.110
but I wasn't gonna put it in the book. Uh,

177
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.270
and I exhausted every resource I had, you know.

178
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.990
<v 0>Because that, that one has always been so puzzling for me,</v>

179
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.070
cuz here's this guy that's not connected to the Mo murder allegedly and then

180
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.470
steps forward and shoots Oswald in front of everybody. Yeah.

181
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.220
Sentencing himself. I mean like there's no doubt about it. Yeah.

182
00:10:57.221 --> 00:10:59.700
You're the guy who did it. Yeah. Everyone saw it. Right.

183
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:01.540
You're gonna go to jail forever. Right. Why.

184
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.780
<v 1>Would you do that? Well, the first report, which was, uh,</v>

185
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.020
fabricated by his first lawyer who admitted this years and years later, uh,

186
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.860
he told Ruby to say he did it to spare Jackie Kennedy from having to come to

187
00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:16.580
Dallas for a trial of Oswalt. Yeah. That was made up made no sense.

188
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.130
And then Mel BEAI was assigned to the case, uh, was, I mean,

189
00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:23.530
Ruby fired like three lawyers in the first couple weeks,

190
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.810
the Mel Mel Mevin BEAI took over and took it to trial.

191
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:32.250
And his argument was that he had had an epileptic fit and didn't know what he

192
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:36.810
was doing. And when he was grabbed by the, the cops, after he shot Ozal,

193
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:41.040
he said, Hey, I'm Ruby. What, what am I doing here? What are you doing to me?

194
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:44.160
Don't you know who I am? Cause he knew all the cops. Um,

195
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.120
my argument in my book is it's important.

196
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.360
My most important finding is that a CIA contracted agent

197
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.160
or researcher for mind control

198
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.200
became the most important witness to the Warren commission.

199
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:06.840
He became that witness's doctor right before he testified and told his story.

200
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.720
I go, that should have been disclosed obviously to the commission,

201
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.190
but they're not gonna say it cuz it's a secret for program. Right.

202
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.870
And then he goes crazy and then he goes crazy. Uh,

203
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.110
I got told by a couple of the people who were, um,

204
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:23.270
nobody on the commission would talk to me that was alive when I started pursuing

205
00:12:23.271 --> 00:12:27.950
them. Um, Joel Ford, wouldn't talk to me. Uh, AR I specter.

206
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.870
I, I think I mentioned that to you before. There's an interesting, um, uh,

207
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.580
I approached Dar inspectorter who was running for reelection.

208
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:41.180
This was 2002 and told him I had new information

209
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.580
and he had Al he had always maintained, you know, he w he, he,

210
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:48.820
he made a lot of money off of his books about, um,

211
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.660
justice and hi, and the magic, you know,

212
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:55.010
defending his magic bully bullets theory. He always said,

213
00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:58.410
if anybody comes to me with new evidence, I'll look at it with an open mind.

214
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.810
So I had sent him a persuasive letter while his people, uh,

215
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.130
they finally said, all right,

216
00:13:05.131 --> 00:13:09.890
if you have these documents showing that this doctor who treated Ruby,

217
00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.040
you know, and within the 24 hours, he lost his mind, uh,

218
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.000
specter will look at them and then decide if he'll talk to you, fax 'em to us.

219
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.680
And at that point, that was 2002.

220
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.440
I had lost the magazine story and I didn't have a book deal.

221
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.240
So I was operating entirely on my own. I said,

222
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.360
I can't send this stuff to you because it's my smoking gun,

223
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.480
the letters between got leave and, and Wes describing all the experiment.

224
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.270
So finally specter agreed to talk to me on the phone for a few minutes.

225
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.510
And it was amazing.

226
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:45.470
He called me from the Senate floor while they were waiting to vote on whether or

227
00:13:45.471 --> 00:13:48.270
not they were gonna invade Iraq. This was 2002. Oh.

228
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:50.790
So we were only supposed to talk for a few minutes.

229
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.790
And when I explained what I had and what it showed west had, you know,

230
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:58.820
involved with, at the time he treated Ruby, he said, well,

231
00:13:58.821 --> 00:14:01.860
if you're not gonna send this stuff to me, I don't know. You know,

232
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.060
I need to see it. And I go, well, I, I can't send it to you. And he said, well,

233
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:10.300
you wanna meet me? Cuz I told him I was in Philadelphia visiting my folks.

234
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.500
And he he's was from Philadelphia too. He says, I'm there on the weekend.

235
00:14:14.501 --> 00:14:18.170
I'll meet you Saturday. I have a squash game at the Windham hotel,

236
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.130
meet me there. Christ squash &lt;laugh&gt;.

237
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.770
So we had a meeting set up, uh, for like three days later.

238
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.410
And this is something I'm always second guessing about. I made a decision.

239
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.290
I don't think I got too.

240
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.680
I don't think I've ever really got paranoid during this.

241
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.120
But I specter had been a long term Senator.

242
00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:44.800
He was running for reelection and it was the first time in his career that the

243
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:48.040
polls were against him. That his opponent was, uh,

244
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.800
they were predicting that he was gonna lose. I specter was gonna lose. Uh,

245
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.480
he had also, you know, defended this magic bullet theory forever.

246
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.560
I mean more people knew him for the Kennedy assassination than anything else.

247
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.400
I thought. So if I do meet with him and I show him these documents,

248
00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:05.040
maybe it was grandiosemy too. I thought he's gonna go, oh my God,

249
00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.440
I need to be part of their, you know, exposure. Cuz if he,

250
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.950
he didn't and walked away from it,

251
00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.910
I thought they were important enough that he would know that that would,

252
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.470
you know, once they were publicized and he had the opportunity to say, Hey,

253
00:15:20.471 --> 00:15:23.870
we need to look into this and didn't he would look bad. So then I thought,

254
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:28.270
well maybe he's gonna two things. He's either gonna use it for, uh,

255
00:15:28.271 --> 00:15:31.620
to get publicity, have a press conference and help him reelection.

256
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.220
Or he's gonna use it to be the hero of it and

257
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.340
run with it before I published a book. And then I'll just be a footnote,

258
00:15:40.341 --> 00:15:44.940
you know, to all this cuz he took it. So I canceled the meeting the morning of,

259
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.780
oh, I called up his press secretary, uh,

260
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.090
and his cell phone, like three phones I had for him. And I said,

261
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:56.890
you have to tell Senator specter. I am so sorry, but there's an emergency.

262
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.370
I've gotta go back to Los Angeles.

263
00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.370
I actually was scheduled to go the day after on Sunday.

264
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.290
So it was a lie and I didn't talk to anyone. I just left the message.

265
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:06.810
And I said, I I'm so sorry,

266
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:10.810
but I obviously I've worked so hard to get this meaning. It's embarrassing,

267
00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:15.560
but I have to go back. So, um, I left my parents' place,

268
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.960
um, to go to the post office cuz I had been there for three months.

269
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.600
I was actually writing the first version of the proposal at their place to get

270
00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:24.200
away from my friends and you know,

271
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:28.800
all the distractions in LA and I was only going for like 15 minutes. I go mom,

272
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.480
if that press secretary calls, I told them I was leaving.

273
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.750
So tell him that I'm I just went to the airport and I, and I apologize.

274
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.550
And she goes, well, I can't lie to a press secretary. I go, well, you got to,

275
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.350
so I go to the post office and I come home 15 minutes later and she's like,

276
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:50.310
as white as a ghost, I go, what? And she goes, Senator specter called, I go,

277
00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.630
you mean the press? Ecretary she goes, no, he called himself.

278
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.700
He to know what happened, why you changed your mind and why you were canceling.

279
00:16:56.701 --> 00:17:00.060
And I had to lie to him and I don't lie. I go, but I lied to the Senator.

280
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.020
You know, he was a big deal in Pennsylvania back then. And so, um,

281
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.660
I don't know if that was a mistake on my part. I think, you know, 20,

282
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:12.940
20 hindsight, I should have done it and taken my chances. I did go, who.

283
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.570
<v 0>Knows what he would've done. I know that's the thing.</v>

284
00:17:15.571 --> 00:17:19.650
That's a very powerful man. And if he thought that he was in danger, yeah.

285
00:17:19.651 --> 00:17:22.130
He could have driven off a cliff &lt;laugh&gt;.

286
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.450
<v 1>I never, I mean, I really didn't try to think like that through all those years.</v>

287
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:27.290
I got, I would've thought like.

288
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.370
<v 0>That when it comes to AR inspectorter. I mean,</v>

289
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.970
do you know how deep that guy had to be in on that to come up with that whack?

290
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.113
I know magic.

291
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.880
<v 1>That theory. Yeah.</v>

292
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.120
<v 0>Yeah. That theory's so bad.</v>

293
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:41.240
The fact that that actually gets debated and the fact that it never gets brought

294
00:17:41.241 --> 00:17:41.441
up,

295
00:17:41.441 --> 00:17:45.320
that there were more bullet fragments in Connelly's body than there were missing

296
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.520
from that bullet. Yeah. And the fact that anyone who knows anything about guns,

297
00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:52.880
right? Any, anyone who's ever shot a gun has seen what a bullet, when,

298
00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.560
when a bullet shatters bone mm-hmm,

299
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.520
&lt;affirmative&gt; what it looks like would look at that bullet and think that bullet

300
00:17:57.521 --> 00:18:00.960
went through two human beings. Right. Right. And the fact that the,

301
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.720
the reason why they had to make up this theory in the first place was cuz a guy

302
00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:07.840
was hit by a Rick ricochet on the underpass. Yeah.

303
00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:09.950
You know the whole story you behind that. Well, here's what.

304
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:10.783
<v 1>I did.</v>

305
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:15.310
I tried not to lose myself any more than I had to in each

306
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.030
compartmentalized area I was going into. So with the Kennedy assassination,

307
00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.390
I just did a superficial cause like Manson.

308
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.350
I was never interested in anything so-called conspiracies. Yeah.

309
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.300
I had never cared about Ken or John Kennedy assassination.

310
00:18:31.301 --> 00:18:34.700
But once I found out that west was connected to Ruby and again,

311
00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:36.780
that was a moment that I was like, oh no, I mean,

312
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.900
first it was west and the CIA and then I'm like, and Ruby,

313
00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.540
how can I not look at the Kennedy assassination?

314
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.740
So I kept my focus narrowly just on Ruby Oswald, west specter.

315
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.050
I looked a little bit of the magic bullet and agree with you,

316
00:18:51.051 --> 00:18:54.090
but I never did a deep dive into a lot of that stuff.
