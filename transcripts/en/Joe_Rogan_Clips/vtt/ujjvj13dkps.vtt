00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.120
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.760
<v 1>I I've heard like people, uh, particularly like, uh, um,</v>

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.880
left wing leaning feminists or, or like, so female comics who are feminists,

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.320
who I know several of. Oh, dare you. And I've uh, yes.

5
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:17.200
I know you call people out. Well, I calling 'em out. I'll call. 'em not by name,

6
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:20.240
but, uh, but I've, I've heard and they'll, they'll get very, and,

7
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:21.910
and of them said to me, once they go, you know, Dave,

8
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:24.830
your whole thing is just that you hate women. Aw. That's, you're horrible.

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.790
But it's like, hate.

10
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.670
<v 0>Women. Like what do you,</v>

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.510
I saw woman say that to Brian POA and you know what he said, it was hilarious.

12
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.070
He goes, you know what? I've heard that before. And every woman that said that,

13
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.070
I hated &lt;laugh&gt;.

14
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.110
<v 1>That really is a great response because it was a stupid.</v>

15
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.940
<v 0>Argument. It is. She was just like saying like, you know, a blanket statement.</v>

16
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.860
You hate women. No, no you.

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.980
<v 1>But I just go, I, I, and I challenge a lot of people on, on the left, who,</v>

18
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.140
who talk about race or sexism and these things, I just challenge you to, to,

19
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.540
to just entertain the possibility for like one second entertain

20
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:01.810
the possibility that you're not right about all of this to off.

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.770
And that the correct position is to treat everybody equal.

22
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.170
Now I know that sounds really, really wild and out there,

23
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.170
and I'm not taking a new account, my white privilege and the history,

24
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:10.450
but just entertain for one second.

25
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.170
The possibility that the correct answer is to treat everybody equal and not

26
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:15.890
judge them based on their race. And then you,

27
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.770
if you entertain that for one second, you'll start realizing like, oh, holy.

28
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.880
If that's true, I'm really the one being the big here. I've seen this. So like,

29
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.480
uh, um, if you know,

30
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.440
the roast battle shows they have down at the comedy store here and,

31
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:30.560
and they started doing 'em in New York too. Now they're really popular.

32
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.000
There are like these group of female comics that will come out and I don't even

33
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.160
begrudge them for this, but they'll come out and just hardcore,

34
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:41.360
like root for the female comic. Okay. Like they'll post about like,

35
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.950
just wanna see more women eat at roast battle coming out tonight to cheer on my

36
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:48.270
girl, blah, blah. And there'll be this dynamic where like their first two jokes,

37
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.510
you know, they'll just get this. Like, it's just like, you know,

38
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.070
female voices from the corner where the comics hang like super, super loud for,

39
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.910
for the chick comic. And like, whatever, I don't begrudge them. Anything like,

40
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:01.350
fine, come do that. But it's just like those same people who will be like,

41
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.470
you're like against women.

42
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:07.460
Like I would never in a million years go out to a show and be like,

43
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.740
I'm just rooting for the men today. Like, like, I don't think this way,

44
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.180
I'm not like on team man, but you are on team women. Like, it's just,

45
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.340
it just seems to me that there's a lot of that going on. You know what I mean?

46
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.540
A lot of that where it's like, you,

47
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.690
you kind of project this thing that you see racism everywhere,

48
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.250
or you see sexism everywhere.

49
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.450
But all I really see is you lecturing people based on race.

50
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.810
<v 0>Sex. Well, in their mind, they're allowed to do it the same way.</v>

51
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.810
Kane Vela is allowed to have brown pride in his chest. Yeah.

52
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.930
Kind the same thing. Like you're, you're disenfranchised or you're marginalized.

53
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.890
So you're allowed to stay. Even if you're not,

54
00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:45.520
you're playing that victim card as a woman. And you're allowed to say,

55
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.600
I'm here to support my girl.

56
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.600
Like I was talking about this on stage the other day,

57
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.280
I saw a bumper sticker in a car. It said girls kick. And I was like,

58
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.280
some of them. Yeah. Some of them are lazy SLS. I like,

59
00:02:56.281 --> 00:02:59.240
what are you gonna align yourself with 150 million women just in this country

60
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.280
alone. That's ridiculous. And I was saying, if a guy had a bumper sticker,

61
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.760
it said, boys, kick. He'd be like,

62
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.320
follow that guy and find out where he is been these kids. Cuz first of all,

63
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.400
you'd never say boys, &lt;laugh&gt; boys kick. You put that on a, your bumper stick.

64
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:15.400
What the are you? You'd pull 'em over. Let see your license. Where do you live,

65
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.790
man? What do you do for a living? Why what's that bumper sticker about the, the?

66
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.743
Do you mean by that?

67
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.390
<v 1>Yes. And I don't need, like, I,</v>

68
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.430
I almost feel like an sometimes where I preface everything with a disclaimer,

69
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.070
like, and I'm not saying this I'm not, but I just wanted to be clear that like,

70
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.470
I'm not saying there aren't exceptions to the rule, of course.

71
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:33.470
But it's also kind of strange to me that like, if you wanna celebrate women,

72
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.270
why are you celebrating such a masculine quality? Like, it's kind of like,

73
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.260
it's like, look, there are white players who are basketball players, right.

74
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.420
There are white Navitzky was an amazing basketball player. Right.

75
00:03:43.421 --> 00:03:47.180
But if I just wrote somewhere like white people kick at basketball, it's like,

76
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.820
well actually, well this is a movie come out.

77
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:53.260
They don't in general women don't kick in general in generally speaking,

78
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.300
that's a male thing to do. Right? So like,

79
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.060
I'm not saying there's not exceptions to that, but you're like,

80
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.450
you're writing white people kick at basketball. It's kind of misleading.

81
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.120
&lt;laugh&gt; right.

82
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.530
<v 0>Well, there's that thing. That's coming out that movie with Steve,</v>

83
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.010
Corll where he plays, uh,

84
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:08.210
that man who had a basket or the tennis match against Billy Jean King.

85
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.090
And he was like barely ranked.

86
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.290
He was a terrible tennis player and he Billy Jean King up. And it was,

87
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.410
and he was like sort of mocking her the whole way. And it was like a real.

88
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.320
<v 1>Hallmark. I don't know about that. He just, he just played a, a.</v>

89
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.360
<v 0>Tennis player, a professional tennis player, but he wasn't the Basson,</v>

90
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:25.080
Billy Jean King was the best woman in the world.

91
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.320
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they played and the Steve Carrell character beat her.

92
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:30.480
Isn't that? Wasn't that what happened? I think so.

93
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.640
I believe that's what happened. I'm I'm getting them conflated with Renee,

94
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:34.980
Richard,

95
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.480
the guy who used to be a man and then became a transgender woman and started

96
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.590
stomping everybody in tennis. He's like terrible as a man.

97
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.390
And then it became a woman who's one of the best of the world. And like,

98
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.470
but there's no biological difference even without a penis.

99
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.150
You're still stomping him. It again.

100
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.950
<v 1>Is like so funny because once you it's so funny,</v>

101
00:04:51.951 --> 00:04:54.870
like how much this stuff starts undermining their own arguments.

102
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.830
<v 0>That Billy Jean King won. Yeah. Yeah. I get that wrong. So I got wrong.</v>

103
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.500
The Renee Richard won. Yeah. That's what I fus. So, um, what was the,

104
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.820
and, and he was like particularly gross. Right.

105
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.380
And Steve Corll plays him really well in the movie. Same Steve Corll who played,

106
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.300
uh, that crazy guy in that wrestling.

107
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.180
<v 1>He did a really great job with that. A creepy story.</v>

108
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.940
<v 0>What a crazy story. The.</v>

109
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.900
<v 1>ESPN 30 for 30 on this. Yes, I did so good, man. I mean, you know,</v>

110
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.770
not a good in the sense that the such a compelling, unbelievable story.

111
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.730
Oh my God. Yeah.

112
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:30.330
<v 0>So when Steve Corll played that character, and then you watch the video,</v>

113
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.210
the actual character, they're like, whoa, like he just nailed that guy.

114
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.290
<v 1>Steve, car's an incredible talent man. Oh, he's.</v>

115
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.170
<v 0>So he's such a good.</v>

116
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.690
<v 1>Actor to be that funny of a comedian and that good of a dramatic actor.</v>

117
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.320
pretty incredible. I guess his comedy though is always kind of his acting,

118
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.000
you know, is like, that's his strength in comedy?

119
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:47.520
Like he he'd own that character.

120
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.520
<v 0>Kind of, you know, well, Roger Feder said that recently and he got in trouble,</v>

121
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:53.360
right? That the, the best women, no, wasn't wasn't Roger.

122
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.440
<v 1>Feder was, what's the name of the older guy? Uh. What's what's the John McEnroe.</v>

123
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.680
<v 0>McEnroe. Yeah. MC row said that and.</v>

124
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.400
<v 1>They let him, they let him into it. He said he,</v>

125
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.160
he started by saying Serena was the best female player. Right. And then they go,

126
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.120
why female? Oh, well. And he was like, well, what do you mean? I,

127
00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:11.520
because I think she's the best female player. He goes, well, why female?

128
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.640
Why not say male? He goes, cuz the men are way better.

129
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.790
Like he was literally just answering the question.

130
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.910
Like I know I started off giving this woman an extraordinary compliment.

131
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.631
<v 0>That was the story.</v>

132
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:25.430
I remember didn't Serena play against an unranked male player. She did.

133
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:27.990
They used to play when they were younger. I think she, well,

134
00:06:27.991 --> 00:06:31.510
she played against some guy that was the story and the guy kicked her and

135
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:32.350
everybody was like, what?

136
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.390
<v 1>It just seems to me to be this thing where I kind of look at,</v>

137
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:39.020
obviously like we're talking at general here and there are exceptions. Like,

138
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.820
you know what I'm saying? Like there are like, you know, uh, uh,

139
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.340
Rhonda Rousey could beat the out of me. I still, well,

140
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:46.620
you're not a fighter fighter. I still use her as an example. But it's a bad.

141
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.700
<v 0>Example. No, no, but I'm saying you're.</v>

142
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.500
<v 1>Not a fighter. No, but I'm just making the point that like,</v>

143
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.700
if you have this stereotype that men are stronger than women or something like

144
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:55.740
that, there are exceptions to the rule. If you get, and there are, there are,

145
00:06:55.741 --> 00:06:58.330
and I still use Rononda Rousey, even though she not champ anymore.

146
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:00.490
She's just still got that ring to it. Um,

147
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.490
but I'm saying there are exceptions to the rule. There are exceptions. And,

148
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.490
and to treat someone based on a group dynamic is, is ignorant,

149
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.850
like to, to, but if you're going to, like,

150
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.810
I do think there are differences between men and women generally speaking.

151
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:17.010
And if you believe that it's like, if we're gonna celebrate women,

152
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.520
I just think it's odd that we have to celebrate the most masculine achievements

153
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.760
of women. It's like celebrating them kicking.

154
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.160
There are these things that I feel like women are superior to men in that I'm

155
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:29.960
very impressed by them. Like.

156
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.680
<v 0>I, I just think women, hold on, lemme stop you.</v>

157
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.120
Cuz you think that running a corporation is masculine.

158
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.920
Like do you think that being involved in any creative endeavor is masculine?

159
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.590
Do you think that involved in anything in tech is masculine? No, I was.

160
00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:43.110
That's what they're talking about. Right? Well, I was more.

161
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.110
<v 1>Uh, uh, responding to the women kick. I bet.</v>

162
00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:47.790
<v 0>That's just stupid bumper sticker. No, you're right. It is.</v>

163
00:07:47.791 --> 00:07:51.070
It's really just group think is I think my issue with it was if.

164
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.150
<v 1>If you see things like, um, well I just,</v>

165
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.230
but the element I'm responding to is that kick as me just seems to be kind of

166
00:07:56.231 --> 00:07:58.510
like a masculine thing. I'm describing that as.

167
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.540
<v 0>Masculine. Yeah. Just one silly stupid bumper sticker. Sure, sure.</v>

168
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:03.300
But like to say those things, right? Yes.

169
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.060
<v 1>Yes. But I just think there's something about it.</v>

170
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:09.020
It seems to me like the nurturing element of femininity is almost like

171
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:13.820
denigrated and the kissy kick element is like is

172
00:08:13.821 --> 00:08:14.860
praise where it's like,

173
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.810
if I'm talking kicking and nurture and I'm talking men verse women in general,

174
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.130
just broad speaking. Right? Like I,

175
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.570
I tend to think of one being male and one being, uh, female, right.

176
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.050
<v 0>To wrap this all up and bring it all day.</v>

177
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.570
I think we'd all be better off male women, white, black, Asian, whatever,

178
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.570
if we just reasonable, nice people, you know?

179
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.330
And that's the real problem is that we lock off as we've been discussing all,

180
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.360
all day into these camps. Yeah. We are on camp,

181
00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.400
white male and we are on camp,

182
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.680
black male or camp gay or camp transgender or camp woman.

183
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.360
And we just lock into these ideologies and we hate anybody else different.

184
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.560
And we have these divisive things that we say like all white men are trash and

185
00:08:56.561 --> 00:08:59.480
less proven. Otherwise, you know, like that kind of crazy, like you're,

186
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.960
you're setting it up. So the guy's like, sorry, sorry. Like you come in. Sorry.

187
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.440
So it's not me. I didn't do it.

188
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.040
I didn't do it instead of just being a reasonable normal person,

189
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.080
but there's not enough reasonable normal people.

190
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.520
So women are constantly dealing with.

191
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.040
So they develop these kind of be pattern patterns of behavior.

192
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:18.870
They think out men as being these intrusive people who just want to get in your

193
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:21.230
pants and really don't care about you and they're manipulative and they just

194
00:09:21.231 --> 00:09:22.270
wanna you. Which is.

195
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.510
<v 1>When you say it. I mean that is somewhat true. That does try.</v>

196
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.270
<v 0>Describe us. True. And then men think of women as being manipulative too,</v>

197
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.510
always looking for the bigger, better deal, you know? Well,

198
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:31.470
they're gonna their personal trainer while you're at work.

199
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.630
And we think about getting divorced and losing all your money.

200
00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.300
You were too stupid. You didn't sign a prenuptial agreement.

201
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.180
She hires some kick attorney and then you're.

202
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.060
And we all know guys who have experienced that before too. They,

203
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.500
she lies about you beating the kids and then she gets full.

204
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.500
<v 1>Custody. Like that's all real, but then the good stuff is all real too.</v>

205
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:49.980
It's all, you know what I mean? It's like, that's all real.

206
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.541
And that does happen.

207
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:53.740
But then there's also like the chick who just like gives a guy like, you know,

208
00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:56.370
like the security and confidence. He never to go be great. Sure.

209
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.250
There's the guy who like,

210
00:09:57.251 --> 00:10:00.210
does support his chick through like her endeavors and like, you know, it's like,

211
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.610
sure. So it's like, you gotta, you know, it's like, it's like that in, in,

212
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.051
in the,

213
00:10:03.051 --> 00:10:06.410
the hurricane in Houston kind of put some perspective on that for me where it's

214
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:08.130
like, you know, it's like, you see just like all these people,

215
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:10.810
it's like Antifa versus Nazis as the state of the country.

216
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.050
And then you see like this, this horrible hurricane happen.

217
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.280
And just the acts of kindness after where you see these people, like,

218
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:20.040
like young guys, like, like these group of like 20 year olds, maybe they were,

219
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:22.840
I saw who took their, like their like, uh, motor boats.

220
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.480
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; down to Houston and are pulling old people yeah.

221
00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:29.000
Out of like their homes. And you're like, God it. Like that's our country too.

222
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.120
Yep. You know? And like, it is like, it it's all real.

223
00:10:31.121 --> 00:10:33.560
Like the Nazis are our country too, but that guy's our country.

224
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:33.801
<v 0>Too.</v>

225
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:37.510
But that is also is people responding to a very real pro problem where it really

226
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.630
unites people. They feel like they have to help each other. It's a real problem.

227
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.020
You know,

228
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.950
most of the time we're separating from each other by buildings and cars.

229
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.790
And there's this weird alienation we have with one another.
