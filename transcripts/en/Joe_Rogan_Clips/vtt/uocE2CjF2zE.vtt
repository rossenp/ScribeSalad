This is hilarious. You think about that?

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.460
<v 0>Well, how the does he have time to do that?</v>

8
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:25.200
Aren't you trying to protect us from the evil.

14
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.220
I'm going to give you something a little more than a Fowchee dollar, you know?

15
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.360
Uh, because, because of what he just did. I, oh, I got you.

16
00:00:42.361 --> 00:00:45.720
25 cheese Topps, rookie card, PSA 10.

17
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.780
This is something you should keep for.

18
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.380
Probably we just probably increased the value by five times. Right? And I just,

19
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:56.040
by talking about it, that's actually a card for Fowchee.

20
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.140
And uh, can you see that?

21
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.290
<v 0>He's throwing a pitch.</v>

22
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.940
<v 1>And he's throwing a pitch. Did you see his.</v>

23
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.940
<v 0>Pitch? I would imagine it was atrocious. You.</v>

24
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.340
<v 1>Got to see the pitch. I can't show it. You cannot ride.</v>

25
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:09.690
You can't show it right in the worst.

26
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.640
<v 0>Wow. That's very arguable, but appetite one bad.</v>

27
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:19.560
1 57 and a bad one. Gary Del Bhate hit a bad one. Oh,

28
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.290
Baba Booey. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, well.

29
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.050
<v 1>Anyways, I thought he would appreciate that.</v>

30
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
Who the is that sexy guy right there. Right. Okay. Well thank you very much.

31
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.520
I figured you would, you will, you know how much that's worth today?

32
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.340
It's probably worth 50 bucks. It's worth a couple hundred dollars. Really?

33
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.760
That's the point that a Fowchee baseball card is worth, worth,

34
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.230
worth a couple hundred dollars.

35
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.410
But I think it just went up after he became sexy. Well then.

36
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.940
<v 0>The sexiest man in America, the sexiest, right? Wow. Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.230
It's worth a.

38
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.390
<v 1>Thousand dollars. It just went up. Oh.</v>

39
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.810
<v 0>Oh well that's what someone's correct asking, but there's not a lot of them, so.</v>

40
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.000
<v 1>Yeah, no, no. You're very much.</v>

41
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.890
Today is his street credit for his baseball card. Just went up. Yeah. With, uh,

42
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.460
with Fowchee. But uh, we'll see. What's going to happen there. Yeah.

43
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.950
<v 0>How much? Who the is collecting cards?</v>

44
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.110
<v 1>Oh dude. Are you kidding me? Do you know?</v>

45
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.650
<v 0>It was a UFC. I have a UFC card. That's like worth money.</v>

46
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.880
I have max Holloway's rookie card. How much is it worth? I haven't looked,

47
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:24.570
but there, I mean the card game has exploded.

48
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.870
<v 1>Are you following it at all or? No, I don't have time for that.</v>

49
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.070
You're not following at all. What's going on with the card game? No. Okay.

50
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:36.210
Can I, can I, uh, shock you with some numbers if that's okay with you, please.

51
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.900
Okay.

52
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.850
What do you think is the value of the most expensive card in

53
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:45.810
the world today? Uh, just throw a number on this, babe. Ruth, have a card.

54
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.140
Maybe it's got a card, but it's not the most expensive. Really? Jackie Robinson.

55
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.590
He's got a card, but it's probably not in the top 1000 of the most expensive.

56
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.910
Oh.

57
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.510
<v 0>Boy. Yeah, no.</v>

58
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.450
<v 1>I'm out of guesses. Mickey mantle has a card. Okay. Mickey.</v>

59
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.770
<v 0>Mantle. Okay. How much is that?</v>

60
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.940
<v 1>10, 19 52 Topps rookie card. There's only three of them.</v>

61
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.820
What do you guess please? 20 million. 20 million bucks.

62
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.840
That's actually the number really? So you do follow. I just say, oh,

63
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.330
you're on the.is 20 million bucks. I'm good at that.

64
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.790
The guy who bought it in 1998,

65
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.330
the owner of the diamond bags paid 1 0 4 for it in 98,

66
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.620
from 1 0 4 to 20 K today. That's a big jump.

67
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.680
A Luca credit card, a Luca rookie car.

68
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.480
Two days after his birthday at 22 years old sold for 5.2 million.

69
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.700
That's a basketball player, Joe. Yeah. Luca,

70
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.620
Don chick is a great basketball player.

71
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.240
I was going to ask you don't follow basketball. I follow sports. I got you.

72
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.910
Yeah. So the main sports commentator who doesn't fall sport,

73
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.190
cause you got to baseball. You got a card as well. You got a card,

74
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.070
you got a card with the, I know there's a UFC card. There is,

75
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:52.180
I think it's worth some money. Yeah. [inaudible] yeah. You got a card.

76
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.250
The card industry. Today's Booman, there's a,

77
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.880
there's a few guys that are doing it the right way. Uh, the card,

78
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.930
private equity business got into it. They got into it. So, you know,

79
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:06.280
Jordan's rookie cards were selling for like 25,000 bucks a few years ago.

80
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.000
And once he's probably, there's only 330 of those PSA, 10 rookie cards.

81
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.590
These guys got into it. Next thing you know,

82
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:15.550
jumped to a couple of them sold for $700,000.

83
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.920
I can't fake that. Can you fake a car?

84
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.210
The best thing about the card game that changed is there's a grading service

85
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:27.070
called PSA show PSA. That's based out of Newport. They don't even,

86
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:29.280
they're not even taking any new cards, run them because they can't.

87
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:32.560
It takes 12 months for you to get graded. They're that busy right now? No joke.

88
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.890
And it costs like 50 bucks, 40 bucks, a hundred bucks to get cards. Great. It,

89
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:40.180
depending on the quality of it, you send it to them. They look at it.

90
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.020
And then based on that, like you see this year that says a PSA stamp,

91
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.200
they give it a score, there's a VIN number to it. And then there's a,

92
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.500
not a vendor, but a serial number to it. And, and this has got a value. Okay.

93
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.060
So PSA changed a game. Beckett. Grading service changed the game.
