WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.520
<v 0>He's constantly subtweeting and like, you know, making fun of Trump.</v>

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.120
<v 1>Yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Wow. That's gonna be fun. I'm sure.</v>

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.640
A fun household, but what's this is what gets me go full screen in this go.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.960
You can't what's interesting. Is these dumies behind him. Yeah.

5
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.720
Like while this is happening,

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.870
one of the interesting things about this to me is that his

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.750
back is to all these people, which is very odd, right?

8
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.670
So they're all behind him. Instead of having a static backdrop,

9
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.190
you you're getting to, part of the thing is the other people,

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.870
it's not just him, it's their reactions, groceries you.

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.460
<v 0>Yeah. It's its a sense of belonging to a weird group. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.340
And everyone has that like leftists and rightists and whatever all have this

13
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:53.580
weird belonging. But when it's, again, it goes back to the China thing. Right?

14
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:54.540
Well we have Fox news.

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.700
We have a way of giving people information that if you follow,

16
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.370
I follow Fox news on Twitter, because I wanna see what they tell people. Right?

17
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.250
Yes. And it's, it's a weird thing. Cause it's not like it's all lies. Right.

18
00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:08.530
There's there's often lies they're there,

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.730
but it's like a very different mixture of things than you would get from the

20
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:17.330
rest of the media. And a lot of it is it's very clear if you,

21
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.930
if you follow Fox news, like they're, they're targeting in older, white,

22
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.560
uh, rural, suburban audience, right? Yes.

23
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:27.840
So there's a lot of like weird human interest stories about an alligator popping

24
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:29.000
outta the sewer and things like that.

25
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.920
Like things that are not they're they're they have no political agenda,

26
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.920
but they're just trying to get those old.

27
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.920
<v 1>White people to pay attention.</v>

28
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.761
<v 0>Yeah. Well they're,</v>

29
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:39.480
they're sending a message that the world is kind of scary and weird and you

30
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.080
know, we need to protect ourselves. There's an alligator on the golf course.

31
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.590
They yeah. Like they love those stories. Right. &lt;laugh&gt; it's.

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.310
<v 1>The alligator of the golf course.</v>

33
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.670
<v 0>Is my favorite. It's just local news. Yes. It's the 10 o'clock local news put,</v>

34
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.630
you know, uh, nationwide and added in there with some, uh,

35
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.870
cheerleading for this bizarrely dysfunctional administration. Well isn't.

36
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.710
<v 1>Sean Hannity now the number one, watch cable news program.</v>

37
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.700
<v 0>I, something like that. Yeah. I don't know the number. I think it's.</v>

38
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.460
<v 1>Number one and it's awful. &lt;laugh&gt; they.</v>

39
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.500
<v 0>Just, they just, uh, there was just a poll. This goes back to the, you know,</v>

40
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:17.180
social credit thing. They did a poll. What is the most trusted news source? Um,

41
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.060
and Fox news gave number two. What's number.

42
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.900
<v 1>One. BBC. That makes sense. Well,</v>

43
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.090
CNN is just taking a giant hit because his constant,

44
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.410
constant berating of them. And then you see Jim Acosta, you know, the whole,

45
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.610
these, all these pro wrestling fans,

46
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.930
like giving him the finger and screaming at 'em and yeah. And it's.

47
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.610
<v 0>It's what I, I, I do worry, uh,</v>

48
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.720
that this is a hard thing to come back from because you know, once you,

49
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.880
you know, like one, another thing that Trump said was that, you know,

50
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:49.680
don't believe anything you're told, right.

51
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:53.240
Unless you hear it from me and Shawn says the same thing. No, I was sorry.

52
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.680
Tucker Carlson said the same thing. Right. Did he say that too?

53
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.760
Tucker Carlson said like, yeah. Any other show than this one? Don't believe it.

54
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.680
Yeah. Look at this.

55
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.400
<v 1>The media he has on women for Trump. Yeah. It's just what,</v>

56
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.160
and then after listening to this radio lab podcast about

57
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:14.160
these Russian troll farms and about how they implement these things,

58
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.070
you gotta think is all of this organic is how many

59
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:20.870
of, how much of this is orchestrated?

60
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.390
How much of this attacking CNN is orchestrated.

61
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.590
<v 0>It's part of it is part of it is just, it builds on itself. Right? All you.</v>

62
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.550
<v 1>Need is just a little bit of.</v>

63
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.870
<v 0>A push talking to someone who is, uh, who is, you know,</v>

64
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:34.190
boasting about how hard Donald Trump works.

65
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.620
That like compared to previous presidents, he's really just putting in the, oh,

66
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:40.341
that's not true. Right.

67
00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:44.820
Which is like really the least thing that you could think about. Yeah. He.

68
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.740
<v 1>Wakes up late, he watches eight hours. He watches TV a day, plays.</v>

69
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.540
<v 0>Golf every day. He like spends all the time at his own resorts.</v>

70
00:03:50.541 --> 00:03:54.660
Like of all the fantasies you could invent. That's a very weird one. Well.

71
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.620
<v 1>People just love to find narratives that fit. What, what would be, you know,</v>

72
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.210
acceptable for their opinions, this, this side that they've taken.

73
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.570
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah. And so he's, you know, he give them credit.</v>

74
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.090
He gives people a narrative that works for them. Well.

75
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.610
<v 1>CNN does it too. Cuz CNN, they, they spent so little time, uh,</v>

76
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:17.610
going over Donna Brazil's book about how the DNC had been

77
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:21.840
corrupted and about how they had rigged the primaries for Hillary and really

78
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:25.360
screwed Bernie Sanders over this is not a narrative that they dwelled on.

79
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.320
They didn't dwell on the fact that she illegally deleted 30 plus thousand

80
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.720
emails and said there were about yoga classes. &lt;laugh&gt; like that,

81
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.760
that is just as preposterous.

82
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.990
And just as it's just as damning against CNN as some of the nonsense

83
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:46.270
that Fox news does, there's no one pure organization of news. That's.

84
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.190
<v 0>Wholly objective. It's not just as. I, I would.</v>

85
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.550
I think that Fox news is special. I especially damning, I think that Fox,

86
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.090
I mean,

87
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.270
Fox news was founded by a guy who was a political operative for the Republican

88
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:57.100
party, right?

89
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.780
Like there might like individual reporters for most news organization tend to be

90
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:05.300
liberal. Uh, but they also sometimes tend to overcorrect for that,

91
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:07.580
like to try to bend over backwards, to be fair,

92
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:10.900
like way more Republicans are quoted in the New York times than Democrats ever

93
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.820
are. Mm. And I, I think that there are certainly biases and certainly, um,

94
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.620
uh, misrepresentations of reality from all of these different outlets.

95
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.570
But I think Fox news is special among the major ones.

96
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.450
<v 1>I would, I would concede that. And, but I also think that one,</v>

97
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.450
one example like the New York times is different because the New York times I

98
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:31.930
feel like because of the fact that's,

99
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.850
it's actually writers and it's in text you're,

100
00:05:34.851 --> 00:05:38.850
you're not dealing with people that have to be comfortable performing in front

101
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:42.960
of a camera, which eliminates a large SWA of intellectuals.

102
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.600
<v 0>Right. It's a very different medium,</v>

103
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.200
it's a different and they fact check and you know, uh,

104
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.640
it's carnival corrections. Yeah. You know, in a way that the,

105
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.480
the TV does not yeah, yeah. It's.

106
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.360
<v 1>Theater. Yeah. It's a different thing. Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.600
And people like Sean Hannity that if you read his written word,

108
00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.800
I don't think he would stand out.

109
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.400
<v 0>No. And I, and again, I, like I said,</v>

110
00:06:03.401 --> 00:06:05.840
it was before I worry about what happens next, cuz I,

111
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.440
I don't think that Trump will win again. I think he will. All right. I,

112
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.200
I don't think so. Think.

113
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.000
<v 1>It's entirely possible. He'll win again.</v>

114
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:13.920
<v 0>Yeah. I would be. But again, I didn't think,</v>

115
00:06:13.921 --> 00:06:15.920
think he was gonna win the first time. No, I did not. So I was just gonna say,

116
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.230
don't listen to me. Like, uh, before Donald Trump,

117
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.230
I was really good at predicting. Who's gonna win elections and the,

118
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.150
I have no ability once he's in the, in the game. So, but I,

119
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.430
I worry that the people who sort of are on his side are gonna feel even more

120
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.790
disenfranchised and disenchanted and angry after he loses again than they do

121
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.190
now. And that's, that's gonna.

122
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.900
<v 1>Be a problem. I think that's a real fear. And I, I think that the,</v>

123
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:41.980
one of the reasons why I said it's entirely possible and I don't know if he will

124
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:44.540
win again, but I don't even know if I believe he'll win again.

125
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:45.740
But I think it's a possibility.

126
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.860
And I think that one of the reasons why I think that is I don't see wh who's

127
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:52.580
the, the big candidate on the other side, that's opposing him.

128
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.900
That stands out right now. Yeah. That's a problem.

129
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.050
And I think there's a real issue with people not wanting the job.

130
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.810
&lt;laugh&gt; it's a really scary job. Yeah. You know? I mean, it, it, it sucks.

131
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.690
You drive like a vampire that's hooked up to the back of your neck.

132
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.570
It's just so even with him,

133
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.370
with his unique ability to sociopathically,

134
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:19.120
sort of navigate the waters of accuse and guilt,

135
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.120
he still looks beaten down by this job. Yeah.

136
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.200
<v 0>But people want it. Maybe not the people we want to want it. Right.</v>

137
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.160
Who wants it.

138
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.880
<v 1>On the Democrat side? Who wants it on the left? That stands out. I.</v>

139
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.320
<v 0>Mean, I think I'm not excited by any of the people right now,</v>

140
00:07:34.321 --> 00:07:38.480
but I think no one is, I bet there's gonna be 10 people running. At least I,

141
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.510
I think that Biden is at least 50% chance to run Elizabeth.

142
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.470
Warren's definitely gonna run. Do.

143
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.670
<v 1>You think Elizabeth Warren though,</v>

144
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.310
she's got that real problem with the whole pons thing. Well,

145
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.630
that whole Indian thing,

146
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:52.670
whether you gonna run that narrative than whether you gonna win. Yeah. Right.

147
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.590
But that, that is a giant problem. The,

148
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:59.740
the thing that she may have faked whether or not she has native and heritage and

149
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:04.660
she's not willing to take a DNA test and that's this native American heritage,

150
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.460
she claimed is how she got into Harvard. And she,

151
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.340
she used that in order to get special status. And that's a problem,

152
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:12.901
you know,

153
00:08:12.901 --> 00:08:15.060
whether or not you should forgive someone for something they did a long,

154
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.980
long time ago, which I think you probably should. The,

155
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.650
the problem is it sort of, in some ways,

156
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.370
negates a lot of the good work and things that she said, because people say,

157
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.250
I can't trust her. She lied about her actual ethnicity.

158
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.010
<v 0>Yeah. It's but what is hard for me to do is to predict how much it will matter.</v>

159
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.050
Right? Yeah. Like in 2008 we had, uh,

160
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:41.960
a race between a Vietnam war hero and a black guy whose middle name was Husain.

161
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.680
&lt;laugh&gt; right. If you had told me that a few years earlier, who's gonna win.

162
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.760
Yeah. We would've.

163
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.600
<v 1>Gotten that one round. We also had Sarah Palin. I think exactly.</v>

164
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.600
<v 0>This is what we don't.</v>

165
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.600
<v 1>Know had taken a better running mate. It's entirely possible McCain.</v>

166
00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:55.434
Would've been president.

167
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.240
<v 0>I think that people were really tired of George w and I think that, uh,</v>

168
00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:01.480
McCain was just not a good candidate. I think he was gonna lose no.

169
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:01.921
<v 1>Matter what. Well,</v>

170
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:06.680
I think also Obama was so charismatic and so uniquely

171
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:11.120
intelligent and smooth and relaxed. And statesmanlike, I think he,

172
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.320
he fit the bill, but remember president.

173
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.590
<v 0>People were worried about like went to Jeremiah rights church and things like</v>

174
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:19.750
that. Right. Right. Stuff that didn't like at the time it was a big deal.

175
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.990
And you know, who cares eight years later, right? Yeah.

176
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.470
So I don't know about the Pana stuff.

177
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.310
<v 1>Uh, that's not, that's a big one though.</v>

178
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.830
The Pana stuff is a big one because it's a personal lie.

179
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.160
<v 0>I don't know. But again, I mean, I think Cory, Booker's gonna run,</v>

180
00:09:34.161 --> 00:09:38.310
came Harris run, uh, who knows. There's a bunch of people. I, I,

181
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.670
I would not be at all surprised if Joe Biden didn't run and I kind of don't

182
00:09:41.671 --> 00:09:43.270
think that he should, but uh,

183
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.470
he's getting up there and he's a Washington insider,

184
00:09:46.471 --> 00:09:47.990
which is not really what the country wants right.

185
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.830
<v 1>Now in 1988 in Boston,</v>

186
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:55.190
we used to have Joe Biden night at the comedy clubs and Joe Biden night was a

187
00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:57.020
night where would do other people's material.

188
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.500
&lt;laugh&gt; cause this is when Joe Biden got, got busted. Yeah.

189
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.380
With Kennedy's speeches. Yeah.

190
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.380
<v 0>Well, and Neil Kinnick, the British politician stole.</v>

191
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.380
<v 1>From him too. And this was when he was running for president in 88. Right.</v>

192
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.100
And so we, he's.

193
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.420
<v 0>Never done very well running for president. Like he's done several times.</v>

194
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.820
It's so I'm,

195
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.010
I think that he was a good vice president and people like him for that.

196
00:10:18.011 --> 00:10:19.490
And they might not want him to do more.

197
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.720
<v 1>Than that.</v>

198
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.010
Vice president's a great job if you want no one to pay attention to you. Yeah.

199
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.370
You.

200
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:24.203
<v 0>Know exactly.</v>

201
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.170
<v 1>You know, it's like being the, the, you know, the,</v>

202
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.090
the co-star and a buddy cop movie with a huge.

203
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.090
<v 0>Superstar, few responsibilities. Good to some funerals. Yeah, yeah. Right.</v>

204
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.960
<v 1>Easy.</v>

205
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.970
<v 0>Yeah. Unless you're Mike where you're trying to, you know,</v>

206
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:37.640
make it the hand aids tale behind the scenes.

207
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.360
<v 1>He seems like he's kinda laying back though. Like,</v>

208
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.720
especially over the last few months like that Trump is so insane that

209
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.240
you see very little Mike, pat.

210
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.240
<v 0>I don't think you see very little of him,</v>

211
00:10:49.241 --> 00:10:52.160
but I think that he's trying his best to put in policies behind the scenes.

212
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:53.760
Well.

213
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.080
<v 1>Um, what is this new thing that Jeff sessions is trying to.</v>

214
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:59.790
<v 0>Religious freedom. Yes.</v>

215
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.310
Which means you have to obey whatever the fundamentalist Christians &lt;laugh&gt; want

216
00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:03.740
to do.

217
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.750
<v 1>Yeah. Well, this is what, you know,</v>

218
00:11:05.751 --> 00:11:09.070
Michael malice was tweeting about this the other day. When, when he, he,

219
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.190
he tweeted this, he said,

220
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:15.110
when I said that a version of Sharia law could very well

221
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:18.260
be coming outta this administration, this is what I'm talking about. Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.260
<v 0>It's a, it's a weird backward thing where you define religious freedom to be,</v>

223
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.500
let fundamentalist Christians do whatever they want. Right.

224
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.820
<v 1>Yeah. And, and do it by law.</v>

225
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.020
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and it's, it's tricky because, uh,</v>

226
00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.020
yeah. I don't know. I mean, if someone wants to,

227
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.090
part of me is a little bit Liber and when it comes to personal action,

228
00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:43.690
like if someone doesn't wanna deal with you, that's their right. Yeah.

229
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.810
But when whole groups are being subject systematically to discrimination,

230
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.170
like gays are then yeah. The government steps in to protect them a little bit.

231
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:51.730
And I think that's okay.
