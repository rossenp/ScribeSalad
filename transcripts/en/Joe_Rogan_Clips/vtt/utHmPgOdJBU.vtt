00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, let's, let's get into that. So you,</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.820
you think that Biden has a very high likelihood of winning here we are.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.870
Let's just, if people come upon this in the future, today is the 14th,

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.620
14th of July, and we're a few months away from the election.

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.210
You feel like it looks like Biden is moving into the direction of

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.210
eventually winning. Well.

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.810
<v 1>I think he's already moved in that direction. And so the question is,</v>

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.190
can Trump change that direction between now and election day?

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.410
I think it's going to be very challenging.

10
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.550
Maybe his best opportunity is going to be the debates. Uh, we'll see.

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.320
I don't think you're going to hit him with a big problem or, or Trump. And,

12
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:47.150
you know, I, I voted for Trump, um, the first time and, you know,

13
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:50.210
I was initially going to vote libertarian, which is something I do.

14
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.640
And by the way, there isn't, there was a candidate, Joe Jorgensen,

15
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.740
who you should have on your show. I don't know if you've,

16
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.581
if you've thought about it,

17
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:59.360
but there is a woman running for president and she will be on the ballot in

18
00:00:59.361 --> 00:01:02.330
every state, Joe Jorgensen from the libertarian party.

19
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.270
And so everybody who thinks there should be a woman president,

20
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:08.990
I actually agree right now. And that's who we should elect voting.

21
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.630
<v 0>For, is that who you're going to vote for?</v>

22
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.840
<v 1>Well, I can't vote for anybody. I live in Puerto Rico.</v>

23
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.050
<v 0>Puerto Rico was a part of the United States, sort.</v>

24
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.930
<v 1>Of, it is part of the United States, but you remember, you know,</v>

25
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:24.290
from the revolution, no taxation without representation.

26
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.620
So what happens is when you move to Puerto Rico,

27
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.270
you no longer have to pay the federal income tax or the Obamacare tax,

28
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.170
which is great,

29
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.480
but then you can't vote for the president and you,

30
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:40.430
you don't have any member of Congress. You don't have a Senator.

31
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.960
So being in Puerto Rico,

32
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.400
I have no representation in Congress and I can't vote for president,

33
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.600
but the trade-off is I don't have to pay the taxes. So, you know, I,

34
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:52.310
that's a good trade-off that, um, you know,

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.000
pretty much everybody is willing to make, so I can't vote.

36
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.700
And normally I voted for the lesser of two evils anyway,

37
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.690
and most of the time I vote for the loser. So as far as I'm concerned,

38
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.460
giving up my right to vote for the loser is, is not much of a sacrifice,

39
00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:11.000
but you know, if I couldn't vote, I would still be living in Connecticut.

40
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.110
And it would be a total waste of my vote to vote for Trump because he has no

41
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:18.260
chance of winning Connecticut. So I would vote for Jorgensen. Uh,

42
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.580
even though I know she can't win,

43
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:23.090
I would rather at least give her a vote of support because I wouldn't be wasting

44
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:25.370
my vote because you know, it doesn't matter.

45
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:29.120
Connecticut is going to go for Biden in, in, in a big way. And so it's,

46
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:32.450
you know, voting for anybody. It doesn't really matter who you vote for.

47
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
This is one of the state like Connecticut, but as I was saying,

48
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:40.160
the problem for Trump and I was one of the few people

49
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.960
who was in the media saying that I thought Trump had a real good shot at

50
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:46.820
winning. I didn't know it was in the bag,

51
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.120
but I thought that he was more likely to win and lose. You know,

52
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.830
even though everybody thought he was a long shot.

53
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.200
And the reason that I thought that Trump could win is because Trump was telling

54
00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:00.430
the truth about how the economy was.

55
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.590
He wasn't regurgitating the lies that the Obama administration had been

56
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.300
telling, or that wall street had been telling about how we had a real recovery.

57
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.470
I knew that we had a bubble inflated by the federal reserve and that beneath

58
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.304
that bubble,

59
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.850
where you could see the stock market at record highs and these phony

60
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:22.450
unemployment numbers, I knew laid a weak economy.

61
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.920
And Trump knew that too.

62
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.690
And Trump spoke to the forgotten men and women of this bubble economy.

63
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.790
And his message really resonated about how we were a shadow of our former

64
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.550
self, that our industrial might have decayed.

65
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.720
We had all these big trade deficits that the stock market was a bubble.

66
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.550
All the numbers were fake. The real unemployment number rate wasn't 5%,

67
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:50.410
but 20%, 30%, 40%. And that he was a non-politician.

68
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.680
He was going to clean house. He was going to drain the swamp.

69
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.650
He was going to put politics aside and big,

70
00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.330
bring a businessman's perspective to Washington brain that swab

71
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.110
eliminate the national debt, right. Make America great again.

72
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.380
And that message resonated with a lot of people.

73
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:12.400
And a lot of those people were maybe afraid to be honest with the pollsters,

74
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:15.370
because they didn't want to admit that they were going to vote for this racist

75
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.340
massagist or whoever the media was portraying him.

76
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.080
So I thought he could win and, and he did, but here's the problem.

77
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.300
Now that he's been in office for three years, he didn't drain the swamp.

78
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.340
He made the swamp deeper, right? He didn't make, get rid of the deficit. I mean,

79
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:38.170
the deficit is bigger than ever even before COVID all he did was,

80
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.920
uh, you know, nurture the bubble that he inherited from,

81
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.590
from Obama and help make it get bigger.

82
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:48.640
He became a cheerleader for the stock market. He didn't care. It was a bubble.

83
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.481
All of a sudden,

84
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:53.740
all the government numbers that were fake under Obama were all of a sudden real,

85
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:57.550
like they just came down from God on a tablet on mine, Sinai.

86
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.300
And he began talking about this low unemployment and his booming economy,

87
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.110
the greatest economy in the history of the world, the greatest economy ever.

88
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.220
And none of that was true.

89
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.230
And so you have the same people who voted for Trump thinking that he would shake

90
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.830
things up,

91
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.770
thinking that he would throw her a monkey wrench in the system and make their

92
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.830
lives better. And their lives aren't better. They're worse.

93
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:21.040
People have more debt, you know, the bubble got bigger.

94
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.210
The trade deficits that Donald Trump criticized are bigger now than they were

95
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:26.410
before he was elected.

96
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.700
And obviously the deficits are much bigger even before COVID. Uh,

97
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:35.020
so I just don't see how Trump convinces those swing voters,

98
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.900
those blue collar Reagan Democrats in the rust belt,

99
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.920
who decided they had nothing to lose. And so they take a chance on Trump.

100
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.880
Why should they vote for him again? I mean, now they may take a chance on Biden,

101
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.810
even though, I mean, Beida does a represent any, any change from the status quo?

102
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:53.350
He's just more of the same. Uh, but you know, one sure.

103
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:56.230
The insider and Trump's now the insider, you know,

104
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.850
he doesn't have edge for reelection.

105
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.980
<v 0>Do you think went wrong? And why do you think Trump just made the swamp deeper?</v>

106
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.430
What do you think that he was deceptive when he was running?

107
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.820
Or do you think the influences once he got into office were greater than he

108
00:06:09.821 --> 00:06:11.890
anticipated? What do you think happened?

109
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.900
<v 1>Well, I have no idea. I mean, I mean, even Ronald Reagan, right? Ronald Reagan,</v>

110
00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:20.020
when he was elected and he was a very principled conservative, right?

111
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.260
Unlike Trump, you know, he was, he, he, he really, uh, talked, uh,

112
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.110
walk the walk, not just talk the talk.

113
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:29.920
And he was a big supporter of Barry Goldwater who didn't make it, you know, it,

114
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:32.440
when he ran against Lyndon Johnson. But when Reagan came in,

115
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.430
he really wanted to shrink government. I mean, he campaign about cut,

116
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.540
getting rid of the department of education, uh, the department of energy,

117
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.430
or I forget it, he, he really wanted to shrink government and cut spending,

118
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.840
but he was never able to do that. Right. He was able to cut taxes, uh,

119
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.370
but he wasn't able to cut spending.

120
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.520
Trump never really campaigned on cutting spending.

121
00:06:51.521 --> 00:06:54.640
He didn't wanna talk about that because he didn't want to alienate any voters.

122
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:59.170
So he just talked about cutting taxes and he did, you know,

123
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:03.640
officially cut taxes, but he actually raised taxes.

124
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.170
That is the important thing that you have to recognize is that

125
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.690
government spending is taxation.

126
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:14.080
And what happened in government spending under Trump,

127
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.860
even before it went through the moon with COVID-19 and we'll get to all the

128
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:20.140
COVID stuff. But even before then,

129
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.380
Trump signed on to all kinds of increases in government,

130
00:07:23.381 --> 00:07:27.400
spending more spending on the military, more spending welfare,

131
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.090
huge increases in government spending that those are tax hikes.

132
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.110
Now Trump cut income taxes,

133
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.330
but the income tax is just one way.

134
00:07:37.331 --> 00:07:41.200
The government pays for spending because all government spending has to be paid

135
00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:43.210
for by the public one way or another.

136
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:46.930
We don't get any government for free everything that government does cost us

137
00:07:46.931 --> 00:07:51.400
money. So every dime they spend represents taxation in some form.

138
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.300
And what they've been doing is they've been printing money, right?

139
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:57.790
The federal reserve prints money. And in fact,

140
00:07:57.791 --> 00:08:02.470
right now the federal reserve is printing about 55 cents out of

141
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:04.450
every federal dollar that's spent.

142
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:08.590
So more money is being printed and spent than collected in taxation,

143
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.210
but all that printing,

144
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.300
all that spending that is being paid for by printing pass,

145
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.660
we don't get that for free. There is a cost.

146
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.200
See when the government takes our money through an income tax,

147
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.100
they take my money that I earned and they give it to somebody else who didn't

148
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:27.340
earn it. And now that person spends the money, but because I don't have it,

149
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:30.670
I can't spend it. I can't invest it or save it. I don't have it anymore.

150
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:32.290
The government took it from me in taxes,

151
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.020
but if the government doesn't take it from me,

152
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.680
they just print money and they hand it to somebody else who didn't earn it and

153
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:42.730
didn't do any work and produce any goods or provide any services. They just,

154
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.380
you know, gotten money from the government.

155
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.880
That's still costs me because what happens is when that money is spent in a

156
00:08:48.881 --> 00:08:51.250
circulation, it bids up prices.

157
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.470
And so prices are now higher than they would have been had that new money been

158
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:56.190
printed.

159
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.120
And so now everything that I want to buy costs more than it otherwise would have

160
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.710
cost either the prices went up or it prevented prices from going down.

161
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.470
And so now my purchasing power has been diminished.

162
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:12.600
And so either the government takes your money through an income tax or a

163
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:13.740
sales tax or something,

164
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.310
or they take your purchasing power through an inflation tax.

165
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.420
And so that's what Trump decided to do to pay for government through inflation

166
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.920
rather than taxation.

167
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.390
But what we know from history is that is the most expensive way to pay for

168
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:32.010
government. And in fact, it hits hardest the middle class and the poor, right?

169
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.590
Because the rich have a lot of assets.

170
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.580
They have a lot of debt where they not consumer debt like on a credit card,

171
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:42.720
but where they borrow money to accumulate income producing property,

172
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.930
to buy companies, stocks, things like that.

173
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.810
And so inflation helps those people, right? If you,

174
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:52.740
if you have debt to buy assets, inflation, wipes out your debt.

175
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.220
But if you're just saving money and working for a living and getting a paycheck,

176
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.220
the inflation tax is very heavy on you.

177
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.690
And that inflation tax is going to get much, much higher, uh, under Biden,

178
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.080
right? For all the talk about all these big government programs.

179
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.010
And we'll talk about that, that he wants to pay for by taxing the rich,

180
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.840
the rich aren't going to pay those taxes.

181
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.500
Most of the money is going to come from the poor and the middle class through

182
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:18.840
the inflation tax. But getting back to, you know,

183
00:10:18.841 --> 00:10:20.550
where I think Trump went wrong.

184
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.900
So Trump gets into office and he had promised to make America great again.

185
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.640
And the reason that America is not great is because government is too big,

186
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.060
right? When America was great, right? We had very,

187
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:36.120
very small government government was, you know, an afterthought,

188
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:41.280
right on all levels, maybe state, federal, and local. Maybe it was 5% of GDP.

189
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.100
We didn't have an income tax corporate or personal.

190
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.650
We didn't have social security. We didn't have all, you know,

191
00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:49.860
minimum wage or any of these, any of these laws. We had a very,

192
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:54.210
very tiny government because government was tiny. The economy got very big.

193
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.900
We had all kinds of freedom. Uh, and because we were free,

194
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:01.470
we were very productive and the living standards were rising and we were

195
00:11:01.471 --> 00:11:04.860
eradicating poverty. We were making all kinds of strides. Uh,

196
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.780
the greatest economy in the history of the world was produced from the freest

197
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:12.900
people in the history of the world, which was the United States. Well,

198
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:16.290
Trump wanted to make America great. Again, the only way to do that would be to,

199
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.370
to shrink government cut government spending and free up all those resources

200
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.110
back into the private sector so that they could be used efficiently again.

201
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.790
But the problem is how do you cut government spending when every single program

202
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.720
has its own constituency, that benefits from it. And so once you,

203
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.860
once you're there,

204
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.540
you can't cut anything unless you're willing to stand up to all the politicians

205
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:42.930
and the special interest groups. And apparently Trump wasn't willing to do that.

206
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.980
I mean, Trump, when he, when he got into office became a politician,

207
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.800
or maybe he was one when he ran for office,

208
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:52.650
but he was more concerned about getting reelected,

209
00:11:52.651 --> 00:11:54.430
which is a shame because he probably won't,

210
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.470
he should have used the bully pulpit and used his office right

211
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.810
away to level with the American public,

212
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:05.800
to look them square in the eye and tell them that government is too big. And,

213
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.480
and, and spending needs to be cut,

214
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.590
including things like social security and Medicare and all these sacred cows

215
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:14.710
that nobody would gore. Trump should have been the guy to do it.

216
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:16.630
He should've said the buck stops with me.

217
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.890
I don't care if I don't have a second term and he should have vetoed all of

218
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:22.690
those bills that he signed.

219
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.380
He never should have agreed to allow the allowing the debt ceiling to go up.

220
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.390
He should have enforced that debt.

221
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:32.530
So we now have 26 and a half trillion of debt, right? When he came into office,

222
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:34.030
it was just under 20 trillion.

223
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.570
So we've already added six and a half trillion since he became president.

224
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.320
I would not have allowed the debt ceiling to go up at all, not one nickel.

225
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.020
And I would have forced the government to cut government spending.

226
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.660
And that's what Trump should have done. And, you know, but,

227
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.260
but he didn't want to do it because he was more concerned about the politics of

228
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:51.090
it. Say.

229
00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.220
<v 0>I would, are you running for president? Are you ready.</v>

230
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.500
<v 2>To do that? I was gonna say what I would have done do this.</v>

231
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.220
<v 0>Peter, are you ready to do this? I bought running.</v>

232
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.990
<v 2>But we need someone who can be the first Puerto Rican president.</v>

233
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.190
Do you ever watch the sweat hogs?

234
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.120
<v 0>Yes. Sure. Yeah. I'm on Epstein. I'm a, yeah. You can.</v>

235
00:13:12.121 --> 00:13:16.290
Joe Epstein played my brother in an episode of news radio.

236
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.220
Really? Yes. He played my older brother who was a priest to beat us up.

237
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.760
<v 1>You know, Kaplan show. That was the 19 set. But, um,</v>

238
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:27.690
I can be a Puerto Rican Jew. Yes. You know, I can't vote. Right.

239
00:13:27.691 --> 00:13:30.510
I can't vote for the president, but I can run. In fact,

240
00:13:30.511 --> 00:13:33.960
I can be the only person elected president who couldn't vote for himself.
