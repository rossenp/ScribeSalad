00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.510
Now let's talk about treatments that are being considered. Uh,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.460
we know that Z packs are one of them, uh, and Klara queen.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.900
Can you explain that?

5
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:16.950
And what went horribly wrong with the couple that took the wrong kind of

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:20.490
chloroquine and it turned out to be a coy pond cleaner.

7
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.350
<v 1>Okay. So let me, let me put, give you the framework for that.</v>

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:28.530
So it makes some sense when we talk about all the interventions,

9
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.290
you have things that are going to be ready down the line.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
Things are going to be ready, a little closer and things ready now. So,

11
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:35.571
and then,

12
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:40.140
and then we can talk about one on one and then I'll I'll I'll let me give you

13
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.810
the framework that I'll answer your clerk. One question.

14
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.640
So the highest bar there is in terms of financial investment required,

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
and time to show safety is a vaccine. So that's what, that's what we're doing.

16
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:56.700
And other groups are doing next tier down. That's going to be, you know, a year,

17
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.330
18 months away, according to Dr. Fowchee could be longer than that.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.560
Next tier down are what we call small molecule drugs,

19
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:08.580
new drugs that have never been discovered before. It still takes a while.

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.490
Maybe not as high a as vaccine in terms of time.

21
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.950
The next tier down is repurposing existing medicines that we

22
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.830
already know are relatively safe.

23
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.600
And then showing that those drugs also work against the coronavirus,

24
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:27.870
and that's going to be the chloric one category, and I'll get to your question.

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.420
And then the, the nearest ones,

26
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.750
the one that we could do now is what's called this convalescent, uh,

27
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.470
antibody therapy, uh,

28
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:39.660
which I've been pushing very hard on because I think we can actually have it

29
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.260
going net right now. So let's do the, um, uh,

30
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.180
let's do the chloroquine hydroxychloroquine. This is, uh, uh,

31
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.370
and that's one of the repurpose, the ones that's not the lowest hanging fruit,

32
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:54.750
but the next lowest hanging fruit. This is a medicine that's used for malaria.

33
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.460
It's an anti-malarial drug it's been around for decades. In fact,

34
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:03.210
the world health organization was going to have in the 1960s,

35
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:08.160
proposed an elimination strategy for malaria to treat everybody with chloroquine

36
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.280
until we had chloroquine resistance. And that derailed that,

37
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:15.390
but in some parts of the world still works as an anti-malarial drug.

38
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.100
It's also used as an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of lupus and other

39
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:24.300
autoimmune diseases. It, you can make a bucket of it. It's cheap.

40
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.700
Uh, we know the safety profile.

41
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:30.450
We know it can cause arrhythmias in some patient and other toxicities,

42
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:34.890
but it generally has a pretty good safety profile. Um,

43
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.810
we know that this drug can block the replication of the virus in the test

44
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:43.440
tube. So in habits, the virus in the, in,

45
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:47.700
in what we call it in vitro in the test tube, second, we know this drug, uh,

46
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.050
reduces inflammation.

47
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:53.400
And that's nice because one of the things you get with COVID-19 pneumonia is you

48
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.910
not only get the virus infection in the lung, you got a lot of inflammation.

49
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.940
So it checks a couple of boxes in terms of why it's attractive to look at it.

50
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:05.380
And then the Chinese did a small study and then a colleague of mine is a

51
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.980
fascinating guy. Uh, I I'm, uh,

52
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.980
I really appreciate his work as a scientist,

53
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.810
if he's a very serious scientists in Marsay and France named DDA row old.

54
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.070
And he's, I don't know,

55
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:21.610
it must've published at least two or three dozen papers in the journal that I,

56
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.020
uh, uh, found, uh, called plus neglected tropical diseases.

57
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.360
He's a serious scientist, works on all sorts of interests, cellular bacteria,

58
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.194
and that kind of thing.

59
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.970
Tick-borne diseases did a small study showing that it worked in COVID patients.

60
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.770
And what he did was he combined hydroxy chloroquine with the Z-Pak,

61
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.330
the azithromycin drug and found, found that there's an effect. The problem was,

62
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:44.860
was a very tiny study.

63
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.850
And so people put those three things together and all of a sudden said,

64
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.550
we've got the miracle cure. I,

65
00:03:51.551 --> 00:03:54.010
I'm not sure that's going to turn out to be the case. I mean,

66
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:57.580
we really need to do large studies to show that it really works.

67
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.830
And the reason I'm holding back is, uh, you know, nothing to do with, uh,

68
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.950
Dr. Professor Rowe is, you know, really important scientists,

69
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.270
but it's a small study.

70
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.800
We were there about a decade ago with influenza that this hydroxy chloroquine

71
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.820
also inhibited, uh, the influenza virus in the test tube,

72
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.750
but then it didn't pan out in Clinton, larger clinical studies.

73
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.090
So I think we have to be really careful and don't be too quick to say, okay,

74
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:28.960
this is, this is going to be at, I don't, we're not even close to that yet,

75
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.000
but we'll know in the next few weeks,

76
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.340
cause we're really working hard to scale up, uh,

77
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.120
clinical trials looking at that medicine now. Um.

78
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.610
<v 0>And in terms of vaccines.</v>

79
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.760
<v 1>But there is, uh, there is a, there is a new,</v>

80
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.870
there's something new though that we can do right now, uh, talk to you about,

81
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:48.850
so this is, uh,

82
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.440
something called convalescent antibody therapy and it was, and it was,

83
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.910
it's been known for over a hundred years. And it was really, uh,

84
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.750
scaled up during the 1918 influenza pandemic, you know,

85
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.770
where that terrible pandemic that killed hundreds, tens of millions of people.

86
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.250
It was shown that if you took individuals had,

87
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.870
who had recovered from the disease who had got infected, they survived,

88
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.310
they had antibodies in their blood. You could remove their blood in some cases,

89
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:22.240
give them back their red cells and take the plasma component and use that as a

90
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:26.920
therapy to treat patients. And, uh, and in fact,

91
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.240
during the 2003, uh, SARS epidemic,

92
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.620
the first SAR SARS one,

93
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.680
there's been a number of studies showing that it worked it actually,

94
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:39.010
you could treat patients for it, uh,

95
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.710
especially if you gave it early on in the course of the infection.

96
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.310
If you waited too long, then it didn't have nearly the same benefit,

97
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.260
but you gave it early on the course of infection.

98
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.920
It could prevent more serious infection and even death because you're actually

99
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.010
giving back antibodies. The antibodies won't last forever,

100
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:58.490
but enough to help you survive the infection. So, um,

101
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.670
a good friend and colleague who I've known for a long time,

102
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.430
our Turo Casa Deval is a brilliant, uh,

103
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.240
professor of microbiology at Johns Hopkins, you know,

104
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.440
started talking to me about, you know, Peter, maybe we should be doing this for,

105
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.870
uh, COVID 19. And, and as the numbers started going up, I said,

106
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.730
I called him. I said, look, Arturo,

107
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:24.510
I'm going on CNN tomorrow. Uh, uh, I,

108
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:28.550
I think this is an opportunity to tell people about this. So I, you know,

109
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:33.410
helped amplify, uh, what he was doing. He had written a paper, uh, with, uh,

110
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.430
with a colleague from Johns Hopkins, a at least San Peroni per profile.

111
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.660
I always get her always mangled, her name per Foskey, uh, uh, at, uh,

112
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:42.500
Albert Einstein.

113
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.910
And I talked to him about this and that really got things moving along.

114
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:50.870
So I've been trying to use my voice on, you know, being on CNN and Fox news.

115
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.270
[inaudible] not just to hear myself talk, but to actually raise specific issues,

116
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.910
to get people to care about, about certain things. And I,

117
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.260
and I used it for this purpose and I think it helped to mobilize some action in

118
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:07.610
now, uh, what our chairman and his colleagues are doing together with the FDA.

119
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.540
So there's a branch of the food and drug administration called CBRE the center

120
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:14.900
for biologics evaluation research, which is this amazing, you know,

121
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.110
you might hear a lot of bad things about the FDA.

122
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:21.410
I think the FDA is amazing myself, but CBRE is something very special.

123
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.250
All of these brilliant scientists who deal with vaccines and biologic,

124
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.670
they're on board with it. I've been talking with Peter Marks, Dr. Peter Marks,

125
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.670
who's the head of CBRE. And he's teamed up with,

126
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.190
with our Turo to get this network together,

127
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:37.670
going at least among 20 academic health centers,

128
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.380
so that they're identifying patients, who've recovered taking their blood,

129
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.820
giving them back the red cells,

130
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:47.660
collecting the plasma so that when people come in sick, uh,

131
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.750
they can give treatment and they'll have some clinical trial results.

132
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.770
I hope in the next few weeks, but I'm really optimistic about that one for,

133
00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.210
for saving lives. The other thing our terrorist talked to me about is, you know,

134
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:03.680
could you use it in smaller doses to give the antibody to healthcare workers and

135
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.970
to first responders, uh, to prevent them from getting sick? Cause you're here.

136
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.420
I mean, I don't know the percentage now of first responders, uh, in New York.

137
00:08:11.421 --> 00:08:14.980
And that's why they turned the empire state building into a siren last night.

138
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:17.600
And, and to, to honor all of the,

139
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.360
all of the first responders who've gotten sick,

140
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:23.300
we knew this was going to happen. Maybe this, this could help them.

141
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:25.460
So I think that's going to be really important as well.

142
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.710
<v 0>Now, the French government,</v>

143
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:31.220
I was reading an article this morning that they've sanctioned chloroquine as a,

144
00:08:31.221 --> 00:08:33.510
an official treatment. And, uh, they're,

145
00:08:33.511 --> 00:08:35.120
they're having some good results with that.

146
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:38.570
Are people currently using that in the United States are doctors prescribing

147
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:39.404
that.

148
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.250
<v 1>There's a lot of what's called off-label use meaning that it's not an approved</v>

149
00:08:43.251 --> 00:08:47.900
indication, but they're going ahead and use it. And, uh, you know, I just,

150
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:52.280
I think, and, and maybe it'll turn out to be a good treatment. Uh,

151
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.280
but the evidence is, is not strong. Uh,

152
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.060
the there's a study in Shanghai that suggested it didn't work.

153
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.850
So we really need well controlled trials.

154
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.810
We really need to pin down the dose because maybe it's a dosing thing.

155
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:09.660
Maybe if you give too high or too low a dose, it's not going to work,

156
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.030
how you pair it with the Zithromax.

157
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.520
So it's going to take a little bit of time to work out.

158
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:17.940
And this is the frustration that people have. You know, you're saying, my God,

159
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:19.590
we have this terrible pandemic.

160
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.850
Now we need to get these new therapies and vaccines are very quickly.

161
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.500
It's the hardest thing to do.

162
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.480
It's the hardest thing to do is to accelerate new technologies for,

163
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.770
uh, a new virus pathogen that we've never seen before,

164
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.610
while the epidemic is raging while the pandemic is raging, it's re

165
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.700
we, we we've, we don't have a lot of track record doing this. We did it, uh,

166
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.690
once, uh, with Ebola. Uh, if you remember, in 2014, there was a,

167
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.880
uh, terrible Ebola epidemic in west Africa effected 33,000 people,

168
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:58.710
11,000 people died, uh, that was in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone.

169
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:04.020
And there were some initial vaccine trials started by Merck and company. Uh,

170
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:05.250
that looked pretty promising.

171
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:09.390
They had licensed the technology from the Canadians, this group in Manitoba, uh,

172
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:12.420
public health, uh, Canada. And it looked promising,

173
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.350
but as the trials got underway, what happened was the resilience,

174
00:10:16.351 --> 00:10:19.110
your national response to put in a health system,

175
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.230
because it turns out he bowl is not very transmissible.

176
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.650
You just have to have some healthcare infrastructure make certain that you're

177
00:10:25.651 --> 00:10:29.910
not directly handling the corpse of someone who's recently

178
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.630
died from Ebola virus infection and the, uh,

179
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.740
and we even sent in the hundred first airborne division we sent in the

180
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.930
screaming Eagles, which made a big impact on helping to, uh,

181
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.970
say, you know, save west Africa from this infection. So the who came in, uh,

182
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.590
there was a UNICEF, there was, uh, doctors without borders. Lots of I'm sorry,

183
00:10:52.591 --> 00:10:55.890
I'm the Israeli army came in. Israeli defense force came in.

184
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:58.500
A lot of groups came in to help west Africa.

185
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.440
And so the vaccine never really got fully tested, but then five years later,

186
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.820
when there was the terrible epidemic, a democratic Republic of Congo,

187
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.210
that's when the vaccine really came into widespread use.

188
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:16.050
And it's probably one of the most important public health stories never told,

189
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:21.810
uh, which was under conditions of terrible conflict and war and political strife

190
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:25.980
and, uh, uh, civil, civil war. Uh,

191
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.480
they vaccinated 200,000 people with this vaccine and it largely

192
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.610
help, uh, eliminate Ebola from democratic Republic of Congo in that,

193
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.870
in that, during those hostilities last, last year, and, uh,

194
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:41.880
essentially saved, uh,

195
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.990
I think it's helped to stabilize the whole African continent. Um,

196
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.120
so it's an amazing story. And again,

197
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:52.740
it was this multilateral effort that involved also the U S government,

198
00:11:52.741 --> 00:11:56.500
the NIH and Barta and all of these organizations.

199
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.920
It's an extraordinary story. And as a result, uh,

200
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.460
we really helped stabilize, uh, uh, Sub-Saharan Africa,

201
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.540
but we'll look at the timeframe 2014 first epidemic to

202
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:10.600
2019. That's five that's five years.

203
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:15.370
That's a more realistic timeframe for a vaccine just to give people a sense of

204
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:16.330
perspective.
