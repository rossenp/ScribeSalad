00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 2>I think that's why there's so much like distrust in government and stuff now,</v>

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.240
because there's so many things that we realize later on, like,

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.880
why was that so necessary?

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.480
<v 1>Well, not only that, I mean,</v>

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.880
you're seeing it with this administration where they're,

7
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:20.280
they're doing the same things that Trump was doing.

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.870
They're just pretending they're not, they're wearing cute jackets. Well,

9
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.070
it's just the same thing. Like what they're doing.

10
00:00:26.071 --> 00:00:30.230
Like the whole thing was like the kids at the border, we gotta stop the,

11
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.590
you know, these families at the board, these detention at the border,

12
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:35.230
putting people in cages, they're doing the same thing.

13
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.830
And then Ted Cruz went down to,

14
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.270
they try to film it and they were asking to stop filming,

15
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.700
like this Biden employees, like stop filming, stop filming SAR.

16
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.820
Please should have some respect. He's like, this is like,

17
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:49.660
you can't just make rules like that. We can't film now. Yeah.

18
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.940
And that's how you're gonna stop people from talking about this.

19
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.220
That nothing's changed.

20
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.860
Cuz they were pretending that Trump was doing this and that it was all Trump's

21
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:01.260
fault. Well, no it's the border is crazy. And,

22
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.890
and now that Trump's not in office,

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.490
they think it's more friendly cuz Biden's there.

24
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.090
So more people are coming through and they have a lot of 'em have Biden.

25
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.250
T-shirts on. Have you seen that? No. Where they get detained? Yeah.

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.690
Like dozens and dozen.

27
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.730
<v 0>Like they're going to a Biden concert. Like they're going to a Biden rally.</v>

28
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.480
We love you.

29
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.250
<v 1>Exactly. Help us. You never seen it. You should see it. It's crazy.</v>

30
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.480
So they're coming to the border wall with Biden shirts on and so they've

31
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.320
resumed construction of the border wall. Yeah. Once you know that.

32
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.440
So this comp you know, this administration was like,

33
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.320
we're not gonna do what the past administration did. Yeah you are. But is this.

34
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.040
<v 0>Huge? Is it.</v>

35
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.230
<v 1>Is it's the same. Look at this. Please let us in. Yeah. Biden.</v>

36
00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:50.030
Please let us in. Look at this. What? Like who's giving him those shirts.

37
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.070
Probably the cartel. They probably all have a pound of kilos.

38
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.830
A pound of Coke in their. Weird. Right?

39
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.950
Yeah. It's just a weird and you know, what's even weirder.

40
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:04.380
I was talking to a friend of mine and he's much more knowledgeable about this.

41
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:07.380
He goes, you know, listen, man. He goes at the bottom of Mexico,

42
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.500
those other south American countries,

43
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:11.780
they're trying to get into Mexico and the Mexicans don't want 'em coming into

44
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:12.614
Mexico.

45
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.980
And then you got Mexicans that are trying to get into America and there's

46
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.300
Americans that don't want them in, in America. Like, it's like,

47
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.580
they're doing it too. Like, it goes all the,

48
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:24.050
if you go down to Honduras and Honduras and Mexico, they're like, Hey, you know,

49
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:24.884
we have enough.

50
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.850
Like there literally it's happening every step of the way up to America.

51
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.110
Yeah.

52
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.930
<v 0>That's crazy. I don't, yeah. I don't know much about that stuff.</v>

53
00:02:34.931 --> 00:02:38.690
Don't pay attention. That. Well, I just feel like it becomes too like,

54
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.490
like sided,

55
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.160
like where it's scary to talk about PA politics because it can become, so like,

56
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.920
if you say one thing that's not with, you know, some sort of like,

57
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.400
if it's not in an infographic on Instagram,

58
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.000
then it's wrong and it's all very like this way or that way.

59
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.320
So I try and stay somewhat informed, but

60
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.640
it just feels very exhausting nowadays. What do you mean by if it's.

61
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.080
<v 1>On an, an infograph?</v>

62
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.680
<v 0>What do you mean? Like I'm on very like super hyper woke Instagram, you know,</v>

63
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.320
you are a lot of, yeah. A lot of my friends post a lot of like, you know, woke,

64
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.040
which, you know, do you yell.

65
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.873
<v 1>At them for that?</v>

66
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.950
<v 0>I scroll past it. I read it's got shiny letters and a nice font. So I'm like,</v>

67
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:25.230
oh, this is pretty. But it's, it's very like extreme where it's like,

68
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:27.550
you're either all in or you're all out. And I'm.

69
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.270
<v 1>Like, I don't, it's a bunch of people trying to control people.</v>
