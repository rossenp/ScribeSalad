00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And that's the thing like MMA fans are fickle, right?</v>

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.680
They like who they like, they don't like, they, like,

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.480
it's only about three or four fighters that can get a lot of views,

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.000
but that on YouTube, on that's that it's that way with everything.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.080
That's what I'm saying. So comedy that way with, yeah.

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.120
And people are fascinated. Like, I I'm lucky enough to know a cabib right.

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.990
Or somebody like that. Like,

8
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:25.550
I didn't know who this guy was until Rashad Evans was like, yo,

9
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.470
let me introduce you to my guy, Ali.

10
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.710
And then I met Ali filming some Henzel Gracie stuff for him. Um,

11
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.470
and he was like, yo, I like you, man. Let me put you together. When my fighter,

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.950
you know, who kaibbi is. I was like,

13
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.710
is that the guy that fought Michael Johnson? I didn't know who could be,

14
00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:41.820
was he was like,

15
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.580
I think y'all would be a good fit cuz the way you do stories and stuff like

16
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:47.580
that. I think you'll, he'll like you and you'll like him.

17
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:52.300
And I literally met him of January of last year of 2018

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.820
in Boston. Um, and when Francis was fighting,

19
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:57.260
Steve payy and VOing was fighting DC.

20
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.940
And that was the first time I ever met cabib and the rest is history. I, I,

21
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.770
I filmed the him up there. He was Finn fight Tony. Um,

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.010
then I film him during the whole Connor fiasco LaQuinta then I went to

23
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.970
dstan. I went to dstan what's that like intense, but it was it like,

24
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:17.650
it was beautiful because people tried to scare me when I was supposed to go to

25
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.760
dstan who, like I got people in the UFC that was like, yo, careful over there.

26
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:24.880
I'm thinking like people that work for the UFC. Yeah. Just stand,

27
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:29.320
like be careful. Like, and I'm thinking to myself, like my DMS on Instagram,

28
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.880
like bro, just be careful. They don't play over there. I was going,

29
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.720
I went doing Ramadan last June. Wow. At the end of Ramadan. And uh,

30
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.360
did you have to observe while you were there? So, uh,

31
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.670
Kabi wanted me to come during like the last tail end of Ramadan. Right.

32
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.190
So I went over there, um, by myself,

33
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.590
went and got my visa in Miami and went over there, just got my ticket. And um,

34
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.950
I went over there. I remember the first day I got there.

35
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.350
I was in like customs for like two hours cuz they couldn't speak English at this

36
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.130
little airport in,

37
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.980
in dstan &lt;affirmative&gt; and cabbe was outside &lt;laugh&gt; and he wasn't coming to the

38
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.580
airport cuz he too famous. Right. And this is in the middle of the night.

39
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.780
And I remember when I first got there, uh,

40
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.180
it was just checkpoint everywhere when I got there,

41
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.540
like we like drive down the street person with some guns. I'm like, all right,

42
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:22.060
cool. I don't know where we at, but this is dggingstan and um,

43
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.330
I ended up into this, this, I stayed at this uncle house, I think.

44
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:28.570
And from there it was, it was just a beautiful moment.

45
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.850
The dggystan Chronicles is my most popular thing on my channel, obviously,

46
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.850
cuz it's showing cabib in the way. No one's ever seen them. Um,

47
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.970
I observed Robin down the whole time I was there. I didn't eat, I didn't drink.

48
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.050
I did exactly what cabibum did because I think a,

49
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.930
a problem with us a lot as Americans,

50
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.080
as we take our culture somewhere else and I wanted to observe day culture and

51
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:48.600
really see what it was like. And I was fascinated.

52
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.640
I wanted to know why women covered themselves. And I asked all those questions,

53
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.280
all of that stuff is in the documentary.

54
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.680
And now when I get all these millions of people watching these videos,

55
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.880
the most common thing is like, where's the women at? And I'm like,

56
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.520
why are these people so obsessed with where the women at? And,

57
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.480
and I literally went into that. Like I asked, like when you,

58
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:09.320
when these women are married, you don't point a camera at these people.

59
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.200
You like, I've seen women, you just don't point a camera at 'em it's rude.

60
00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:17.280
Right. And that's like in their culture and their culture, did they explain.

61
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.070
<v 1>This to you? Yeah they did. And they, how.</v>

62
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.070
<v 0>What did they say? They literally just said, they look at they,</v>

63
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.310
like I talked to a couple of 'em a couple people over there and they were just

64
00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:30.230
like, we look at our women as women, as Queens and we cover 'em because in, in,

65
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.150
in the, in the Quran is, you know, the man is weak to the flesh.

66
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.630
So they don't want their woman to be, you know,

67
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.020
look at by other men things. Yeah. That's the word I was looking for.

68
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.420
So you just covered themselves up. Um, and in our culture that's, you know,

69
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:51.540
that may be weird, but I respect it. Like what they told me, it made sense.

70
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.900
It literally made sense where it was just like, listen,

71
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.380
we don't let another man look at our wife. Right.

72
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.290
I'm not gonna bash on that culture because I like that's silly.

73
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.490
A woman can do whatever they wanna do. That's just how they feel like I don't,

74
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.810
you know, so, but I seen women,

75
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.490
I seen some beautiful women too while I was in dstan.

76
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.730
So it wasn't the fact that I didn't film any women. I seen women. But.

77
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.610
<v 1>They explained to you when you go here, you cannot film.</v>

78
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.130
<v 0>The women. No, no, no. It was just, yeah. In a way,</v>

79
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.000
like just don't film another man's woman.

80
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.520
Like I think I talked to Chris Wyman once, uh, when I was at,

81
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.840
at his gym when I was doing allyqueta he, he went tochenia. Yeah.

82
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.720
And uh, he told me a story.

83
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.800
I think him and vodue went to cheshnia and he was telling me a story of like,

84
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.880
he accidentally touched the woman's hand and uh,

85
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.830
they like literally got on, like, you don't touch another woman.

86
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.430
You don't touch a woman's hand over here cuz that's bad on her. Right. Right.

87
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:48.750
And I was like, that's crazy.

88
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.150
You can't even cuz he said he was just like reaching out shaking peoples hands

89
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.590
and you know, human instinct, you reach and grab somebody's hand.

90
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.230
And he just said, man, that that's different culture over there.

91
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.740
You can't a woman can't touch another man hand. So yeah, that.

92
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.180
<v 1>Guy from chetchna the, the leader of chestan he's like really into mm MMA.</v>

93
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.500
Right. He flies as much people out.

94
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.300
<v 0>Yeah. You know what's crazy is that I don't know anything about the guy or his</v>

95
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.300
politics or anything, but I know that he obsessed with fighting. Right.

96
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.930
I know toong been over there and yeah. Why man? And all these guys I just met,

97
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.610
uh, Nick detu the other day mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they went,

98
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.370
they went over there to Chenia him and the Mendez brothers. Uh,

99
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.530
that jujitsu. Yeah. They had, I think the Mendez brothers had like a,

100
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.250
a seminar or something seminar. I,

101
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.170
I did like a preview of cheetove and he was talking about it in there.

102
00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:44.080
Like they did a jujitsu match in front of some Ola, Gar or over there,

103
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:47.880
like it's crazy. Right? Like they flew him over there for that. Yeah. Well he's.

104
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.710
<v 1>Got a lot of money.</v>

105
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.560
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, Hey. I'm not even fighting. These sponsors didn't.</v>

106
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.480
<v 1>Need to give cabib like some crazy Mercedes when he won.</v>

107
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 0>I think I saw that Instagram. He got like a gift.</v>

108
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.360
I think he gave him some crazy S class Kabi getting that Dubai money.

109
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.600
Now though he always in Dubai. He, I mean, since his fight, he been in Dubai.

110
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:09.360
How many times what's he doing over there? Speaking things like that. I mean,

111
00:06:09.361 --> 00:06:09.641
when you,

112
00:06:09.641 --> 00:06:13.280
one of the most fam I think he's like top 15 and the most famous athletes now.

113
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:14.040
Well.

114
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.470
<v 1>For sure. And definitely the most famous Muslim math. Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.950
<v 0>Yeah. So I mean he.</v>

116
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.110
<v 1>And the only UFC champion that's undefeated, other than John Jones,</v>

117
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.670
who should be undefeated. If not for that one, listen, up.

118
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.440
<v 0>Disqualification.</v>

119
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.830
After spending time with cabib and daggystan like meeting his father,

120
00:06:29.831 --> 00:06:32.710
going into the mountains and things like, I just don't see nobody beating him.

121
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.630
I'm sorry, what you throw at him? You know, way.

122
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.180
I just feel like just his pedigre of where he from. It's nothing.

123
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:42.540
That's gonna break that guy. It's not you can't what are you gonna do?

124
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.380
I just don't think it's nothing you can do after going to dagstan and seeing how

125
00:06:46.381 --> 00:06:49.580
those people live and how they, their, their code and their,

126
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.540
their values and how they live. What.

127
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.340
<v 1>Way? What, what was so convincing? Well, just.</v>

128
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.970
<v 0>How STR the faith is over there. Right?</v>

129
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.650
And they tie in everything they do to their faith.

130
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.370
It's sort of like how Ali was like,

131
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.650
I'm not gonna lose because of ally and things like that.

132
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.050
And I truly believe after seeing like just the camaraderie over there,

133
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.450
the gyms, they train in the mountains, everything that makes this guy,

134
00:07:15.451 --> 00:07:20.160
it's nothing in a octagon that someone is gonna do. Like there's gonna beat.

135
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:22.440
Couldbe like, everything can happen. A flukete can happen.

136
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.440
We see it all the time.

137
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.920
But I just feel like mentally there's nothing that's gonna break. Couldbe like,

138
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:31.640
if I feel like if, if he was ever in a situation where he had to tap,

139
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.880
he wouldn't like you would, he would just have to put him to sleep.

140
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.360
Cuz I just don't think that's possible. Like to beat him. I,

141
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.830
I honestly feel like Kabi can't lose. I just don't see nobody beating him.

142
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.550
I just I've been in locker rooms with fighters and you got a butterfly feeling

143
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.230
and things like that. Like when he fought Connor and I was in a locker room

144
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.070
Kaib was facet, timing, his people and Don laughing and Javier Mendez,

145
00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:59.460
just like let's get focused. Let's get focused. Let's focus.

146
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.500
Cabibv is not caring. Wow. Cabib just ready to go. Right. When, uh,

147
00:08:04.501 --> 00:08:09.380
Tony Ferguson was fighting petest he like hit MI with Javier and cabbe just

148
00:08:09.381 --> 00:08:12.940
looking up the screen. &lt;laugh&gt; Javier was like, let's get focused.

149
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.780
Let get focus. KIB don't care, man. This' is a different level. He all said,

150
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:18.540
that's like his favorite thing. This is a different level.

151
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.250
That's what I about him, man. It's like, people are obsessed with the fighter.

152
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.650
I like aibva as a person.

153
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.250
And that's the thing that I get outta this anatomy of a fighter is like just

154
00:08:29.251 --> 00:08:31.170
hanging out with this guy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

155
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.850
if you ever watch my series, I never really talk about a guy's fight coming up.

156
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.330
Like if you ever watch anatomy fighter, it's not about your opponent.

157
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.640
It's just about your life F because I felt like when I created it,

158
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.640
I felt like these organizations wasn't promoting fighters all the way and

159
00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:50.800
not, yeah. They gonna promote the top fighters and things like that.

160
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:55.080
But what about the guys that are two and one in the UFC not ranked,

161
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.960
like they in the UFC, like they may get cut after a couple fights.

162
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.560
Like what do they have left after that? And I was just like,

163
00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:06.680
let me create this series instead of a documentary and just continue to build

164
00:09:06.681 --> 00:09:09.760
this and follow these guys' lives. And that's all I really wanted to do.

165
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.120
It was no hidden incentive where I was like,

166
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.640
I'm gonna make millions of dollars off this.

167
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.510
I'm gonna end on a Joe Rogan podcast. It was like,

168
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:20.230
I love following these fighters and telling they stories because it's sorta of

169
00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:22.990
like similar to my journey. You know, these guys are,

170
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.110
what was the guy that just fought, um, Deron Wyn in Greenville,

171
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.950
Eric spicy or spice or whatever his name was mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he tweeted

172
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:35.220
like, oh, I had, he just got, they got fired tonight. Right? He was like,

173
00:09:35.221 --> 00:09:40.100
I had two minus, two 70 in my bank account. Yeah. I I've been there,

174
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.700
Joe. So that's why I I'd get the passion out of doing it.

175
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.300
Cuz I've been there with these fighters. I've at this point in my life,

176
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.660
I've paid for fighters, flights and hotels because they couldn't get a hotel.

177
00:09:50.661 --> 00:09:54.220
Like these fighters know that some of these fighters know that to where I'm able

178
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.130
to help them. And I fun this all on my own, breaking myself. So I'm, to me,

179
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.090
I'm just thinking on myself, like you doing this for a specific reason,

180
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.410
you passionate about it and you want to tell these guys lives.

181
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.610
And I just run really wanted to offer another glimpse into fighters lives other

182
00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:10.444
than fight week.

183
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.690
If you flew to Phoenix for three days to

184
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:21.200
do comedy, um, and get a hotel and you, you know how expensive flight,

185
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.360
like, so imagine me finding this on my own.

186
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:25.080
If I want to go somewhere for three days. Well.

187
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.280
<v 1>Especially dstan yeah, like that. And where are you staying?</v>

188
00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:29.120
When you're in dsstan.

189
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.360
<v 0>I was staying with, uh, stayed at cabib's family house. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

190
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.520
So I stayed, uh,

191
00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:37.710
they put me like above a store and he told me,

192
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.030
he gave me a key. He was like, brother, lock this door at night,

193
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:45.270

217
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.200
Yeah. Okay, cool. So, um,

218
00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:54.520
so it's you're you're it is a city,

219
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.560
but it's essentially like nest in the.

220
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.560
<v 0>Mountains'. Yeah. It's big. The.</v>

221
00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.640
<v 1>Mountains are like right next to it or something. Yep. Like.</v>

222
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.960
<v 0>Sort of like Denver. Well, when we went to his mountain village,</v>

223
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.080
we had to drive like two hours to get there. Oh really? Yeah.

224
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.120
Like we had to go on the border as a Chasney. I had to get another visa. Oh wow.

225
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:13.070
Like just to get through that checkpoint, I never be to get like,

226
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:14.950
we got to the checkpoint and they, like,

227
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.870
we had to all give him our stuff and then cabbi uh,

228
00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:20.550
cabib was like get out &lt;laugh&gt; and the dude was like,

229
00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.550
get out the army guy with his gun and then I get out and I come

230
00:12:25.551 --> 00:12:28.550
around the car and cabib was like, get your camera brother. Right.

231
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.590
And then he was like, they want to take a picture with you with the camera.

232
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.180
I was like, thank God. What the hell y'all about to do? Yeah. It's kind,

233
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.140
I caught like a bad case of diarrhea while I was over there. Cause I eaten them.

234
00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:43.540
But meat, I was trying to do keto while I was over there. &lt;laugh&gt; and listen,

235
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.700
the toilets are just a hole in the ground. Do you have the squat? Yeah.

236
00:12:47.701 --> 00:12:49.700
You got the squat and pull the string or whatever. Oh geez.

237
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.340
So I remember like we was driving from his village at,

238
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.610
that was like my last night there and I CA like,

239
00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:01.530
I was always destroyed &lt;laugh&gt; I was like, and we got two hours and oh no.

240
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.970
We like stopped a couple times to eat and pray and all that stuff. Like,

241
00:13:04.971 --> 00:13:05.804
you know, I,

242
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.530
and I remember like I was suffering and cabib like filming me with his phone,

243
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.050
laughing, look at his brother, look at his brother.

244
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.450
He's about this hisself &lt;laugh&gt;.

245
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.600
And I remember getting back to the place where I was standing in dggingstan oh

246
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.640
my God. I probably lost like eight pounds. &lt;laugh&gt; it was crazy, man.

247
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:22.960
It was a crazy experience, man.

248
00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.880
It was a crazy experience in dggingstan that's life changing.

249
00:13:25.881 --> 00:13:30.360
It changed my life. How long were you there for nine days.

250
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.470
Wow. It changed my life. Really? Yeah, because when you,

251
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.710
in this type of industry, everybody materialistic, we all want nice things.

252
00:13:38.711 --> 00:13:42.230
We wanna live in nice places. Wanna drive nice cars. I do.

253
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.070
Most people do wanna live nice and comfortable.

254
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.470
And I saw just how happy these people was just living their lives.

255
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.990
Like I went to his village,

256
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:54.190
I went to his mountain village and I was in this city and I saw these people

257
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.860
were just happy and maybe on,

258
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.420
on the outside they was happy and maybe they was dealing with other things that

259
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:05.940
we don't know about, but I saw familyliness brotherhood.

260
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.340
And I, I, I had a little bit of respect for their culture,

261
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.060
like obviously with Islam and things like that.

262
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.410
It's so many different sex that makes it bad. Just like with Chris tianity and,

263
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.770
and people in the Catholic community and the, the priest and everything. Sure.

264
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.370
And that's my experience with the Islamic community being around cabib so that's

265
00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:26.690
the only thing I can go off of.

266
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:30.250
And obviously everybody seen Muhammad Ali and he praises and things like that.

267
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.970
But, um, I had a newfound respect, uh,

268
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.080
for just the simpleness of, of that.

269
00:14:37.081 --> 00:14:40.960
Like Kaib I thought honestly Kaib was gonna retire after he fought Connor.

270
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:46.160
Cuz I talked to him a little bit about that and cuz he don't want

271
00:14:46.161 --> 00:14:48.920
much, what did he say after the Connor fight? No, no.

272
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.360
Before the kind of fight before he was, he was just like,

273
00:14:51.361 --> 00:14:54.320
what do you think about, uh, me retiring after the counter fight?

274
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.840
And I was like, man, you do what you wanna do. I can't tell you. He was like,

275
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.000
I mean, I'm gonna have money. What else do I need to do? Right.

276
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.360
Because he obviously knew that was gonna be the biggest, the biggest fight ever.

277
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.240
So at the, how much did he make for that fight? I don't know.

278
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.870
Well remember they took his check. Right.

279
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.390
But obviously he got a lot of money for that. Yeah. They,

280
00:15:13.391 --> 00:15:17.630
they gave him a con con I think Connor had $4 million check. Yeah.

281
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.150
And then cabib had a $2 million check and then obviously they had the pay view

282
00:15:21.151 --> 00:15:24.390
points. Right. So I was like, where am my money at?

283
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:28.310
I promoted the thing &lt;laugh&gt; you should have definitely unpaid for that video.

284
00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:32.940
Listen, you know, what's funny is that uh, uh, somebody asked me along.

285
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.700
It was like, if, if you got anything out of this whole thing,

286
00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.060
what would you want? I'd be like a camera.

287
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.300
Let's get a new camera so I could shoot some movies or something. Right.

288
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.940
That's literally the low expectations I had out of making the series mm-hmm

289
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.340
&lt;affirmative&gt; right. Especially when it was a documentary, I was just like, man,

290
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:53.250
maybe I make this documentary put in on Netflix design for free about fighters.

291
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.970
And now looking back on it, the stuff that I have captured on them, hard drives.

292
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.130
I can sell a documentary for millions of dollars.

293
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:03.410
I think I got amazing footage. I got,

294
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.170
I got the whole Connor thing that I got like that,

295
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.970
that tape is like 20 minutes nobody's ever seen it. I have it. No.

296
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.560
Oh, one's really seen the whole thing.

297
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.280
Like I got Connor when he first ran down the tunnel,

298
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.960
like cuz I seen him from a distance.
