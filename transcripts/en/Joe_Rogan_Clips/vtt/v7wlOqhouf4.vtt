00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.543
<v 1>Experience.</v>

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.570
We also know how to measure placebo and we don't know how the that works.

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.460
We know that hypnosis people can have open heart surgery under hypnosis or have

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:15.870
limbs amputated or all sorts of amazing things with no anesthesia whatsoever

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
because I've really been done. Oh yeah, yeah.

7
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.080
<v 2>Yeah. Have you ever been.</v>

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.130
<v 1>Hypnotized? Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.050
but I don't have high hypnotic ability that differs. Uh,

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.070
it's another thing that differs among people and Stanley actually has a really

11
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:33.090
interesting theory, uh, along those lines, which is that in, uh,

12
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.710
prehistoric populations, hypnotic ability would be, um,

13
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.750
uh, adaptive because a lot of the healing rituals

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.400
were keying into placebo response. Uh,

15
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.360
so if we have a certain ritual, if you're susceptible to, you know,

16
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.450
you believe in that like voodoo, uh, there's uh, you know,

17
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:58.680
voodoo death people die when they're a spell is cast or curse because they

18
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:01.980
believe it. If you don't believe it, it doesn't happen. So it happens, uh,

19
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.770
the opposite direction as well with healing. So his,

20
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:08.850
his idea is that that would have been a very adaptive, um,

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.070
characteristic in prehistoric societies. Whereas in contemporary societies,

22
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:17.790
it's maladaptive because you're more susceptible to advertising.

23
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:22.560
You're easier to manipulate. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. So I, uh,

24
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.590
yeah, I've, I've uh, when I was in grad school,

25
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.300
I had some professors who worked with hypnosis and I studied it a bit,

26
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.800
uh, along the same,

27
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.950
around the same time I was looking at multiple personality disorder.

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.490
Cause I was real interested in this question of how the brain and the body

29
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:41.130
interact. How much of, you know,

30
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:45.060
there's all this research showing that people with the same, um,

31
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.980
condition in hospitals exactly the same age, same prognosis and all that.

32
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.220
They heal significantly faster.

33
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:56.100
If their hospital window looks out on trees,

34
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:59.850
as opposed to looks out at another building, something like that,

35
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
just looking at something like nature, keys,

36
00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:08.130
the body into some sort of energy that, that helps it to heal.

37
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.520
<v 2>Totally makes sense. I've met people with multiple personalities. Well,</v>

38
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:16.140
Roseanne, Roseanne's got Mo doesn't she go? Make sure that's true. Um,

39
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.770
I know another one. That's a weird one is the football player. Herschel Walker.

40
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:23.340
I think he had trauma induced, multiple personality disorders. Wow.

41
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.660
<v 0>There's an article that says like bill, bill Maher reminds us. She does.</v>

42
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.170
And then Roseanne says she doesn't. So yeah, I think,

43
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.950
and then the sheet 2001 says seven, having seven personalities.

44
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.960
Just tough her saying it. So yeah.

45
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.000
<v 2>Well here's the thing about Roseanne? I mean, I'm saying this for the 10th time.</v>

46
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:46.230
I guess she was hit by a car when she was 15 and she was put in a mental

47
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:48.690
Institute for nine months afterwards.

48
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.400
She had severe brain damage and she lost her ability to do mathematics and like

49
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.600
really scrambled her brain.

50
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.160
And that is probably the birth of the Roseanne that we know the comedian.

51
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.820
And, um, that's also the case at Sam Kinison, Sam Kennison was also a,

52
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.270
like a pretty normal kid. And then he was hit by a car and, you know,

53
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.090
pretty severe brain damage as well. And, um,

54
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.440
brain damage for w especially, um,

55
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.510
apparently it especially has an impact on,

56
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.100
um, your ability to be rational and impulsive behavior.

57
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.490
Like people with brain damage. A lot of times get very impulsive.

58
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.950
It's very so widely, you know, it's, uh, what,

59
00:03:30.951 --> 00:03:34.210
what happens to you dependent upon like what kind of trauma,

60
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:37.740
where the trauma is and what part of your brain, but, um, when,

61
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:39.820
when they said it about Herschel Walker, I was always confused.

62
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:44.230
I wonder if it was football, like football trauma or was it personal trauma?

63
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.730
Like, you know, abuse.

64
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.470
<v 1>Yeah. People with let her diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.</v>

65
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:54.970
If I remember correctly, almost always we're severely abused as kids,

66
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.790
you know? And in fact, the, the rationale is that they develop the,

67
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.280
uh, alternate personalities as a way of escaping a reality that's intolerable.

68
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.170
Thanks.

69
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.380
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, people do weird things with horrible memories.</v>

70
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.101
You know,

71
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.250
they bury them to the point where they don't even really have access to them

72
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:19.540
anymore. Sexual abuse, some, some traumatic events when you're young,

73
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.030
but the human brain, then the way it adapts and moles to things is so bizarre.

74
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.100
<v 1>Yeah. There's a, there's an anecdote that is in this book, civilized to death.</v>

75
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.330
Notice that segue. Good segue to thing. Um, yeah.

76
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.310
It's uh, by the way that the art is done by a guy listens to my podcast,

77
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.530
it's really, it looks like.

78
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.910
<v 2>But the art by a guy, Uh, cheeseburger,</v>

79
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.070
a Chimp where a cheeseburger with a nice suit.

80
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.050
<v 1>Yeah. It has got an iPhone. Um, uh, oh yeah, the story.</v>

81
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:58.000
So there's a species of grasshopper in

82
00:04:58.001 --> 00:05:02.020
north Africa that, uh, you know,

83
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.290
they hang out they're grasshoppers, they're dispersed, they eat grass.

84
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.830
They're chill, right? Rains come the grasslands,

85
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:11.500
expand grasshopper population increases.

86
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.570
Then the rain stop the grasslands contract to the point where the PA the

87
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:21.160
density of the grasshoppers triggers a

88
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.340
dormant gene. So there's an epigenetic, uh,

89
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.200
event in these grasshoppers and they start to transform and not over

90
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:33.730
generations, individuals, front legs get shorter back legs, get longer.

91
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.090
Thorax changes, shape of the head changes, coloring changes,

92
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.630
and behavior changes from being these chilled out, solitary, relaxed grass,

93
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.990
grasshoppers. They start attacking each other.

94
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:48.820
They become cannibalistic and they swarm locus locus.

95
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.100
Exactly. They become locus.

96
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.870
So this species of grasshopper and locus is the same species.

97
00:05:55.871 --> 00:06:00.470
It's the same DNA. It's just responding to different conditions. So,

98
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.310
you know,

99
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.460
we were talking about the brain and you know who you are and what identity is

100
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:08.540
and all that. And this, I was reminded of this when you said, uh, you know,

101
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:11.330
people are so different and the H2O thing,

102
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.660
we're not only different as individuals in the same context,

103
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.140
we change completely given the context we're in.

104
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.790
So the focus of his book is a hunter gatherers were essentially a different sort

105
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.610
of animal. They were essentially, you know, uh,

106
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.580
the parallel is with the grasshoppers and now we're swarming.

107
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.240
Now we're a different kind of animal, even though our DNA's the same.

108
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.010
<v 2>Well, that completely makes sense to me.</v>

109
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.160
People that live in small towns are so different than people that live in

110
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:37.994
cities. Yeah.

111
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.270
It's so rare that you find someone who has a small town sensibility in

112
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.890
Manhattan. Yeah. They get.

113
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:43.920
<v 1>Chewed up. Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.550
<v 2>Literally. Yeah, literally. Yeah. It's um, that's the, the, the,</v>

115
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:50.780
the locus thing's amazing.

116
00:06:50.781 --> 00:06:55.250
Have you ever written or read Reddit rather the accounts of, um, the settlers,

117
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.570
uh, in the, you know, the pioneer days making their way across the country and,

118
00:06:59.690 --> 00:06:59.720
uh,

119
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.530
dealing with these swarms of locusts and really not having any idea what to do

120
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:05.840
with them and how to handle it. Yeah. Yeah. You.

121
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.320
<v 1>Can give Americans AIDEM. Yeah.</v>

122
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:09.680
<v 2>That's probably a real good move. Right.</v>

123
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.800
That's one of the things that people think is, uh, probably, uh,

124
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.810
an excellent solution to, uh, some of the issues that people have with meat.

125
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.170
Cause a lot of people don't have any problem killing bugs,

126
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.630
but they wouldn't want to kill a lamb. Right. You know,

127
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:25.700
but you can have cricket protein. It's.

128
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.250
<v 1>We call it micro agriculture. Yeah.</v>

129
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.090
<v 2>Yeah. Cricket protein is apparently like very healthy. I've eaten crickets.</v>

130
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.983
<v 1>Yeah. I have two.</v>

131
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.853
<v 2>In Thailand.</v>

132
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.880
<v 1>I've had them in Mexico.</v>

133
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.080
<v 2>Oh yeah. Mexico they've they had them fried and we were staying at a resort in,</v>

134
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.490
uh, um, where was it? Um,

135
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.380
Punta Mita. Yeah. I think it was down there, uh, Puerto Vallarta. And, um,

136
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.070
they had a bowl in the resort, like when we walked into the hotel room, like,

137
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.540
oh yeah. They had like slice mangoes, and then they had crickets.

138
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.400
And I was like, all right, I'll try that. I hosted.

139
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.420
<v 1>There's a restaurant here in LA that I was at just a couple of weeks ago.</v>

140
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:06.260
That has all sorts of crickets and grasshoppers. What's it called? Uh,

141
00:08:06.261 --> 00:08:10.760
it's a Mexican place. They specialize in Molay uh,

142
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.960
I don't remember what it's called.

143
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.270
<v 2>It's really good. Is it a weird that, like,</v>

144
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.080
there's a lot of great Mexican food in LA, but it's like, you know,

145
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.230
like your basic burrito, joints and taco.

146
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.730
It's not like gourmet Mexican food. It's very few gourmet Mexican places.

147
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:26.564
Places.

148
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.890
<v 1>Yeah. That's it. That's right. Couldn't remember the name. Jane.</v>

149
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:33.200
[inaudible].

150
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.410
<v 2>The topic. Is that say, have you been there? No, I just I've known the word.</v>

151
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.360
It's like a, I don't know if it means party,

152
00:08:38.361 --> 00:08:41.670
but it's a celebration down [inaudible] yeah.

153
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.670
Serving up insects.

154
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.990
<v 1>Yeah. Check it out. It's a good place. I really, the Malays fantastic.</v>

155
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:53.360
<v 2>Part of LA on lunch Olympic. Okay. Deep in the heart of Texas. Yeah.</v>

156
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.250
Bam. Beautiful. Yeah.

157
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.330
<v 1>I love Mola and let's face it. Shrimp lobster. That's just bugs.</v>

158
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.433
Those are just big Seba.

159
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:01.891
<v 2>Well,</v>

160
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:05.520
we found that out on fear factor was people that are allergic to shellfish are

161
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.000
also allergic to roaches. Yeah. We found that out. The hard way.

162
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.500
Little lawsuit. No, no. The dude, uh,

163
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.380
was allergic to shellfish and he had to eat roaches for this thing.

164
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.020
And you know, they wound up having to give him an adrenaline shot.

165
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:21.810
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

166
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:26.370
<v 2>He was a season up a little bit. Your windpipe starts constricting. Yeah.</v>

167
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.170
<v 1>I'm not allergic to anything as far as I know. I'm very happy. Yeah.</v>

168
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.230
<v 2>Me too. Yeah. That's a bummer man. Allergies are above,</v>

169
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.340
especially fricking peanuts.

170
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:39.690
I've I've heard peanut allergies are so bad that people will ask you to not eat

171
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:42.720
peanuts on a plane with someone who has a peanut allergy.

172
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.200
Like some people's peanut allergy is so severe.

173
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.300
Even like the dust of you chewing peanuts on a plane

174
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.800
next to them, you get them sick.

175
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:58.110
<v 1>And, and it's interesting to think about the state of consciousness and how that</v>

176
00:09:58.111 --> 00:10:01.800
affects allergies, because apparently, and again,

177
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.560
I'm always cautious about saying on the show shows.

178
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:05.730
There's so many people listening.

179
00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:08.760
So caveats been a long time since I read the research.

180
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.510
But if I remember correctly, uh, under hypnosis,

181
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:17.340
a lot of people with allergies no longer. In fact, I remember the research.

182
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:18.893
Yeah. There was a,

183
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.160
it was a setup where the person could see.

184
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.450
So like you and I are talking across the table and there's a mirror behind me

185
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.670
and in the mirror, in your peripheral vision, you see, uh,

186
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.210
roses and you're allergic to roses.

187
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:41.370
You'll have a reaction even though they're plastic roses. Oh.

188
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.880
So it sort of enters the consciousness and triggers the response

189
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.680
subconsciously. Yeah. If I think that's how it was.

190
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.420
And then with people under hypnosis, like, uh, Andrew Weil wrote about this, uh,

191
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.900
cat allergies and he was tripping and he was on MDM, I think.

192
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:00.960
And he was playing with a cat and had no reaction to it. Wow.

193
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.000
<v 2>Are you this self hypnosis? Squelches allergies, pictures.</v>

194
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.980
<v 1>Jamie and my life too.</v>

195
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:12.990
<v 2>Picturing ski slopes reduces hayfever symptoms by a third. Look at that.</v>

196
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.970
Picturing ski slopes. How weird, what a wheel? Oh, I'm skiing.

197
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:19.350
Uh.

198
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.440
<v 1>Well, because you're picturing a place where there's no pollen. Right?</v>

199
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.110
You could probably picture the surface of Mars too.

200
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.000
<v 2>You've ever got a needle, you know,</v>

201
00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:30.510
like you got a shot in the doctor's about to give you the shot and you start

202
00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:33.800
like tensing up. Like, you feel this, like the anticipation,

203
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.671
it makes it like your,

204
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:37.800
your heart starts quickening and you get like really weirded out by it.

205
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.530
But then you get the shot and like, oh, that wasn't. Like,

206
00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:44.850
why was I freaking out like that? But it's this the psychosomatic aspect of it,

207
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:45.680
I think.

208
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.020
<v 1>And that's what life is basically not share in a nutshell,</v>

209
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.720
like we're always worried about things.

210
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.780
We spent so much time worrying about things. Most of which never occur. Yeah.

211
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.980
You know, and even the ones that do occur, it's like, wow, whatever, like death,

212
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.250
you know, what is, I'm not worried about death dying.

213
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:07.910
Maybe if it takes too long. But if it's, if it takes like an hour,

214
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.990
a day to die, that's a tiny fraction of your life who gives a.
