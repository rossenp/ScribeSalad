00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Last time you were here,</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.370
you would neither the interim nor the undisputed. Now you got it.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.830
All of the double, interim champ. You got it. Why? Why say,

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.500
w you're saying that double, interim, interim.

5
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.363
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.970
<v 0>Cause Whitaker's the champ. You knocked them out. You're the champ.</v>

7
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.790
<v 1>Because when I was there, you know, I, even my last fight,</v>

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.930
I feel like it's my first title defense, to be honest.

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.660
Cause I was waiting for something to change.

10
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.110
I was waiting for that feeling that I had in Atlanta will never came.

11
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.660
And within three days I was like, I felt like I just defended the belt.

12
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.840
Cause technically I was the champion as well. I was the champion.

13
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.260
He had beat me here to go. One of those Ruby's you put on this.

14
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.170
So I'm looking for my Ruby as well. I get a Ruby. Yeah.

15
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.570
That's the thing you don't get. You know, I used to get a new belt. Yeah.

16
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.800
He don't get a new build anymore. So what they do is they, you send this off.

17
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.760
This isn't actually my one, my one I've sent it off. This isn't yours.

18
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.773
<v 0>Yeah. But.</v>

19
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.860
<v 1>I sent you take this plaque off this plaque on the side and then you send it</v>

20
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:57.570
off. Then they put a Ruby and send it back to you.

21
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.370
Then you put a Ruby in the plaque. Yeah.

22
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.880
So you collect like the infinity stones or whatever. And it's like.

23
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.640
<v 0>Oh yeah. Oh yeah, dude. I used to not like this belt now. I like it better.</v>

24
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.000
<v 1>Yeah. It took me like maybe two days after everyone complained about it,</v>

25
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.880
then I looked at it and I, when I first saw it, I think it was at the PI.

26
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.980
And I was like, you know what I with it.

27
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.820
<v 0>I have for a while I was like, ah, the old one was better now. I'm like,</v>

28
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.690
I don't think so anymore. I like this. [inaudible] yeah. It gets you every time.

29
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.090
This one's cleaner. Yeah. It's just like sharp.

30
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.420
<v 1>More legible. The old one. It was cool. And I still liked it.</v>

31
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:33.570
I could buy one on the website hopefully. Yeah.

32
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.860
But you just like nostalgic purposes and just cause you know, I've been a fan.

33
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.440
I should have got one of those. I came at the, the end of it.

34
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.030
<v 0>Colby is still walking around with one.</v>

35
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.310
<v 1>Man. Don't get attached to these things, man.</v>

36
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.660
I only T I flex with them for a little bit, you know? Cause it's I, even my, um,

37
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.770
my last, after, after Atlanta, my coach, he was kind of worried.

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.640
Cause I was going to Nigeria. I was going to all these shows.

39
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:57.960
I got to like show it off, flex it, but he's my coach. So Eugene's like, man,

40
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.440
you know, don't think you're the champion. But I'm like, yeah, I'm the champion.

41
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.440
But then there was a point when we moved gyms and I just kinda alright,

42
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:07.890
put in this box with everything else. And then he kind of posted about it.

43
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.130
Cause he saw like, okay, the switch has happened. Like is game time now?

44
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.280
So same thing I'm doing my tour right now. Victory tour, walk around,

45
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.580
do all this. But then even being at the fights last week and I got FOMO.

46
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.610
Cause I, you know, after the fights, I, you know, I see what's up.

47
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.650
People talking about me right around us. I'm like, man,

48
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:24.810
I gotta get back to the gym. So when I get back.

49
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.240
<v 0>I look at this thing. That's interesting.</v>

50
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:32.220
So you're aware that you could get too into the moment.

51
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.030
You can get too wrapped up in the fact that you won the title and maybe slack

52
00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:38.730
off a little, but maybe take yourself too seriously.

53
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.750
<v 1>A lot of people, this is their goal. They're like,</v>

54
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.700
I want to become the UFC champion. They get it done.

55
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.430
And then what happens after the next fight? They lose it.

56
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.070
They lose track of what really matters. So some guys like Colby,

57
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:56.070
for example, he's walking around with the belt when Huseman whoops,

58
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.260
his or if it was man, which asked him, what's going to happen,

59
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.820
you're going to walk around with that bill. How are you going to feel? Well.

60
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.080
<v 0>I, the Colby thing is interesting and I don't know how much Colby wants people</v>

61
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.690
talking about this, but I'm going to, I'm going to spill it as much as I can.

62
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.130
That's an act, man.

63
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.640
That's a strong act that he put on when they were ready to cut him,

64
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.010
they were ready to cut. You talk to that guy in real life. He's yeah.

65
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.850
<v 1>Just being around him, just being inside. He's a nicest guy. He's a nice guy.</v>

66
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.530
<v 0>And he's playing a pro wrestling heel and he's got the whole world worked up</v>

67
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.310
sells. And here's the thing though. This is where it's interesting.

68
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.940
It tricks people because he seems like a goof.

69
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.770
He's wears this stupid cheap blue suit. He wears that Magda hat smile.

70
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.920
He's got the old belt and you know, it's not a legit belt. Right.

71
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:42.400
But he did win the interim title and they took it from him for no reason.

72
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:45.550
It doesn't make any sense. So this is thing about him where people,

73
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:48.280
somehow another thing like maybe he's illegitimate. Maybe he's not real.

74
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.960
Then he Robbie Lawler up and you go, oh Jesus,

75
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:57.070
this guy doesn't get tired. He could strike his wrestling's on point.

76
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:00.280
His cardio's off the chart. He's tough as nails.

77
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.690
<v 1>Especially when he put Robbie against the fence, he was right there.</v>

78
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.360
Slipping and ripping. Oh yeah. Some things, you know,

79
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.610
everyone has holes in the game. I have holes in my game,

80
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.970
but he was really impressive the way he was right there in his face. Yeah.

81
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.833
Robbie Lawler.

82
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.660
<v 0>He's not an elite Stryker in the sense of like,</v>

83
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:20.380
he's a guy who will slip and then blast someone unconscious with one shot.

84
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.860
He's a volume guy. He's throwing 60%, 50,

85
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.540
60% just on you on you on you never let you rest.

86
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:29.374
Never let you rest.

87
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.060
And Robbie in that fight in Brava is a all-time great welterweight champion.

88
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.820
I mean, he was a legit top of the food chain.

89
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.270
And he was looking for those openings that were never there.

90
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.210
He was always looking for Colby to slow down. Colby never slowed down.

91
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.400
<v 1>You want to see him like just waiting, waiting.</v>

92
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.350
And he was just like buying this time box. Get. Yep. Here it is. Here it is.

93
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.560
And there's ways to do that. Like I did it against them Whitaker as well.

94
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.550
You see? Excuse me. I always got a burp. Um,

95
00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:59.350
it's times when he'll like,

96
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.250
I'll put a clip up of this as like a simple one shifting real simple,

97
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.610
subtle thing. Just move two step one, two. That's it.

98
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.060
I can see it when he would like bounce, bounce. All right, I'm ready to go.

99
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.560
You shift, you disrupt a pattern. Okay. Reset, reset. But about to attack,

100
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.800
you know, wonder boy did it to I'm Lou K past weekend.

101
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.160
Whenever he was bouncing he's either he's gonna bounce bounce and a wonder boy

102
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.970
shifts. So he was doing it with the offense, bounce, bounce, bounce attack.

103
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.040
So he was just, it's all about rhythm.

104
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.060
<v 0>Well, you have something that Wonderboy has that a few other people have in,</v>

105
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.040
in that you're a specialist and that being a specialist.

106
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.940
And obviously you have a full game. You,

107
00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:40.900
there's no way you get to where you are without a full game,

108
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.220
but you are an elite Stryker. Thank you. And with that,

109
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:46.200
that's an,

110
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.840
that's a giant advantage because on the feet you are a step ahead of everybody.

111
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.640
<v 1>Every fight star standing on the feet, you.</v>

112
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.820
<v 0>See it with Whitaker because Whitaker is a great striker. He's a tough guy,</v>

113
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.190
but he had holes in his game and maybe he didn't even know he had. Yeah,

114
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.760
but you, you.

115
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.660
<v 1>Could see what it was.</v>

116
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.440
I got in his head and everyone like when I can see this kind of stuff, man,

117
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.350
before the press, before the fight at the press conference,

118
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:09.500
when he was talking and acting on bothered and stuff like that. And I was like,

119
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.760
what? He's acting out of character. People. He put this MIMO, right?

120
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.100
And then people thought I was affected by the mean. But all the,

121
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.450
all that showed me was like,

122
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.680
you've never talked or poked fun at anyone you're fighting with somehow suddenly

123
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.550
you're poking fun at me.

124
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.590
That's showing your first card is showing your firsthand.

125
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.060
And a lot of things he's did throughout the back backtracking and whatnot.

126
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.580
I was like, you're showing me your hand. You're acting out of character.

127
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.230
Even my coach said the same thing. And I said,

128
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.120
just do what got you to the dance.

129
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.060
Don't try and talk with a guy who knows how to talk.

130
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.390
I know he knows how to talk with his friends and like that. But not with me.

131
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:45.530
The internet kid is different. Don't make means against me. I'm a mean majesty.

132
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.680
But like, yeah. So, and then when he quit, when he came to the cage, you know,

133
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:51.850
so you saw me when I walked up, I stumped the yard, stomp the yard.

134
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.970
Now I enter the cage. And when he came in, I could, I could feel it.

135
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:58.850
He was like, that's go, you know, beating this justice thing he did.

136
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.930
And he took about a minute and a bit before he looked me in the eyes and I was,

137
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.380
I was looking at him the whole time. And he like a cat you corner,

138
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:09.050
even the chicken, get one of your chickens corner. It like a rooster.

139
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.010
It's dangerous. When you corner any kind of beast,

140
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.520
they'll attack you at any point. So I could see him pacing back and forth,

141
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:19.820
like a caged animal. And the whole time, like he was a hunter,

142
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.950
he was the hunted. And I was the PR I was, I was a hunter.

143
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.990
So I was watching him and I could feel it like, you know, really about this.

144
00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:30.920
And he's trying to hide himself blessed. And I could just smell that.

145
00:07:30.921 --> 00:07:33.920
And when I went to my stance, I started whoop whoop.

146
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.390
Like this is something I was doing during sparring, like during my,

147
00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:39.200
my training camp. So it was just triggering this, this memory,

148
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.960
like muscle memory in my head. And I was just having fun.

149
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:44.750
This is the point I looked at him. I kind of smiled like, you, I got this.

150
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.120
And I just knew from that point, then I was honest.

151
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.390
And the first round I thought I lost the first round without the knockdown.

152
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.570
Just like I let him have it. But then I watched the back,

153
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:58.160
I threw less strikes. I landed more, he threw more strikes and then it lists,

154
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.250
all I was doing was just me. And you didn't talk about this.

155
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:04.430
Like let the first round or the first half of the fight, let's see what he does.

156
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.290
Just get all his attacks. Draw, make him, show his hand, make him draw, draw,

157
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.800
draw the tax out of him. And I did that and after I watched it again,

158
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:15.320
I was like, yeah, without the knock, then I still had the round.

159
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.450
<v 0>Yeah. It was a brilliant performance.</v>

160
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.110
And the knocked down at the end of the first round was essentially the end of

161
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:24.500
the fight. He was up. It was, there was a bad knockdown.

162
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.330
You could see when you went back to his corner, there's,

163
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.840
there's a moment where you see his eyes are just not quite there.

164
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.191
<v 1>Um, like after the,</v>

165
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:35.660
even before the second round he stood up and when Kelvin rocked me,

166
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.270
after I got rocked, my first time being rocked in the UFC,

167
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.990
in the second round before the second one, I was like, all right, let's,

168
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:44.630
let's go, let's step it up. He was looking at the screen.

169
00:08:44.631 --> 00:08:47.510
Robert was looking at the screen like, well, hit me will hit me. And I was like,

170
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.450
Hey, Hey, that's in the past.

171
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.770
That's done focused on me right now. Anyway. I was like, all right,

172
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:56.930
then let's go. Yeah. Yeah.

173
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.870
<v 0>Um, when it was over, when they stopped the fight, raise your hand.</v>

174
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.170
What's that feeling like knowing that you're the undisputed champ.

175
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.620
<v 1>It felt like just my title defense, honestly, Atlanta,</v>

176
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.040
Atlanta was the one where they put my hand up and I felt like, yes.

177
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.920
<v 0>Why, why Atlanta? Why? Because of the fight so hard.</v>

178
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.300
<v 1>I think because of the way the fight went, the back and forth. And then me that,</v>

179
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:22.800
that fifth round, like I found out who I was after that, that fifth round,

180
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.110
I found out the depths I'm willing to go.

181
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.750
So when they put my hand up and you know,

182
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:29.730
you're beat up and all that kind of stuff just, and also,

183
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:30.720
I never had a belt before,

184
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:34.260
so I've never had it wrapped around my waist as I visualize it.

185
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:37.320
So once that happened, boom, I felt like, yes. And also I was looking at,

186
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:40.140
I was like, please judges don't screw me over. No, for me over on this man.

187
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.130
And I knew I had it, but you know, you never know exactly, bro.

188
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.120
Look at the Darren till guests in flight. So when they put my hand up,

189
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.300
I was like, yes. But then this time they put my hand up, I was like, all right,

190
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.960
what's the thing is I, my, my brain wants to move forward.

191
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.080
Cause I did it in kickboxing. Cause I was undefeated for so long.

192
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:00.660
So it was always like, all right, cool. What's next? I'll watch the fight.

193
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:04.590
Maybe once study it. All right, what's next. But now I have to like chill,

194
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:10.050
relax, look at the tape, look at what you've done. And then soak it in,

195
00:10:10.051 --> 00:10:12.720
smell the roses for a little bit and then move on.

196
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.590
Because once I had my first loss, I took winning for granted.

197
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.170
Cause it was just a habit. I was always winning, always winning, always winning.

198
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:22.020
So now I have to like, when you, when, when you do something amazing,

199
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:25.740
like I did in Atlanta, like I did in Melbourne is chill,

200
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:28.260
smell the roses and then move forward.
