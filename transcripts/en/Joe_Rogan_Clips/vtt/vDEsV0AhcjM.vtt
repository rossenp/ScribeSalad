00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 3>What, what did that one doctor in the corner say about, uh.</v>

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.980
<v 0>Well, what did he say about the results.</v>

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.080
<v 1>I presented to him? 459 guys who had a 78% improvement in a year.</v>

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.990
Okay. That was our 2009.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.120
<v 0>Turns into what is no improvement.</v>

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.590
<v 1>No improvement. Yeah. And so, and it wasn't a long presentation.</v>

8
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:24.000
They only gave me like 20 minutes.

9
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.280
It was a three hour lecture I'd put into 20 minutes.

10
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.510
<v 0>20 Minutes for you is like a couple of blinks, the average person, like.</v>

11
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.760
<v 1>So it was good. Right. But the one guy said he appreciates, uh, what did he say?</v>

12
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.170
He was sitting in there closer to, yeah.

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.410
<v 2>I appreciate it. Your willingness to work with people who needed help,</v>

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.700
but he didn't believe a word you said.

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.880
<v 1>Yeah. And there were like four or five docs that did that. Um, but that's fine.</v>

16
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.620
<v 0>Did you call them out on their motivations?</v>

17
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.610
<v 1>Um, at the end, I basically said, uh,</v>

18
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.560
to my colleagues across the aisle or across the pond, um,

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.290
that if they continue on the paradigm that they're working,

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.020
they're going to have as many suicides as we have in the United States,

21
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.810
because there was no rationale. It was a psychiatrist.

22
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:08.340
What's the scientific evidence.

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.920
The psychiatrist used before he puts you on not you,

24
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.270
but puts a person on antidepressants. What's the science, there's none.

25
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.370
What's the objective science. You feel bad.

26
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.400
<v 0>It's his perception. Yes, exactly. Here.</v>

27
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.630
<v 1>We have hard objective reproducible</v>

28
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.490
clinical data. So I presented 459 cases.

29
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.070
We'll FLATE it out into age groups into what percentage of the people did best

30
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.990
are failures. I mean, we have failures. Our fairs are, um,

31
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.730
24 people out of 459 were due to their being on medication that

32
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:45.720
blocked our treatment.

33
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.850
There's certain medications we've learned what medications, um, one called, uh,

34
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.210
Gabapentin. Um, it, uh,

35
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.800
interrupts Gabba, which is extremely important for, uh, sleep.

36
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.820
So it's substitutes in, uh, did they put you on Gabapentin? No,

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.500
I don't believe so. Yeah. So I.

38
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.530
<v 0>Didn't go in. What's the benefit of Gabapentin for.</v>

39
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
<v 1>Pain and for sleep, uh, for chronic pain and sleep.</v>

40
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.960
That's what they're using it for.

41
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.240
<v 2>But the surgeon general loved what he heard and we actually want him over.</v>

42
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.840
We're going to do this big study in Birmingham, England look over 40.

43
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.430
<v 0>Yours. So the surgeon general loved it. And who didn't the.</v>

44
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.800
<v 1>Well who had, um,</v>

45
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.720
control of the military project at Imperial college?

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.180
The scientific advisors, scientific advisors.

47
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.150
<v 0>Because, because you just throw a monkey wrench into the role of.</v>

48
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.680
<v 1>Their work when his name is Colonel a Colonel</v>

49
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.870
Tim Hodgetts, that stood up.

50
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.640
<v 0>Problem. Pardon? That's the guy who had the.</v>

51
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.560
<v 1>No, he loves what he does.</v>

52
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.020
He's the surgeon general designated him to talk, uh, read, uh,

53
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.240
read was the surgeon general, uh, was the.

54
00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.890
<v 0>Shop towels to read. Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.130
<v 1>So.</v>

56
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.820
<v 2>Yeah, it feels like truth. Yep. Let's do it. So I bought this guy, he came in,</v>

57
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.210
shut him up and said, we're doing this, we're doing it in Birmingham.

58
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.630
<v 1>Really? So what I promoted to do is, um.</v>

59
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.250
<v 2>Since got shut down.</v>

60
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.890
<v 1>They shut us down. You know, they shut us down. Why they shut it down.</v>

61
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.770
<v 2>They came back afterwards, the advisors and worked,</v>

62
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:21.730
however they worked at and got, got them to agree that we.

63
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.040
<v 1>Shouldn't be the summit from the America's coming over.</v>

64
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.770
<v 0>This is not always the case in the movie where you have these like stiff</v>

65
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.750
British intellectuals who just don't buy all this new research

66
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.270
and they do whatever they can to stop it.

67
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.850
<v 2>Yeah. We ultimately in real time, yes. Do you know.</v>

68
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.710
<v 0>Story, those kinds of stereotypes.</v>

69
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.660
<v 1>Do know the story of ink or, um, uh, what his name, he was, uh,</v>

70
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.250
just dropped his last name. Anyway.

71
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.450
He was at the first OB hospital in Austria.

72
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.070
And, um,

73
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.170
Semmelweiss is his last name Semmelweiss he was a obstetrician gynecologist.

74
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.330
And during that time they would go from cadaver dissection into doing

75
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:10.270
vaginal exams on these pregnant women getting ready to deliver.

76
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.960
And they had a very high occurrence of what's called crib death where the they

77
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:16.420
die because they didn't understand.

78
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:20.620
At that time they didn't have cottage POS postulate that they were transferring

79
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.940
infectious agents from the cadaver, because the 17 hundreds,

80
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.620
they didn't wash their hands. So Zimmer vice what he did. He says, ah,

81
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.660
let's put lemon juice and a lie together and we'll wash our hands.

82
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.860
And he took a 20% death rate down to less than 1%.

83
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.630
And he did a thesis on this and presented it to the first obstetrician,

84
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.510
all gynecological hospital in Austria.

85
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.990
And what they did was they refuted his results. Why,

86
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.080
if they admitted that what he was doing,

87
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.440
all it took was washing the hands because what did they say during those times

88
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.550
it was God's will, it was God's will the reason why the person died.

89
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.280
And it was also admit that they were doing things wrong.

90
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.820
They didn't want to acknowledge the fact that here's a guy,

91
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.870
that's an unknown guy. I'm unknown. I don't have credentials. Like these people,

92
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:15.640
we went up against and he was able to solve the

93
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:18.760
problem, but they refuted it. Okay.

94
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:22.450
Like Admiral small and very small from the British Admiralty.

95
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.100
He's the one who treated the first nutritional illness called scurvy.

96
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.240
But it took 50 years for the Admiralty to recognize it because they don't want

97
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:34.810
to believe it took. That's how they got the name limeys. They didn't, you know,

98
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.900
all you need is vitamin C in order to avoid scurvy.

99
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.260
So the doctors were in limeys comes from that's right.

100
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.170
Go look it up. Wow. Yeah, it's in my book, my first book,

101
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.400
interventional endocrinology.

102
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:53.380
I talked about these cases because they talk about the paradigms

103
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.920
and how difficult it is to get one generation of medical caregivers to

104
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:02.870
change what they've been indoctrinated in and fixated on to something more

105
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:07.460
modern that maybe solves a problem that they weren't able to, uh,

106
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.323
resolve.

107
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.170
So it would be admitting that what I'd been doing all this time has been wrong.

108
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.800
If I don't wash my hands. Right. And I can't take that heat,

109
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.710
I become the culprit now wasn't God's.

110
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.371
<v 0>Right.</v>

111
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.160
And then you become responsible for all those deaths that occurred during your

112
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:23.090
treatment. That's right.

113
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.290
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.030
And that's part of what I think is motivating a lot of the resistance

115
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:31.160
there, the science is there. We're seeing it.

116
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.780
<v 0>State side, just as much it's ego. Right.</v>

117
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.480
And then it's also influenced from the pharmaceutical companies.

118
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.800
<v 1>If I had, um, a Harvard degree or if I had a Stanford,</v>

119
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:46.400
I had some of the other degrees behind my name instead of just MD.

120
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.430
If you see K uh, what would happen is they might listen to me, you know,

121
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.630
one of the, um, or you might have a different worldview, uh, correct. I'd say,

122
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.130
oh, screw it. Right. Let it be, uh, one of the,

123
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.120
um, one of our admirals rear admirals that, uh,

124
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.370
was been with us for about eight years,

125
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.620
connect me with another Admiral who got me to the Fort Dietrich

126
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.320
army medical research and development group to share with them what we're

127
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.320
doing. And they were interested in it,

128
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.600
but they didn't understand it because they asked me,

129
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.960
where's the antidepressants, where are the anti-anxiety medications?

130
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:29.870
They're looking for maintaining the status quo.

131
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.100
The only way we're going to improve this is for people to open up and look at

132
00:07:34.101 --> 00:07:37.070
the science and say, huh, I didn't know about this.
