00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 2>Do you, do you know the story about this guy who is a, a liberal journalist?</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.120
Who, what did he do? He agreed with someone that said something.

4
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:15.760
He liked something about Alexandri Ocasio-Cortez and the police

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.640
came to his house. I did. Did you, did you hear the story?

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.190
I did pull his story up, cuz it's so crazy. Crazy that you, you go,

7
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.030
this can't be real. And here we, we are, I don't think that it's AOC,

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:27.780
who's doing this.

9
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.630
It's probably some nutty AOC reporter or a supporter rather police

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.630
visit the home of podcaster after a criticize AOC on Twitter.

11
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.750
So pull up the story because this is so crazy. This is like so crazy.

12
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.020
I mean it's China type.

13
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.860
<v 0>It's so crazy that I feel like there has to be more to it when I heard about it</v>

14
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:46.694
the other night, but.

15
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.020
<v 1>I mean, no, it's not please scroll down so I could read this here. It goes. No,</v>

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.540
no, no. So I could read that to you. Oh yeah. It's about.

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.580
<v 0>That interview that she had, which was &lt;laugh&gt; see.</v>

18
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.140
<v 1>Yeah, the interview was insane. Oh my gosh.</v>

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.300
And so ridiculous Uhhuh on April 1st AOC did a live stream with Michael Miller

20
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.210
head of the Jewish community relations council of New York.

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.050
She was asked about peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

22
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.290
Her response was incredibly underwhelming to say the very least. Now,

23
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.770
if you listen to her response, she's unprepared.

24
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.410
She doesn't really have a thing to say about this.

25
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.130
So she basically just sort of uses words, salad, and it's a nonsense answer.

26
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.480
Yeah. Okay. That no, go back down, go back right there. Um,

27
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.200
really shaken up right now. Uh,

28
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.840
so the guy puts this thing saying it's underwhelming.

29
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.080
He puts it up on Twitter and I'm really shaken right now.

30
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:32.914
This is the next tweet.

31
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.000
I was just visited by two plain clothes police officers from California highway

32
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:37.960
patrol at my home.

33
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.110
They said they came here on behalf of the Capitol police and me of

34
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.470
threatening AOC on Twitter yesterday. This is provably false.

35
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.230
So go back up to what we just saw. Yeah. So this is all he said,

36
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.550
her response was incredibly underwhelming to say the very least.

37
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:57.990
So someone decided that what he now,

38
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:02.990
the reason being is I'm sure this is some sort of a support

39
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.580
order of AOC that contacted the Capitol hill police and probably lied.

40
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.260
But the fact that they could just come to your house without any proof that you,

41
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.380
it's not like he's saying this lady deserves to die. She must be stopped.

42
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:18.060
We have to stop none of that. None of that,

43
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.980
none of that underwhelming to say the least, which,

44
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:22.740
which is a very mild criticism.

45
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.890
<v 0>It is actually, if you watch that interview, the guy's face is classic though.</v>

46
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.610
The guy interviewing it's just like, he can't believe what she's saying.

47
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.410
It's classic. He watches facial expressions.

48
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.770
<v 1>Like, but this is what happens. Wanna play.</v>

49
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.770
We should play it just so people understand what, how cuz it is.

50
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.010
It's really a ridiculous answer. It is. But it's, it's a,

51
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.770
it's a kind of answer you give when you're in seventh grade and you're doing a,

52
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.843
a,

53
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.600
the teacher asked you a question about a book report and you didn't really read

54
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:49.520
the book exactly what it was. It was about Columbus. And this is,

55
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.400
it was so important that Columbus was here because without Columbus mm-hmm

56
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.680
&lt;affirmative&gt;, there was so many things that would not have happened.

57
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.640
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, collo what Columbus did was brave and amazing.

58
00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.680
You really like.

59
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.240
<v 0>That's exactly what it is. Now. You have to be careful.</v>

60
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.440
They might be showing up at your house tonight.

61
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.440
They might be at the studio when we're at, when we walk outta here. I.

62
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.960
<v 1>Don't think AOC dis I really don't.</v>

63
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.840
I think it's a crazy person that thinks that this is just my opinion.

64
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.360
I think it was most likely a crazy person that is angry at this guy for not

65
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.240
towing the liberal line. Yeah. Because he's a liberal journalist. Yeah.

66
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.390
<v 0>Podcaster. That's the interesting thing too. When you talk about, you know,</v>

67
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:23.670
grow growing up, when we grew up, when you talk about liberalism,

68
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:26.030
it means something different and than it does today,

69
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:29.030
and there's a difference between a classical liberal and a leftist.

70
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.790
And what we're seeing more of in this country is those terms intertwined.

71
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:33.310
And they're very different things. Yes. Uh,

72
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:36.110
and leftists are kind of what we're seeing more of, uh,

73
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.790
which is grabbing this control restrictions on,

74
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.980
on freedom of speech and restrictions on owning firearms,

75
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.460
restrictions on whatever they think might be dangerous. Yeah.

76
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.580
Especially when they throw in dangerous to the children. That's the other,

77
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.020
other key when, uh, talking about, but then they take power and guess who's buy,

78
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.340
who's buying all the expensive houses and, and has the,

79
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:54.540
has the power and the control. Oh,

80
00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:57.340
those same people that were fighting for the little guy a little while ago.

81
00:03:57.341 --> 00:04:00.210
And talking about all these restrictions that we needed to place on, uh,

82
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:03.770
some of these more natural rights that, uh, are inherent at birth,

83
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.250
they namely to be able to defend ourselves and our family defend that gift of

84
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:07.850
life. Yeah.

85
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.090
<v 1>Like when a Marxist starts making money and buys million dollar houses. Ah,</v>

86
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:13.770
did that happen recently? Yeah, it did. Yeah. Yeah. That's what happens.

87
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.050
You're a Marxist. If you're a Marxist, you're not buying million dollar houses.

88
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:21.160
You're not on a real estate basis. &lt;laugh&gt; that's not mark. That's why I.

89
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.000
<v 0>I talk to,</v>

90
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.840
well all as often as I possibly can I talk about the importance of studying our

91
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.000
history? Yes. Putting that requisite time, energy,

92
00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:32.000
and effort into studying the past so we can make decisions that, uh,

93
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.320
cause we have this responsibility to make decisions, uh, for future generations.

94
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.280
And if we haven't put that time into studying our history and if what you know

95
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:42.990
about a certain, uh, uh, event or a, a, uh,

96
00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:47.150
certain issue is based on someone else's tweet that you just retweeted and all

97
00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:47.471
of a sudden,

98
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:50.550
that's your opinion of something that's gonna affect multiple generations down

99
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:50.831
the line,

100
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:54.590
particularly their abilities to defend themselves and their families or to, to,

101
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.110
to start a business or whatever it, it might be. Well,

102
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.950
you owe it to put down the phone to get into these books, realize, Hey, what do,

103
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.420
why? Why, why is, why are these amendments in place? Why is this important? Um,

104
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.500
and from the inception of this country, up until today,

105
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:10.460
people have died to give you the right, to be able to make these decisions,

106
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.660
to follow your dreams, to have these options and opportunities.

107
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.633
Not only give up.

108
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.260
<v 1>Everything, people have died, supporting these things that you support,</v>

109
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.170
these things you, you like when people are really in a Marxism,

110
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.210
like you need to learn what happened when that was the rule of law,

111
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.370
because it's a terrible, terrible history. It's horrible.

112
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.810
But it seems good. Like the idea that everybody should have something,

113
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.250
it should be equal for all. And all the workers should be even,

114
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.400
and everybody should have equal things. Well, you know what happens then? You,

115
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.100
you,

116
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.080
you don't have the same amount of effort because there's a reason why some

117
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:52.880
people work harder than others because they realize you can actually get further

118
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.320
ahead. There's a competition. And that competition fuels innovation.

119
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.680
It fuels all sorts of things. There's incentives. Oh yeah.

120
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.680
These incentives to discipline, you wake up an hour earlier,

121
00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.200
then you're the next guy you do it seven days a week.

122
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:09.200
You got seven hours of work that that guy doesn't have in. Yep. Or you.

123
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.440
<v 0>Wake up seven hours earlier, like Jaco does. And everybody else,</v>

124
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:13.720
something like that. Yes. Uh, but yeah, you have that option.

125
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.840
You have the option. True. I can write books. You can do this.

126
00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:18.870
Like we have these amazing freedoms. And when have you ever read a book,

127
00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:22.550
whether fiction or non or studied history where the people that put names on

128
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.510
lists, the people that restrict rights,

129
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:27.910
the people that confiscate firearms are the good guys in any of those movies.

130
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:31.230
Even let's just say fiction. Yeah. Ever. Yeah. Never. Exactly. Yeah, exactly.

131
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.030
So that should be a clue, right. There seems.

132
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.300
<v 1>Like when you say it the right way, if you Rick,</v>

133
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.980
the rights of these people to have guns, then they'll not be any mass shootings.

134
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.740
Cause there'll be no guns like oh, okay.

135
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.580
<v 0>And someone just retweets that that becomes their opinion rather than hold on.</v>

136
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.340
Let me look at the, if this was even the issue, uh, let me look,

137
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.140
take at the look at the FBI crime statistics, the actual ones and be like, oh,

138
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.100
why are they going after this one thing that causes almost nothing.

139
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.340
They should be going after hammers and baseball bats,

140
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.210
or if they were really wanted to save lives,

141
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:02.370
you should make sure that every single phone just turned off when you got in

142
00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:04.610
your car and just what didn't, wasn't allowed to operate.

143
00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:06.010
If you really cared about the children, right.

144
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:07.810
Or at least start 18 and under no texting,

145
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.810
this thing turns off when you get in a car, right.

146
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.890
If you were really concerned about saving lives.

147
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.090
So it's a disingenuous argument from the beginning. Yeah. Uh,

148
00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:16.130
but it sounds so good.
