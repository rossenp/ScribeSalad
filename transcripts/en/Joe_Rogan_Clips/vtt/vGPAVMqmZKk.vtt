38
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.310
the type of rifle that Adam Lander used to kill 20 children. And six more.

39
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.750
Rideals he quote a blast to shoot with guns are fun.

40
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.350
Some of them are much more cool than others. Are you proud of what you said?

41
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 4>It's.</v>

42
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.620
<v 2>Too, is the fact in America,</v>

43
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.980
there have been a lot of shootings in the school and in the university.

44
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.820
What do the liberals say is the reason for this and this solution?

45
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.100
<v 4>Well, they blame it on guns. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, it's crazy because.</v>

46
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.090
<v 2>They blame it on the guns. Yes. Yesho it is.</v>

47
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.010
We start a program in Israel for kinder

48
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.850
guardians. Okay.

49
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.530
We train them from the age 16 down to the age three. Yeah.

50
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.170
<v 4>Well, I, I think it would be a, a, a good idea.</v>

51
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.090
We we've been pushing something along this line for years,

52
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.210
but really haven't gotten any traction with it.

53
00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:47.040
We were thinking seventh or eighth grade and you're talking much younger than.

54
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.000
<v 2>That. My son was in the very first program. May he rest in peace?</v>

55
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.800
&lt;laugh&gt; he died doing what I love &lt;laugh&gt;.

56
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.000
<v 4>They haven't quite developed. Um, oh my, we call conscious God where you, you,</v>

57
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.640
you feel guilty about doing something wrong. That's developing.

58
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.640
If you're learning right and wrong. If they haven't developed that yet,

59
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.680
they could be very effective soldiers. This year.

60
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.160
I thought in our state government,

61
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.200
they had a bill put in that would've made it illegal for someone

62
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.110
four years old to 12 years old, have access to a gun. Uh,

63
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.310
we, we killed, we killed the bill.

64
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.910
<v 2>They tried to stop four year old children from having access to guns.</v>

65
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.190
Yes. Yes. What is the logic that these people come up with? &lt;laugh&gt;.

66
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.910
<v 4>They just think the children, uh, can't handle them.</v>

67
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.420
<v 2>We want three roles who are real experts at what they're doing.</v>

68
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.420
Not three yearolds who are reckless. Yeah.

69
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.740
And we don't teach two year olds because they call it the terrible tools for

70
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:49.260
reason. Yes.

71
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.220
This is a reason &lt;laugh&gt; I would like you to help me do instructional video.

72
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.460
<v 0>For three. Oh.</v>

73
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.500
<v 1>They're gonna show you. Yeah. Well you should folks watch that,</v>

74
00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.130
but what's really crazy is the hate man. Like that's a while.

75
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:02.090
Look at the makeup that he's.

76
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.890
<v 0>Wearing Madison. He does, he does one where he's like a, an NPR type of cat.</v>

77
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.930
And he goes to Kingman, Arizona, and he tries to build a mosque. And they,

78
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.610
the that comes outta their mouth, the fact that they sign off on it,

79
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.850
the one dude goes there's blacks in this town. And we don't,

80
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:19.210
they don't belong here either. And the guys and you know,

81
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.040
of course he's he makes to joke. And then he goes, no,

82
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.360
what i'mt telling you is we tolerate them. We tolerate the blacks.

83
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.360
It like sits and it sits in the room for a second. You're like good God.

84
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:33.680
These are real people that exist. Yeah. They exist. They tolerate the blacks in.

85
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.880
It's.

86
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.640
<v 1>A great name of the show too. This is America. Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.520
<v 0>This is, this is the guy MOS new.</v>

88
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.670
<v 1>MOS per king. Look the NPR guy, the wooden beads around his neck. Oh, he nailed.</v>

89
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.310
<v 0>It. His intro is hilarious. Cuz he goes, I'm a self-haing white man. &lt;laugh&gt; oh,</v>

90
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.373

91
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.190
<v 1>Play that video. Try to find that video. It's really.</v>

92
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.150
<v 0>Funny. And then you, and then he's a genius, man. He, he, uh, he lays us.</v>

93
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.510
What is this? This, this is it. That's it. That's it. That's it see.

94
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.340
<v 5>Huge economic growth here. Here.</v>

95
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.460
Who wants to see an investment of

96
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.380
385 million?

97
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.780
Guess what? You guys are gonna get it. Look at.

98
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.850
I'm here to tell you the chosen, this,

99
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.490
the location of a brand new state. Ofthe art.

100
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.303
Mosque.

101
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.090
<v 6>What of the art?</v>

102
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.650
<v 5>I know some of you thinking, okay, this is just another typical mosque.</v>

103
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.280
This guys is going to be the world's

104
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.640
largest mosque outside of the middle east.

105
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.273
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

106
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.440
<v 6>Just the word alone scares you to me. When I hear the word mosque,</v>

107
00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:57.920
I think of terrorism. This guy, is there.

108
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.740
<v 0>Is there a need.</v>

109
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 5>For this in Kingman? Yes. There is. How wild,</v>

110
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.800
what your town will become. Forget the whole thing.

111
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.080
Hop for tourism for.

112
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.280
<v 1>It's really.</v>

113
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.600
<v 0>Good. It's so good, man. That'll.</v>

114
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.000
<v 1>Be able to look at the character. The character is this guy.</v>

115
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.350
<v 0>Right there. Wonder that guy, this toothless dude, that it just on him too.</v>

116
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.870
But the other dude, he's the one that's like the blacks we tolerate. It's a,

117
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.270
we have to, we do it. Cuz we have to it's.

118
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.470
<v 1>Look at his shoes, man. He went insane with the perfect outfit. This is amazing.</v>

119
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.830
<v 0>Every detail of every character he does, the clothing is my,</v>

120
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.390
is some of the funniest. It's real specific. What's.

121
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.910
<v 1>Hilarious is he kind of had to do this because everybody knew what he looked</v>

122
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.940
like that we couldn't just do Bora. True. Couldn't just do Oll.

123
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.540
<v 0>Jean, except for people in these. He, you know, when someone goes,</v>

124
00:06:42.541 --> 00:06:45.660
someone will notice you he's famous. Not in those worlds. They don't, they,

125
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.980
if he'd had no makeup on nobody in king, who, who Sasha bear and Cohen is,

126
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:49.560
do you know what I mean?

127
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.460
<v 1>The, the crazy thing is these people must have had to sign releases.</v>

128
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.300
<v 0>Yeah. And I did hidden camera. So I know how that works. Yeah. I've done that.</v>

129
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.380
<v 1>Too. Yeah. So how.</v>

130
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.050
<v 0>Well there's two ways there's money,</v>

131
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.810
which is always the best way mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you make 'em sign before

132
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.970
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's that's it there's there's two ways to get around

133
00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:05.970
sign floors the way yeah. You make sign, you know,

134
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:07.050
we're gonna be featuring you on this thing.

135
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.210
We did this bit Ian Edwards and I did this bit for comedy central for the show

136
00:07:11.211 --> 00:07:15.090
that never went. Um, I don't know if I've ever told you this, but we,

137
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.000
this bit was so fun to do. We made a thing called and in Mayo, mayonnaise,

138
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.720
mayonnaise, that ch that made you darker. &lt;laugh&gt;

139
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.960
Real. And, and we put food coloring in Mayo,

140
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.680
but we introduced it as new brown Mayo. It's a new generation of Mayo.

141
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.480
And so we got people in this test group.

142
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.280
We know like real people in a real test group that go and take tests all the

143
00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:40.990
time in. They, I mean, they sample. We put 'em in a room.

144
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.110
We made them eat the sandwiches, just Mayo. It was Mayo.

145
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.630
They eat the sandwiches. All these white people eat the sandwiches.

146
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:47.870
And then when they're done,

147
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:50.470
we send in this black dude Al and she shows them a video.

148
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.550
And it was a pre-ttape video,

149
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.390
basically of white people confessionals who have turned we've you know,

150
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.310
we photoshopped them to have turned more brown to turn, start to turn black.

151
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.260
Oh my &lt;affirmative&gt;. And we're like in three to five weeks,

152
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:03.740
you start to see results. You start to see cultural results, mental results.

153
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:05.580
You know're getting, you're getting more black by culture.

154
00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:06.740
You're getting smarter black.

155
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:08.980
You're getting cooler black in your neighborhood to your friends,

156
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.580
like their face it, their faces were perf. If we didn't have any volume,

157
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.500
you'd laughed. Everyone's like, um, wait a minute. No one said we'd be black.

158
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:22.290
We'd be turning laugh. I mean, they lost their minds.

159
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.410
&lt;laugh&gt; people got so scared. It was amazing. Ah,

160
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.130
that bit was incredible. They MTV never. I mean, uh,

161
00:08:29.131 --> 00:08:31.650
comedy central never aired to any of that. Where is it? Comedy central.

162
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:35.250
Probably. Hasn't a vault. They threw away. Oh my God. How could they not?

163
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.610
That was one of our favorite bits that we, that made us laugh. So hard.

164
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.960
Their faces that one, one woman though, one woman to her credit. She goes, she,

165
00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:45.280
you know, people are freaking out in the room.

166
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.120
People are starting yelling at him and they're like, this is I'm gonna Sue you.

167
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.720
I'm gonna, and he's black and he white people. I'm gonna Sue your. If I'm black,

168
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.600
it's like the funniest to watch him go.

169
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:55.960
It's not as bad as you're making it out to be. I mean, I was,

170
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.120
I was born black and I'm liking it a lot. And one woman goes, you know,

171
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.400
it's disturbing, cuz it's shocking just to spring this on me. But I don't, um,

172
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.800
I'm not scared. I, I could take on being black.

173
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.440
I'll just let's let's we'll see what happens. I mean, she was like positive pun,

174
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.960
third credit. See what happen? She goes, we'll just, I'll just live with,

175
00:09:13.961 --> 00:09:15.790
we'll just figure this out. I guess. I mean,

176
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.470
it was insane that they bought into it, but also that that's how we did it.

177
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:22.950
We made him sign beforehand and then you paid him out and when it's over,

178
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.910
we broke 'em off more money. So they wouldn't say no,

179
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.590
cuz they still have the legal right. To be like, I'm pulling that. You,

180
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:30.470
you pull it or I'm suing you. So once.

181
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.670
<v 1>It was over, did they understand that it was for comedy central.</v>

182
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.180
<v 0>After, after everything was said and done. And then did they laugh?</v>

183
00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.860
A few did not laugh. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. Yeah. A few laughed.

184
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:44.220
A few people were not cool, but that was one of my favorite bits,

185
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.940
melon and Mayo and man didn't work like a charm. People were like,

186
00:09:48.941 --> 00:09:52.020
this mayonnaise is delicious. It was Hellmann's or whatever.

187
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.490
With a little brown dye in it it's unconventional. I really like it.

188
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.730
&lt;laugh&gt; this is so stupid. That's so funny. Yeah. That was a funny bit, man.

189
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.130
They killed, they murdered.

190
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.930
<v 1>A bit. Seeing people think they're about to turn black and.</v>

191
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.010
<v 0>They panic and the black guy's a presenter.</v>

192
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:09.770
That was the best part we put Al you know,

193
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.410
Al's up there in a room full of this guy named Al shear.

194
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.690
He was he's a greatover and he's in a room filled with white people.

195
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:19.200
Tell telling him they don't want to go black. Oh my God. It was awesome.

196
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.200
It was a fun bit. So he.

197
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.120
<v 1>Was saying that he used to be white. No.</v>

198
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.800
<v 0>No. He he's saying it's he, he just was the, the representative for the company.</v>

199
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.080
Right? We loved the idea.

200
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.960
We had images and video of people who had turned black of white people who had

201
00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:33.960
turned black &lt;laugh&gt;.

202
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.590
<v 1>But you didn't tell him until after the eighth a sandwich. It's exactly right.</v>

203
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.230
<v 0>Oh my gosh. Eat the food first. Then we showed them the, we,</v>

204
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:42.190
we said it was a commercial cuz that was the whole thing.

205
00:10:42.191 --> 00:10:43.390
It' like a new commercial campaign for,

206
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.750
for whatever fake mayonnaise company we made up. And then we had said,

207
00:10:46.751 --> 00:10:49.110
here's the commercial. We're gonna run along with it. What do you guys think?

208
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.270
And we played the commercial. They were supposed to rate the commercial.

209
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:53.710
That's what they do in those test groups, you know? Oh my God.

210
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.180
<v 1>Yeah. That was, that was fun. Now what did comedy central? Why did they, not.</v>

211
00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.580
<v 0>That they didn't, they, you know, what's so funny is they, they,</v>

212
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.780
we oversshot this pilot cuz I think they wanted way more bits for the sketch

213
00:11:04.781 --> 00:11:08.660
show. And I just don't they, a lot of things, they said they couldn't,

214
00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:11.180
they didn't want to air, they couldn't air. There's a few things that were just,

215
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.140
he did some great bits.

216
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:15.580
I just think comedy central legal department was just having a trouble with it

217
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.100
because he, he was balls out. He,

218
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:19.730
he did this thing called gangster gardener where we would went.

219
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:21.290
Tobelaire where he just started, um,

220
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.570
like clipping people's lawns and planting trees with a group of Mexican dudes.

221
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.770
And they were like, looked like they were thuggged the out.

222
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:28.970
And these white dudes would come out. Like, what are you?

223
00:11:28.971 --> 00:11:30.530
What are you doing in my yard? It's like we plant trees.

224
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.810
Are we trying to get this looking nice? And these white dudes are like, no,

225
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.330
I don't want you. He's like we landscaping.

226
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.850
And then he would hand &lt;laugh&gt; he would hand them bills. He'd be like, yeah,

227
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:40.960
that's 50 bucks, 50 bucks for that Bush. And these dudes were like,

228
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.320
I'm not giving you my, you can't, you can't just like Renegade do my lawn.

229
00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:46.200
He's like, that's how we making money out here these days.

230
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.000
Inbelaire it was like, Ugh, we got in, that was a tough day.

231
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.560
Cause everyone's like, I'm gonna Sue you. I'm gonna Sue every in that truck.

232
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.720
I mean, it was like, I mean, there were fun days, but a lot of days,

233
00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.240
and that was like going through,

234
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.040
you just feel people's like anger B bubbling over and they're gonna murder

235
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.960
somebody. But Al was ruthless. He didn't give a Fu he didn't give a.

236
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.080
He would to be.

237
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.200
<v 1>A certain type of person and.</v>

238
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.920
<v 0>Do whatever he would go do any bit. He would go do any bit. He loved.</v>

239
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.870
And Rachel was always, his favorite was making white people feel uncomfortable.

240
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.750
<v 1>To do a hidden camera show. You gotta be a.</v>

241
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.550
<v 0>Different kind of person. Yeah. It's a beastasly thing. I &lt;laugh&gt;,</v>

242
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:24.950
you gotta be up. You gotta be up. And they, he and he was good, but yeah,

243
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.430
Ian, Ian and I, and, and uh, another person wrote a bunch of those weird stupid.

244
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.310
It's.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.620
<v 1>Gotta be really hard to do something like done today,</v>

246
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.500

<v 0>But you know what?</v>

250
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.580
They took a chance because he is such a good horse to bet on and look at on

251
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:51.300
that. Just on yet YouTube clip. That's not even a Showtime clip.

252
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:54.970
That was somebody else that 150,000 and views on just a sh a clip.

253

<v 1>And it's just really recent too. Yeah. Just.</v>

254
00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.090
<v 0>They just put it out. Yeah. I mean,</v>

255
00:12:59.091 --> 00:13:01.090
his they're circulating all over the internet.

256
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:06.050
It's it will just get way more traction as time goes on. Cuz it's so fun, man.

257
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:07.690
Yeah. He's a killer. Got all that free PR.

258
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.890
<v 7>Too by all the politicians saying that like bill, bill duped,</v>

259
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.970
before they even put out the shows, they're all like we got DUP.

260
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.280
I got duped by him. I got.

261
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.240
<v 0>Duped Dick. I got Sarah Palan they all came out. Were like,</v>

262
00:13:18.241 --> 00:13:20.040
they Fu he me over da, da, da, da.

263
00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.600
And then they had a billboard that somebody said he was doing stolen valor.

264
00:13:23.601 --> 00:13:24.434
Did you see that?

265
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.640
<v 1>Yeah. What was that about? Because he said that he was a, an injured soldier.</v>

266
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.200
<v 0>And an ex right. There was an ad for him as an ex soldier or something.</v>

267
00:13:30.201 --> 00:13:33.200
And so that got a ton of press, a ton of press.

268
00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.390
<v 1>Wasn't that? The Sarah Palin one? No.</v>

269
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.670
<v 0>Yeah. I don't know. Was it? I don't know. You'd have to look it up.</v>

270
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:39.590
I don't remember which one it was.

271
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.990
<v 1>I think it was the Sarah Palin one. He was a disabled veteran.</v>

272
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.670
<v 0>But they were saying right stolen Val or stolen Val, all this.</v>

273
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.950
<v 1>Yeah. They were trying anything to discredit it. Well, but if.</v>

274
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.030
<v 0>But it's com it's a, it's a comedy series. It's a sketch comedy series.</v>

275
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:54.910
You tell me a sketch character. Can't play whatever they want. I mean, that's,

276
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.980
that's what it is. That's I think people that's like people get mad.

277
00:13:57.981 --> 00:14:00.180
Some people say no. I mean, if it's a,

278
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.460
if you can play a character in a F if you can play a war hero in a film,

279
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.340
why can't you play the opposite?

280
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.260
<v 1>Like born on the 4th of July, Tom cruise. Okay. What's.</v>

281
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.220
<v 7>So funny. I was just thinking the, the, I think the character he has when he is,</v>

282
00:14:13.221 --> 00:14:16.610
that is the, the, the alt right type guy. Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah.

283
00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.050
He saying is a bunch of stuff like that.

284
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.090
And Showtime countered the claim here

285
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.530
with the Showtime counter Sasha bear and cl stolen Val claim. Yeah.

286
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.290
<v 1>They countered.</v>

287
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.410
<v 0>It well, cause they cuz it was made public. It's.</v>

288
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.090
<v 7>A long statement about it. But.</v>

289
00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.680
<v 0>Widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne</v>

290
00:14:36.681 --> 00:14:38.840
Rudick Jr. PhD performed by. But what is the.

291
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.673
<v 1>Counter?</v>

292
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.640
<v 7>I think they explained what happened.</v>

293
00:14:41.641 --> 00:14:44.200
They sort of said that they didn't misrepresent themselves.

294
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.120
They probably thought he was someoneridick.

295
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.480
<v 0>Was asked by the Senator if he was disabled.</v>

296
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.440
And he stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve energy.

297
00:14:53.441 --> 00:14:56.040
In addition, barricone never presented himself as a veteran in the us military,

298
00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:56.920
former Alaska governor,

299
00:14:56.921 --> 00:15:00.160
Sarah Palan during the booking process or during the filming of her interview.

300
00:15:00.161 --> 00:15:01.520
Okay. So there you go. Okay.

301
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.640
<v 1>Scroll down a little bit lower.</v>

302
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.360
It says on Monday a conservative street artist replaced a billboard near CBS

303
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.600
television. Yeah. City complex in a Los Angeles, uh,
