00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.960
<v 1>Um, it's like trying to find your, your,</v>

3
00:00:06.961 --> 00:00:08.600
your calling and your passion in life's.

4
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.640
Like you don't ha have to necessarily know what that is,

5
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.080
but Whitt it down by fi what don't you want to take? What do you hate?

6
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.920
What do you hate? Right? Don't even look like what you like, what do you hate?

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.990
I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna do this. I don't wanna do this. I, I,

8
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.070
I learned very early on at a young age.

9
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.910
Like I do not want to go down this path that I see everybody on this,

10
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.430
go to school, get a job. Uh, have kids get married, retire, die.

11
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.630
Like, I, I, I don't want, I don't want that. I don't know what I do want.

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.390
I just know that to me. I don't want anything to do with that.

13
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:42.460
And I'm gonna go in these &lt;affirmative&gt; exact opposite direction,

14
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.020
whatever that is. As long as I'm far away from that, that'ss where I'm gonna be.

15
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.740
<v 2>Well, it's one of the benefits of being an outsider. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:52.540
When you're an outsider and you see all these people that are supposedly doing

17
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.473
the right thing,

18
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.500
but living these sort of empty meaningless lives that they don't enjoy.

19
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
Yeah. Particularly that they don't enjoy, you know? And then &lt;affirmative&gt;,

20
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.530
you know, when I was a kid, I,

21
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.170
I always looked at normal people living normalized. I could never relate.

22
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.090
I never understood it. You know,

23
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.450
I also grew up from a broken home and we were also on welfare and, you know,

24
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:17.570
the whole deal mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because I think a lot of motivated people

25
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.410
come from a place of despair when they're younger. Yeah.

26
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.560
And I always had this thought in my head one day, I would make it yeah.

27
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.800
One day I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it. And then one day I realized,

28
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:32.640
and I don't know when I realized it. Probably when, like on paper,

29
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.720
I'd already made it. Yeah. Yeah. I realized, oh, there's no such place.

30
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.720
&lt;laugh&gt; like, this is not real. Like you can't ever, you don't make it.

31
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.470
No ma no one makes it. Yeah. Like if you,

32
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.870
every day you have to be trying to do better.

33
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.830
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; every day you have to be trying, first of all,

34
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.630
there's no perfect human let's accept that. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

35
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.630
you're always gonna be flawed. You're always gonna,

36
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.190
you're always gonna be subject to fits of rage and envy and,

37
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.550
and all the things that you wish that you would never have in your mind.

38
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.620
So you've got a constant ly be working to make sure that that never happens.

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.740
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

40
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.380
you'd constantly be working to make sure that you are always evaluating your

41
00:02:11.381 --> 00:02:15.020
perspective on life. And always looking at things from meditate,

42
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.740
constantly meditate, make sure that you approach life with, uh, a,

43
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.660
a learned perspective.

44
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.170
Like you are a better than you were the day before mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and

45
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.930
whatever you're trying to do, whether it's fighting or whether you're,

46
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.850
you have an art form that you practice, whatever it is that you're doing,

47
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.970
you are trying to do better every day. And you never, even if you,

48
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.770
you accomplish some, like when you know you accomplish some amazing work of art,

49
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.290
that's just that day mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; the next day you gotta go back to

50
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.243
work. Yeah. Like,

51
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.560
like if you have a world championship fight and you've trained for eight weeks

52
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.920
and you win by knockout and the spectacular result,

53
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.040
and you're very happy with the result you got a day or two to relax. Yeah.

54
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.280
You got a day or two, and then you're like, okay. Now what? Well,

55
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.480
now you gotta get back to work. And if you,

56
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.880
if you think that there's some place like a movie where you're holding hands

57
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:09.400
with your loved ones and the sunset's going on in the credits role,

58
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.533
that's horses.

59
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.040
And we have this idea in our head that there's this place that you can get to

60
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.120
where you have air quotes made it. Yeah.

61
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.710
And I'm here to tell you that doesn't exist. Yeah. I mean,

62
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.230
obviously I'm not the most successful person in the world, but on paper,

63
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.790
I've accomplished a lot of. And it doesn't mean a thing.

64
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.550
&lt;laugh&gt; every day, every day I get up. Yeah. And I'm like, all right, God,

65
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:35.670
I figure, figure out how to do this. I gotta work on this new bit. Okay.

66
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.870
I got this podcast today. I gotta be on point. Let me think about this.

67
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.260
Let me read this book. Let me, uh, you know, whatever the subject is,

68
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.580
let me get all, let me get into it. You, you have to, if you don't,

69
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.020
you're you're gonna feel like.

70
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.580
<v 1>Yeah. It's that, that destination mentality. Yeah. There's.</v>

71
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.620
<v 2>No destination. Yeah. Stay just.</v>

72
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.180
<v 1>A journey. You're never gonna get there. There's no, it doesn't exist.</v>

73
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.860
<v 2>There's nowhere to go. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

74
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.970
<v 1>There's nowhere way to go. As soon as you get there, you're like, geez,</v>

75
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.450
I'm just as far away from that thing that I thought,

76
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:06.570
because as you develop your, your,

77
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.450
the things that you think you want develop too. Yes. Oh,

78
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.810
one day I'm gonna be rich, but the richer, they,

79
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.570
you get the richer you want to become, well.

80
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.130
<v 2>Then you start filling up your life with these meaningless destinations. Right.</v>

81
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:22.200
Which are material objects. Like I wanna can yacht. Yeah. I want a jet,

82
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.760
you know, and you're like, I want a bigger jet. Tom's got a jet,

83
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.120
but I want a big jet. I wanna show, put my jet up beside hood jet,

84
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:33.280
let know there's levels to this game, you know, and that's what people do.

85
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.560
And it's, they, they fill their lives up with meaningless possessions and they,

86
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.773
and they still.

87
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.670
<v 1>Aren't happy. &lt;affirmative&gt; a bandaid to cover up the, like,</v>

88
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.470
what is the real thing here? Do.

89
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.110
<v 2>You know how many really successful people I know that are medicated to. All,</v>

90
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.230
all of them, a lot of.

91
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.910
<v 1>'Em a lot of 'em more, more, more, more, more,</v>

92
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.990
more so than the people that aren't in. A lot of ways.

93
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.630
<v 2>The people that struggle they're on a better medication for real, the,</v>

94
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.380
the struggle of like, like a hard working person that can get,

95
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.500
get done with a day of hard work and have a feeling of accomplishment and then

96
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:10.180
go home to your family and get going again,

97
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.940
knowing you have to get up in the morning and do it again,

98
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.980
knowing you don't have enough money to buy a yacht,

99
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.980
but knowing you have enough money to put food on a table,

100
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.620
and there's a satisfaction to be able to provide that that's a better medicine.

101
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.570
<v 1>Well, that's the thing with, with why it's so important and vital to,</v>

102
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.770
to travel and, you know, go to these third world countries.

103
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.850
Like these people literally have nothing and are

104
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.170
inviting perfect strangers into their homes and giving them things that,

105
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.410
that they, they do not even have themselves. Like,

106
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.570
why are these people so happy? Why are they so at peace? Right?

107
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.520
Because they end understand what's important that it's not this materialistic

108
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:48.480
thing. And, and that's not to say that materials are bad,

109
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.560
but we view them as these, these, these objects of, of success. Yes. And, and,

110
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.280
and, and I've made it and I've things are perfect in my life. And they,

111
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:02.280
they do the exact opposite in a lot of ways. If you don't have a

112
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.560
good grasp of, of what's really important in this life.

113
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:09.840
And, and UN,

114
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.880
unfortunately a lot of times we need everything taken away for us to really

115
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.120
understand what those things really are. Yeah.

116
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.110
<v 2>You, you can appreciate some things.</v>

117
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.190
You can appreciate a nice car or a nice house,

118
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.110
but if you get really caught up in them,

119
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.030
you are trying to fill up a bucket with a hole in it. Yeah.

120
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.790
And it's never gonna fill up. Yeah.

121
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:29.590
You're always just gonna look for bigger and bigger things to try to fill that

122
00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:33.950
bucket up. And, and you're gonna feel full of anxiety all the time,

123
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.950
chasing that. Yeah. And there's no real,

124
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.620
there's no real ill satisfaction then that's why, you know,

125
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.820
when you look at one of the things that people look at,

126
00:06:41.821 --> 00:06:45.300
when you look at people that are extremely materialistic, that you know,

127
00:06:45.301 --> 00:06:46.040
where the,

128
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.660
the most fancy jewelry and drive the most fancy cars and the biggest

129
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:54.380
houses, we always think they're shallow. Always. I mean, isn't that funny?

130
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.210
Like the thing that you would look at in terms of like you like

131
00:06:59.211 --> 00:07:01.570
markers for success, markers is like

132
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.650
material. Things are the big ones, right? They're the big markers for success.

133
00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.330
The big house, the that's the big one, right? Yeah. Big mansion.

134
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.010
Look at his mansion, big everything, big, everything.

135
00:07:13.011 --> 00:07:16.610
Look the big rock on its finger. Yeah. Big chain, you know,

136
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:21.160
big this big that the there's nothing there. Yeah. There's nothing there.

137
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.280
<v 1>And so ingrained in us from the time that we're born, because.</v>

138
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.560
<v 2>It's hard to get. Yeah. That's, that's why it's a trick.</v>

139
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.760
It's one of those things that's hard to get. So you think you want to get it?

140
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.190
Yeah.

141
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.960
Because there's a lot of things that are hard to get that are worth getting for

142
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.520
sure. Right. I mean, becoming a great fighter is hard. Yeah.

143
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.680
But it's worth doing. Yeah.

144
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:39.190
Because once you do do it and you you've realize like,

145
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.430
like there's an expression that I've used before, but my, uh, tango,

146
00:07:42.431 --> 00:07:46.030
no instructor said to me when I was a, a little boy, he said,

147
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.950
martial arts are a vehicle for developing your human potential. Yeah.

148
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.230
And I remember that I' mean like, oh. Like,

149
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.630
and I've used that many times explaining to people,

150
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.740
but that is the benefit of getting good at a martial aren't. Yeah.

151
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.180
Like you go through this difficult thing. And then through that,

152
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.420
you reap all these personality rewards.

153
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:08.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you reap these character rewards.

154
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.340
You reap this understanding of what you're capable of. Right.

155
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.420
If you are capable of making it through a brutal camp and getting up in

156
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:17.860
the morning, when, you know, you don't want to,

157
00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:21.090
that alarm clock goes off and you're like, I don't wanna run, but you do it.

158
00:08:21.091 --> 00:08:22.050
You go out and run and you,

159
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.570
you do it every day and you get through it and then you're successful.

160
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.690
And you realize that you have this incredible endurance because of the

161
00:08:28.691 --> 00:08:29.570
discipline that you put in,

162
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.050
you realize that you have this incredible skill and this understanding of how to

163
00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:35.850
fight correctly because of all the time and the hours and the focus.

164
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.930
You're a better person because of that. Yeah. Right. That's a real goal.

165
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:44.000
But that yacht, you know, like the, the like, oh, I'm gonna,

166
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.680
I'm gonna work 16 hours a day so I can get a bigger yacht. And then, you know,

167
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.800
I, I need a house with bigger windows. I need a it's there's a nonsense to that.

168
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:57.560
Like, look, I'm not saying if you can afford a nice house, get a nice house.

169
00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:00.600
Yeah. It's great to have a nice house. What I'm saying is it's not the end.

170
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.680
Yeah. It's the, you, you are the project. Yeah.

171
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.000
Your mind is the project. Yeah. How you treat people is the project. Yeah.

172
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.920
How you, your,

173
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.070
the way you are with your family and your friends and your loved one and the

174
00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:18.670
people you communicate with, get better at that. Yeah. That's, that's,

175
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.270
that's the goal in this life. The goal in this life is how we treat each other.

176
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.510
<v 1>I know. And I, I, I wish these were things that we were, uh, taught.</v>

177
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.350
<v 2>No, no, no, no. It's better. It's better that you didn't learn it that way,</v>

178
00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:30.790
because you had figured out yourself. Yes.

179
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:33.670
Cuz you had to figure it out yourself and cuz you can explain it to people.

180
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.471
That's true.

181
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:38.860
You particular that you can explain it to people having gone through this

182
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.380
horrific adversity mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and come out on the other end with a

183
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.820
message. Yeah. And so other people that are going through some tough,

184
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.220
you've got the medicine. Yeah.

185
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.820
The medicine is your you've you've actually experienced it. And you know,

186
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.380
it's a map, it's a map of the territory. It's not,

187
00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.050
it's not a pill that you can take and all of a sudden everything's gonna be

188
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:01.610
better. But what it is is a map of the territory. Yeah. And you know, and,

189
00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:06.290
and a knowledge, Hey, you can get through these woods. And on the other side,

190
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:08.970
there's a beautiful green meadow and there's a lake and it's really nice.

191
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.283
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.

192
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.490
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. You know, I think that that was one, uh,</v>

193
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.970
one of the benefits of the way I grew up, which it,

194
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.440
which was really hard and horrible, but I got to see firsthand,

195
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.680
both sides of money. You know,

196
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.040
I went from living in a basement with five of the people, living on welfare,

197
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.840
to living with my father and a mansion. And it's like,

198
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.360
oh yeah, all this money and all this stuff is just emptiness and,

199
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.630
and meaningless. And, and it doesn't necessarily equate too real happiness.

200
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:44.510
No. And like, why are we'all chasing this so hard?

201
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.030
And I got to see that first hand very, very early on. I was like,

202
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.910
I don't want this at all. Well.

203
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.870
<v 2>It's a trick. It's like the same reason why people love to play video games.</v>

204
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.310
Yeah. Because they're difficult.

205
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.500
Uh-huh &lt;affirmative&gt; &lt;affirmative&gt; but there's no, there's no real reward.

206
00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:02.260
Unless you're a professional video game player and you make a living doing it

207
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:06.020
nowadays. There's no real reward. You just get better at it.

208
00:11:06.021 --> 00:11:08.500
And you get some sort of a sense of satisfaction and mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

209
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.740
I mean, there's a, there's something to be gained from it. In fact,

210
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:15.580
some video games they've actually shown can increase your cognitive performance

211
00:11:15.581 --> 00:11:19.650
and other things similar to the way Chad does. Right. But the,

212
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.650
the trap is that they're hard to do.

213
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.290
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so when we see things that are difficult,

214
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.250
human beings are sort of puzzle and problem solving oriented.

215
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:32.650
We see puzzles we wanna solve and we see mysteries.

216
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.050
We wanna find out that's why everybody's into like Bigfoot and UFOs and.

217
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.800
Cause it's a mystery. Yeah. Oh, what is it? What do you think it is?

218
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.520
Like we have a natural inclination to try to solve things like that. Yeah.

219
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:49.480
And we think that because in life, look, if you try to solve where the food is,

220
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.120
you survive. That's what made us alive.

221
00:11:52.121 --> 00:11:56.120
That's why our DNA has been passed down for all these hundreds of thousands of

222
00:11:56.121 --> 00:11:59.560
years. Yeah. Cause our ancestors figured out where the food is, you know,

223
00:11:59.561 --> 00:12:03.480
they figured out how to drill a hole in the ice and fish.

224
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.640
They figured out how to, you know, how to survive. Yeah.

225
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.200
And this is why things that are difficult to do are attractive to us,

226
00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.910
but we have to be able to differ ranch between things that are difficult and

227
00:12:14.911 --> 00:12:17.950
meaningful mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and things that are difficult and. Yeah.

228
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:20.030
My fr you know, Brian Coen mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; my friend,

229
00:12:20.031 --> 00:12:22.670
Brian Coen said something to me once when we were really young and uh,

230
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.550
it was the perfect thing. We're both in our twenties and he said,

231
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:27.470
all you want is enough money.

232
00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:30.430
So you don't have to worry about what something costs when you go to a

233
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:34.540
restaurant. Yeah. He's like, everything else is. I was like, you're right.

234
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:40.180
Like that feeling of being able have enough money to just get a nice meal at a

235
00:12:40.181 --> 00:12:43.420
restaurant and not sweat it. Yeah. Like everything else is gravy.

236
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.660
<v 1>Yeah. Well, you know, they, they've done countless studies on this.</v>

237
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.700
Like once your basic human needs are met, you know,

238
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.060
you have food shelter. Yeah. Um,

239
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:58.090
everything from that point on is doesn't correlate to any kind of happiness.

240
00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:02.050
And in, in many ways is the exact opposite, you know, creates more stress. Yes.

241
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.650
And all of these things like what, how much do you really need? And if you,

242
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.690
the more you, you think you need, the, the more problems you're creating and,

243
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.810
and the more distractions you are from, um,

244
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.560
the important things in life and developing as a human being, you know,

245
00:13:18.561 --> 00:13:20.720
you're developing all these materialistic things,

246
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.160
but you're not developing yourself emotionally and mentally and spiritually.

247
00:13:25.161 --> 00:13:29.840
Yeah. And, uh, yeah, like just as soon as you realize that and be like,

248
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.720
why, why am I cha what am I,

249
00:13:31.721 --> 00:13:34.440
what is the purpose of what it is that I am chasing? Yeah.

250
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:39.230
<v 2>I think this study was like, they said $80,000, like everything over $80,000,</v>

251
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.630
like you really don't experience any much more, you know,

252
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.910
before that you're you get into like 40,000, 30,000. Well,

253
00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:49.910
now you're struggling. It's hard to feed yourself. Yeah. Becomes very,

254
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.270
it's a weight on your shoulders. Mm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

255
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.710
But once you hit a certain number, it's like, eh, you're gonna be all right.

256
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.540
<v 1>Yeah. You're not gonna be in the street. Yeah. You' be fine.</v>

257
00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.740
<v 2>You're living. Like I remember I lived in this apartment or this, uh,</v>

258
00:14:01.741 --> 00:14:04.260
kind of apartment and then I moved to a better apartment.

259
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.660
And then I was sitting in this better apartment. I was like,

260
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.220
I'm kind of used to this. Like I'm used to this, like, this is just home now.

261
00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.180
&lt;affirmative&gt;, there's a feeling when you get, when you're home, like,

262
00:14:12.181 --> 00:14:15.060
all right, I'm home now, I'm in this other apartment. It just costs more money.

263
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.210
Yeah. You know, like, okay. I remember thinking that like, is this better? Yeah.

264
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.890
I mean, I guess it's better, but it cost twice as much.

265
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.610
Like now I gotta think about how I'm gonna pay for this. Yeah.

266
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.450
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; boy, I think about like,</v>

267
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.090
when I had like $5 in the bank room when I had $5,000 in the bank, like,

268
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.680
did I feel different? I didn't feel different at all.

269
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.480
No. You know, I might have felt different.

270
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:40.840
Like when I go out to eat and the check comes, like,

271
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:42.960
how am I gonna pay for this kind of thing? But,

272
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:47.840
but emotionally I didn't feel any different whatsoever.

273
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.760
Yeah. And, uh, yeah,

274
00:14:49.761 --> 00:14:54.560
I think that's such an important lesson for all of us to learn. And if you know,

275
00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.520
the early, the sooner you figured those things out, you know, the.
