00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.061
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:06.780
I think one big point about what you're saying about these influential people

4
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:11.190
too, is they, they benefit from strife.

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.480
They benefit from conflict. And so instead of United is like Martin Luther king,

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.280
Jr. You have the opposite.

7
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.270
You have people that literally benefit from people being divided.

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.010
They benefit from calling people out or yelling people

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.420
down, or, you know, getting, getting conflict going like that.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.000
That gets them more views. I mean, that's, what's going on with Facebook.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.000
That's what the algorithms that people are complaining about,

12
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:40.050
that that are literally accelerating our path towards some sort of civil war.

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.273
Do you see the.

14
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.070
<v 1>I did see the social dilemma. Scary, scary.</v>

15
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.920
And I tell you what I was watching actually on the plane was this, uh,

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.890
do you remember the duke lacrosse players? You remember that story.

17
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.720
<v 0>Dude.</v>

18
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.960
<v 1>The duke lacrosse players. So the whole media, uh,</v>

19
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.970
had kind of indicted these guys and they loaded this story with,

20
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.140
you know, class and race. Explain the story. It was a bunch of lacrosse players.

21
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:07.590
They had a party, right? A bunch of guys had a party at their house. Yeah.

22
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:10.770
They're uppity white guys. They played lacrosse. So it's like,

23
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:12.840
nobody comes from the ghetto and plays lacrosse.

24
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.070
So you know that they're arrogant white guys who probably, you know,

25
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:18.630
their father may have like a third.

26
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.930
They definitely have a portrait in the foyer of like, this is my uncle,

27
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:26.280
his ties go back to England or whatever. So their dishes, we get it. But, um,

28
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.950
they had a party and somebody, uh,

29
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.060
hired some strippers and the strippers that came were like two, um,

30
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.740
POC S they were POC, POC. And, uh, one of them, a lot of people.

31
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.573
<v 0>Listening, like.</v>

32
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.660
<v 1>PLCs or people who, um, historically disenfranchised,</v>

33
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:46.680
a little darker melanin tones, people of color, people of color,

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.240
people of color. Um, and so they came, they stripped the girl,

35
00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:54.150
they only shirt for like five minutes and the girl was saying weird stuff. And,

36
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.930
um, then they got mad. The guys got mad.

37
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.510
Cause they felt like they were getting a con that they didn't get their,

38
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.600
their lap dance worth or whatever their dancing worth.

39
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.100
And then something went awry.

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.460
And then the girl called the cops and said I was assaulted.

41
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.670
And then from there it became a big story.

42
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.350
And it ended up that the prosecutor was withheld, withholding,

43
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.170
um, exculpatory evidence that would have exonerated

44
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.490
knowingly. I mean, he ended up getting disbarred and doing time because of this.

45
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.460
And uh, and you look back now and you're going,

46
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:33.750
like that guy was doing exactly what online personalities do now. It's like,

47
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:36.210
this is good for me. Right? I'm in the spotlight.

48
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.810
I'm this hero convicting these bags. There's the,

49
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.780
media's attaching this big social justice cause to it,

50
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.080
this there's this evidence that clearly my client is lying.

51
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.080
Let's just put it to the side because all the attention is on me.

52
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.820
And this is self-aggrandizing for me. So I'm benefit forming. I'll just lie.

53
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.850
And just, you know, there's some evidence that comes that, uh, you know,

54
00:02:56.851 --> 00:03:01.390
contradicts what I'm saying. Let's just because right now I'm a star. And uh,

55
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.500
so these kids were maligned by the media, all these journalists,

56
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.210
writing this horrible stuff about these kids,

57
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:12.040
the culture of the lacrosse players, the privilege, the white privilege,

58
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.490
this that they did this to this poor black person, you know?

59
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.930
And th and then it was loaded because of Dorham because you got duke and duke is

60
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:23.920
like the Harvard of the south, and then you got poor Dorham and then it was all.

61
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.410
It was all. The DNA exonerated, the three kids that were on trial.

62
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.940
And, um, it ended up just, this girl was like, had some mental health problems.

63
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:37.060
She ended up like killing her boyfriend or something, and is in prison.

64
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:41.560
Like a couple of years later, she was like off, you know, and, um, some,

65
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.890
a few journalists apologized. But by that time, it was like, you know,

66
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.700
now you go to comedy clubs, the joke that comics tell the most,

67
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.850
if they see a black five, like waspy looking white guys, they're like, ah,

68
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.640
you guys look like the duke lacrosse player like that.

69
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:55.930
You use it as a pejorative.

70
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.350
So it doesn't matter if it's true because the media made it true.

71
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.460
A lot of people don't even know that they did nothing because the narrative had

72
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.930
already been written. Right.

73
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.460
<v 0>That's the problem. That's the problem.</v>

74
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.890
The problem is once the narrative gets out there, any, any,

75
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.200
if there's some sort of a correction in the newspaper, a couple of weeks later,

76
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:18.460
it's always on like the fourth page in the lower right-hand corner. Sorry.

77
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.300
We have the amendment to the story. Turns out nobody raped anybody. Whoops.

78
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.000
Yeah. Sorry. Sorry. We ruined your life forever.

79
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.950
<v 1>But we sold a lot of papers with that.</v>

80
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.270
<v 0>So that, that isn't a real issue. The real, here's a real question.</v>

81
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.500
Should you be able to make money off the.

82
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.670
<v 1>News? It's a good.</v>

83
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.720
<v 0>Question. It's a good question. Because if you can make money off the news,</v>

84
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.340
then all of a sudden the news becomes a show and the more outrageous you can get

85
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:47.050
it, the more click baity you can get it.

86
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.970
The more you can sorta jazz up the headlines and distort the story.

87
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.060
The more you're going to get people to tune in. If it bleeds, it leads.

88
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.650
<v 1>Oh, I remember when I was working for fusion, which was like a short-lived, uh,</v>

89
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.640
company. And, uh, that was owned by Disney and, um, Univision.

90
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.110
It lasted like a year. It was toted.

91
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:08.980
Like they tried to build a big studio in Miami and they were trying to target

92
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:11.080
millennials. But by that time, like everything was on the phone.

93
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.450
People were watching you. And it was like, it was just a waste of money.

94
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.980
But I remember one of their slogans was like, start a fight. And I was like, ah,

95
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.930
yeah. Cause my co two,

96
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.320
my two co-hosts were journalists and it was run by journalists.

97
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:25.510
And I was like the comedic guy that, you know, they, oh,

98
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.240
they had me in a corner and they opened it up and I came in and I was like, Ooh,

99
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.830
ha to make people laugh. But, but I was working with like a Peabody award,

100
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:36.970
winning journalist, uh, you know, Maria, Marianna Atencio and Pedro, uh,

101
00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.830
drag and drop he's. Uh,

102
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.330
he was from Brazil and they were two serious journalists. And, uh, you know,

103
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.200
the, the, when they, the executive producer said, it sounds like pick a fight,

104
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.580
always look to pick a fight. And I'm like, wow, that sucks. That sucks.

105
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.890
Yeah. That should be happening in MMA with the matchmakers. Not your.

106
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.540
<v 0>That's hard to hear. Yeah. Pick a.</v>

107
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.100
<v 1>Fight, pick a fight because it gets ratings. People love the drama.</v>

108
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.460
They love it. I mean, if you turned out a real reality TV show,

109
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.760
it would just be like a couple of guys sitting around, you know,

110
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.360
picking their nose changing channels. But then if you make a reality,

111
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.670
you're like, they tell you that that's not, that's not reality.

112
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.930
They don't mind producers going, okay. Calling me Edward now it's like,

113
00:06:19.931 --> 00:06:22.980
I don't want to call them the N word. Like, nah, trust me. We'll figure out it.

114
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.870
You know? It'll.

115
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.670
<v 0>And then we'll bleep it out. No one on the flip side.</v>

116
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.503
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.680
<v 0>Then they start with the end and lead with the R you you're like, Hey.</v>

118
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.790
<v 1>I bet you punk was a really good guy. I bet you, they just edited it.</v>

119
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.020
You remember puck from real-world.

120
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.770
<v 0>Oh yeah, that's right. Pedro's a mess.</v>

121
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:44.600
But the problem with those guys is that you make a more of a mass by shining the

122
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:46.520
camera on them, and then you make them famous.

123
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:48.200
Didn't he like lose his marbles ever.

124
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.410
He got off that show cause he was like one of the most famous guys from the real

125
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.970
world other than Theo Vaughn. Yeah.
