00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Here's my thing. Back to the,</v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:07.800
the mass shootings and the gun control with the semi-automatic weapons.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.910
If they said, Hey man, if we get rid of semi-automatic weapons,

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.510
there won't be any more mass shootings like this. Don't you think in general,

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:18.870
most people are like, yeah, cool. Take them in. Are they that fun? No.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.770
Are they that cool.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.520
<v 1>Shoot. People would not do that. There's the, why do you need them? It doesn't,</v>

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.610
it doesn't matter whether you need them. It's a mass stupid Joe, listen.

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.450
<v 0>It's a real problem, man. The problem is dying left and right. Okay.</v>

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.060
<v 1>You're looking at it the wrong way you got to look at and T yes.</v>

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.080
In terms of the way they're looking at it, they're not going to say, okay,

12
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.000
you take them because their ideas,

13
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.850
the government eventually wants all your guns and they're going to start with

14
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:44.970
assault weapons, and then work their way to all weapons.

15
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.833
What if they just give up.

16
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.850
<v 0>You look at a worst case scenario.</v>

17
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.610
What if it's just assault because of the mass shootings? Because they don't.

18
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.080
<v 1>I think that they should be able to do that.</v>

19
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.010
They think that the government does not have the ability to take away your guns,

20
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.900
but we haven't stopped them. The problem is crazy people shooting people.

21
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.800
The problem is not automatic guns shooting people. Right?

22
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:05.581
It's really interesting.

23
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.400
You're going to go after those people that have the guns that have never done

24
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.290
anything. Well, they are going to say, well,

25
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.690
the second amendment protects my right to keep.

26
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.560
<v 0>We've been bear arms.</v>

27
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.230
Know the amendments written the 17 hundreds that hasn't changed. True.

28
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.650
The thing is though, is if you can say, Hey, we have problem.

29
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.750
If we can get rid of these for now.

30
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.020
<v 1>In the future, we're good to go. What I'm saying is that.</v>

31
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.360
<v 0>Most Americans would be like, yeah, you're right, man.</v>

32
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.840
We don't need them that bad. No, that's that's mind blowing to me. It is.

33
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.950
But people went, Hey, Brendan Ferrari's are killing people left and right, dude,

34
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.150
you gotta get off the road with this thing. So many people are dying.

35
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.480
Like get rid of the Ferrari.

36
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.780
<v 1>Yeah. But that's a simplistic perception of what's actually going on. No,</v>

37
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.180
one's going to think about it that way. They're going to think. I mean,

38
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.220
the people that don't have guns are going to think about it that way,

39
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.420
but the people that are second amendment and physiatrists are going to say,

40
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.570
this is a slippery slope. I didn't give them any ground.

41
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.900
Like Joe Biden has been saying, we're going to take your assault weapons.

42
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.060
This is one of the things that Joe Biden has said publicly.

43
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.030
And this is one of the reasons why the people that are pro second amendment are

44
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:07.770
never going to vote for him. They think that if you give in, in any way,

45
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:09.930
shape or form, we're going to take them on free slope.

46
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.970
And they're going to take away pistols. I mean,

47
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.450
California's already reduced the size of the magazines, but that actually,

48
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.130
I think that was voted back. Like I think that was ruled to be unconstitutional.

49
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:22.890
They had like limited magazines. Like you only have a magazine,

50
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:25.800
like six rounds or 10 rounds or something like, no, it was 10.

51
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.240
And I think they're trying to make it lower, but that dad has been reversed.

52
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.060
<v 0>Here's my thing with the mental health, everyone goes, well,</v>

53
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:34.320
America has a mental health problem.

54
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.060
There's a mental health problem all around the world.

55
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.100
We just have a gun problem. That's all.

56
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.930
<v 1>True. The mental is just here.</v>

57
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.830
The mental health problem in the United States is extremely exacerbated by the

58
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:46.920
use of psych drugs. There's way, way, way.

59
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
<v 0>More. Psych drugs prompts to brother. They don't have nearly.</v>

60
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.730
<v 1>As many prescribed drugs in Europe as they do. Are you sure? Yes.</v>

61
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.440
SSRI talked to.

62
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.273
<v 0>Bernie.</v>

63
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.400
<v 1>[Inaudible] psychologists. Yeah. You've probably done your research.</v>

64
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.160
It's this pharmaceutical lobby in this country. Look,

65
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
obviously not everybody on psych drugs is out murdering people.

66
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:09.910
The problem is it's many, many, many layers, right?

67
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.320
There's people that are abused.

68
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.630
There's people that grow up with a lot of violence.

69
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:16.720
There's people that grow up and they, you know, they're, they're psychotic.

70
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.020
They, they have psych drugs. The psych drugs are disassociated.

71
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.590
<v 0>The bad apples though. Like, does it always have to be a mental illness?</v>

72
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.370
Like all these shooters just happen to have mental illness, all of them, well,

73
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:28.563
someone just don't say.

74
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.380
<v 1>Maybe some socket life, but almost all of them. I mean,</v>

75
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.860
in the high 90% are on psych medication. Yes.

76
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.110
And as coming from someone who's who was murdered by his wife when she was on

77
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:45.790
an SSRI and on cocaine, like people, when they're on those drugs,

78
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.020
it's, it's a varying reaction and suicidal thoughts are very common,

79
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.280
as well as homicidal thoughts, very common. And also the,

80
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:56.140
the feeling that things aren't real,

81
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.110
the people that I've talked to that were on SSRI as they got off of them.

82
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:01.750
One of the things that they all say is that nothing seemed real.

83
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.200
That's what you did like a simulation.

84
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.033
<v 0>Yes.</v>

85
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.880
<v 1>Blank. Yep. Yeah. Everything felt flat.</v>

86
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.730
I think that's a big problem for sure.

87
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.170
A crazy person with a semi-automatic weapon is a real problem.

88
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.100
And you would want to take a semi-automatic weapon away from a crazy person,

89
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.220
the other PR. But the problem is if there's a guy like you,

90
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.840
who has a semi-automatic weapon,

91
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:29.350
you have a ranch somewhere and you just like shooting coyotes and

92
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.390
metal targets that are out in the distance and you don't harm anybody.

93
00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:39.160
And you're a good person. You are technically protected by the second amendment.

94
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:42.610
And why should you, but okay. But then what about your pistol?

95
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:44.320
Should you take your pistol? What about your shotgun?

96
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.690
What if you get a shotgun and you keep reading.

97
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.010
<v 0>But again, to the, with shotgun, they're not going to kill as many people.</v>

98
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.730
<v 1>It depends on whether or not the people are armed. If the people are not armed,</v>

99
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.550
they're running around a mall. You can kill a lot of people with a shotgun.

100
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.650
<v 0>It was an automatic. Yes.</v>

101
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.570
<v 1>Maybe. Yeah. Maybe.</v>

102
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.240
<v 0>I mean, here's what the scary thing me you're on the smartest people.</v>

103
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:08.710
I know Bernie Sanders is smart. This, he lives in this world. When you said,

104
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:12.280
what are we going to do? His answer? I was like, that was as good as mine. Yeah,

105
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.270
it's true.

106
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.430
<v 1>You're right. You're right. There's no one that scared me.</v>

107
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.510
It's a good thing to be scared because there's no one out there has a shining

108
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:22.720
light. Like one answer. You like, that's it. The smartest.

109
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.870
<v 0>Mine's in the world. And then I'm listening. I'm like, well,</v>

110
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:27.430
I've thought of that. That's not gonna work.

111
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.430
<v 1>For me, dude. The, the Joe Biden answers the dumbest answer.</v>

112
00:05:30.431 --> 00:05:32.620
We're going to take away your guns. You're going to have a civil war guns.

113
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:35.710
You can't, you can't take away. The St take away assault,

114
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.020
guns and assault rifles. You're not going to do that.

115
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.990
They're not going to give them the constitutional.

116
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.820
<v 0>Let's say they do do it. There's too many out already. Right?</v>

117
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:47.680
There's too many on the market. So let's say you borrow.

118
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.700
<v 1>A hundred million guns.</v>

119
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.070
<v 0>In this car. And how many people, that there's 300,000 people in this.</v>

120
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.730
<v 1>A million. There's a hundred million more guns than there are people. Okay.</v>

121
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.630
So you.

122
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.660
<v 0>So if you stop the of automatic guns right now,</v>

123
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.180
there's still a hundred thousand more than people out there.

124
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.680
<v 1>Then you'd have to go get them,</v>

125
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.650
but you'd have to go door to door and search to do that.

126
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.170
What everyone's thinking will happen. That's not.

127
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.790
<v 0>Realistic. Like the Howard's or some.</v>

128
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.080
<v 1>How else are you gonna get.</v>

129
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.210
<v 0>Those guns from? That's clearly not the answer. Is it?</v>

130
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.840
That's never going to happen? No, no. One's going to give you those guns.

131
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:19.670
So that's not the answer. I don't know what the.

132
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.530
<v 1>I don't either. But the crazy thing is,</v>

133
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:23.420
if you look at the mass shootings across the world,

134
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.490
the most and other countries see like two.

135
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.430
<v 0>Or three now for us, it's over 300 already this year.</v>

136
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.110
<v 1>I think it's two 70 something.</v>

137
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.760
<v 0>A mass shooting is three or more. Yeah. Um, the other thing to me,</v>

138
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:38.660
that's interesting is I used to always think it was kids who, on our, you know,

139
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.190
our, in their basement and on Reddit,

140
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.610
there are these losers and they have nothing to live for. Probably true.

141
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.450
Some of them set up most nine out of 10, but then he got homeboy like go over.

142
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.840
And, uh, where was it? Ohio who had these chicks are coming out.

143
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.500
He's banging a few girls, had a bunch of girls that like, man, we saw signs.

144
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:56.060
He was always talking about mass shootings. Like.

145
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.090
<v 1>He had a rape list in high school. Yeah. They all fed he's up.</v>

146
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.320
They all thought he was really up.

147
00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:08.240
But he was also Elizabeth Warren supporter who wrote a post about the

148
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:12.050
need for gun control after different mass shootings. I mean,

149
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:13.940
he was a real left wing guy.

150
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.450
And this is something that the media is ignoring because it doesn't fit the

151
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:21.230
narrative because the narrative is, they're all white male, right wing,

152
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.620
you know? And he was left wing. He was left wing. Like, yeah, he's a leftist.

153
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:28.850
I mean, he, he wrote leftist. He, him as his pronouns on his,

154
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.470
his page. Wow. Yeah. I mean, he was, but it has nothing to do with him.

155
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:34.610
He's a psychopath.

156
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.890
<v 0>They're saying the kid that they caught and got in,</v>

157
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:39.380
I don't want to talk about mass shootings, bonds me out, winded up to this.

158
00:07:39.381 --> 00:07:42.200
We'll move on to something else. But, um, they're saying the kid that got in,

159
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.460
uh, El Paso who did the one who, who ended up dying and was, she did die. But,

160
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.230
um, he was saying that, uh, he shows no remorse. He's like, I did it man.

161
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.290
And like, are you kidding me, dude? You killed kids. And he's like,

162
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.750
you're right. How crazy is that?

163
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.950
And he's going to get a cushy, you know, room he's living better than, than,

164
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.240
you know, most of these immigrants that come here and get detained.

165
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.250
It's insane, man. They should.

166
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.980
<v 1>Definitely kill them. And they should definitely.</v>

167
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.800
<v 0>Should torture, man. Just, just, just, ah.</v>

168
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.640
<v 1>Just a quick it's it's not fair, but having them suffer,</v>

169
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:21.350
it doesn't help anybody. It really doesn't.

170
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.930
But having them around doesn't help anybody either. No.

171
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.620
<v 0>Here's the, here's the good thing though. In his manifesto, he went,</v>

172
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.560
hopefully someone gets them in shoots me.

173
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:33.200
So I don't have to go through the legal system. That's way worse.

174
00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:36.710
It'd be way better die real quick. So at least he doesn't want this.

175
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:39.470
That's a good thing. Why is it all white dudes?

176
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.590
<v 1>No, we're a mess. You know, Charlotte crazy, bro. Charlemagne actually put that,</v>

177
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.520
that it was all these white guys that white guys are the biggest threat in terms

178
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:53.390
of terrorism in America and Instagram took his posts. How.

179
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.770
<v 0>Crazy is that? That they're, they're more of a than ISIS.</v>

180
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.830
<v 1>But he had played widows of all these different white guys who have committed</v>

181
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:02.430
mass murders. And as a white guy, I'm like, yeah, yeah, me.

182
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.263
<v 0>Too. I went go.</v>

183
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.760
<v 1>Charlemagne. Yeah, you right. But they took his post down. Well,</v>

184
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.160
how crazy is that? Then they put it back up. They put it.

185
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.100
<v 0>Down. Right? They did show had some power, man. Well, he.</v>

186
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.830
<v 1>Made his case and he's correct. He,</v>

187
00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:17.130
he had literal photographs of all the different people that were white that have

188
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:20.130
committed mass murder and named the last time.

189
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.860
The last time there was a black guy that committed a mass murder.

190
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:26.370
Was those guys in DC. They were shooting people out of their car.

191
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.150
<v 0>DC sniper. It was a son and a father. Yeah.</v>

192
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.670
<v 1>It was a guy in a younger guy. The younger guy was his son. He.</v>

193
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.080
<v 0>A serial killer though. Yeah. Yeah. Not so much. A mask is doing one at a time.</v>

194
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.660
One, it wasn't killing three, but that was scary.

195
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.640
Cause people were just at like gas stations getting.
