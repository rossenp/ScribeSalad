00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.300
but how often do you come across people that will fight you tooth and nail to

3
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.960
the death to hold onto those preconceived plot? Exactly.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.360
A simple one I came across was even involved with this COVID stuff was trying to

5
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:18.660
talk to people about how the,

6
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.280
the ma the mainstream media has had bad narratives from the get, you know,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.410
be it, they were given bad information,

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.460
but they doubled down on it all the time. Or if it's the who,

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.500
and they're running interference for China, whatever, right?

10
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:36.090
There's all this manipulation going on around something that is not,

11
00:00:36.091 --> 00:00:40.860
that is, it's not subjective viruses. Aren't subjective that you just can't,

12
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:42.600
you can't play this game with that kind of thing.

13
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.820
And people would fight me tooth and nail to

14
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:49.740
defend the mainstream media over it.

15
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.510
And I go look here's example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, look at how they're all wrong.

16
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.640
They're up. They're doing this, they're politicizing.

17
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.560
And they're doing all these different things for different reasons,

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.510
but none of it is really for your own betterment of understanding and to be

19
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:06.960
safer and healthier. And, or even just to say,

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.550
we still don't know yet,

21
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.720
because we just don't have the data and people fight tooth and nail over the

22
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.360
ship, because there's so many people that you use,

23
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.340
the current media apparatus as their mainstream sense-making apparatus.

24
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.450
And if you tear that away from them, now they have to sit back and go,

25
00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.480
what do I really know? Right. What,

26
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:30.900
what is the reality of what I think truth is? What is,

27
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.210
what is the metric upon understanding now that you've just shown me that?

28
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.210
And of course, even at its best, of course,

29
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:42.300
media is going to be faulty at times because it's just made up of people, right?

30
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.820
We're always going to be imperfect. We're always going to make mistakes,

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.440
but there is no admitting of mistakes anymore.

32
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:52.110
There's no saying I was wrong. We were right.

33
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.040
There's also a problem with mainstream media.

34
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.920
And it's the same problem that we have with the police.

35
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.500
You're giving people an inordinate amount of power.

36
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.810
And when you give people that amount of power,

37
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.970
they don't want to ever let it go.

38
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.000
And they don't ever want to say they're wrong and they don't ever want to admit

39
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:12.860
fault, and they don't ever want to open the door to nuance. Correct.

40
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.300
And that's what you see with whether it's CNN or Fox news or any of these,

41
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.080
they have this idea that they've been selling you,

42
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.360
whether it's this idea about Russia,

43
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.170
whether it's the idea about COVID was the idea about Trump was the idea about

44
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:31.970
Biden. I mean, they're selling you some and it's,

45
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.100
uh, it's very, very difficult to get an unbiased perspective on the world.

46
00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.860
They came after you for no reason, you know,

47
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:44.540
they would write all this kind of completely disingenuous, uh,

48
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.810
uh, just narrative driven, around you,

49
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.850
a person who brings people on and has conversations and tries to tries to,

50
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.710
um, flourish. That idea of the, the,

51
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.470
what are they going to marketplace of ideas,

52
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:04.330
like having conversations and trying to earnestly and sincerely explore things.

53
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.020
<v 1>I got to tell you the story. So I went to Peru beacon for,</v>

54
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:10.860
to research this book because I wanted to talk with like,

55
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.250
as close as I could get to pre agricultural hunter gatherers. Right.

56
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:16.410
And I can't get, you can't get too close, but there,

57
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.000
there are people called the [inaudible], the mochi Ganga, um,  in the rainforest

58
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 that I got to talk to, and I got to ask them about, you know, their relationship with technology and all that stuff. I'm never 

59
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.000
going to forget. I go up to this, this guy and I ask

60
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 him, they've just had solar lights installed, like in the main sort of area of their village. And I go up to this guy and I was like, how do you feel about having these artificial lights installed? And he, 

61
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and

62
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.000
, and I'm thinking to myself, you know, it's this pollution, right? Isn't it better to just have, you know, the stars in the sky and the moon. And he looks at me and he goes, he goes, this is good. We can see 

63
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.833
at night.

64
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.180
<v 2>He's just like, look, he was talking to just a idiot. You know, like,</v>

65
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.740
of course I'm happy.

66
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.070
<v 1>Right. Or this, and then this lady, I was like, they they'd had, you know,</v>

67
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.340
they had a, they had a pump like running water installed, basic clean water.

68
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.130
Right. So you could wash your dishes and your clothes. And I'm thinking,

69
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.050
oh my God, this is ripping them away from the natural way of life.

70
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.450
And I asked this lady, I'm like, how do you feel about the water?

71
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:22.110
And she's like, it's we don't, we don't get bacterial infection.

72
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.720
She didn't say bacterial infections. She was like, we don't get sick anymore.

73
00:04:24.721 --> 00:04:28.440
From the water that we're drinking from the river. I was like, oh,

74
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:32.130
and she's just looking at me like, who, like, why, why is he asking me this?

75
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:32.821
Right. And meanwhile,

76
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:36.000
I'm coming from this place where everyone wants to get closer to nature. Right.

77
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:37.750
Because we have been alienated from it. And,

78
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.220
and I'm asking from the perspective of someone who thinks it just must be

79
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:46.110
paradise living so close to nature. And she's like, no, we want the, we,

80
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.900
we, we wanna be able to wash our clothes and have lights on at night.

81
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.530
<v 2>You know? And I was like right there. Um.</v>

82
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.570
<v 1>And I'm talking to the shaman in the village, don't Alberta. Right.</v>

83
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.700
And he's talking to, he's like, you know, it's true.

84
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:59.910
That technology is messing up the world. We've got climate change. We've got,

85
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:02.430
you know, all these species are going extinct and he goes on and on. Right.

86
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:06.090
It's, he's very close to nature. Very, very wise, man.

87
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.950
He's got a cell phone also. Right. And I'm like, well,

88
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.020
so technology ban. He's like, he's, he's like, yes. Well, yes, yes. And no,

89
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.153
he's on Tinder.

90
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.650
<v 2>Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's what he's really doing. He didn't tell me.</v>

91
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.950
<v 1>But that's, I, I want people,</v>

92
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.050
I just want people to understand that there just aren't any easy categories you

93
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:32.400
can use to divide up the world into good and bad.

94
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.800
And now that people now that organized religion is sort of,

95
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:36.780
the sphere of authority is shrinking. Right?

96
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:38.490
You don't go to your priest to find out what to eat.

97
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.300
You don't go to your priest to find out how to cure your disease.

98
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.210
Now that that authority is shrinking.

99
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.500
I think people are looking to other similar kinds of authority.

100
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:51.180
And so they're like, okay, I can't go to my priest,

101
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.740
but if I'm walking through the store,

102
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.010
what sort of criteria can I use to the world up

103
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.510
easily into good and evil, clean and unclean.

104
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.950
Oh, my king makes.

105
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.550
<v 0>Mistress lie at his feet and make her his, what does it say.</v>

106
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.140
<v 3>As he makes our hedges? What does it say? There it's from the sun, but it's.</v>

107
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.360
<v 2>Official. That was when she was the official.</v>

108
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.830
<v 0>Concubine, uh, attended by his wildly. They were wife in all capitals.</v>

109
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.900
But Denny demoted her. This is, this is when she became the official concubine.

110
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.591
And by the way,

111
00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:28.010
I think that was the first time anybody had an official concubine,

112
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:28.970
like a hundred years.

113
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.380
<v 3>That's that's the that's. This is the flashy.</v>

114
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.600
<v 2>I don't let her hope. I don't let her. Oh, I love you. Look.</v>

115
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.670
Oh, shame that in front of everybody look lie down at his feet.

116
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.580
Look, you. It's weird.

117
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.710
It's like the keys only see us. You see that's bonkers.

118
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.450
<v 0>The only, but like, everyone else is just kind of normal. There.</v>

119
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.220
<v 3>Is not scaring his wife here. She the same thing.</v>

120
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.240
<v 0>Oh, the wife had do the same. Wow. And she's pouring tea on her head.</v>

121
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:05.074
What is that?

122
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.850
<v 3>And other people's laying down. Are they cleaning very odd,</v>

123
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.280
a good for him. They seem to love him though. He used to be the,

124
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.600
she see you as a former. She was a soldier, body guard, former body guard.

125
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.340
Okay. You take that weird hat off and come live with.

126
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.620
<v 2>That's a microphone. That's this?</v>

127
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.070
That's this take that hat off.

128
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.890
<v 3>Stop chatting that stuff. Let's go have some tape.</v>

129
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.670
<v 0>I did enjoy Thailand though. I enjoyed it a lot.</v>

130
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.310
<v 3>A good time. Yeah. Um,</v>

131
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.890
I went back last year. Did you do the same thing? Who is that?

132
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:58.750
Just for a little bit, not the what's going on there. Crap. Tap. What is this?

133
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.700
<v 0>The Monarch even threatened to Sue Facebook over the startling shots taken in</v>

134
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:06.730
2016 by a passer-by who recognize the king?

135
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.960
<v 3>Yeah. Oh, that's the king yoga class. Wait a minute.</v>

136
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.500
Cell cycle. Well, she, she has to wear the crazy.

137
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.230
<v 2>Hat and he was in Munich. Oh.</v>

138
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.790
<v 3>He's kicking it. Okay. Yeah. That law's over there.</v>

139
00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:23.710
So people,

140
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.780
I saw something about someone got put in jail for liking a post

141
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:33.670
making fun of the King's dog. Yeah. I saw that too. Just.

142
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.730
<v 0>So that's just how he likes to rock it.</v>

143
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.080
He likes a tank tops that show his belly button. That's cool.

144
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.650
<v 3>It's cultural. It's king. I'm.</v>

145
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:51.340
<v 2>The king. He's the king. I was the king of Thailand. I dressed like that too.</v>

146
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.893
you going to do.

147
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.530
<v 4>It's actually two things. Uh, about 10 years ago, 11 years ago,</v>

148
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:01.530
I had this really weird experience. I was in San Francisco.

149
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.930
It's a lot of breath, work, yoga stuff going on there.

150
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.890
And I kept getting pneumonia. I surf a lot at,

151
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.930
at ocean beach and I thought that that was the reason.

152
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.160
So I kept getting bronchitis pneumonia year after year, it just kept happening.

153
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:18.840
So a doctor, friend of mine suggested a breathing class might help.

154
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.060
I didn't know much about this, but went down,

155
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:25.200
signed up and was sitting in the corner of this studio.

156
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.940
Cold room legs crossed breathing in this rhythmic pattern,

157
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.480
nothing crazy just, and then really slow.

158
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.890
And I sweated through my t-shirt through my socks.

159
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.860
My hair was sopping, wet, sweat all over my face.

160
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.390
So I went back to her and I said, what happened? Like you're a doctor.

161
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.380
You should know this. And she said, oh, you must have had a fever.

162
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.160
Or the room must have been too hot. So she had no idea,

163
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.490
but I didn't know what to do with that story. So I just kind of filed it away.

164
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.790
Forgot about it for a number of years until I met some free divers.

165
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:04.920
These are people who have through the power of will enabled themselves to

166
00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:07.290
hold their breath for 6, 7,

167
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.190
8 minutes at a time and dive to depths far below what any scientists thought

168
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:12.900
possible. So I thought, wow,

169
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.110
there's something in breathing here that I don't know about.

170
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:19.340
And I figured other people might not know about as well. Uh.

171
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.030
<v 0>That's, that's, that's really interesting, you know, um,</v>

172
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.140
I've known a bunch of free divers and, uh, I've known a bunch of, uh,

173
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.220
jiu-jitsu people that got really into yoga primarily because of Hicks and Gracie

174
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.700
Hixon, Gracie, do you know who he is? Yeah, famous. Uh,

175
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:37.520
probably the most famous of the, of the,

176
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.930
like the classic jiu-jitsu people he's known as being the very best.

177
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.930
He was like one of the, uh, original,

178
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:47.390
real pioneers of jujitsu in America as well.

179
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.830
And there's this documentary on him called choke. Have you seen it? I have not.

180
00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:55.070
No, it's really fascinating. This documentary,

181
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:59.960
he's doing all this crazy stomach breath stuff, the yoga stuff, you know,

182
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.350
cause he's,

183
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.350
he's really into yoga as well for flexibility and balance and all those

184
00:11:03.351 --> 00:11:07.490
different things. And he was probably the first guy to introduce yoga,

185
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.840
to jujitsu as well. But, um, him and his son,

186
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.640
who's also a world champion in jujitsu,

187
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.950
just stressed constantly that it's all about the breath and that breathing

188
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.120
is it's everything that it's everything for. Jiu-jitsu,

189
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:25.880
it's everything for martial arts, it's everything for your mindset.

190
00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.680
<v 4>You're going to find that the foundation of so many different sports,</v>

191
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.570
I think a lot of that has been forgotten.

192
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.710
I know that coaches in the fifties used to have their runners take a big

193
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.020
mouthful of water, run around the track,

194
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.740
and then they'd have to spit out that same amount of water into a cup to force

195
00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:44.960
them to breathe through their nose, to force them,

196
00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:48.710
to move their diaphragms up and down a little more because breathing is so

197
00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:51.530
essential to the recovery, their endurance and their performance.
