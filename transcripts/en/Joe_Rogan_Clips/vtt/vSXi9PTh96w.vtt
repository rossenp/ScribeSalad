00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.750
when the first day you actually got up there,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.330
was that the first time you had ever been in space?

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.260
<v 1>On my first mission. Yeah, the first, yeah, it was first time in space.</v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:14.460
So your first view.

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.450
<v 0>Of the earth from above.</v>

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.320
<v 1>What's that right there. Yeah. He's not like, wow, well,</v>

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.440
I didn't see it right away. Cause I was in the mid deck,

9
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.460
the downstairs of the shuttle and there's only one window down there and it's in

10
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.080
a corner. Okay.

11
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:32.190
So it's in a hatch and it's like the size of a dinner plate and

12
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.950
I was up there. You got a lot of work to do when you,

13
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.990
as soon as you get up there. So I'm working like crazy.

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.550
And after about 30 minutes,

15
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.620
I see this pale blue glow come from that window. And I'm like,

16
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.280
that's the earth? You know, I should have a look at that.

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.050
And I was super excited for this, you know, so I wanted to be ready. So I pause,

18
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:55.320
I closed my eyes, I'd meditated, you know, call it whatever you want.

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.880
I just got ready. And when I felt like I was ready,

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.100
I floated up to that window and I opened up my eyes and I gazed

21
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:09.120
out for the very first time at the earth from space.

22
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.570
And what that felt like is, is really,

23
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:15.390
really hard to describe in words.

24
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.250
But if I had to pick one word to describe what it was feeling at that moment,

25
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.200
it would be man, really?

26
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.160
<v 0>Man.</v>

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.340
<v 1>Just man, just man. I mean, it was all right. It was pretty,</v>

28
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.930
it had a lot like those earth colors, like blues and greens. Right. But man,

29
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.190
we've all seen pictures of the earth from space. Okay. I mean,

30
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.930
we got like HD video coming down from space now where it's just spectacular.

31
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:45.930
You could see stuff in that video that you can't even see with your own eyes.

32
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.750
Like, uh, like the Aurora and all that.

33
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.210
And I'm sure like John Glenn and like Yuri, Gagarin had no idea what to expect.

34
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:57.090
And so when they looked out and they saw the earth, they freaked out, you know,

35
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.780
and it, and it was amazing and it was beautiful, but it was,

36
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.870
it was underwhelming. I guess my expectations are so high.

37
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.680
Like I felt like there should be like some heavenly choir and that we should all

38
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.810
hold hands and sing kumbaya.

39
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.200
<v 0>Yeah. Most people that have done it.</v>

40
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.110
They talk about this realization that you like,

41
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.700
this inescapable realization that we're all on this thing together

42
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.830
and that all these boundaries of civilizations and cultures and

43
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:28.440
countries and continents are all nonsense.

44
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.420
We're really just all in this one thing together.

45
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.820
<v 1>Yeah. They call that the overview effect.</v>

46
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.210
And a lot of guys come back and talk about that and they really feel it.

47
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:39.240
And they talk about a world without borders and you know,

48
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.640
and it's a beautiful sentiment. And I, and I don't,

49
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.750
I don't want to knock that in any way because it's like,

50
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.280
like really what'd you expect this?

51
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.730
You expect to look down and see like dotted lines between trees. You know,

52
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.010
really like, uh, you know, I guess you do, you,

53
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.500
it's inescapable when you look down and you see the planet and you realize that

54
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:06.730
we're all in the same boat, you know, but, uh,

55
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.320
that didn't strike me as a,

56
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:12.550
as a sudden realization because I think it was because I knew that before I went

57
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.081
it,

58
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:18.040
you shouldn't have to go and strap into a rocket and blast off and look at Derek

59
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:20.560
and know that basically we're all human beings. I think. I mean,

60
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:25.360
I think the things that unite us are so much stronger and more important than

61
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:27.730
the, than the crazy little things that divide us,

62
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:32.560
like race or sex or nationality or politics or whatever. Um,

63
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.130
and, and you, at the end of the day, we have this one home and,

64
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:39.640
and we're all stuck here in it together.

65
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.920
So I had that strong knowledge before I

66
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.860
went. And maybe that's why when I looked down, I'm like, yeah, there it is.

67
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.310
Okay. I get it. But it wasn't like all of a sudden,

68
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.200
like the shade was pulled back and there was like suddenly a

69
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:58.210
new realization about life.

70
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.920
<v 0>Is there one place that's the spot on the space station to get the view where</v>

71
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:04.000
you really get a big window.

72
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.670
<v 1>There's a huge window, uh,</v>

73
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.220
called a coupla that wasn't there in my first mission,

74
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.420
but it was there my second mission.

75
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.540
So I got to see it the second time I added a window. Yeah.

76
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.890
It's like, Hmm, let's get the saws all and put that.

77
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.130
<v 0>How do you add a window to the space station?</v>

78
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.600
<v 1>You just, you know, get the, now it's, uh, they added a whole module.</v>

79
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.990
And then I had had this coupla, which is like a, is.

80
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.823
<v 0>That it right there.</v>

81
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.800
<v 1>Though? You're looking through it. That's exactly it. Yeah. Wow.</v>

82
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.780
<v 0>So this was pretty.</v>

83
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.730
<v 1>Tight. It's like a, it's a dome.</v>

84
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.590
And so you get the full 360 view and it's spectacular. Wow.

85
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.140
And we tell the guys that don't get to do a spacewalk,

86
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.150
that this view is just as good as doing a space walk, but it's.

87
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.080
<v 0>Not, it's not.</v>

88
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.630
<v 1>It's not, but don't tell them because it, it makes them feel better.</v>

89
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.650
<v 0>Listen, what is the space walk like?</v>

90
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.360
<v 1>Oh man. Well,</v>

91
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:02.650
first I got to tell you that the likelihood of me doing a spacewalk was like

92
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.310
slim to none. Uh, w when I first got there,

93
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.910
they tell you that when you're interviewing to become an astronaut to go talk to

94
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.140
some of the other astronauts.

95
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.610
And so I went in there and we had this presentation about space walking,

96
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:18.070
and it seemed like to be the, like the ultimate experience,

97
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.880
just an incredible thing. And I wanted to do it bad.

98
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.710
So I went, I'm talking to this one. Astronaut is a pretty tall guy. Um,

99
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.640
those are the can't tell from the podcast. I'm, I'm five, four. Okay.

100
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:34.030
So I'm not like, not like a real towering individual,

101
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.040
little vertically challenged, I guess.

102
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.190
And I'm talking to this real tall astronaut. And I said, you know,

103
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.340
just heard about the spacewalk. It sounds awesome.

104
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.260
I wa I I've been living in California. I've been doing like some rock climbing,

105
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.230
some scuba diving, maybe that make me a good candidate to do a spacewalk.

106
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.370
And this tall astronaut looked at me like right in the eye.

107
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.780
And he laughed in my face. He said,

108
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.370
what are you four foot? What, how rude?

109
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.880
I know my, my first thought was, you know,

110
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.020
I thought astronauts was supposed to be polite. And this guy like,

111
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.010
was not being nice, but he was, he was actually just being brutally honest,

112
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.560
you know, it was kind of tough love. And he was like, listen,

113
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.580
the suit is one size fits all. You're going to get in that thing.

114
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.160
And it's going to swallow you up and you're not gonna be able to do anything.

115
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:28.490
You're going to be useless. So this is an impossible forget about it.

116
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.840
So I was kind of off, but, uh, but I wasn't gonna let this guy stop me. Right.

117
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.930
So I get there, I got the job and I go down for my first training exercise,

118
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.520
which was in this huge pool. We got in Houston and it's like, uh,

119
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.450
it's a hundred feet wide, 200 feet long, 40 feet deep.

120
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.940
And we could fit like most of the space station in there.

121
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.360
And they get a crane that comes by, they put you in a suit which weighs,

122
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.700
you know, something like 175 pounds and stuff. And then in addition, you,

123
00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.563
you're in a two,

124
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.200
it picks you up and they plop you in the water and you float around.

125
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.390
And it's kind of like being up in space. And that's how we train.

126
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.380
So get down there as my first, very first exercise.

127
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.300
And I could tell in the first five minutes of this training exercise, that big,

128
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.450
tall astronaut that laughed in my face was right.

129
00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.380
I was not, I was failing. I was, I was not doing well. I was, uh,

130
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.980
I was screwing up. I was like, it just, wasn't going, well, why do they.

131
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.900
<v 0>Make a one size fits all suit? It.</v>

132
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.760
<v 1>Seems they have the ability to alter the arms and the legs a little</v>

133
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:39.470
bit. And they have, um, it's actually three different size, upper torsos.

134
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.200
There's a, there's a medium, a large and an extra large,

135
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:43.940
but that said it's limited.

136
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:46.730
And because of cost a lot of money to make different sizes.

137
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.100
So there's only the gloves that can tailor.

138
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.600
Cause that's actually the most important thing. But, um, I'm getting my bucket,

139
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.570
you know, and I, and I got a needs improvement,

140
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.040
which is a NASA nice way of saying you failed. Right. But I,

141
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.430
I wasn't ready to give up. I went and, uh,

142
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.700
I knew I was going to need help. So I talked to, um,

143
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.910
the people that make the suit and it did some of those things. So they, like,

144
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:13.310
they shorten up the arms, they fixed it up a little bit for me.

145
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.580
And then I talked to the, the trainers and we said, okay, yeah,

146
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.330
we gotta think outside the box here. If we give you the standard procedure,

147
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:21.770
you're going to be at a disadvantage,

148
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.280
but maybe we change your body positions instead of going straight onto the work

149
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.850
site. Maybe we come at the worksite from the size to get more, reach that way.

150
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:31.880
And we started working at it and we got better and better.

151
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.480
And the end of the story is that, uh, I got to,

152
00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:39.590
eventually I got the highest possible qualification to do the most complicated

153
00:08:39.591 --> 00:08:43.520
spacewalks we do. And I ended up doing three different spacewalks.

154
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.560
And of course my career and a big tall guy that laughed in my face.

155
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.353
It didn't get to do any.

156
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.010
<v 0>Yeah. It's your gift for talking, sir. Look at you out there.</v>

157
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.730
<v 1>Yeah. That's.</v>

158
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.920
<v 0>Me now. What is that feeling like?</v>

159
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.020
Because it's got to feel insane when you're strapped to a space

160
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:08.160
station that's floating around and you're, you're just hanging by a cord.

161
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.870
Yeah.

162
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.080
<v 1>Well,</v>

163
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.710
you're holding on tight and then you do have that safety tether that you say

164
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:16.020
there and, and, uh, uh, you know,

165
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.750
they can prepare you for everything except for the visual.

166
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.390
So when you like her in the pool,

167
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.600
you're staring at the pool wall and when you get up there and you see the whole

168
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:25.434
earth below you,

169
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.930
some people go out there and get like a sense of fear of falling. Um,

170
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.840
of course you, if you let go, you're not going anywhere, right?

171
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.520
The space station is moving 17,500 miles an hour. But so are you,

172
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.880
so it's kind of like doing a wink, wingwalking on an airplane,

173
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:43.830
but with no air to blow you off the wing.

174
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.850
So when you look at the space station is rock solid,

175
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.940
but you look down and some people get the fear of falling.

176
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.130
And then they hold on real tight, which is a terrible,

177
00:09:53.131 --> 00:09:57.870
terrible mistake because we call it space walking, but you're not walking.

178
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:00.060
You're, you're doing everything with your arms so you can wear.

179
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.200
<v 0>Your arms out. Exactly.</v>

180
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.410
<v 1>Uh, so now if you're you're climbing and you get like kinda,</v>

181
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.540
totally thrashed and your forearms and it,

182
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.140
now you get that claw hand and it's useless. Yeah. You can do that.

183
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:13.980
And you got like seven and a half hours to go and that's bad.

184
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.820
<v 0>So, so you're out there for seven and a half hours. Yeah.</v>

185
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.673
What if you have to pee.

186
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.140
<v 1>Diaper diaper.</v>

187
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.070
<v 0>Yeah. Poop.</v>

188
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.440
<v 1>As well. Try to avoid that. I.</v>

189
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.413
<v 0>Do your best.</v>

190
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.820
<v 1>Yeah. As a, as a scientist, I had to experiment. Right? Of course.</v>

191
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.810
So during a training exercise, I waited till the very end, just in case,

192
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:39.210
you know, and I let one go, uh,

193
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.600
right before they pulled me out of the pool one day and I resolved never,

194
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:43.560
ever to do that again.

195
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.920
<v 0>Is that number one? And number two, number two.</v>

196
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.380
<v 1>Boy, number one is no big deal.</v>

197
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.470
<v 0>What saved that project? I,</v>

198
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:54.000
I wish I could have told you what was going to happen. That's disgusting.

199
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.860
And you're doing it in the pool too.

200
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:59.850
You're not doing it in actual space space to be one of the rare people that it's

201
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:03.120
actually pooped in space. It would be very interesting.

202
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.150
<v 1>That's uh, that's, you know, we keep all these records. I don't know.</v>

203
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.360
Who's got that record. It's not me.

204
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.710
<v 0>Yeah. So you just have to let it go when you're up there. Yeah. So what, uh,</v>

205
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.150
what are you doing when you're out there?

206
00:11:15.151 --> 00:11:17.370
So if you're doing seven and a half hours worth of work.

207
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.950
<v 1>You're, you're basically doing maintenance.</v>

208
00:11:19.951 --> 00:11:23.880
So it's kind of like being a mechanic or a technician the way I describe it.

209
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.240
But the suit is like so hard. It restricts everything you do,

210
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.190
because it was blown up to about four pounds per square inch. And so even,

211
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.440
um, just closing your fists takes work because the suits like a balloon,

212
00:11:37.441 --> 00:11:41.190
it wants to stay like this. And so just closing your fingers is,

213
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.060
is takes effort. And over seven and a half hours, it gets really fatiguing.

214
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.240
You're moving your arms. Everything is, and the suit can only move.

215
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.260
Like you can't do this. Right. You can do this, maybe. So your, your,

216
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:54.760
your ability to up your shoulders is really limited.

217
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.690
So you're trying to do all this work, but you're working inside this suit.

218
00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.800
And I described it as like,

219
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:03.550
it's like trying to change the oil in your car while wearing a medieval suit of

220
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:07.070
armor. It's hard. What,

221
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.230
what kind of maintenance are you doing on the outside of the spaceship? Uh,

222
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:16.090
you know, we're cleaning the windows, getting the bugs off and like, no, we're,

223
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:19.360
uh, oh yeah. That's another, on this particular spacewalk,

224
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.170
we're assembling a robot, uh, that we took up there, but we did other things.

225
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:27.220
Like we put a new antenna on top of the space station. We, um,

226
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.960
H swapped out a bunch of batteries that were getting old, um, you know,

227
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.560
stuff like that.
