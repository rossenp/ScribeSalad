00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.720
What kind of resources are available to you when you do come back? Like how,

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.120
how do they treat people that are suffering from PTSD.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.480
<v 1>And, well, you gotta be careful with it, right? Because I mean, the,</v>

5
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:19.160
the last track you want to get on is, is all the, the pharmaceutical drugs,

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.990
right? Like the pills and so stuff. Um, and you'll get on that real quick.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.670
The VA is notorious for it. So, you know, we, what do they try to give you?

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.710
Um, I mean, I, collopin Xanax, I've been on tons of blood pressure medicine.

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.950
I mean, you go down the list. Right. And, uh, and I, I,

10
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:41.860
like, I went down that I went down that road and, and it got me nowhere.

11
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.980
Um, but now, you know, like we're, you know,

12
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.140
there's tons of nonprofits out there who are doing a lot of great stuff, uh,

13
00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:52.940
trying, trying to help out. Um, you know, we're,

14
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:54.460
withs one thing that we found out and,

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.860
and actually studies are starting to show that this helps is, uh,

16
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.690
it's called a Stella Stella gang gangum block. It's called SGB,

17
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:06.970
it's a Stella gangling block. And, um, you get a shot,

18
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.290
it goes in your neck. Um, and I'll tell you this,

19
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.490
like when I got that shot

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.960
it instantly before the needle came outta my neck,

21
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.360
Dr. Sean Mulvaney is the guy that's, that's, that's putting all this together.

22
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.430
When the needle came, came outta my neck, it instantly took me from being like,

23
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:29.070
like my whole life was downtown, New York city and rush hour traffic,

24
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.990
15 minutes late to a meeting that my life depended on to instantly

25
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:38.710
being, driving down a quiet country road with nowhere to be really instantly,

26
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.750
instantly, what is it doing? So basically what it does is,

27
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.420
is this is how it was described to me. And you have like two systems,

28
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.380
you have like your, your, your automatic nervous system,

29
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:50.500
and then you have your manual, right?

30
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:54.780
So your automatic is like your eyes blinking, breathing, things like that.

31
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.100
Your manual is like, Hey,

32
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.860
I need to reach over here and grab this bottle of water.

33
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.460
And what happens is this fight or flight gets stuck in your automated,

34
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.090
like there's no longer do you say, I recognize this as a threat.

35
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.410
And now I go into fight or flight.

36
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:11.570
So what it does is you've been in that so long that it gets put over into the,

37
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.370
the automatic side. And so what this does is it's kind of like a restart. Like,

38
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:21.170
it, it there's no nothing that lasts long in it, it, it goes in and it,

39
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.680
it basically, I think it gets on it, the sciatictic nerve,

40
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.160
and it basically gives you a restart. And it just,

41
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.320
it took away all Myx anxiety. I mean, it, it, it just, it instantly

42
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.680
like just melted it away. How long does it last? So it comes down to,

43
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.800
I mean, sometimes I get one, one a year, one every six months,

44
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.870
but comes down to,

45
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.990
do you go back and expose yourself to these chaotic situations, right? Like,

46
00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:53.990
do you go keep making bad decisions? Um, but for me, I look at it as like a,

47
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.910
it's a, it's a solution to, to, I call it the flash bang of anxiety. So like,

48
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.560
it's that flash bang that gives you the moment,

49
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.800
the separation to where now I can make decisions that I don't feel like I'm

50
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:07.760
outta control. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; now I can, I can make decisions to get,

51
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.280
get things back together.

52
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.640
<v 0>What is the actual chemical that they're using?</v>

53
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.760
<v 1>I don't know. I would have to look, he's got it. An article about it.</v>

54
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.710
<v 0>That's crazy that it's so effective of using stellat</v>

55
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.830
gangian block to treat posttraatic stress disorder. Yeah. Okay.

56
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.671
Make that a little bigger.

57
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.870
Jamie posttraumatic stress disorder develops in response to being exposed to

58
00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:32.710
extreme stress. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do. Okay.

59
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.430
The sympathetic nervous system fighttofide has been known to play a part in

60
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.220
PTSD.

61
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.700
It's believed that extra nerves of the system or grow after extreme trauma.

62
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.260
Wow. Leading to elevated levels,

63
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.220
levels of noapnephrine and adrenaline-like substance,

64
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.220
which in turn overactivates the amygdala, the fear center of the brain,

65
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.860
this chain of events, results in PTSD symptoms that may be,

66
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.740
that may persist for years. Um,

67
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.530
so a part of the sympathetic nervous system called the stellat ganggli on a

68
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:03.730
collective nerves in the neck,

69
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.210
seems to control the activation of the Amy amygdala.

70
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.210
A recent innovation offers potential and rapidly treating symptoms of PTSD for a

71
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:16.210
prolonged period of time placing an anesthetic agent on the stellat ganggliion

72
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.120
in an anesthetic procedure called the stellat gangly and block

73
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.240
can relieve the symptoms of PTSD in as little as 30 minutes. And for you,

74
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:27.080
it said just a few seconds before.

75
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.913
<v 1>The needle is out.</v>

76
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.040
<v 0>And last for years,</v>

77
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.160
the S GB reboots the sympathetic nervous system to its pre-trauma state,

78
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.880
similar to a computer reboot in the brain nor epinephrine levels are rapidly

79
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.630
reduced. And the extra nerve growth is removed. Wow.

80
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.670
SGB is an anesthetic procedure that has been performed since 1925 and is

81
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.510
considered a low risk pain procedure done under x-ray guidance. That's insane.

82
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.300
Yeah.

83
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.310
<v 1>They use a, uh,</v>

84
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.510
so Dr. Sean movaney is the guy I I've been to other doctors and he's Dr.

85
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.380
Movaney's the only guy I would go to.

86
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:06.260
Who does it the way he's got the whole procedure set up. He was a Navy seal. Um,

87
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.460
he's a doctor and, uh, he does it outta DC and, and, um, but nobody,

88
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.180
you know, most people hadn't heard of this, you know, I've never heard of this.

89
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.900
Yeah. It's yeah. And it's, um,

90
00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.250
I went in and he called me the next day and he was like, so how do you feel?

91
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.770
I said, man, I caught myself singing in the shower this morning. &lt;laugh&gt; like,

92
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:29.530
I caught myself singing in the shower. What were you singing? I don't,

93
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.770
I can't remember. But I was like, man, I caught myself singing in the shower.

94
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:36.210
Like I actually, like, I walked out there and I, and, and to me, you know,

95
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.170
I got to a point at that point, like, I,

96
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.160
I got to a low point and I just, uh,

97
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:46.560
there was nothing like, there's nothing in my life I can complain about. Like,

98
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:47.394
there's nothing I,

99
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.800
I have this country has given me a life that I could have never dreamed to ever

100
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.040
have. Um, I have no problems, zero,

101
00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.120
and I just woke up every day and I was just like,

102
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.760
I just don't wanna wake up feeling like this. And so he's like, come do this,

103
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.200
come do this. And I came out there and did it. And it, it changed.

104
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.840
It changed my whole life.

105
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.070
<v 0>That sounds infinitely better than therapy or talking through it or</v>

106
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.910
any, any other methods I've ever heard.

107
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.870
<v 1>Of? Yeah. Well, I mean, I think all that, I think you, I think all that matters.</v>

108
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.030
I think the therapy, like, if you wanna go do talk therapy, that's, that's good.

109
00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:26.190
Like you, you, you should do that.

110
00:06:26.191 --> 00:06:28.350
But I always tell people who go do talk therapy,

111
00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:31.550
like go in there with a plan of where you want your life to be like,

112
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.110
it's like going to a nutrition coach or a workout coach and,

113
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.950
and not giving them goals. Right. You know, don't go in the,

114
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.180
or just to go in there, like go in there with a plan, you know, Hey, how,

115
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:42.780
how and have them help you get to that plan. But this,

116
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.220
this is instantly just like that.

117
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.020
<v 0>That's incredible. Now, did they,</v>

118
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.220
did they try to do that in conjunction with medication?

119
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.500
Does it does a standalone thing, standalone thing.

120
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.300
<v 1>Wow. Standalone thing, you know, the only thing I do to,</v>

121
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:59.050
to help mine and my anxie is like, it, it can get bad.

122
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.130
Like I'm talking bad when.

123
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.290
<v 0>When, and when you say that, like what happens? Like what's, what's the process?</v>

124
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:10.890
<v 1>You know, I, I usually feel it building up, um, over days. Yeah. Days. Like,</v>

125
00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:15.130
it's almost like a, like, it'll come and it just builds up. And then it's like,

126
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.080
it'll, you'll have like a little, little bit of an anxiety attack or whatever.

127
00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:20.720
You'll start feeling anxiety or anxious.

128
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.560
And then that becomes your new baseline. Mm.

129
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:29.000
And then it keeps building people don't recognize it. And for a long time,

130
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.160
I used to, like, I used to drink a lot and I didn't because I didn't,

131
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:35.640
I didn't know what anxiety was. I mean, I, well, what do you mean? Like,

132
00:07:35.641 --> 00:07:38.360
this is how I feel all the time. Right. And then, you know,

133
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.670
S then what usually happens is at night, it'll just, when I go to sleep,

134
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.150
it'll just, it'll rock me. It'll rock me. I'll start throwing up.

135
00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.470
I'll be sweating. I'll be crying. Like, I mean, I'll be in the floor now.

136
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.430
Are you thinking.

137
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.630
<v 0>Things when this is happening or is it just an overwhelming sense of anxiety?</v>

138
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.750
Just, just all encompassing. I just, I.

139
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.740
<v 1>Don't know where it comes from. I mean, obviously I know where it from, but are.</v>

140
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.180
<v 0>You thinking about war where this is happening? No.</v>

141
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.460
<v 1>No. I think it just in my subconscious, I think, you know,</v>

142
00:08:05.461 --> 00:08:09.300
obviously your brain is always trying to, to like when you're asleep,

143
00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:11.580
trying to file things and process things. Right.

144
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.540
And I think that's what happens is like consciously, you know, you know,

145
00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:20.530
consciously it doesn't bother me to talk about it. Like I,

146
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.330
I went back and I was in another gun fight four days later.

147
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.651
And I mean,

148
00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:29.930
literally I was packing up all my teammates stuff and getting ready to go back

149
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.610
to fight again. And I got into another gun fight. And

150
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.810
I, I think that, you know, coming home,

151
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:39.730
your brain's still trying to process all that stuff.

152
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.520
And I think it happens to anybody. You don't have to go to war.

153
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.360
You could be in a car wreck. I mean, you look at,

154
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.920
you look at the October 1st shooting in Vegas, you know, you could,

155
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.880
you can go through anything, right. Like whatever.

156
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.160
I think it's what people are dealing with. And it's just,

157
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.800
I think that's why you see so much anxiety across the world is because of

158
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:01.080
all this desensitization, consciously,

159
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.200
and people are processing it subconsciously. Mm.

160
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.400
<v 0>That makes sense. That really makes sense that it's,</v>

161
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.360
they're taking in all this information.

162
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:13.040
They think it's not affecting them at all, but it really.

163
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:13.601
<v 1>Is. It is.</v>

164
00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:16.670
And I think it's why you see all these people feeling like their lives are outta

165
00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:20.190
control. And it's because consciously,

166
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:23.670
like we're not sitting here talking about it, like, well, yeah, yeah. You know,

167
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:25.950
I seen a car wreck the other day where, you know, so and so died or,

168
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:28.870
you know what I mean? And it's like, they're not ever processing it consciously,

169
00:09:28.871 --> 00:09:31.230
but their body will, SUBC like your body will.

170
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:34.270
I always say you can either exercise your demons or they're gonna exercise you.

171
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.300
<v 0>That's a great way to put it. What do they recommend when, when,</v>

172
00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:41.940
when you, I mean,

173
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.980
do they check on you to see if you are having anxiety or do you have to come to

174
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:48.420
them and explain it?

175
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.260
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, you, you just, you go to them.</v>

176
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.500
<v 0>Does anybody get through it without anxiety?</v>

177
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.780
<v 1>I mean, I, I like, I,</v>

178
00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.770
I would worry about the people that got through it without it. I mean, yeah,

179
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:02.410
you, you know what I mean? Right. If you can go kill people and not right,

180
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.210
right. Get through it without nightmares or anything, you know? Um, but I,

181
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.570
I think, I think some people do, uh, I mean, I think,

182
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:12.930
I think people just deal with it different ways. Right. Um, but me, you know,

183
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:15.970
like I used to drink a lot and, and, but I,

184
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.040
I was doing it not because I was an alcoholic.

185
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.520
I was doing it as a, I just, I had rather,

186
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.560
I could regulate my drinking better than I could.

187
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.760
The effects of what medicine would do to me.

188
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.160
<v 0>Now, do the Marines, have a system that they will,</v>

189
00:10:31.161 --> 00:10:33.040
they check on you and make sure you're okay.

190
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.430
Or guide you into a specific type of treatment when they know there's something

191
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:38.020
wrong.

192
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.150
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. But you know, the problem is for all these war fighters is like,</v>

193
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.830
they don't want to go talk about it or tell the Marine Corps because then

194
00:10:45.831 --> 00:10:48.710
they're, you know, you're you're or, or the military,

195
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:52.750
I'll just say military wide, you know, they, they, they look at you as well.

196
00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:54.630
Now this person can operate everybody.

197
00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:57.740
Everybody's too worried to talk about this because they're afraid of not being

198
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.574
able to do their job,

199
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.780
because they're afraid that somebody will look at them and say, oh, well,

200
00:11:01.781 --> 00:11:06.060
you got PTSD, so you don't need a gun. And it, and it's like, you know,

201
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.060
most people that have PTSD are car wreck victims.

202
00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.980
<v 0>Brilliant. Yeah. That's the biggest source.</v>

203
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.780
<v 1>Of PTSD. Yeah. You can, you can Google it.</v>

204
00:11:16.781 --> 00:11:20.730
See the biggest source of PTSD is car wreck victims. Wow.

205
00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.170
<v 0>It was probably a lot of those, right. Tons of them.</v>

206
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.553
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.770
<v 0>So when you do have an issue, how,</v>

208
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.050
how do you go from having an issue to getting treatment? What's the process?

209
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.010
<v 1>Well, you, I mean, if you, if you, if you tell your command, I mean, you know,</v>

210
00:11:38.011 --> 00:11:40.640
the there's, there's all types of resources there. I mean, you know.

211
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.760
<v 0>Um, but you have to speak out. Yeah. And.</v>

212
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.441
<v 1>That's the problem, right?</v>

213
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:46.960
That's the problem is nobody wants to talk out because, you know,

214
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.120
you start talking then, you know, how quick your job gonna be gone?

215
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.960
You know, I got out, I was out before, you know, I was out so fast after,

216
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.720
after all this happened, I was out, you know, seven or eight months afterwards.

217
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:03.400
And I didn't realize what was going on until

218
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.600
I probably never started dealing with my PTSD until 2016.

219
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.790
You know, I just, I thought this was just normal on.

220
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.850
<v 0>What made you change?</v>

221
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.410
<v 1>My, my daughters, my daughter, sailor. Um,</v>

222
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.450
I can remember the day I was in a, I was actually in the floor,

223
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.330
like just having an anxiety attack, like crazy. And I was like,

224
00:12:28.331 --> 00:12:31.410
I gotta do something. I've, I've gotta do something because my daughters,

225
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.520
they deserve the best five father possible. Like they, like,

226
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:40.520
they had no choice in coming in this world. And, you know, I might not want to,

227
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.000
I might not wanna deal with it and face it for myself, but I, I,

228
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.320
they deserve for me to wake up every single day and give them the best father

229
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.280
that, that they could possibly have. And, and that,

230
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.230
that is my responsibility to them. Is that.

231
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.270
<v 0>When you first got this shot.</v>

232
00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.750
<v 1>This block, so I ended up getting it in 2017.</v>

233
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.230
Yeah. 2017, I think. Uh, and I didn't know anything about it until,

234
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.470
you know, once I found out about it, I did. How did you find out about it?

235
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.620
Just another, another warrior that had gotten it and it worked for them.

236
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.380
Wow. And, um, I also use, so I use,

237
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:23.500
I use three methods to maintain all of it. I use the Stella gangen block,

238
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.620
which is, is kind of when it gets real bad, I'll go get that.

239
00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:29.700
That's like the whole reboot. Right. Um, for maintenance,

240
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:34.500
I usually use it's called a alpha stem. And so it goes on your ear lobes.

241
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.450
I've heard.

242
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.330
<v 0>Of that. And people quit smoking with that. Right.</v>

243
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.850
<v 1>I don't know about, I don't know about that. It's for, usually for pain,</v>

244
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:43.650
anxiety, depression. Um, but I use, I use an alpha stem and it goes,

245
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.930
I put on clipping on my ears and it, like,

246
00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.370
I usually do it every day and it just, it melts, it melts it away as well.

247
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.210
And then the last piece is, is, and this is not obviously, and, and I,

248
00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.840
our community, it's probably not the popular side of it is, is,

249
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.160
um, is using a, a pan at night, you know, before I go in.

250
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.360
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.120
<v 0>Do you CBD.</v>

252
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.960
<v 1>B D uh, so it's the, it's the, uh,</v>

253
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.280
I in Indico mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. And that, like,

254
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.350
that pretty much eliminated all my drinking. Really? Yeah.

255
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:19.923
<v 0>Why is that not popular?</v>

256
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.030
<v 1>I don't know. I think it's kinda like still like the taboo, right?</v>

257
00:14:23.031 --> 00:14:26.830
Like the town I come from, they just made alcohol legal in it. What?

258
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.990
A few years ago. &lt;laugh&gt;.

259
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.110
<v 0>What town you from.</v>

260
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.950
<v 1>Man? Columbia, Kentucky. That's crazy.</v>

261
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.260
<v 0>They just made alcohol legal. Yeah. Wow. The that's a good place to study.</v>

262
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.620
That's like an unacted tribe. &lt;laugh&gt;.

263
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.220
<v 1>Yeah. Well, you know, you look, if you, if you do, if you, if you make it legal,</v>

264
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.540
the boot Lakers will go outta business, right.

265
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.980
<v 0>Oh, okay. It Duke's a hazard style. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; that's crazy.</v>

266
00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.400
Yeah. Wow. They just made alcohol legal. Holy. So, yeah,

267
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:58.160
vapepen's outta the question. Oh yeah. Show up with a pot leaf.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.920
T-shirt they'll shoot you. Oh, oh, listen. Yeah. Yeah.

269
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.590
