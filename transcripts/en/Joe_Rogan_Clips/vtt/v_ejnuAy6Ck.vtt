00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.320
They also figured out the best way to kick people in the legs. Thai boxing,

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.560
interesting elbows, the best elbows, knees and leg.

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.060
<v 1>Kicks. Is that tie that's tired. Brazilian head that tired. Oh yeah.</v>

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.310
<v 0>Of course. The Brazilians, his jujitsu,</v>

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.060
the Brazilians figured out jujitsu and the ties figured out kickboxing.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.510
<v 1>Nah, what about Krav? But God's that any good? Sure. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:25.740
You don't hear much about crop?

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.370
<v 0>Well, it's a combination. It's a self-defense system. The, the, uh,</v>

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.080
I believe it was created for the Israeli military, but what it essentially is,

11
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.960
is the best aspects of all these different martial arts,

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.820
like a Jeet Kune DOE a good Jewish G Cuno like Bruce Lee's idea of G condo is

13
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:44.940
like you take what's useful from whatever martial art and combine them with

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.560
[inaudible] there's some of them, you know, some are more striking base.

15
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:52.440
Some are more grappling base in terms of what they teach in their classes.

16
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:57.300
But it's essentially a combination of striking arts and

17
00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:01.590
grappling arts jujitsu techniques along with karate techniques,

18
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.430
[inaudible] techniques. So they, they do, uh, they do real martial arts.

19
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.870
It's like, you see a Krav Maga expert. Like you go, oh,

20
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:13.170
well that guy is a real martial artist. It's not like watching those,

21
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.310
some of those Kung Fu people that do wacky. Like, I don't think that's real.

22
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.530
It's just noises. You're just touching the guy in the chest.

23
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.050
The guy's falling down. What they're doing is real stuff.

24
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.780
So they just combined them. Yeah.
