00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.840
<v 1>Experience. It's always hard for me at the airport. When I see like, uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.640
like a drug sniffing working dog, but it's like a yellow lab.

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm like really pet, I can't pet the yellow lab. I don't, you can, I don't.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.840
<v 0>You could ruin the dog.</v>

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.080
<v 1>I don't wanna ruin the dog and his chances at retirement, you could ruin.</v>

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.680
<v 0>It. I'm not going to, yeah. Those drugs,</v>

8
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.230
drug sniffing dogs make me nervous. Cuz I'm like, what are they looking for?

9
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.990
Not weed. That's the truth.

10
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
But you could only teach a dog to look for one thing, you know, you can't say,

11
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.150
Hey, I want the truth, the truth. You can't teach a dog. Hey,

12
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.230
I want you to look for guns and Coke. Right. It's smell like residue.

13
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.310
<v 1>Right. Do smell or.</v>

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.150
<v 0>Right, right. Do you smell gun powder? Do you smell marijuana?</v>

15
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.140
Like what do you smell? Like what do you, what do you train? You train the.

16
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.060
<v 1>Dog to smell heroin. You find, uh, mushrooms. Bring them back. Right? Find.</v>

17
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.893
<v 0>Them find 'em you little.</v>

18
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.580
<v 1>Yeah, definitely the heroin. Cause I think you can make more things out of that.</v>

19
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.180
<v 0>Uh, well it's one that kills you.</v>

20
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.020
It's one of the reasons why they should look out for heroin. Fentanyl.

21
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.740
If they could smell fentanyl, that would be nice. They could smell anything.

22
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.540
But.

23
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.220
<v 1>I feel like fentanyl is it's more local. Oh actually, no,</v>

24
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.610
I don't know what I'm talking about. I feel like with prescription drugs,

25
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:07.210
like that's more like it ravages a community and I don't,

26
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.570
when I think of like airplanes,

27
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.290
I think like weight being pushed through from other countries. Mm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

28
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.090
But I don't know.

29
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.810
<v 0>I think it's all things, meth. It's everything.</v>

30
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.250
It's the really up part about it is.

31
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.050
It's almost like what we were talking about with football.

32
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.480
That football be safer. If there was no helmets, it doesn't make sense.

33
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.360
And drugs would be.

34
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.320
<v 1>Safer if they wouldregulate.</v>

35
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.240
<v 0>It, we would safer if they were.</v>

36
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.120
<v 1>Legal. I feel that way about prostitution. Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.520
And I'm gonna actually broach this here. I was gonna write a joke about it.

38
00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:35.360
I'm just gonna say it. I believe a state issued. If you apply for funding,

39
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.481
uh, for support,

40
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:39.400
if you're going to schoolhmm like loan or the state's paying for you to go to

41
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:40.234
school, you get a scholarship.

42
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.510
You should also be able to apply for a state issued prostitute.

43
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.070
If you are a little socially awkward,

44
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.230
maybe you haven't had sex because men get weird.

45
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.150
If they haven't been made privy to the way a woman is,

46
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.750
or they haven't had sex and you're going to college, let's get you a prostitute.

47
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.110
Let's get you having sex twice a week. So you, you're not afraid of women.

48
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.750
Let's get you a little less weird. Let's fund a prostitute.

49
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.020
<v 0>Well, I think if it didn't have the social stigma behind it,</v>

50
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:08.420
there's a lot of people that would choose it overworking at Wendy's great.

51
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.180
Did a lot of people that choose it. But we long as an it's a choice.

52
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.540
The social stigma is that there's something wrong with it. Right's because.

53
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.420
<v 1>It's a woman saying I wanna do this with my body. That's what's upsetting that.</v>

54
00:02:19.421 --> 00:02:20.020
It's sort of.

55
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.530
<v 0>That, but it's also, well in this country, it's also connected to sex slavery.</v>

56
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.090
We think of it as like, if someone is doing that, then maybe,

57
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.490
maybe they're a sex slave. Like maybe there's someone who's. I think.

58
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.690
<v 1>That's less on people's radars.</v>

59
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:36.650
And it more has to do with the puritaanical idea of there's.

60
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.610
<v 0>A little bit of that. But I mean,</v>

61
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:41.130
that was one of the things that they were accusing Robert Craft of you remember

62
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.851
Robert Craft?

63
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.920
Mmhmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who's the guy who owns the craft or it's craft, right?

64
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.600
He's the guy who owned the new England Patriots.

65
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:47.960
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; he went to a

66
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:50.280
massage power in the game of happy ending. And then the next thing you know,

67
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:53.480
they, you know, they arrested him and told him that there's a video of it.

68
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:54.480
Right. And they were, you know,

69
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.480
they're trying to get him to plead guilty and all this,

70
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.000
all this different that was going on to a guy who's like insanely insanely

71
00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.240
wealthy, who just was going there to get jerked off.

72
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:05.400
But one of the things they said was that it was, uh,

73
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.360
that he was participating somehow in sex trafficking.

74
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.320
And so they were accusing him of that. They were,

75
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.000
that was a big part of what the police were saying. Well,

76
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:17.520
it turned out that none of the girls that worked there were sex traffickers.

77
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:20.430
They're just prostitute. And the woman that did it to him,

78
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.790
she was like 40 years old. But none of.

79
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.750
<v 1>This would've happened. If it was legal, none of it wouldve.</v>

80
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.310
<v 0>Regulated was legal, but it's also, they, they were using that term to,</v>

81
00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:32.030
they were accusing him of this thing and using that term, like to, to brand him,

82
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.350
wait.

83
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.470
<v 1>Are you telling me that to shame him?</v>

84
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:35.550
There was a news story where they used a buzzword.

85
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.260
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. It is a buzzword. Right. But it's a buzzword. That's,</v>

86
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.980
it's very specific in terms of like the difference in the consequences that you

87
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:50.380
would want someone to face, whether they just went there to get jerked off.

88
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Sure. Or they participated in sex slavery. Right. You're.

89
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.820
<v 1>Not a part of a ring. Right? I mean, you are cuz the ring ends with you.</v>

90
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.740
So because there's a demand for it. There is a supply.

91
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.570
So that is by and large part, part of the issue. Um, and I say this,

92
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:03.010
not knowing a ton about sex slavery,

93
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.090
but I do know that if you take away the stigma and you can normalize things very

94
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:08.810
quickly, weed is a great example. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right. Yeah.

95
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.651
You could do that.

96
00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:12.650
And even we've done this with women and bodies and the way that we look at

97
00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:14.970
people who are overweight and we look at people with different things.

98
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.490
Like we are getting to a place where it's less of a thing.

99
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.760
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I think you could do that with prostitution. I so too. And,

100
00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.880
and it's fine. And look at it as like, this is her choice. Yeah. And if there,

101
00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.960
if there wasn't an exceptional exorbitant demand for it, it wouldn't be a thing.

102
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.400
<v 0>Yeah. It's just, you,</v>

103
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.000
you can't tell people what to do with their bodies any other way,

104
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.800
except when money's involved. Yeah. That's why I have a problem with it. Except.

105
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.633
<v 1>When taxes are.</v>

106
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.550
<v 0>Involved. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's not even that it's, it's,</v>

107
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.950
it's a societal position, right? Like if we were gonna vote on it,

108
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.870
most people would vote on no prostitution cuz they don't want their daughter or

109
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:52.470
their sister, their mother to be a prostitute. That's how that's a or, or them,

110
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.190
they don't wanna be a prostitute. That's why they would vote on it.

111
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.310
But it's the only thing that's completely legal to do.

112
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.060
Like not only that, but it's what sells everything.

113
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.700
When Brandon pit is selling cologne, he's selling, I'm a hot man. If you,

114
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.260
if you get my cologne, you might get some pusy I'm looking right.

115
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.460
<v 1>At that mouth. Yes. Look.</v>

116
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.820
<v 0>At him. It's beautiful. I, I agree. But that is the thing that is,</v>

117
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.060
is up about all this.

118
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:20.860
Like a woman can have sex with as many people as she wants for free

119
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.970
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; &lt;affirmative&gt; she charges then all of a sudden itscr. But,

120
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.530
but, but you can charge for a rub. Like what the? Like why.

121
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.610
<v 1>Is it you're like I'm getting off either way, but.</v>

122
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.450
<v 0>It doesn't just doesn't make any sense. It's I agree with you. It's silly. It's.</v>

123
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.011
<v 1>Restrictive.</v>

124
00:05:34.011 --> 00:05:37.330
I think when it comes to the idea of a woman taking control of her own body,

125
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.010
no taxes being paid, uh,

126
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.400
and the idea of someone and being a because of our puritanical roots in this

127
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:46.920
country, all those things combined make it a volatile topic.

128
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.080
But at the end of the day, if she's gonna make money,

129
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:53.080
that's gonna go back into your society. That's gonna be put to good use.

130
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.800
It's gonna be tax. It's gonna be in your community. What do you care?

131
00:05:56.801 --> 00:05:58.040
What she's doing behind closed doors.

132
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.640
If it's safe and it's regulated just like weed,

133
00:06:00.641 --> 00:06:05.480
all of a sudden there's standards. Now there's a way to, uh, sanitize this.

134
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.160
<v 0>Yeah, I think so. And they did it in Australia. They did it in Nevada. Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.000
And parts of it, parts of it. Right. Um, but in Australia they have, I mean,

136
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:16.320
it's full on there. You can do whatever you want. They have, they have brothels.

137
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.990
But I think it's also one of the things that we're conditioned to have a

138
00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:22.950
perspective on it, similar to the drug issue. Yeah.

139
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:27.710
Like I don't want my friends or my daughters or my mother or

140
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.150
anyone I know to be a prostitute. Right. So we have this,

141
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.350
like this position on it. I also don't want them to do Coke,

142
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.950
but I don't think Coke should be illegal. I,

143
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.860
I don't think anybody should be able to lock you in a cage cuz you want to get

144
00:06:39.861 --> 00:06:41.060
cokeed up. Imagine if.

145
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.820
<v 1>It were legal, how many less people would be dying just in a drug trade.</v>

146
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.360
<v 0>Yes.</v>

147
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.980
And how many more people would be aware Uh-huh of how much you can do because

148
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:50.460
you'd get actual Coke, right.

149
00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:53.420
With a lot of the you're getting is being cut because you're getting it.

150
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:55.940
You're buying it from people that aren't companies. Right.

151
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.290
If you're gonna buy something, Nabisco, Nabisco was selling Coke,

152
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.770
put the ingredients on it. It'd be a hundred percent Coke.

153
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.050
You'd be able to get real Coke.

154
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.650
<v 1>Real Coke. Nebisco flavored cocaine. Yeah. Moreover, I mean, look in Europe.</v>

155
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.570
The way that they are with alcohol. Like Italy, for example. Yes.

156
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:12.210
Kids have wine when they're little and sure. There's alcoholics there,

157
00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:15.290
but it's way less. It's less of like a rum Springer freak out.

158
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.490
When you are able to do something, that's.

159
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.960
<v 0>A great way to put, put it a rum Springer, freak out that. Yeah.</v>

160
00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.160
What she's talking about, if you don't know, is the Amish have a thing?

161
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.280
It's when they turn like 18, right? Something like that. They get to go ham.

162
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.560
They get to do whatever they want. They could watch TV.

163
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.800
They could drink smoke pot and.

164
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.840
And they go crazy for a short period of time. And then at the end of that time,

165
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.390
they can either leave the church forever or come back.

166
00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:40.390
And most of them come back.

167
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.510
<v 1>Right. Because it's all, you know, also you're.</v>

168
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.390
<v 0>Probably so hung over. Like Jesus tries to someone.</v>

169
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:45.470
<v 1>Make me some OCAS.</v>

170
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.350
<v 0>Get me back. Cutting logs. &lt;laugh&gt; this.</v>

171
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.230
<v 1>Is real workout. I don't have any sports injuries.</v>

172
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.910
I don't think I ever played a.

173
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.790
<v 0>Sport. You have no sports injuries at all? No.</v>

174
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.740
<v 1>I feel like a lot of girls like get knee surgery in high and stuff like thathmm</v>

175
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:01.180
maybe I just wasn't playing hard enough.

176
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.380
<v 0>You don't have you. You never played any sports. I played sports.</v>

177
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.020
<v 1>I just don't have any. I played lacrosse.</v>

178
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.540
<v 0>Oh, you were so white. So white. That's so white.</v>

179
00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:12.100
It's such a private school thing. That's the whitest sport of all time.

180
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.980
I played lacrosse in Texas. So a rough sport though. Well,

181
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.980
people don't know people, crack people with those sticks. What.

182
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.170
<v 1>I lacked in genuine enough athletic ability. I made up for an aggression. Wow.</v>

183
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:24.450
So there's nothing worse than an athlete. That's not good,

184
00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:25.650
but they're very aggressive.

185
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.490
<v 0>Do you think that flavored you as a human? Maybe? Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.323
<v 1>Because it wasn't cute.</v>

187
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.570
<v 0>Well, it's not cute. Well,</v>

188
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.650
I think of girls playing thelacrossees like hair all over the place and in this

189
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:37.050
face. Eh, in skirts.

190
00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.930
<v 1>Yeah. It's I got ejected from a game one time.</v>

191
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.640
I'm so hard that I wasn't allowed to sit with my team.

192
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.960
Like what's a shade beyond a red card, like a black beating heart.

193
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.280
What did you do? I hit a girl with a stick. Yeah. With, with my car.

194
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.340
&lt;laugh&gt; the parking.

195
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.960
<v 0>Lot. I mean, I thought made your hand or something.</v>

196
00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.281
<v 1>No,</v>

197
00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.280
I drove my stick and it was unlawful and they made me sit next to my parents in

198
00:09:00.281 --> 00:09:02.640
the stands. And it was so humiliating.

199
00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.960
<v 0>Good for you. I wanna go to pat you on the head. Good. Our team was pretty good.</v>

200
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.040
<v 1>Those up. I played defense though. So I wasn't really.</v>

201
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.320
<v 0>A part of this. I had a buddy of mine that played lacrosse in high school and I,</v>

202
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.510
I remember he was like telling me I was crazy to, and I was like,

203
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.110
what's to stop someone from hitting you with those sticks. Yeah.

204
00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.150
You guys are running into each other, man. I go, I'm like don't kid yourself.

205
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:22.790
I'm like, you're doing something violent.

206
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:27.190
You're just doing something violent under this weird pretend thing. Yeah. Uh,

207
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:27.430
under.

208
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.310
<v 1>Pretend civility. Yeah. Boys get pads and helmets and girls do not. What.</v>

209
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.150
<v 0>The is that all about? Because girls aren't.</v>

210
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.660
<v 1>Supposed to. I mean, you're it physical sport,</v>

211
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.020
but boys it's like football with sticks. Did you.

212
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.300
<v 0>Like just pick it up like a baseball bat and crack this chick in the head?</v>

213
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.020
Like how'd.

214
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.020
<v 1>You do if you put it over your head and come down, that's not okay. Right.</v>

215
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.300
My nickname was, uh, I think it was like, oh butcher. Because my coach was like,

216
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:53.340
you hold your stick and you come down so hard because you know what?

217
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.970
It comes out on the field and women are not allowed to be

218
00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.010
aggressive. It's a thing where it's like on sports day, like, you know,

219
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:02.550
wear skirt,

220
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.090
be ladies represent and you got dudes just running around ripping people's heads

221
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.490
off raping villages. And one girl takes her shirt off at a world cup game.

222
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.570
Meghan rapinoino does something. That's like, whoa, scandalous and it's. Well.

223
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.640
<v 0>I just got back from the UFC. There was three women fight its this weekend.</v>

224
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.360
That's a different thing. Pretty intense.

225
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.360
<v 1>And that's okay now, but for other sports,</v>

226
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.400
it's always expected that women conduct yourselves like ladies, right? Yeah.

227
00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:26.040
And I'm like, that's not what it'.

228
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.873
<v 0>Sport. It's sport.</v>

229
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.400
It has nothing to do with the real world it has to do with trying to win.

230
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.560
But it, it also has, I mean, you, you violated the rules though. There,

231
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.560
the rules broke the rules.

232
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.870
Cause otherwise like if everybody was just swinging at each other would be a

233
00:10:37.871 --> 00:10:39.270
tip. Totally different sport. Not.

234
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.350
<v 1>I was not great. And I own that. What.</v>

235
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:45.310
<v 0>Did you do? Did you just swing it over your head? I probably just.</v>

236
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:49.670
<v 1>Came down a hammer. Yeah. Like if you have too much, uh, like torque built up,</v>

237
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.950
like I had and I hit and you're not supposed to you, you hit her on the head.

238
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.350
You can give a tap, a tap mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to get the ball out of the thing.

239
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.580
I didn't hit in the head. I think I, I probably hit her stick so hard. I don't.

240
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.940
<v 0>Remember. My friend was telling me, people get concussions. High,</v>

241
00:11:02.941 --> 00:11:03.420
high school was only.

242
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.253
<v 1>Like two years ago.</v>

243
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.460
<v 0>I'm like how many people, you know,</v>

244
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:08.020
you've been getting concussions from lacrosse. And he was like a lot.

245
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.380
And I was like, bro, you're in a violent sport. It's a violent sport.

246
00:11:11.381 --> 00:11:12.660
It's sport a violent sport.

247
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.940
And it's oddly not a professional sport because I think it would be an exciting

248
00:11:16.941 --> 00:11:17.890
profess it's.

249
00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.690
<v 1>A professional sport, but it's not, it's not a widely received one.</v>

250
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:23.690
<v 0>You're not gonna make any money playing lacrosse. It'ss bowling. Right. It's.</v>

251
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.930
<v 1>Not a, you know, good luck. But they do have it.</v>

252
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.130
I have a friend that plays professionally and I don't know who's watching it,

253
00:11:28.131 --> 00:11:28.330
but.

254
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.091
<v 0>They do it. Right.</v>

255
00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:31.530
But wouldn't you think that it would be like hockey or like rugby, rugby,

256
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:35.290
like a legit? Yeah. Rugby should be our football. That's what I think.

257
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.010
I think it would be better. The athletes less concussion.

258
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.320
They had less concussions back when they were playing with those little leather

259
00:11:41.321 --> 00:11:42.800
helmets. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and little tiny pads.

260
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.640
Cuz you just couldn't do what these guys are doing. You're just.

261
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.240
<v 1>Smashing into smash with your head as a battering ring.</v>
