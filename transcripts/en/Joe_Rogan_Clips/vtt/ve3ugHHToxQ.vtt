00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Your book, the chemical.</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.760
<v 1>Age, uh, touches on a lot of subjects that, uh, I find very fascinating,</v>

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:12.420
particularly pesticides. Um, I am, um,

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.990
con consistently terrified of pesticides. I'm ran into a man once, uh,

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.380
that I met on a ranch and he had an artificial thighbone.

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.850
His femur had been replaced with like a piece of metal and like a metal bone.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.140
And he told me he got bone cancer from, um,

8
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.070
pesticides.

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.150
They use on a golf course that got into local water supply in a bunch of people

10
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:35.070
in that area got cancer.

11
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.330
And there was like some large scale a lawsuit against the,

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.170
I don't know if it was against the chemical company or the golf course or both,

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.220
but, uh, I remember thinking like, whoa, like I D okay.

14
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.320
I didn't even think of that. Like, of course,

15
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.300
if you're going to have all that green grass,

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.980
you have to do something about the weeds.

17
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.690
You have to do something about the bugs, that all that stuff is terrifying.

18
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.680
When, when I was listening to your podcast, the science history podcast,

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.040
and your friend was interviewing you, who was it? Pete Myers,

20
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.210
Pete Meyers was interviewing you.

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.460
And you were talking about the prevalence of these pesticides and chemicals that

22
00:01:11.461 --> 00:01:14.610
we use all over the world. And he said,

23
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.100
I think his exact quote was,

24
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.870
am I wrong in saying that there's a square centimeter of this planet?

25
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
That's not somehow or another polluted by

26
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:30.090
humans and our chemicals. And you said that's accurate. That's accurate.

27
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.090
<v 2>Yeah. It's amazing. Isn't it? That's insane. Yeah. And you think of,</v>

28
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.160
you've been to Alaska and you go to Alaska, looks pristine, it's beautiful.

29
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.390
And you think everything is perfectly clean. But in fact,

30
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.540
even their most remote places in the world like Alaska are getting

31
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.970
atmospherically, deposited chemicals,

32
00:01:49.971 --> 00:01:52.280
including pesticides that are used at lower latitude.

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.240
And so there really isn't anywhere on the earth. It's not polluted,

34
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.313
unfortunately.

35
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.870
<v 1>And you were explaining the,</v>

36
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.700
the way these chemicals get into the atmosphere and then get distributed all

37
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:09.350
over the world, akin to a, still like a whiskey or a moonshine.

38
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.010
<v 2>Yeah, exactly. If you go back and you look at an old, an old,</v>

39
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.150
still the way it works, you would have a heat source, like a Bunsen burner,

40
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.650
that's heating up a liquid and that liquid volatilizes,

41
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.140
some of it evaporates into a gas. And then,

42
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.180
and then that is connected via a glass tube to a glass ball that

43
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.500
has cold water on it.

44
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.420
And that whatever vaporizes from that heat is going to condense on that cold

45
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.920
surface where the cold water is.

46
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.420
So that's the basics of how you would make a distillery and the earth works

47
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.380
really in the same way.

48
00:02:42.381 --> 00:02:45.350
So the equator is the part of the earth it's most directly facing.

49
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:48.230
The sun is getting the most intense solar radiation.

50
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.590
So you have these contaminants, like many pesticides PCBs,

51
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.450
a lot of other things that, that some out, some portion of them will volatize,

52
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.400
they'll become a gas and there'll be in the atmosphere, move in the atmosphere.

53
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.790
And then they'll condense out of the atmosphere when it gets colder.

54
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.810
So when it's winter time and it'd be a little higher and latitude and the next

55
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.480
summer, they'll, volatize again, they'll evaporate again,

56
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:13.720
and they'll move north again. It's called a grasshopper effect.

57
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.020
And so over some number of years, they moved their way north.

58
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.450
When they get to the north pole to the south pole,

59
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.020
those are hemispheric sinks for these contaminants is cold year round.

60
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.730
And so the amount of deposition from the atmosphere is far greater than the

61
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.300
amount of evaporation. And therefore the,

62
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:34.570
the poles have the highest concentrations of certain classes of these so-called

63
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:35.890
persistent, organic pollutants.

64
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.340
They're the ones that are relatively light that can move through the atmosphere

65
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.690
as a result that, and these are also fat soluble. So they get into the food web.

66
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.450
And as you go up each food trophic level,

67
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.580
you end up with higher and higher concentrations.

68
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.350
So the Mo the animals with the highest concentrations of these certain kinds of

69
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.070
persistent organic pollutants on earth are these high trophic level,

70
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.400
long lived animals in the Arctic, like the killer whale on the polar bear.

71
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.120
That'll have millions of times the background concentration of these

72
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.290
contaminants. Things like DDT, mercury, a lot of other chemicals,

73
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.840
a lot of pesticides, flame retardant, chemicals, and so on.

74
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.040
<v 1>Wow. So polar bears. So,</v>

75
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.450
and so when they, they test these animals.

76
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.480
So if the people in these areas eat these animals,

77
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.130
are they at risk of being infected by these contaminants?

78
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.070
Or is it not at a level where it's going to harm them?

79
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.000
<v 2>No, it it's a, it's a really sad case of environmental injustice,</v>

80
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.720
because you have subsistence peoples the indigenous peoples of the Arctic that

81
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.240
they're living off the Marine environment, they're reading bowhead,

82
00:04:39.241 --> 00:04:42.780
whale and walrus and ICLs and polar bear,

83
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.770
and every single one of their meals, they're getting in the fat,

84
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.130
in the rendered oil, they take the blubber and they render oil,

85
00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:52.890
which goes on to all of their meals, every single meal,

86
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:57.690
they're getting hundreds of parts per billion of PCBs and pesticides and

87
00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:01.380
things like that. So it's just grossly unfair when you think about it,

88
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:03.360
because they never use these chemicals,

89
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:06.360
they didn't benefit economically from these chemicals.

90
00:05:06.361 --> 00:05:09.600
And yet they're subject to the, some of the highest concentrations in the world.

91
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.040
<v 1>And you were also saying that their breast milk is contaminated with it.</v>

92
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.750
<v 2>Yeah. Actually the way this whole problem was discovered was in the 1980s,</v>

93
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:23.730
scientists in Canada wanted to understand breast milk contamination of

94
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:25.200
women who lived in Southern Canada,

95
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.190
in the industrial and agricultural areas of Canada. And so they were thinking,

96
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:32.730
where can we find a reference population of people who have no exposure to these

97
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:33.564
chemicals?

98
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.710
So they decided to go to Baffin island in Northeastern Canada to look at the

99
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.620
Intuit people that live there. And they're were surprised to find that the,

100
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.990
the woman on Baffin island,

101
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:47.460
their breast milk contained 10 to 20 times higher concentrations of chemicals

102
00:05:47.461 --> 00:05:50.490
like DDT and PCBs and, and mercury.

103
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.030
Then the woman who lived in the industrial areas where these chemicals were

104
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:58.910
used. So that was the first kind of global that, that actually we're,

105
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.970
we're poisoning. The people are people of the Arctic we're poisoning them.

106
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.920
And that's how the rights of indigenous people in the Arctic to live

107
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.670
in a clean environment became part of the Stockholm convention on persistent,

108
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.420
organic pollutants.

109
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.140
There's representatives from these tribes who go to the negotiations every time.

110
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.120
Uh it's because of this problem is called global distillation because of this

111
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:22.400
fact that it's, it's like a, still the way that it works.

112
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.910
<v 1>Now, now we know this problem exists.</v>

113
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.600
Is there a solution that's on the table or a possible solution,

114
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:30.820
a theoretical solution to try to extract that.

115
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.610
<v 2>Yeah. And actually the problem is kind of twofold.</v>

116
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:35.230
So we've talked about one aspect of it,

117
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:37.870
which is this atmospheric transport of contaminants.

118
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.550
But the other aspect of it is there are also thousands of locally contaminated

119
00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:43.390
sites in the Arctic.

120
00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:47.080
I do a lot of work on this things like former LEAs defense sites from the cold

121
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:51.820
war. So the military built thousands of these us, military, Europe,

122
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.140
Russia, military,

123
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.280
and these sites have terrible problems with contamination.

124
00:06:57.281 --> 00:06:59.380
And typically when the military pulled out of them,

125
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.860
they just left everything behind. We have sites we've worked in,

126
00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:06.550
in Alaska where there's just fields of barrels and you don't know what's in the

127
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:10.360
barrels and they're leaking and, and you know,

128
00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:13.090
you test it and you find there's, there's all kinds of nasty things,

129
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:17.200
flame retardants, and pesticides and PCBs. So I've been there a long time,

130
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.900
been there for decades. And unfortunately these chemicals,

131
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.350
many of them persist for decades. That's why they were so wonderful. You know,

132
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.430
PCVs were so wonderful because they were stable. They could last for decades,

133
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.160
but that's also why they're so bad because they're carcinogenic.

134
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.490
They disrupt the hormone system. They cause a lot of different problems.

135
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.530
So in terms of what can we do about it?

136
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:40.270
The main thing is to not be using these chemicals and to be using there's a

137
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:41.470
field called green chemistry,

138
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:45.940
which seeks to instead use safe chemicals in place of these toxic chemicals,

139
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.360
but in terms of cleaning up, yeah. There's also things to do to clean up.

140
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.570
We're involved with that in some places. And it's an important thing to do,

141
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:55.270
but we have to stop the problem even before it gets going.

142
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:56.500
<v 1>When did this problem start?</v>

143
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.280
Like when did human being start using large scale pesticides?

144
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.080
<v 2>So large-scale pesticide use started in the 1880s.</v>

145
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.560
And at that time they were based on metals and metal Lloyds.

146
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:09.640
So naturally occurring,

147
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:14.320
toxic metals that would kill insects or kill fungal pests, things like that.

148
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.360
And those were actually quite dangerous. Things like lead and arsenic, uh,

149
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.940
being used in, in, uh, these pesticides,

150
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:26.320
they were dangerous because they ended up on the food. So you'd buy an apple.

151
00:08:26.321 --> 00:08:29.380
And if you didn't wash it while you got to a dose of lead poisoning,

152
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.220
that continued until about world war II and in world war II,

153
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.800
we made a dramatic shift from using these metal based products,

154
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.560
using synthetic organic compounds. So in world war II,

155
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.950
we saw the origin of the organic chlorine compounds and they're kind of

156
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:46.930
phosphate compounds. And,

157
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.110
and those really became the basis for pesticide use that.

158
00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:52.480
And then there were broadcast all over the environment,

159
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:54.580
following world war II and until today.

160
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.930
<v 1>So in the 1880s, when they were using,</v>

161
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.720
they were using led and they were using arsenic, what would they,

162
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:03.030
are they combating locus? Like, what were they, what were they trying.

163
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.580
<v 2>To kill? So the very first commercial pesticide was actually a copper</v>

164
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.670
based pesticide. And it was used in France to stop the,

165
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.920
the mildew that was just joining the vineyards.

166
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.690
And once it was found that it could destroy as it was called the, uh, uh,

167
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:18.351
water mold,

168
00:09:18.351 --> 00:09:21.350
once it was found that could destroy the water mold and saved the vineyards,

169
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.650
scientists realized you could also use it against the potato blight,

170
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.360
which had caused the famine in Ireland in the 1840s and other famines around the

171
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:33.440
world. So it became a very powerful tool to prevent famine. And, you know,

172
00:09:33.441 --> 00:09:36.320
one thing I like to look back on is, as you can think,

173
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:39.560
why did people poison the world like this with these horrible things,

174
00:09:39.561 --> 00:09:43.340
but really their motivations initially were quite positive.

175
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:44.840
They were trying to stop famine.

176
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.740
Ireland had just been through this devastating fam and they were trying to stop

177
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.890
infectious diseases that were vectored by insects,

178
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.760
things like malaria and yellow fever. So the motivation was good. Um,

179
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.150
but unfortunately the use for public health, it became,

180
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.890
instead of just using it for public health,

181
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:04.640
we started using it in the house and for convenience, for everything.

182
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.720
<v 1>It is really crazy when you think that the human species has been around for</v>

183
00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:10.040
hundreds of thousands of years.

184
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:14.990
And it took till 1880 before we decided to everything up with pesticides.

185
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.130
That's a long time.

186
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.851
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:21.800
And we things up pretty fast because now we have a world that is like

188
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:23.240
you said, anywhere you go in this world,

189
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:25.130
you're going to find contaminated animals.

190
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:29.900
You go to Antarctica and you measure pesticides in penguins and their eggs,

191
00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:31.670
and you'll find very high concentrations.

192
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:36.350
<v 1>And are they seeing, uh, health effects of the in-unit people?</v>

193
00:10:36.351 --> 00:10:38.030
And the people that eat these animals? Is it,

194
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.550
is it having a detrimental effect on them?

195
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.560
<v 2>It does. Uh, and in fact,</v>

196
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:47.510
the cancer rates are quite high and among the people who are subsistence hunters

197
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:48.111
in the Arctic,

198
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:51.980
and that's really how I got involved with this kind of work is that people

199
00:10:51.981 --> 00:10:55.730
report a very high cancer rates, also high rates of developmental disorders.

200
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.240
It could be due to these, these chemicals disrupting development in the womb.

201
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:02.180
And, and so there,

202
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.790
there are groups that bring together teams of scientists to work on this.

203
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:09.110
I was brought in as an eco toxicologist to work on some aspects of this. And,

204
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.680
uh, but yeah, there's quite a few health problems associated with it. And.

205
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.240
<v 1>Are these subsistence hunters,</v>

206
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:19.010
are they free of all the other problems that many Inuit

207
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.060
folks have in terms of like cigarettes and alcohol and a lot of people that have

208
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:25.490
been introduced to some of the vices of the Western world world.

209
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.540
<v 2>Now, and it's the same kind of problems also with these communities in Alaska,</v>

210
00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:33.020
there's high tobacco use and, and a lot of problems with alcohol and.

211
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.400
<v 1>How do they parse whether or not it's a contributing factor. You think.</v>

212
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.980
<v 2>It's a contributing factor and it's very hard to parse it out.</v>

213
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.180
And actually this is the justification. The government often uses to say, well,

214
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.990
it's not the contaminants from this military side that's causing the problem.

215
00:11:47.991 --> 00:11:51.650
They'll say, look, the cancer rates are no higher in this village.

216
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.130
That's next to the military site than they are in this village.

217
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.720
That's away from the military site, but, you know, uh, it's, it's, uh,

218
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.330
you can't actually solve the problem with epidemiology.

219
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:02.710
We're talking about tiny communities.

220
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:06.400
It might be the villages I work in typically are no more than 800 people.

221
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:06.940
Oh wow.

222
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.470
And so how can you do a proper study of a rare health effect when you have a

223
00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:14.920
small population? So I'm sure it's contributing to the health problems.

224
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:15.940
And unfortunately,

225
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:20.050
people use the fact that there are these other issues that cause health problems

226
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:23.830
like smoking in order to justify not doing anything about the pollution.

227
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.520
<v 1>And when you, so when you go to these villages,</v>

228
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.530
is it uniform that most of them are using cigarettes and

229
00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:32.790
alcohol? Is it.

230
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.370
<v 2>So it's not uniform? So in Alaska, actually,</v>

231
00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:39.570
most of the villages are legally dry. And, uh, and so it's,

232
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.840
it's illegal to have alcohol. It's illegal to bring in alcohol really,

233
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:44.850
but many people do or they home.

234
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.100
<v 1>Is this because the village has realized the problem with this.</v>

235
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.520
<v 2>Yeah, exactly. And so they have passed their own laws, their, you know, their,</v>

236
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.800
they have their sovereign governments,

237
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.710
they've passed their own laws to make their villages dry,

238
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.640
but there are still problems of course, with alcohol and drugs,

239
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:03.600
even in tri community.

240
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.050
<v 1>So they pass these laws, they make them dry,</v>

241
00:13:07.051 --> 00:13:08.850
but people sneak the stuff in any way. Yeah.

242
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.930
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. In fact, when we fly into these villages and in small airplanes,</v>

243
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:13.764
there's typically a,

244
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.080
a state trooper searching through looking to see if anyone's bringing alcohol

245
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.590
and, um, cigarettes as well.

246
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.730
<v 1>So is there any where you can study that has this issue</v>

247
00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:27.810
with the pollutants,

248
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.460
but doesn't have the issue with alcoholism and is there a village that's figured

249
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:34.260
it out and is avoided the alcohol?

250
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.380
<v 2>So I, that's a great question. I don't know.</v>

251
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:42.180
I I've not come across any communities that don't have multiple, you know,

252
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:44.010
multiple problems. It's difficult.

253
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.340
And it's the same in other parts of the world where I've done work like in

254
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:49.260
Australia with Aboriginal communities, there's,

255
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.440
there's a whole bunch of things going on that are harmful to health.

256
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.380
But the part that I'm focused on is a contribution of content.

257
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.760
<v 1>Right.</v>

258
00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.270
I just was wondering if there was a place where you could examine only the

259
00:14:00.271 --> 00:14:00.931
contaminants,

260
00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:03.300
if somehow none of these people have figured out how to be free of.

261
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.280
<v 2>The, it's a great question, right? It would be,</v>

262
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.110
it would be a great way to study it, but I don't know.

263
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.080
<v 1>Um, now you,</v>

264
00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:12.660
you were telling me before that you also work with some native American tribes

265
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:15.240
as well. Is this a, the same issue?

266
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.200
<v 2>Uh, so different kinds of contaminants. I'm doing work down on the Arizona,</v>

267
00:14:19.201 --> 00:14:20.040
Mexico border.

268
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:25.020
That's mostly on pesticide use and we're working with migrant farm workers

269
00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:28.740
there. And so if, if you think about the, the, um,

270
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.150
pesticides that were common when we were kids and, and a little bit earlier,

271
00:14:33.151 --> 00:14:37.380
these organochlorine pesticides like DDT, they were pretty safe to handle.

272
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.341
And, uh,

273
00:14:38.341 --> 00:14:42.180
the problem was that they were destroying wildlife causing species go extinct.

274
00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:44.970
It's why the bald Eagle almost went extinct.

275
00:14:44.971 --> 00:14:49.440
Why the Peregrine Falcon almost went extinct. It was from DDT. And, uh,

276
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.420
and so countries, the United States phased those chemicals out.

277
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.040
They were replaced by the organophosphate chemicals, pesticides.

278
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.280
And these were developed by Nazi scientists during world war II.

279
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.780
They're very similar to the Nazi nerve gas,

280
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:07.430
poisons like Tabin and Seren.

281
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.030
And those chemicals are incredibly toxic,

282
00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.190
but they break down faster in the environment.

283
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.150
So we ended up trading doing a trade-off where, uh, they,

284
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.500
their organochlorine would end up as residues on food. And consumers would,

285
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.270
would end up with two unacceptable levels. Like if you go back into the 1960s,

286
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.890
the average American had 12 parts per million DDT in their body fat,

287
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.820
and that's a toxic level of DDT. And that was the average. So wow,

288
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.280
really terrible consequences for health.

289
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:40.820
So in order to prevent that we switched to organic phosphates,

290
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:43.100
but then that caused another problem,

291
00:15:43.101 --> 00:15:45.290
because then we're asking the farm workers,

292
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.770
instead of using this relatively safe chemical to use,

293
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.480
do something that's quite dangerous.

294
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:54.980
A lot of people get killed in during application and the farm workers for some

295
00:15:54.981 --> 00:15:56.960
of the most vulnerable people in our society.

296
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:00.920
They're typically migrants from Mexico or other parts of Latin America.

297
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:02.780
They're coming up, they're working incredibly hard.

298
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:05.480
They don't have the right protective equipment.

299
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.840
And then they're spraying these chemicals that are incredibly poisonous.

300
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:13.640
So I also work on that on, on, uh, health effects of pesticides,

301
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:15.380
um, in the border region,

302
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.680
both with migrant farm worker communities and with some of the tribes there.

303
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.310
<v 3>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

304
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.460
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

305
00:16:27.461 --> 00:16:29.890
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

306
00:16:29.891 --> 00:16:33.580
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

307
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.600
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

308
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.400
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
