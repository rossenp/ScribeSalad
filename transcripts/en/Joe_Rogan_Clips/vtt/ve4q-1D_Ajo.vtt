00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I was a graduate student.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.340
<v 1>Studying bats in a, I was in Michigan and,</v>

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.590
uh, I was interested in evolutionary trade-offs that's my

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.633
signature thing.

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.860
And there was a very good piece of work from a guy. I knew George Williams,

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.910
great evolutionary biologist about the evolution of senescence.

7
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.020
That is to say the process by which we grow feeble and inefficient with age,

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.780
but most people call aging. Um,

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.490
and basically that's classic paper explained why it is that

10
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:40.140
creatures like us, uh, get old and die. And the answer was,

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.970
um, basically this,

12
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.350
that you have a genome that's complex,

13
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
it's full of genes, but there aren't enough genes to have a gene for every, uh,

14
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.590
trait that you have. In fact,

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.160
there a tiny fraction of the number of genes you would need to cover all of the

16
00:00:56.161 --> 00:01:00.120
various characteristics you have. So genes always do multiple things.

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.960
And in the case, when a gene does something,

18
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:07.230
that's very good for you when you're young at some cost,

19
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:10.560
when you're old selection tends to S to favor it,

20
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.230
because you may not live long enough to suffer the cost.

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.640
And so if you have the trait that makes you powerful when you're young

22
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.530
and you've got, uh, some costs that you're going to pay when you're old,

23
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.440
but you're not going to live to get it, it may be a freebie, right?

24
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.940
So selection sees early life much more clearly than it sees late life.

25
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:33.570
And it prefers things that help you early, even at a cost of harming you late.

26
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.700
That's the basic answer it's called the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of

27
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:42.600
senescence. But at the point that I started working,

28
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.000
we knew that this was right.

29
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.800
We could tell that the hypothesis was true because it matched all sorts of

30
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:54.060
observations about wild creatures, certain creatures live longer than others,

31
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.250
even when you correct for things like body size.

32
00:01:56.251 --> 00:02:00.870
So creatures that fly live longer than creatures that are of the same type and

33
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:04.290
size that don't fly. Why? Because they can fly away from danger.

34
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.190
If you can fly away from danger, you're more likely to make it to an older age.

35
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.030
The better selection can see the harms that afflict you when you get there.

36
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.600
So selection, doesn't prefer a bias in favor of youth.

37
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.990
If you can fly away from danger, same thing applies. If you're poisonous,

38
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.680
if you have a shell, if you have a really good defense,

39
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.440
then selection sees your late life better. Okay.

40
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.020
So we knew that this hypothesis was right,

41
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.370
but what we had never found at the point that I was working in the very late

42
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:35.640
nineties on this was a gene that matched the description.

43
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.860
We knew that selection was finding these genes and accumulating them,

44
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.170
but we had never found one of the genes in question.

45
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.940
And that was very conspicuous. I called that the missing pleiotropy. So,

46
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.520
anyway, I was sort of on alert about this. It was a curious fact. And, um,

47
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.350
I saw a talk given by somebody who was talking about

48
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.680
telomeres and he was talking about telomeres and their relationship to cancer.

49
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.510
So telomeres are repetitive sequences of DNA at the ends of our chromosomes.

50
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.480
And they grow shorter every time a cell dies, right?

51
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.160
So it's like a fuse or a counter that ticks down each cell

52
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:21.660
division and it drops to zero and in, uh, or not zero,

53
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:25.200
but it drops to a number that the cell refuses to divide after that.

54
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.320
And some people were working in one set of labs on the possibility that this

55
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:33.750
was causing us to grow feeble with age.

56
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.100
Because if your cells can't divide anymore than they won't replace themselves,

57
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.190
and your tissues won't be able to maintain, right?

58
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.360
Another group was studying this question of Tila mirrors with relation to

59
00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:49.770
cancer. And they were saying Eureka, every time we look in a cancer,

60
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.780
it has this enzyme called telomerase turned on, which elongates telomeres.

61
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.110
And these two groups were not talking to each other.

62
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.090
They were each claiming that they were about to cure their respective disease

63
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.220
group was saying, if we can activate telomerase, then we can lengthen your life.

64
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.680
And the other group was saying, if we can turn off telomerase,

65
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:14.670
we can cure cancer. Right? And I put two and two together, and I said,

66
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.800
this is the missing pleiotropy here. We have something that is protecting us.

67
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:20.910
It's helping us in youth.

68
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.630
We have a counter that is limiting the number of times a cell can divide and

69
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.030
presumably preventing cancer, right?

70
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.760
And the cost is you can't maintain your tissues forever.

71
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:31.230
So you grow feeble and inefficient.

72
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.980
So that made a hell of a lot of sense to me.

73
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.890
I couldn't convince anybody else that this was sensible.

74
00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:43.020
I couldn't even get them to understand what I was saying because in evolutionary

75
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:45.690
biology, there has traditionally been a bias,

76
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.830
not in against mechanism, the study of cellular biology,

77
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.670
not because there's anything wrong with studying cellular biology as an

78
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:57.420
evolutionary phenomenon, but because, um,

79
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.520
early in the study of evolution,

80
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:01.410
we just didn't have the tools to look into the cells.

81
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.370
So evolutionary biologists got used to thinking about the form of creatures and

82
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:08.550
the behavior of creatures, but not thinking about the internal mechanisms.

83
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.550
Cause there just wasn't a lot that could be said. Anyway,

84
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.280
I retained an interest in the cellular biology.

85
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.310
I saw these two things that needed to be connected.

86
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.140
And I started to work on the puzzle.

87
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.680
It turned out that that hypothesis would answer a great many questions that

88
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:29.790
were otherwise very difficult to answer with respect to how

89
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.540
aging functions, but there was one huge obstacle.

90
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.610
The obstacle was that a fact that was well-known about mice

91
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.100
did not fit with the idea that telomeres were fundamental to the aging process.

92
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.070
And the fact that it was known was that mice had extremely long

93
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:52.350
telomeres and yet they lived short lives.

94
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.290
So if it were true that the length of your telomeres dictated how quickly were

95
00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:00.110
going to age, then a tiny,

96
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.850
any creature with very long telomeres ought to be able to replace his tissues

97
00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:07.600
really well. And it should, it should aid. It should aid very, very slowly.

98
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.110
So I thought there's gotta be something wrong with this.

99
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.100
The hypothesis answers to many questions for that obstacle to be real.

100
00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:20.050
And I thought maybe it's maybe one person has run a test and everybody else is

101
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:23.770
just parroting it. And I went and I looked in that wasn't the case.

102
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.930
And, um,

103
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.020
I finally realized that all of the mice that were had been looked at were

104
00:06:32.021 --> 00:06:36.370
coming from one source, that there was a laboratory in bar Harbor,

105
00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:37.870
Maine called the Jack's lab.

106
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.590
That was the source for all of the mice being used in all of the laboratories in

107
00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:46.570
the country. And, um, I started to wonder,

108
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.470
is there something going on at that lab, maybe mouse, Tila mirrors, aren't long,

109
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.200
the ultra long tail numbers of mice. Aren't real.

110
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:57.460
Maybe that's a feature of laboratory mice and wild mice would have short

111
00:06:57.461 --> 00:07:02.410
telomeres in which case the hypothesis would make sense. And I called up, uh,

112
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:06.310
one of the leading people in the field, a woman named Carol Greider,

113
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.630
who's now won a Nobel prize. And I said, Carol, you don't know me.

114
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.350
I'm an evolutionary biology graduate student. I have a question.

115
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.350
Is it possible that all my,

116
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.980
I don't have long telomeres that that's really just laboratory mice.

117
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:25.570
And she said, well, I think mice have long Tila mirrors,

118
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.740
but it's interesting if you order must spree this rather than mus musculus and

119
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.500
you order them from Europe, then how long their telomeres are,

120
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.640
depends on what supplier you get them from. So this is interesting. So anyway,

121
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.950
we both agreed that it was really interesting.

122
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.850
She decided she was going to test the hypothesis. She put her graduate student,

123
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:47.710
Mike Heman on the case, we exchanged some emails and, uh,

124
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.370
anyway, they tested it and they got some mice that weren't really wild,

125
00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:55.810
but they were much more recently encountered activity and low and behold they

126
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:58.900
had short deal Amir's okay. So that was an amazing moment.

127
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.020
My prediction had turned out to be true, which meant a,

128
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.360
that my hypothesis about, um,

129
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.520
senescence and cancer and aging might well be true. That was important.

130
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.470
Um, but it also raised a bunch of really difficult problems.

131
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:20.320
One was if it is true that all the mice that are being used to study

132
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.530
physiology are broken in this way,

133
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.200
then how are we blinding ourselves?

134
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.540
Is it possible that we are using all of these mice,

135
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.730
that would be terrible models for wound healing, for senescence, for cancer,

136
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:35.950
for a whole number of things. Um,

137
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.680
w w how is it that we are allowing ourselves to take these mice who have been

138
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.110
altered and using them as models for normal physiology?

139
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.390
And the other problem may be even more serious was that we use these animals in

140
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:53.410
drug safety testing.

141
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.960
And the way we use them is if you think about,

142
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.280
if you'd come up with a drug that you thought was useful and you wanted to test,

143
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.320
whether it was safe to administer it to people,

144
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.270
you can't really afford to give people a drug and then wait

145
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:13.770
40 50 years to figure out whether you've shortened their lives. Right?

146
00:09:13.771 --> 00:09:16.320
So at the point that you start testing these things on humans,

147
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.120
you're really in the final stage,

148
00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.250
the way we test whether a drug is safe for long-term

149
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.440
use, or whether it is safe for your long-term life based on short use is we give

150
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:33.210
large doses of it to small animals that live short lives on the assumption

151
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:38.190
that if it's going to shorten your 80 or 90 year life by 10 or 20 years,

152
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.870
that it'll shorten a mouse's life long enough to see it. But here's the problem.

153
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.820
If you've altered a mouse in the laboratory environment,

154
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.240
by favoring the radical elongation of its telomeres,

155
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.110
then it has the ability to replace its tissues indefinitely.

156
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.990
A toxin that will harm you by killing tissue may not

157
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:02.370
harm that mouse. In fact,

158
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:05.610
it may actually help it because these mice are very cancer prone.

159
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.680
So when we give a toxin that will damage you to a mouse that is highly

160
00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:15.660
resistant to tissue damage, you may slow down its tumors. And in fact,

161
00:10:15.661 --> 00:10:20.370
we've seen this a number of times where a drug is given to mice,

162
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:23.190
and we get back the paradoxical result. Not only is it not toxic,

163
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:25.950
it actually makes the mice live a little longer. All right.

164
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.410
So my contention is that we had a problem where

165
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:36.090
we were testing drugs to see if they were safe on animals that were predisposed

166
00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:37.230
to tell us that they were.

167
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:40.260
And then when those drugs were released into the human population,

168
00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:44.460
it turned out they were not safe and people died. Now,

169
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:49.440
the problem is I was absolutely unable to alert

170
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.920
the world to this problem for reasons that still elude me.

171
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.200
I published my paper. I went through,

172
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:57.420
I don't think we need to bore your audience,

173
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:01.170
especially if they've been through Eric's description with the details of what

174
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:05.340
happened in the attempt to bring this to public attention. But,

175
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.313
um,

176
00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.420
the world of scientists working on the question

177
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.700
was unwilling to respond to the discovery that their model organism

178
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.440
had this fatal flaw that was going to predispose us to see certain things and

179
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:25.140
not other things in the laboratory environment,

180
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.180
the governmental commission that was charged with studying the Vioxx

181
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:30.601
scandal,

182
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:35.490
which I believe was likely the result of something like this in its 300 page

183
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.130
report, doesn't mention mice. It.

184
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.740
<v 2>Doesn't scandal, which was a, it was a drug for arthritis, correct.</v>

185
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.090
And it gave people strokes.

186
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.210
<v 1>Yeah, it did heart damage. And so anyway,</v>

187
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.590
heart damage is actually probably not heart damage. Um,

188
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.450
and by that, what mean is, if you take a drug,

189
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.170
a substance that damages tissues in the human body,

190
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.630
it will show up as heart damage because of the special nature of the heart.

191
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.180
So let's say that you took some drug that, you know,

192
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.820
killed every 10,000 seller,

193
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:12.970
every thousand cell that would be destructive all over your body.

194
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.760
The heart though is a special tissue.

195
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.410
The heart has a very low capacity for self repair at a cellular level,

196
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.990
very low for reasons we could go into if you want it,

197
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.160
but because it has a low capacity for self repair,

198
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.140
it is also very vulnerable to something that does some kind of general tissue

199
00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:35.740
damage. And it's also an Oregon that when it fails,

200
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.360
it's absolutely conspicuous.

201
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:42.640
So you would expect that if we had substances that were body-wide toxins,

202
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.620
and we released them into the public,

203
00:12:44.621 --> 00:12:47.920
having tested them on mice and not discovering that they were dangerous,

204
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.090
that you would see relatively young people die from heart conditions,

205
00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:55.120
which is where we would detect that there's a problem before we would detect it

206
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:58.690
anywhere else. So anyway,

207
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:01.060
the government studied this problem after,

208
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:05.260
after Vioxx and it put together a report and the reports 300 pages,

209
00:13:05.261 --> 00:13:08.320
it doesn't mention mice. It doesn't mention the genus mosque.

210
00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.240
<v 2>If you think they did that to protect themselves.</v>

211
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.080
<v 1>Well, what I know is that I attempted to call their attention.</v>

212
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:18.490
After the report came out, I looked at it and you know, it had a physical form,

213
00:13:18.491 --> 00:13:20.830
but it also had it lives online. You can search it.

214
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.310
And I could see that telomeres mirrors weren't mentioned mice,

215
00:13:24.311 --> 00:13:26.200
weren't mentioned rodents aren't mentioned.

216
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:31.030
And so I tried to alert them to the fact that they had screwed up and I,

217
00:13:31.031 --> 00:13:35.470
they blew me off. They wouldn't talk to me. So that is,

218
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:40.990
it raises a question and I to this day cannot answer the question.

219
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:45.850
I can't even say whether or not. So when I've tried to raise this issue,

220
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:52.120
um, I have run into, uh, various kinds of resistance.

221
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:54.760
If I raise it with, um, journalists,

222
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.500
what I get back is typically I get interest back at first

223
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.790
and they say, okay, I'm very interested in the story. I'm going to pursue it.

224
00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:03.910
I'm gonna make a few phone calls.

225
00:14:03.911 --> 00:14:08.890
And then they come back to me and they either they go silent or they

226
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.040
say, well, I talked to some people and they said, it's been taken care of,

227
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.510
right. Well,

228
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:17.050
I don't know what it's been taken care of means I published a paper that said,

229
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.860
here's a hypothesis about what's going on. Here's my, uh,

230
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:25.300
I proposed a mechanism whereby Teleopti telomere elongation would have happened

231
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:28.620
in the breeding colonies in question. And it's.

232
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.240
<v 2>Been taken care of is a very strange way to describe something that could be an</v>

233
00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:34.200
enormous problem.

234
00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:37.650
<v 1>Well, not only let's say that it was taken care of, right?</v>

235
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:41.670
Let's say that they have altered the S the breeding protocol and they fixed the.

236
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.850
<v 2>You still have all those drug tests that they've done for.</v>

237
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.860
<v 1>You got all those drug tests, you've got all of the papers, you've got my paper,</v>

238
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:53.120
which proposes a hypothesis. And I have a right to say,

239
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:56.810
actually it turns out to be correct, or it wasn't right. But so anyway,

240
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:01.640
we got back. All of these weird answers it's been taken care of, or, uh,

241
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.120
even more curious is the argument. Well,

242
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:09.920
everybody knows that the mice are bad models, which is insane because this.

243
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.890
<v 2>Telomere problem got that response from.</v>

244
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.450
<v 1>Several people.</v>

245
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.840
I went to several different journalists and it wasn't that I was told who they

246
00:15:17.841 --> 00:15:18.674
contacted.

247
00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.040
What I was told was that they contacted somebody and this is what they heard.

248
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.600
And so they, their enthusiasm evaporated at the point, they make a phone call.

249
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.220
So.

250
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:27.520
<v 2>Did they,</v>

251
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.140
were they not aware of the consequences of this problem with these mice?

252
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.290
<v 1>So again, this is,</v>

253
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.830
we have a serious problem. It's not about mice. It's not about virology,

254
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.400
right? It's a general systemic failure of reason.

255
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.990
So what I encountered as a young,

256
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.500
somewhat naive graduate student was an instance,

257
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.040
which frankly woke me up to the fact that my colleagues,

258
00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:59.830
even when human life was on the line,

259
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.870
we're going to pretend they didn't know what was going on. It's quite possible.

260
00:16:04.871 --> 00:16:09.670
They didn't know until I had put out my hypothesis

261
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.900
and Carol Greider who later pretended she didn't know what I was talking about.

262
00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.320
Published the empirical work that revealed that indeed lab,

263
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.610
lab mice are unusual in having long telomeres. After that work was out.

264
00:16:21.611 --> 00:16:25.720
There's no excuse for not investigating what the consequences were.

265
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.323
Um,

266
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.670
I cannot explain it except to say that the culture of science has become so

267
00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:34.504
rotten,

268
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.770
that this sort of thing is maybe standard

269
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.150
operating procedure.

270
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:45.100
<v 2>Just protecting their and protecting the of those who give them jobs and,</v>

271
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.500
and all the work that's been done that sort of establishes

272
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.230
that they should be doing these tests in the first.

273
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.800
<v 1>Place.</v>

274
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.660
I'm sure they tell themselves some story in which they are the heroes

275
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.220
and they are protecting us from something. But, uh, I,

276
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.050
I look at my own medicine cabinet.

277
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.700
And even though I am aware of what likely happened,

278
00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:12.460
I am in no position to protect myself or my family.

279
00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:17.440
The only way to be protected from the downstream consequences of this error

280
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:22.630
is to just not take pharmaceuticals. Jesus Christ. Yeah. It's a,

281
00:17:22.631 --> 00:17:26.710
it's a, it's a really huge problem. And, um,

282
00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.630
the response of the system generally to shut down the

283
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:32.740
lone individual,

284
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.150
trying to point out a serious problem is it's just

285
00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:41.110
breathtaking. And when you've, when you've seen it, when you lived it, um, you,

286
00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:43.180
you never go back. You know,

287
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.440
you've looked into the eye of something that is willing to ignore. Uh, I mean,

288
00:17:47.441 --> 00:17:51.420
it's willing to ignore not only human life,

289
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.550
but it is willing to ignore the requirements of goods.
