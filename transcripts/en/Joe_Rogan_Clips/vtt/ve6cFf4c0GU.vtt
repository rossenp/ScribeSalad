00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.920
Is there a struggle to find time like to manage the time between work

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.360
and family relationships?

4
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.430
<v 1>Not after that accident? No.</v>

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.740
I know that I an accident accident was the,

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.680
the best eye opening experience ever. You know what I mean? It it's,

7
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.660
I was married to my career, dating my family,

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.950
right? Like, um, um, I'm all about this work and all about this hustle.

9
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.280
Granted, there's nothing wrong with that. It's a good thing.

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.580
But after a certain point,

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.690
you gotta prioritize accordingly. When you,

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.440
when you get to a certain point where the decisions that can be made are a

13
00:00:46.441 --> 00:00:51.090
little more controlled and you have the ability to maneuver differently because

14
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:54.540
of the success that you've obtained. Make those adjustments.

15
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.970
I didn't make those adjustments. I was still hustle, hustle, hustle. Great,

16
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.940
great dad. Um, we're doing stuff. I'm home. I'm getting back home,

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.130
but my in and outs three days and I'm out two days,

18
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:09.960
three days, I'm out. I gotta go film the movie.

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.680
Y'all come down for the weekends. All right. I see you guys. We'll eat dinner.

20
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:17.040
We'll do stuff and it's great. Crammed it all in our y'all got to go.

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.600
I'm working and it's not bad, but now,

22
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.240
all right, I'll film a movie after I'm done filming a movie while I got,

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.830
I need to take 30 days off. I need to take 40 days off.

24
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.510
I shared with me in the fam now, Hey, you go tour.

25
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.280
It was just bow year and a half. We out four days out of the week,

26
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.410
I'm out year and a half. I got to get it.

27
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.720
Well now let's go a month and a half. I stopped for three weeks.

28
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.190
I'm with the fam. So I still have my three days a week that I was here,

29
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.520
but then I'm gonna stop for three weeks. This dedicated to FaceTime.

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.940
Don't nobody do anything with me or talk to me. I'm um,

31
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.600
I'm home now, my office,

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.610
I was in that office when we open office open at

33
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:10.860
nine I'm there eight, you know,

34
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:14.460
there's a chance that I may be in that office till six.

35
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.160
Now, yo, no matter what guys that day in the office has to end at like three,

36
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.510
I gotta be home for dinner. I got dinner with the fam.

37
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.970
My priorities have changed,

38
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.230
but it brings me back to the decisions that you're now

39
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.240
able to make based off of life's

40
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.420
circumstances, life's lessons.

41
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.790
So because of all of the that I went through,

42
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.220
because of the things that I now got to see because of that hospital room and

43
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.690
those four walls and me seeing my family and what that love did for me and to

44
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:55.440
me, well, I'll be damned if I look past that,

45
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.890
I'll be damned if I not do what I'm supposed to do.

46
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 2>And give that the same amount of attention in return.</v>

47
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.470
<v 0>When are you going to do your thing with norm? Again, you're gonna S gonna.</v>

48
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.900
<v 2>Start. So we, uh, we've been planning for a while now,</v>

49
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:11.480
so now we're just going to, um, we just need to put all the,

50
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:14.590
the nuts and bolts into place and then get a, get a studio,

51
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.760
get a camera and just do it, but you're going to be the first guest I'm in.

52
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.000
<v 0>All right, good. So just tell me when, so I can, I can plan ahead.</v>

53
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.280
<v 2>Uh, we're shooting the first one in the fall. So.</v>

54
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.880
<v 0>Let you know, you gotta plan it out. You're gonna map it out in advance. Nice.</v>

55
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.410
<v 2>I can't wait. And we're still, yeah.</v>

56
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.750
<v 0>I mean, listen, I love norm to pieces.</v>

57
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.840
He's one of my all time favorite human beings that have ever lived.

58
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.520
I have a great story about norm, me and him on a plane and randomly,

59
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.390
this is a crazy, but true randomly twice. I sat next to him on planes.

60
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.720
Just random. Uh, wow. Yeah, totally randomly. Like what's up norm.

61
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.270
What's up normally crazy. This is happening again.

62
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.240
And both times it was a blast, but uh, one time we're,

63
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.900
we're flying back and he's like, yeah, I used to smoke and uh,

64
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.620
had to give it up. It's terrible for you. But I, sometimes I miss it,

65
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:02.860
but glad I quit. I'm like how long, you know, how long has it been?

66
00:04:02.861 --> 00:04:05.020
He's telling me all these months, he stopped smoking this net.

67
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.770
We're talking as soon as they land, he walks right into the store,

68
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.950
buys a carton of cigarettes and he's opening this cigarette.

69
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:15.490
He's a lighting it before he gets out the door and I go, what are you doing?

70
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:17.800
He goes, oh, that talk about smoke. And I had to have one.

71
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.550
And the flight from, from, I forgot where we were two times, both times,

72
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.140
or just like the best flights,

73
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:33.400
like just like having an audience of one next to one of the greatest comics ever

74
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:33.850
and just be like.

75
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.310
<v 2>Talk. Yeah. He's probably, you know, he's,</v>

76
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:40.240
he's probably like in my top three favorite standup comics of all time. And, uh,

77
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.560
he's a great guy. He's.

78
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.590
<v 0>A great, great.</v>

79
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.110
<v 2>Guy. The two greatest people, uh, in my life in,</v>

80
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.420
in comedy have been Norman spade. They've just been so good to me.

81
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:52.180
And I love them both. And they're both equally hilarious in different ways,

82
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:55.000
but norm I'll never forget how quick he was.

83
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.090
And goody was hosting that podcast.

84
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.360
We had Larry King on one time and Larry was like, uh, no, I'm,

85
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:04.540
I don't think they're going to give you a show. Like, you know, the way,

86
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.700
cause he was just outlandish saying the most crazy to Larry King.

87
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.500
And Larry is like, you know what? Norm?

88
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.540
He's like 50 years in the radio business. Uh,

89
00:05:13.541 --> 00:05:17.920
the one thing I learned is I never, I rarely talk. I always listen.

90
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.130
And that's why I always learned from the guests because I'm always listening

91
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.570
nervous. Can I interrupt you there?

92
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.290
So I can't wait to, uh, I can't wait to come back with this podcast.

93
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.760
<v 0>Norm is the hidden king of the internet. If he decided to have a podcast,</v>

94
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.060
it would be the biggest podcast of all time. If he just did a regular basis.

95
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.920
<v 2>I know we just need to get motivated.</v>

96
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.210
<v 0>And he's buck wild dude.</v>

97
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.950
And he's always been always there's whatever the filter that it doesn't even

98
00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:50.620
screw in his head. Like there's not, there's no filter.

99
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.880
There was never a place for it.

100
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.040
<v 2>Is the Charles Manson a comedy. I know he loves Manson. Does he really?</v>

101
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.740
We're going to, we'll.

102
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.010
<v 0>Definitely get O'Neil along no way. He's a Manson fiend.</v>

103
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.410
How much does he know about the case? I think he knows.

104
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.340
I I'm sure he's read the books. He's read that book. That chaos book. Okay.

105
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.030
Yeah. Good. I need to talk to him about it. Yeah.

106
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.360
<v 4>The, the best fighters in the world can always match a good match,</v>

107
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.690
but it's the first one that makes a mistake is the one who loses.

108
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.600
That's where it and momentum is so important in sports.

109
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.150
Momentum is everything I snowball. Once it starts to build,

110
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.420
it's so hard to recover and turn that around in high competition.

111
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.254
It's a mental thing,

112
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.760
but when you can control things and control and control and then find one

113
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.190
mistake, and then you build on that mistake, you're like a wave.

114
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.250
You slowly get a little bigger and you still get a little bigger.

115
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.410
And now you start to capitalize because once they make a mistake,

116
00:06:39.411 --> 00:06:40.790
that pattern is starting to create.

117
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.150
And then once you get someone to make a mistake after mistake after mistake,

118
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.500
that's when you crumble on them.

119
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:47.870
And I feel like that's what he's done really well to three fights.

120
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.010
Prior to that, he was just the capital able to capitalize on the big mistake.

121
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.090
But credit to Tony, Tony is one of the most gangster dudes in this sport.

122
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.680
And for him to go through the damage that he did it continue to walk forward

123
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.450
is something unique. Incredible. It is one of the coolest things to experience,

124
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.670
uh, uh, as a coach to sit there and watch his mental not change. Even when he,

125
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.850
cause I was calling for the ref to stop the fight it about halfway through the

126
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:17.990
fifth round. And when he got hit with that last jab and shook his head,

127
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.310
I don't think it was a point like, oh, I don't want to go on no more.

128
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.370
I don't know if it was the orbital. Cause I know he had an orbital issue,

129
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.910
but there was something going on where his body is telling them not to do it.

130
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:31.280
But his mental is like, nah, don't stop. Keep going.

131
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.770
Can they still kick it and punch it. Even with the big old gash on his,

132
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.560
his shin from the check, he was still kicking.

133
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.340
<v 0>Hip flinched. He never flinched. She was getting cracked and.</v>

134
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.510
<v 4>He'd get knocked backwards.</v>

135
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:44.920
And then he would go from backwards or right back to forward as it was,

136
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:47.960
it was super unique to watch. But again, it was,

137
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:52.730
it was great to see someone who can listen and understand,

138
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.040
uh, that if you stay in control yourself,

139
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.000
that's the key to everything in this world. You,

140
00:07:57.001 --> 00:08:01.160
if you listen to anything else on the outside and you start to adapt to other

141
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:04.940
things, you'd never going to live the way you want to live. And to be a fighter,

142
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:07.370
you have to be in control yourself all the time.

143
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.770
I always say the best fighters are the best actors.

144
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.210
The ones that can trick yourself,

145
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.800
fake it till you make it till you get to the championship and you have to live

146
00:08:15.801 --> 00:08:20.510
that way. You have to obsess, never be in broken. And even if you break,

147
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.390
except it in an honest, the next don't deal with it. Oh man,

148
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:24.224
I had such a bad day.

149
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.800
This is one of my biggest pet peeves that I hate is hearing someone, oh man.

150
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:30.560
Today was a day. And I was like, yeah, there's going to be many more city days,

151
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:31.650
but accepted. Yeah.

152
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.900
<v 0>Zero. Good to sit around and talk about days.</v>

153
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.900
<v 4>I have fighters say, man, you always say, and just positive.</v>

154
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.580
You're always just like, and I'm like, hell yeah,

155
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:42.170
you got to love every part of it. What.

156
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.720
<v 0>Where did you store everything? Well, it was a new.</v>

157
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.170
<v 5>Initially. I didn't, to be honest, I didn't expect to see a Wolverine.</v>

158
00:08:48.171 --> 00:08:51.230
I never have. And I just wasn't something on my consciousness.

159
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.310
And so when I got the moose, I put all the meat up on the, I built and thought,

160
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:59.220
man, if a bear comes, it'll be great. I'll have a chance at a bear. You know,

161
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:03.510
I'll wake up at night and kind of be like a bait pile basically. Yeah. Yeah.

162
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:06.660
And so I was maybe expecting a bear to come,

163
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:11.070
but I went to sleep the first night I got the moose and woke up and came out and

164
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.860
there were just tracks everywhere. Somehow I hadn't woken up,

165
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.350
but Wolverine's a lot slyer animal.

166
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:19.770
And he had come and pulled out all the kidney fat, you know,

167
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:21.300
I had like a jug of kidney fat.

168
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.570
<v 0>I was just like, no. And all your family hauled.</v>

169
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:28.650
<v 5>Off a full gallon jug packed with kidney fat.</v>

170
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.570
I had other fat, but that was like, you know, weeks of fat, there was no,

171
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.830
it was, it was rough. And so then he was pretty excited.

172
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:42.390
I'm sure that Wolverine just kept coming back every day. I figured,

173
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.200
I don't know if they're like, I figured they were nocturnal,

174
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.290
but they sure enough I'd be like out there scraping my moose hide in the middle

175
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:52.530
of the day and come running up and like try to grab some meat and run off.

176
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.450
And I was like, holy smokes. This thing's bold.

177
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.310
<v 0>Is this a photo of him? Yeah. That's.</v>

178
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.690
<v 5>The one that's at my shelter. There are that's up in the show.</v>

179
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:04.230
There he is sneaking around the uh,

180
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.310
but no. Yeah. So he stole 35,000 calories, which is gold up there.

181
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.700
So.

182
00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.730
<v 0>You got some series gear on you're wearing KU you. Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.840
<v 5>Real, real gear. Yeah. You're not, not naked and afraid. Fortunately.</v>

184
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.030
<v 0>Oh that's that's serious. Uh, hunting gear. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's,</v>

185
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.080
you're, you're a pillar of dope. Is that when you off the moose fat? Yeah.

186
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:34.860
Moose fat contains roughly 35,000 calories. Wow. Gone God,

187
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.220
a little Marine. You shouldn't get that in the little tent with you.

188
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.000
<v 5>Yeah, I really should have. I thought I would hear a bear coming,</v>

189
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:45.960
but I didn't think Wolverine then the, uh, anyway,

190
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.820
he kept coming every day and I knew,

191
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.580
I knew it was going to be me or him kind of on that island.

192
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.120
<v 0>There's a scary little Fox. I heard I read.</v>

193
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.710
<v 5>Maybe Jamie could find it,</v>

194
00:10:55.711 --> 00:10:58.950
but that at one killed a polar bear in the zoo a while ago.

195
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.570
<v 0>Yeah. I'm not.</v>

196
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.370
<v 5>Shocked or OSHA's little things. Okay.</v>

197
00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.200
<v 0>You've seen him chase off bears. Oh,</v>

198
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.340
have them chasing bears off of Kilz wolves. All I was like, what the?

199
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.900
[inaudible] yeah. And they're so durable.

200
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.860
Like they get bit by bears and wolves and they just shake it off.

201
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.710
<v 5>Cool animals for real.</v>

202
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.553
<v 0>Yeah, man.</v>

203
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.370
<v 6>It is sad. I mean, you know, we were talking about it earlier that you know,</v>

204
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:27.690
all these businesses are going to go under like the, you know, you know,

205
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.840
child care and barber shops and stuff like that.

206
00:11:30.841 --> 00:11:33.600
It's like gyms and they didn't do anything wrong. They didn't,

207
00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.460
they did everything. Right. And you know.

208
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.380
<v 0>Yeah. I know maybe in hindsight,</v>

209
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.740
it's going to turn out that it was the right thing to do and that it stopped the

210
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:43.560
spread of the virus. And even though there was some flare ups here and there,

211
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.170
it made people more aware and the virus eventually goes away.

212
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.033
Maybe it's possible.

213
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:48.990
<v 6>Even if it's not the right thing to do.</v>

214
00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:52.170
I think people are just doing it out of caution because we don't know what it

215
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:52.470
is.

216
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.650
<v 0>But it's not the strategy.</v>

217
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.130
<v 6>There was other strategies that could be employed and they could have made</v>

218
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:59.290
people more cognizant than protecting themselves.

219
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.620
It would have really greatly slowed the risk of transmission.

220
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.740
And I think you could have, let people stay working.

221
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.110
We tell people they can't work. I don't, I don't like that. You know?

222
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.930
And I don't like that. Not just because it's unconstitutional.

223
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:16.480
I don't like that because I don't like people telling people what to do.

224
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.500
And I don't like that because I don't like one person being in charge of

225
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:22.660
figuring out what's right or wrong.

226
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.370
And I don't know if it's one person or a hundred people,

227
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.570
but what's right or wrong for an entire state of 40 million people to do it.

228
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.040
And to make up the, the mind for them based on what based on,

229
00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:34.960
just because you have voted into office, right.

230
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.280
That doesn't make any sense to me.

231
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.860
You should be dealing with like legitimate problems,

232
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:43.150
not controlling the population through some Orwellian mandate.

233
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.310
We just deem it that everyone has to stay home.

234
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.150
Then you even offer rewards for people in LA.

235
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.550
The mayor was offering rewards for people,

236
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:54.790
turning people in who weren't social distancing. Yeah. Yeah. That just,

237
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.630
that opens up a can of worms. And it's like, it's not all the wrong moves.

238
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.440
That's not going to help anyone that, you know, when I heard that though,

239
00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:04.630
the whole thing that you can basically snitch on somebody not wearing a mask or

240
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:05.464
not doing it.

241
00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:06.843
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

242
00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:12.250
<v 6>Yeah. You're you're setting people up to. Yeah. It's not a good thing, dude.</v>

243
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.970
<v 0>Did you ever see the article where it says, normally it's snitches get stitches,</v>

244
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:19.780
but in those cases it's snitches get RA, like they're even calling it a snitch.

245
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.200
<v 6>And it was an official thing that they released. Oh my God.</v>

246
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:25.660
Some marketing person was like, yeah, I got the thing.

247
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.000
<v 0>No, if it was an official thing or was the article on it,</v>

248
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:32.950
it was in the LA times or whatever it was. And I was like, what are you saying?

249
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.420
This is a terrible idea.

250
00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:38.080
You're encouraging people to turn people in for rewards.

251
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.030
Do you not understand psychology?

252
00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.770
Like there's people that have grudges against people. There's people that are,

253
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.930
they don't like their neighbor. They're just going to turn each other in. Right.

254
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.240
You can't give people that kind of power. Right?

255
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.710
Give people the power to just say, hits him. He's got the Scarlet letter.

256
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:57.850
And then, then, they look up your with a microscope.

257
00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:01.750
See if you've been social distancing a SUSE. I got my eye on you. Six feet,

258
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.760
six feet mask, hand sanitizer. Yup. Stay safe.

259
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:07.594
Stay home.

260
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.060
<v 6>Watch your head. I'm going into a cop car. I don't know what.</v>

261
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.340
<v 0>The they're doing, man. They don't know what the they're doing.</v>

262
00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.640
No one knows what the they're doing for them to tell us what to do.

263
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:18.280
Like definitely you have to know. Maybe you should do it that way.

264
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.100
Maybe you should wear a mask and you should stay home. But don't,

265
00:14:21.101 --> 00:14:21.910
don't tell me what to do.
