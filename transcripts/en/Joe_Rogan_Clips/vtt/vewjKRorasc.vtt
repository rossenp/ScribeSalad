00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. The what,</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.950
what are the misconceptions of you? Cause here's, here's the,

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.190
if you go to the knee jerk, conservative reaction,

4
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:15.300
you talk to people who are not interested in anyone that wants to be a

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:18.210
democratic socialist. They hear the name, Bernie Sanders,

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.010
the negative implications are that you are somehow or another going to take

7
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.590
their money. Right? Did you that annoying to you?

8
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.120
<v 1>Yes, it is. Of course it is. And also that I missed the Maduro. I'm a dictator,</v>

9
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.920
I'd love dictatorships and all that stuff.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.640
And the truth is Joe,

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.650
that if you look at the issues that I can't pan on and what I believe on,

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.020
they are really not terribly radical.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.200
They exist in many countries all over the world. For example,

14
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.090
just we can start on healthcare. If you'd like,

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.300
is the idea that healthcare is a human, right? Not a privilege, a radical idea.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.800
I don't think it is. It's not.

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.890
And the truth is we are the only major country on earth.

18
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.100
Many people don't know this. We're the only major country on earth,

19
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.220
not to guarantee healthcare to all people as a human, right?

20
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:09.540
And yet we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on healthcare,

21
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.570
the function. And you can argue with me if you want,

22
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:16.320
but the function of the current healthcare system is not to provide quality care

23
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.920
at all.

24
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
It is to make tens of billions of dollars in profit for the drug companies and

25
00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:23.100
the insurance companies. That's the function.

26
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.900
If you go to Canada and I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border,

27
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.350
you have major heart surgery. You were in the hospital for a month.

28
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.960
Do you know what the bill is? When you're going out zero, you got it.

29
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.110
You go to any doctor you want, you don't have to take out your wallet.

30
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.160
And yet they guarantee healthcare to all of their people and they spend one half

31
00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:43.440
of what we spend. That's kind of what I want to do.

32
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.950
And I don't think that that's terribly radical. We have a program now,

33
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:50.250
which everybody knows it's called Medicare was started by Lyndon Johnson back in

34
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.400
1965. It is a popular program.

35
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.530
All that I want to do over a four year period is to expand the today eligibility

36
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.830
age of 65. I want to take it out of the 55, 45, 35,

37
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.170
everybody over four year period. That's about it.

38
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.940
And I want to expand benefits to include a dental care hearing aids on

39
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.150
eyeglasses, uh, as well. That's about it. Not too radical.

40
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.430
<v 0>Well, that doesn't sound radical at all. No. When you say that they,</v>

41
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.620
that Canada spends less, obviously they have less people.

42
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:17.640
You mean less per capita.

43
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.780
<v 1>Half per capita,</v>

44
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.700
exactly per capita and the quality of camp is as good or better.

45
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:26.160
Do they have problems? Yeah, they have problems. Everybody has problems,

46
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.600
but overall,

47
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.010
the healthcare experts will tell you the quality of care there is as good or

48
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:35.310
better than it is in our country. So what's the hurdle. Okay.

49
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:38.280
I'll tell you exactly what the hurdles, the hurdle is. Exactly.

50
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:42.480
The same thing is in every other aspect of our lives, it's the power of money.

51
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.440
All right, listen to this. Over the last 20 years,

52
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.200
the drug companies alone have spent four and a half

53
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.030
billion dollars in 20 years on lobbying and campaign contributions.

54
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.280
That's what we're up against the knowledge.

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.090
And I mark my words within a short period of time,

56
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:06.700
you will see TV ads in California, all over this country,

57
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.640
demonizing Bernie Sanders. He wants to do this terrible thing to you.

58
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.290
He wants to do that. They have unbelievable amounts of money. Uh,

59
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.210
and politicians are frightened of that power. Give you one example. Uh,

60
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:20.770
back in 2016,

61
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.330
I got involved here in a little way with an effort on the part of the nurses to

62
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:28.210
control of the cost of prescription drugs in California.

63
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.880
You may recall that effort. I did it.

64
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.980
It was a ballot item in one state here in California.

65
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.520
Do you know how much the drug companies alone spent at the feet that epic,

66
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.230
they spent $131 million on one ballot item in one state.

67
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.240
All right, last year,

68
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.250
the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion a week ago.

69
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.910
I went to Canada with a number of Americans who are dealing with diabetes.

70
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.520
We bought insulin in Windsor, Ontario for one 10th, the price,

71
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.820
10% of the price, same exact product being charged at America.

72
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.950
So you got drug companies that are engaged in collusion and in price fixing

73
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.330
who are incredibly greedy. And the result is many elderly people,

74
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:12.790
many working people simply cannot afford the medicine. They need it.

75
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.170
This is it's unbelievable.

76
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.710
And the reason for all of that stuff is we are the only country in the world

77
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.720
that does not negotiate with the drug companies.

78
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.400
They can charge you any price they want.

79
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.460
And that has to do with the fact that we don't have a national healthcare

80
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.380
program. Medicare is not negotiating, et cetera.

81
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.370
<v 0>Is this something that can really be implemented inside of four years?</v>

82
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.340
It's an enormous endeavor.

83
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.380
<v 1>I want you to think back. Think back, Joe, in 1965, uh,</v>

84
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.680
you had Linda Johnson is president. And by the way,

85
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:44.200
this idea of national health care,

86
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.090
this has been talked about literally since Teddy Roosevelt is not a new concept.

87
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.670
Healthcare is human rights is what Teddy Roosevelt was talking about.

88
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:54.820
That's what FDR was talking about. Harry Truman was talking about it.

89
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.550
Kennedy was talking about it. Kennedy got killed.

90
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.800
Lyndon Johnson picked up the mantle and their idea was according to people in

91
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:06.490
their administration, we'll start with the elderly who are most impacted by,

92
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.330
by healthcare costs and sickness will start.

93
00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:13.630
And they did in 1965, without the technology we have today,

94
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.340
they implemented Medicare, 19 million people,

95
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.080
elderly people signed up in the first year.

96
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.390
So if you could slot a brand new program and have 19 million people

97
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:28.810
sign up with a technology that is way, way behind where we are today.

98
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.810
Why can't we over a four year period simply expand that program.

99
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:35.140
I don't think it's such a difficult operation.

100
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.070
<v 0>So when you talk about the drug companies and the lobbyists and the enormous</v>

101
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:41.320
amount of money that they spend is this,

102
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.040
does this exist anywhere else other than the United States lobbyists on that

103
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:45.874
level? No.

104
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.540
<v 1>No, of course not. Uh, and the reason, you know, in Canada,</v>

105
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:54.280
what you have is you have a national healthcare program and so forth and they

106
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.950
sit down and they negotiate with the drug companies.

107
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.010
They have their own approach,

108
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.520
but every other major country on earth says to the drug companies,

109
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.150
of course you can't charge us any price you want. This is a reasonable price.

110
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.310
Tell me what your profits are, what your expenditures are.

111
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.150
This is a price for us. You can walk in, you know, if you have an illness,

112
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.270
you could walk into the pharmacy tomorrow and the price has been doubled.

113
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:15.560
And you say to the pharmacist, what happened?

114
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:18.350
He said they just raised their prices. They could do it any day.

115
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.790
They want any price they want.

116
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:25.410
<v 0>No lobbyists are in general. When people talk about lobbyists,</v>

117
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.480
it's a, it's an unattractive term. We think a bit in terms of a negative,

118
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.470
we don't, we don't think of, oh, thank God. There's lobbyists. We think, wow.

119
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:37.520
There's someone with enormous amounts of money using that money to gain

120
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:41.000
influence on politicians. And it shapes regular people.

121
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.940
It shapes our lives mostly in a negative way.

122
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.480
This is the way most people look at it. I'm not saying it's correct. Why,

123
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.650
why do we have that system in place? Like, why do we have lobbyists?

124
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.010
Why is it legal for someone to spend exorbitant amount of money,

125
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.360
exorbitant amounts of money to affect our civilization,

126
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.950
to affect the way our culture.

127
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.730
<v 1>I know you've taken us into a whole new area. All right, let's look,</v>

128
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.160
can I let me detour? And I'll come back to

129
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.810
Today in America,

130
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.910
you got three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of the American

131
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.880
society. You don't see that on television too much. Yeah, no,

132
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:23.960
you don't three people. You got the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom.

133
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.710
92%. Listen to this. This is a statistic we recently saw,

134
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:32.330
came from the federal reserve over the last 30 years.

135
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.650
The top 1% has seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.

136
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.030
The bottom half of America has seen a $900 billion decline in their wealth.

137
00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.370
So what you have in America today is a relatively small number of

138
00:07:46.371 --> 00:07:49.580
incredibly wealthy people. And I deal with these guys. Everyday.

139
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.040
People are always talking about rich. You don't know what rich is,

140
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.140
what multi-billion dollar operations are incredible power

141
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.550
over our society. And if you wasn't in pharmaceutical industry, and last year,

142
00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:04.310
10 companies made $69 billion in profit.

143
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.550
You're sitting around right now saying, all right, that's great.

144
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:08.630
How do we do better next year?

145
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.620
What strategy do we have we to put a lot of ads on we're going to work with

146
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.300
others during the CNN debate that I participated in recently in the debate,

147
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.620
right? In the middle of the debate,

148
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.460
the drug companies and the insurance companies had an ad telling how bad

149
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.260
so-called, how bad better care for all would be. So they they're smart guys.

150
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.370
And they use their power over politicians. They use their power over the media.

151
00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.630
They spend billions of dollars on advertising on media to make sure that they

152
00:08:35.631 --> 00:08:39.080
make as much as they can in profit, but it's not any different with wall street.

153
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.520
It's not any different than the fossil fuel industry or the prison industrial

154
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:45.500
complex. These guys have wealth,

155
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.550
they have power and they could care less about the needs of working people in

156
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:53.090
this country. And that's the dynamic of American politics right now.

157
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.220
And in our campaign, look, we're taking them all on.

158
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.230
I know what makes a lot of people uncomfortable,

159
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.780
but we are taking on all of these entities and all of their wealth and all of

160
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.660
their power. And that's what a political revolution is about.

161
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.460
<v 0>So the real problem seems to be that they have this strategy of unlimited</v>

162
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:11.850
growth.

163
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.750
Not that they're not providing medication that people need to save their lives.

164
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.890
I mean, it's obviously important to have pharmaceutical company, of course,

165
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.410
of course. Right? So there's good that they provide,

166
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:25.440
but the business aspect of it is where the problem lies. Right?

167
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.150
<v 1>Right. Look, they have great researchers,</v>

168
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.260
but if you check how they even spend their money, you know,

169
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.900
they will tell you this, all of them, when you got research to develop,

170
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.420
we're charged with tackling cancer, we're tackling diabetes.

171
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.640
Alzheimer's the truth is of course, Leo,

172
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.470
but the bulk of their money is going often to what we call me-too drugs.

173
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.090
They make modest changes on a drug,

174
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.960
which really doesn't improve people's wellbeing in order to make profits.

175
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:53.190
So the answer is, yes, we need obviously vigorous research and development.

176
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.020
And by the way, your tax dollars,

177
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.940
all of our tax policy often goes to that research and we don't get the benefit

178
00:09:59.941 --> 00:10:01.890
of it in terms of lower prices. So.

179
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:06.660
<v 0>So it's just, it's a business model issue. It's a greed issue. You've got it.</v>

180
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.910
And how would one stop that when you're dealing with this kind of influence that

181
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:16.500
you're talking about with $69 billion in a year, I mean the resources they have,

182
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.360
how would you stop that?

183
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.910
<v 1>Well, that is kind of what we call the $64 question.</v>

184
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.610
And I'll tell you what I think this is what I believe.

185
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:31.380
If you think back on American history,

186
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.200
and you think about the real changes that have taken place since society,

187
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.640
you think about the labor movement and working class people standing up and

188
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:44.940
saying to their employers, we're not going to be treated like animals anymore.

189
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:49.290
You can't hire and fire as you can't work. As you know, 15 hours a day, we, we,

190
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.040
we deserve dignity. And you think about the growth of the labor movement,

191
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:54.000
millions of people,

192
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:57.660
beginning to slam together and fight you think about the civil rights movement,

193
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:01.410
you know, and it wasn't just Dr. Martin Luther king, Jr. It was again,

194
00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:04.830
millions of African-Americans in their white allies saying we're going to end

195
00:11:04.831 --> 00:11:08.040
segregation and racism in this country. Think about the women's movement.

196
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.790
A hundred years ago, women in America didn't even have the right to vote.

197
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.490
Think about the gay rights movement. Think about the environmental.

198
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.920
The only way that change takes place is when ordinary people come together

199
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:23.850
and stand up and fight and say that the status quo is not working.

200
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.780
And that's what I believe. And that's what we're trying to do. So with the,

201
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:32.160
the message of our campaign is it's us, not me,

202
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.560
cause I can't do it alone. Let me be very honest with you.

203
00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.970
If I were elected president tomorrow,

204
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.650
I can't do the things that I would like to do that I'm campaigning on.

205
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.450
Unless millions of people will working with me to tell the corporate elite that

206
00:11:45.451 --> 00:11:46.410
they cannot get at all.
