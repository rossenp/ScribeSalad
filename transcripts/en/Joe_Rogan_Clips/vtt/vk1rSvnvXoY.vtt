00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.860
You don't hear a peep about the revelations that are coming out

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.750
of this laptop, where ever came from Jamie actually had a really good point.

4
00:00:12.751 --> 00:00:14.520
I want to bring it up to you to see if this is possible.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.510
<v 1>Uh, so I've heard of people being able to hack into it like an iCloud account</v>

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.070
from time to time.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.420
And if you had that ability to have the account hacked,

8
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.110
you would need to clone it to a computer to then be able to decipher this

9
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.480
material. And then turn that into somewhere because you need to,

10
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.940
you can't say you hack the iCloud account.

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.120
Is that possible that then they then put it on a Mac book, turned it in and say,

12
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.380
oh, look, what's on this Mac book.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.180
<v 0>But they do have emails and signed receipts from hunter Biden,</v>

14
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.340
supposedly, supposedly, but they haven't denied that this is his laptop,

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.930
which would be the first thing that's.

16
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.800
<v 2>That's this is the key point. So, you know,</v>

17
00:00:57.801 --> 00:01:00.290
when we reported this note in archive, you know,

18
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.560
like when we hit send that first time, like you asked me earlier, you know,

19
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:05.780
there were millions of documents, right? Like there was,

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.010
we had a high degree of confidence in their authenticity because we had

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
verified a lot of them. You use your intuition,

22
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.080
you examine them from a kind of metadata perspective to see if there's,

23
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.290
uh, in Disha of forgery or alteration,

24
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.490
but you can never prove the negative that none of the documents has been altered

25
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.070
or forged by snowed in or by somebody else. Right?

26
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.500
Like you just don't know for sure,

27
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.890
with a hundred percent certainty until you hit publish.

28
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.900
And the way that you ultimately find out for sure is if you

29
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
publish that first report and the people that you're reporting about,

30
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:44.540
don't come back and say, what the are you talking about?

31
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.720
That's not a real document we didn't ever do that.

32
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:51.680
That's not our doc that's forge. And it was when the NSA didn't say that,

33
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:56.180
that we, I mean, I don't think I've ever been so happy in my career in my life,

34
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.630
because that was proof that the archive was real because of course they would

35
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.510
have said it, same thing. You know, last year in Brazil,

36
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:03.920
we reported this series of expos.

37
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.110
A's where my source had hacked the telephones of the

38
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.950
highest and most powerful officials in Brazil and the Boston area government and

39
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:17.240
gave me the text conversations that they were having that revealed a lot of

40
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.340
corruption. Same thing. Of course,

41
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.610
those people wouldn't verify or confirm to me that they were real before I

42
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.260
published. They wanted me to be in doubt.

43
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:27.200
And then once we publish and they didn't say those,

44
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.280
those aren't my conversations, those are fabricated. We knew they were real.

45
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:32.330
And we per se, so the,

46
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.220
just the fact alone that Biden has never denied either that the conversations

47
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:41.090
are real or that hunter actually brought his laptop to that Delaware repair

48
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.400
store. And, you know, we've submitted questions,

49
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:46.820
I've submitted questions to the Biden campaign and to hunter Biden asking that

50
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:50.990
question specifically, and they won't answer because of course they're real. Um,

51
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.280
but the, it was the, the journalists, the media outlets,

52
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:58.370
like CNN that took the lead first and saying that this was Russian

53
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:00.160
disinformation. Yeah. You know,

54
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.550
like the standard way to get rid of information that they don't want the public

55
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.920
to believe. They just lied about that. They just made that up.

56
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:10.870
There was never any evidence that Russia had the slightest thing to do with it.

57
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.950
Um, you know, and as to your question, the provenance is a little unclear.

58
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.870
Like that is kind of a bizarre story, right?

59
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:18.820
That like a hunter Biden brought in three laptops,

60
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.180
never bothered to pick them up the store owner out of curiosity and looked in

61
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:23.440
them once no one picked them up,

62
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.380
saw that there was all this evidence of corruption and gave it to the FBI and

63
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:30.160
Rudy Giuliani. I'm kind of skeptical skeptical of that story myself.

64
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.400
But why isn't the Biden campaign denying that and saying, no,

65
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:35.260
hunter never has been to that store in his life.

66
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.770
That's called complete lions and cast it's because it's probably true,

67
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.070
but it's definitely true that these documents are authentic.

68
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.610
<v 0>It sounds like a crazy thing to do until you factor in</v>

69
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:50.520
smoking crack. Once you factor.

70
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.380
<v 3>It is a factor, that's a factor.</v>

71
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.920
<v 0>Once you factor in smoking crack, like, Hey,</v>

72
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.290
you probably leave all over the place. Like you're out of your mind. Like,

73
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.990
and I don't blame him for that. You know what I mean?

74
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:05.250
He's obviously had a drug problem. And when you're smoking crack,

75
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.340
you leave laptops at repair shops. You don't pay for them.

76
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.960
That's it seems normal. Right, right.

77
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.060
<v 2>I mean, that's the least of what you do, right?</v>

78
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.780
Like if you're struggling with substance abuse is that does make it a lot more

79
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.390
credible. But here's the thing like,

80
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.920
this is why I don't think I've ever been just disgusted with my colleagues and

81
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:28.800
my profession as I have been the last three weeks because of this story.

82
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:33.180
And I'll tell you why in general journalists do not care

83
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.240
about where material comes from.

84
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.310
If it's a authentic and be newsworthy, for example,

85
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.990
in 2016,

86
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.270
somebody mailed a copy of Donald Trump's taps tax.

87
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.630
Our copy of Donald Trump's tax returns to the New York times just dropped it in

88
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:55.230
the mail and sent it to their newsroom. They got it to this day.

89
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:56.910
They have no idea who sent it to them. Well,

90
00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:01.830
let alone what the motives of that person was were or what they had to do

91
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:05.910
to get them. Did they break in commit crime? Did they hack, was it the Russians?

92
00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:08.910
Was it Aronne they, the New York times has no idea.

93
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:11.400
But then of course they've reported on the contents as they should,

94
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:12.660
because that's what journalists do.

95
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.370
And when asked when the lead reporter who's won, two Pulitzers was asked by NPR,

96
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.230
how can you report on a document when you don't even know who gave it to you or

97
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:24.330
what their motives were? He said,

98
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.180
what I would say and what all journalists should say, which is,

99
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:30.900
I don't give a about the sources. Motives.

100
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.380
Sometimes you get great documents from sources who have terrible motives,

101
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:37.920
you know, like they want to get vengeance on somebody. They feel, you know,

102
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.550
like deep throat leaked about the Nixon administration to the Washington post.

103
00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:43.740
Not because he was a Snowden, not because he was noble,

104
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.920
but because he was resentful that Nixon passed him over to be the director of

105
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:51.720
the FBI. So that's, so this idea that journalists are using,

106
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.370
I'd go, my God, this might've come from Russia.

107
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:56.970
Therefore we shouldn't report it as a complete corruption of the,

108
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.990
uh, function. But the reality, Joe, like, why are we even talking about this?

109
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:06.440
Like everyone knows the reality. I work in journalism. I have, you know,

110
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.660
lots of colleagues that I work with.

111
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.990
They have tons of friends in every news outlet up the Eastern,

112
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.060
up and down the east coast, from New York to Washington.

113
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:15.890
And then on the west coast, the reason is,

114
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.680
is because they're all desperate for Trump to lose. That's the reality.

115
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:19.970
They all want Biden to win.

116
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.830
And so they don't want to report any information or any stories that might help

117
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.250
Biden lose in part, because they want Biden to win.

118
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:31.520
But also because in their social circles,

119
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.900
everybody essentially is anti-Trump and pro Biden.

120
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.620
And they don't want to spend four years being accused of having helped.

121
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:40.251
Trump won,

122
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:43.610
like they were in 2016 when they reported on those emails that were leaked by

123
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:47.450
the WikiLeaks. And it's just fear. They don't want to be yelled at,

124
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:49.670
they don't want to be scorned in their social circles.

125
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.790
And so they're willing to abdicate their journalistic function,

126
00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:56.420
which is reporting on one of the most powerful people in the world and Joe Biden

127
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:57.681
in part,

128
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:01.700
because they want to manipulate and tinker with the election using journalism,

129
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:04.730
but in much bigger part, because they're scared of being yelled at on Twitter,

130
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:05.990
it's pathetic.

131
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.880
And it's going to ruin people's faith in journalism for a long time,

132
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.210
even more so than it are there. It already is ruined for good reason.

133
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:19.130
I now defend people who say fake news is you were saying, even though in 2016,

134
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:23.600
I didn't like it either because it's just true. It's just true. They will lie.

135
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.410
They will print things that they have no idea whether or not they're true if the

136
00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:28.580
CIA tells them to,

137
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:31.610
or if they think they can get attention from it about front for it,

138
00:07:31.611 --> 00:07:35.900
or a pause F uh, from their colleagues on Twitter. Um,

139
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.290
and I don't blame, you know, if you have faith in mainstream news institutions,

140
00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:40.600
you're really right. Rational.

141
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.270
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

142
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.420
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

143
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:51.820
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

144
00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:55.540
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

145
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:59.530
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

146
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.360
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Love Bubba.
