00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, but the problem is,</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.470
is no balance because it's almost all the stuff that they're angry about because

3
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:10.410
that's what they want to text and tweet and Facebook about.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.790
And very little of the stuff like what's the ratio of like really cool stories

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.350
like that make you feel good to like another horror in the news.

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.700
What's the ratio at 90 something to 1 97 to one, there's a new one.

7
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:27.690
There's a cloud of dust. That's coming from Africa across the ocean.

8
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.540
It's going to write this out. Really. This year was like the devil scripted.

9
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.370
<v 1>This year. What is it? What is this still dust? I don't know, man. No.</v>

10
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.790
<v 0>Dust could fly that far. All the way across the ocean in that crazy.</v>

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.020
Where is it right now? Like now this is something I got to con five or some.

12
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.483
What happens? It.

13
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.620
<v 1>Just storm. I don't.</v>

14
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.410
<v 0>Know. I just read it. I was like, oh my God. And they said,</v>

15
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:52.580
Yellowstone's ready to blow.

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.680
<v 2>That scares me the most.</v>

17
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.030
<v 0>The most, the most we're pretending we're over here pretending that this,</v>

18
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:01.160
this is all permanent and happens a few times a year.

19
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.490
<v 1>Oh, does it really fairly common, but what is it? Oh.</v>

20
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.220
<v 0>What does it do? Oh, this is this blown out of proportion for the news.</v>

21
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.130
I think just the headline sounds crazy. Headline sounds terrible.

22
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.140
<v 3>The one I found says it's a silver lining,</v>

23
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.350
so it's actually kind of maybe a good thing. Signifies a dry,

24
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.550
very dry layer in the atmosphere and hurricanes. Don't like dry air.

25
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.690
<v 0>So protecting protected church. Oh well that's good. Okay. Oh,</v>

26
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:25.370
see we jumped the gun. Oh.

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.950
<v 1>That sounds great. That was a great story.</v>

28
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.120
<v 0>How about that? How about hurricanes? How about the fact that every year,</v>

29
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:34.520
the sky becomes a monster and eats people.

30
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.000
<v 1>Throws cars through the air and. Yeah. Every year it happens and it's getting,</v>

31
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.760
it's getting worse. Right. And the fires are getting worse. Right?

32
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.350
They say that.

33
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.210
<v 0>And it makes sense that it's getting worse.</v>

34
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.380
And this is not an excuse for like the carbon emissions.

35
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.350
This makes it sound way worse. What is it? Oh my God.

36
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.500
Enormous cloud of dust for Africa. Sahara appears to be heading for Texas,

37
00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:59.690
Louisiana and Florida. It's like, it's a missile.

38
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.000
<v 3>Show. A dust storm, like taken over a city.</v>

39
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.060
<v 0>Oh my God. Is that really what it was like? I don't think so. I mean,</v>

40
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.340
that's not what the other article. I just read. Show that video though.

41
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.203
What does it say?

42
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.980
Massive dust storm turns the sky red and Sinise capital

43
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.900
somewhere way far. Oh my God, man.

44
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.340
<v 2>Look at that. I was in mission possible four, I think. Was it? Yeah,</v>

45
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.020
he was on like that sky ride.

46
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.090
<v 0>He got caught in. The dust was coming. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.980
Imagine living there and seeing that common. You're like, oh my God,

48
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.000
I'm going to be breathing dirt for the next hour. Like how long does it last?

49
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.670
How long has the dust storm last to imagine living there, man,

50
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.000
you got to go to the grocery store and you're literally walking through a dust

51
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:45.430
storm. So you dressed like one of them dudes from the Lord of the rings, right?

52
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.910
Right. Just scratched across your face. Like no, the, the guys in star wars,

53
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.100
what are they called? The, the,

54
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.720
the ones who lived like in the dirt and then the sand people, sand people. Yeah.

55
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.520
I don't, I think that was the name.

56
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.880
<v 2>There's a little while it had been a little ones. Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:05.140
There was a bunch of them. Those were the, uh. But those same people. No,

58
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:05.974
you walked.

59
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.990
<v 0>But who were the sand people? Yeah. Maybe that's it. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.110
<v 2>I think that's it.</v>

61
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.370
They're called [inaudible]. They're called Jawa. Yeah. Sounds right.

62
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.370
<v 4>I'm going to go with Chihuahua. I believe.</v>

63
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.600
<v 2>You should do a whole podcast of things. We kind of know that.</v>

64
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.570
<v 0>We're already doing it. I don't, I don't think man. I mean, look,</v>

65
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.280
there's no way that's the weather just stays the same. It doesn't stay the same.

66
00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:36.114
It's never stated.

67
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.570
<v 2>But we have to listen to climatologists a hundred percent. Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.570
A hundred percent sure. I dunno why it drives me nuts, but I, but.

69
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.440
<v 0>This is my point of view. Liga, legitimately, we have a bigger concern.</v>

70
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.740
One of the bigger concerns is we're not prepared. If anything goes sideways.

71
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.840
And that's what we're finding from this COVID thing.

72
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:55.800
We're not really prepared if things go sideways. Yeah. And, uh,

73
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.810
we definitely should be protecting against the human impact on the

74
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:04.140
climate change. It's real. We really have up the earth.

75
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.880
How ever, even if we didn't it up, this,

76
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.810
this place is so unstable. Even if it wasn't us,

77
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.070
the asteroids, the hurricanes that just exist and have always existed.

78
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.900
Earthquakes. We just,

79
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.990
we just don't live long enough to see enough of these to be scared of them

80
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.360
because our lives are so short and the life of the earth is so long

81
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.140
that these, all these tectonic plates, like when we go to a mountain, like, wow,

82
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:32.820
that's really pretty. Look what happened. It's.

83
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.290
<v 1>Alive. But things move it right now. This vault lava, if.</v>

84
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.250
<v 2>You sell like 10,000 years of second, you would just see the whole earth.</v>

85
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.710
<v 0>Oceans come in and out. And it's constantly doing that. It's always done that.</v>

86
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.690
We definitely should stop up the world that we're living in the

87
00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:53.700
world that we exist in. But even.

88
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.140
<v 1>If we didn't, this is so dangerous. This whole place is covered with the.</v>

89
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.540
<v 0>Predators. We are just super lucky. We killed.</v>

90
00:05:00.541 --> 00:05:04.080
Most of them often boxed ourselves away. And some people forgot,

91
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.820
except for those people. We've got to figure.

92
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.010
<v 2>Out that Astro. We're not looking at enough for the sky.</v>

93
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.600
And they were looking at 3%.

94
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.240
<v 0>Dude. Then you get different answers from different folks.</v>

95
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:15.060
When you ask them how long it would take before they could deflect something,

96
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:18.300
I'll forget. Well, I think Neil deGrasse, Tyson, what does he say? 10 years.

97
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.163
Do you remember?

98
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.490
<v 3>You gotta do, like, you got to figure out how you're going to do it. Um, Jesus.</v>

99
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.210
<v 0>Three weeks, bro. That it's too big. There's nothing you can do. I mean,</v>

100
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.680
if it's too big, there's nothing you can do.

101
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.420
<v 2>But I don't know. We could get a, just you have one week to live.</v>

102
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.020
Just could come on the news today. We just saw this asteroid.

103
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.710
<v 3>They said the Mayan calendar is supposed to technically end next week. Oh,</v>

104
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.573
Jesus.

105
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.830
<v 2>Always comes up though. And it's never anything.</v>

106
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.650
You know what shocks me is when you have at the leader of a cult and they have

107
00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:50.010
dooms day and the date and the time they all go outside and they sing and it

108
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:54.780
doesn't happen. And then that guy convinces them to stay and he goes, no,

109
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:56.970
it's a different day. And they all just.

110
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.860
<v 0>It was a guy who was taking out billboards.</v>

111
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:06.200
There was a billboard in Woodland Hills on Ventura Boulevard and it had this

112
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.780
billboard and he had a bunch of them all over the place.

113
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.170
But they had this billboard that showed the very day,

114
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:15.260
the earth was going to end. Like it was like, it had a date on it.

115
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.950
Do you remember it? I told him, I thought,

116
00:06:16.951 --> 00:06:20.420
I want to say it was like somewhere around April or may not.

117
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.350
Scientists says reading mine, calendar predicts end of the world this week,

118
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:28.580
the 21st. Oh, okay. Whatever in New York post.

119
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.550
<v 2>The post is trolling. You son. I like that.</v>

120
00:06:33.551 --> 00:06:36.700
We listened to people who just like put leeches on people that care.

121
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.930
According to the sun, actually.

122
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.150
<v 0>You know what, man, they, they did have a weird culture.</v>

123
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.850
The Mayans had a weird culture. It was it's really.

124
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.210
<v 2>I don't know much about it. I know the temple and they, they didn't,</v>

125
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:50.080
they kill virgins.

126
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.530
<v 4>I don't think they killed. Who knows. This is great.</v>

127
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:55.000
I don't know about this topic. I don't.

128
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.850
<v 0>Know if they really know what exact people they killed.</v>

129
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.080
They killed a lot of people,

130
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.770
but what's really interesting is how beautiful their structures were.

131
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.600
Like these amazing structures.

132
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.820
<v 2>I thought one of their pyramid, like those big steps,</v>

133
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.850
I thought one of them was for murder for their crops.

134
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.980
<v 0>Dave, Dave speculated that there was certain platforms that they would do, uh,</v>

135
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.140
sacrifices on the Aztecs.

136
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:22.000
Did I think the most sacrifices in one day and or it was like a

137
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:26.380
couple of days. They, they killed somewhere around. I want to say,

138
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.580
I want, I want to say more than 80,000 people.

139
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.770
They sacrificed when they, yeah. When they completed this,

140
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.990
uh, one of the temples.

141
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.100
<v 2>How do you bury them? They just killed them one after another,</v>

142
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.690
that takes a lot.

143
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.220
<v 0>Of the victims of human sacrifice by Mexico's ancient Mayans who threw children</v>

144
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:52.630
into Waterfield. Caverns were likely boys and young men,

145
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:56.470
not Virgin girls was previously believed. So wow.

146
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.620
They would human sacrifice by throwing children into Waterfield,

147
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.390
caverns kids. You imagine that though, like you,

148
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:06.880
you, you believe in superstitions so much.

149
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:11.980
You want to drown a kid so that, so that the crops come back.

150
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.560
<v 2>That's a sign. You people feeling out of control.</v>

151
00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:18.070
They don't know the answers to something they can't figure out. And then.

152
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.700
<v 0>But how crazy did the people in almost all religions,</v>

153
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.340
especially the ancient ones, they,

154
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.050
they lean towards these really ridiculous things like that.

155
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.470
Whose sacrifice first brings that.

156
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:36.880
<v 2>Up. But what if we do this killer kids? Yeah.</v>

157
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.640
<v 0>So make a sacrifice like Cain and Abel, right?</v>

158
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:43.480
<v 2>And if your God wanted that, your God wanted you to kill your children.</v>

159
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.870
That's a horrible God that you're.

160
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.210
<v 0>Or how about your God tells you to kill somebody when you're about to, he says,</v>

161
00:08:49.211 --> 00:08:51.550
no, stop. I was just testing. That's a up story.

162
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.130
<v 1>I mean, that is people.</v>

163
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.220
<v 2>Don't tackle. That's a normal story.</v>

164
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.800
<v 0>That's the God that makes the universe, told you to murder somebody.</v>

165
00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:03.530
And since you said, yes, you did the right thing by saying yes,

166
00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:04.880
because you have to trust God.

167
00:09:04.881 --> 00:09:06.920
Even if God tells you something that you can't imagine.

168
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.610
<v 2>It's real. Even if you write down your gut is wrong to murder your kid, you.</v>

169
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:12.470
<v 0>Have to murder your kid. Cause God's telling you to,</v>

170
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:15.080
and you were about telling you like, okay, good. I was just checking.

171
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.640
<v 2>Bro. I like you now. Bully.</v>

172
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:26.150
<v 0>Oh Metzker is actually a religious genius. Yeah.</v>

173
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.860
He knows a lot about religion. And he was explaining to me the story of, uh,

174
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.830
he gave me a much better understanding of the story, uh,

175
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:35.480
where I think his name is Alicia.

176
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.190
These kids were yelling at him and they called him bald head. Who's a bald guy.

177
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.880
And so, uh, he asked God to sick. Uh,

178
00:09:43.881 --> 00:09:47.840
she bear on the kids and it killed like 40 kids.

179
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.730
<v 1>She there this, I wish.</v>

180
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:54.320
<v 0>I could remember exactly what, uh, what, Metzker, how he explained it to me.</v>

181
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.940
But it was the,

182
00:09:55.970 --> 00:10:00.860
the insult was much worse than just calling him bald head. You just have to,

183
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.860
you have to put it into perspective with the time,

184
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.000
like the way he was saying it to him was much worse than we would imagine.

185
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.480
The term would be. We're we're looking at it in terms of modern language,

186
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.920
but it might still, the guy said, God sicked a bear on these kids.

187
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.070
I think master was saying that it might ma might've meant that the actually we

188
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:22.220
were trying to kill the man. Yeah. From there,

189
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.820
Elijah went to Bethel as he was walking along the road.

190
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:30.620
Some boys came out of the town and jaded him. Get out here, Baldy. They said,

191
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.700
get out of here. Baldy. He turned around to look to the, okay, the curse, this,

192
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.910
this, I think that's a real weird translation.

193
00:10:37.911 --> 00:10:39.920
I don't think that's the best translation.

194
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.250
The way I've heard it before is not written exactly that way.

195
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.260
They have more than one translation.

196
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.730
<v 4>Tons of translation.</v>

197
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.910
<v 0>He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them.</v>

198
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.650
In the name of the Lord.

199
00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:54.740
The two bears came out of the woods and mauled 42 of the boys.

200
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.720
I got a bear story. It seemed when I heard it before God maybe I'm wrong.

201
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.670
But if it felt like it was, um, in the ancient way of saying it,

202
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.940
and that was what Metzker explained to me. See if there's a final,

203
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:09.770
I got another, there's another,

204
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.310
there's another way of putting the words together. That Metsker was saying, no,

205
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:14.390
they were going to kill it. This is.

206
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.910
<v 3>A version that has like tons of translations of it. Holy.</v>

207
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.310
So there's lots of versions.

208
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.170
<v 0>Unless they were trying to kill the guy. Maybe we're looking at it wrong.</v>

209
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:25.460
And they were actually trying to kill the guy.

210
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.530
And I think that's one of the things that Metsker was trying to say,

211
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.930
like they were threatening violence to the guy sent a bear since I think two

212
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.730
bears. Didn't say two bear. Yeah.

213
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.010
<v 3>This is two female bears too. She bears.</v>

214
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.870
<v 4>Dude. I was.</v>

215
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.600
<v 0>Called due to Baldy and he's six bears. Yeah.</v>

216
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.150
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>
