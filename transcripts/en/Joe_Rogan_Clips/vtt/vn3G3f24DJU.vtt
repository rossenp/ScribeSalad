00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Man. I was just in Italy. Like the,</v>

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.000
like when you see like these little small family businesses,

3
00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:11.640
small family restaurants, like people that work there, you know, like, like the,

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.600
the father's the owner and the daughters, the manager,

5
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.240
the mom works in the kitchens like, wow, this is crazy.

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.990
But they still do the businesses. That was always a thing. Right.

7
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.910
You remember like family businesses on the east coast now it's like so rare that

8
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:29.190
people, they wear it like a badge of honor. Look, it's a family business.

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:31.590
Like all businesses is to be family businesses.

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.350
<v 1>No. Yeah. Everything went corporate though. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.950
<v 0>Man. There's certain places where that's not the case though.</v>

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.950
Like you gotta really appreciate there's one of the things you appreciate about

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.540
going to Italy. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

14
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.180
there's just like a bunch of little places. I mean, they have nice doors.

15
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.740
Like if you're in like Gucci and stuff like that, they have nice doors. Yeah.

16
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.300
But the restaurants and all the places where you buy things, they're not like,

17
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:53.860
they're like people's shops.

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.220
<v 1>Right. They're not boutiques. There's just like, yeah, I go to,</v>

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.420
I go to Craig's or I go to, yeah, Tiffany's not target.

20
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.460
<v 0>Or Walgreens or, you know, or Sears. It's no,</v>

21
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.130
not there's no corporate to, to it.

22
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.690
It's just families.

23
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.410
<v 1>It's weird. That keeps the money in the household too. Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:12.610
You know what I mean? It makes it real familiaral it actually works out. See?

25
00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:15.490
Which is that makes sense. And that's also why I say like,

26
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.850
I'm not real big into the reparations talk for black people. I mean,

27
00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.610
I don't really know the ins and outs of it. People keep saying like, we need it.

28
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.480
Get if a Twitter hate, I'm saying this, I'm saying, how about we knew? Why,

29
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.640
how about we incentivize parenting?

30
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.960
<v 0>Mm. But can you do that? Let's keep.</v>

31
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.600
<v 1>If, if you're watching your kids, instead of like, they're just out there.</v>

32
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.800
Cause I mean, like let's say is, isations talk about, I don't know,

33
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:39.960
infrastructure in black communities and if that's the case,

34
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:43.350
well then let's incentivize keeping the parents at keeping the parents together.

35
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.230
Or if they're split up, it's just like,

36
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.910
if you guys are teaching your kid and he,

37
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:49.190
and he's in school every day or he survives, you know,

38
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:52.190
eight years of the school shooting, every family gets like, you know,

39
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.430
a big bonus, you know, or if, if he makes the honor roll, you know,

40
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:57.590
like you guys get this, it's like,

41
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:59.470
you'd really be investing in your investments. It's like it take,

42
00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:01.630
they say it takes 18 years to make it back on your investment. If your child,

43
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.860
if you're, if you're incentive, advising 'em to go to school and for education,

44
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.180
it's gonna make better people in a better society.

45
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.060
<v 0>That seems good on paper. No, if you're saying incentivize,</v>

46
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:13.860
like how would you incentivize 'em right. I'm saying like, it's always good.

47
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.220
It's a good, it's always good to encourage people to be successful. So.

48
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.180
<v 1>Your kid test well on some of these like aptitude tests, right? Right.</v>

49
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.820
Then you get a stipend or something like that. I mean, it's like,

50
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.050
what do these we' talking about? Exactly. Exactly.

51
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.370
I don't really know the ins and outs of it,

52
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.610
but if it's about infrastructure of black communities, I'm so into it.

53
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:32.890
But it's also, let's incentivize keep, you know, being in the child's life.

54
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.530
Because for a lot of the, for a lot of the reason these kids are like, they're,

55
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:37.410
they're depressed and they feel like they have a chip on their shoulder because

56
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:40.170
nobody's home watching them. And they go to these gangs that they go to,

57
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.130
you know, these other things, right. Is because they're just not being watched.

58
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.320
<v 0>Right.</v>

59
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.200
I think the idea behind reparations is that some people at one point in time

60
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.480
were profiting off of slavery.

61
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.960
Those people have used that money and that money has become a part of really

62
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.800
large businesses. Many, many large businesses. Oh,

63
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.400
we talking about second from businesses. Well,

64
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.680
that's where reparations would have to come from in my mind.

65
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.760
<v 1>Oh yeah. But yeah. Yeah. General electric, yeah. Give me $1,500.</v>

66
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.240
<v 0>That's one that I think directly should be like, you have to wonder,</v>

67
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.240
like if you made, like, what if you used to sell babies? &lt;laugh&gt; right.

68
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.110
You had a baby selling in business, you sold babies. Right? Right. And then,

69
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.350
uh, your, your grandson inherited all your money from selling babies.

70
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.950
Okay. But the grandson's cool. I mean, he just, uh,

71
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.270
he goes golfing and he is not criminal. Right. It's fine. It's fine.

72
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.590
But is it fine because didn't his money come from baby selling. Right.

73
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.230
Where's it where, wait a minute. Let's chase this money.

74
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.940
Like here's it started out. It was just much money.

75
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.340
And then your dad got that and then his dad got that. Yeah.

76
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.820
And then like how many generations? Okay. So.

77
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.860
<v 1>You're saying that families who are known money, plantation owners money. Yes.</v>

78
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:53.620
Should have to pay that money back to the black community. Where did it go?

79
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.340
<v 0>Where'd the money go? What was he used for? No, you're right.</v>

80
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.410
I'm saying it's only a hundred years ago. It's 1865. Okay.

81
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.210
It's not that long ago. It's so recent'm.

82
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.970
<v 1>Giving to anybody that that's on the census that says they're black, right?</v>

83
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.650
To what, like an 8%, if I'm 8% black, I'm gonna get how much of this, you know,

84
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.530
uh, the Jones plantation, you know, fortune.

85
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.410
<v 0>I'm not saying that I'm saying that what the, the smart thing to do would to be,</v>

86
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:19.570
to figure out what damage was like,

87
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:24.480
if they really objectively looked at what damage was done to communities where

88
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.720
slavery existed for, I mean,

89
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.480
how many hundreds of years in this country before it was.

90
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.050
<v 1>400.</v>

91
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.600
<v 0>Years. Hundreds of years. Right.</v>

92
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.160
And then it ends mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then these people live in these cities

93
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.470
and they're discriminated against and they're locked up. Yeah. They would,

94
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.990
they would sort of one thing that I learned about who,

95
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.430
who was telling us about this, that they,

96
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.590
they would disproportionately arrest men for all. Oh,

97
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.150
the reconstruction era is to get them.

98
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.070
<v 1>The worst air for black people in America.</v>

99
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.350
It's not so much slavery as it is the reconstruction era,

100
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:58.950
because then people are just mad that black people are here. Yeah.

101
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:59.151
<v 0>Well,</v>

102
00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:03.500
they were also arresting them for like small crimes and making them work in

103
00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:04.940
prison. Right. Kidnapping.

104
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.580
<v 1>People. Yeah. Making indigenous servants and.</v>

105
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.700
<v 0>You become, it's just another form of slavery.</v>

106
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.460
It's like through this weird loophole, like you can make you a slave again.

107
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:13.740
Yeah. We just arrest you for hanging out in the street. Yeah.

108
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:16.620
And then we put you in this factory and you have to do this for us and we make

109
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:19.300
nothing. &lt;laugh&gt; and it's basically the same thing as slavery.

110
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.250
When you find out what they make in prison, when you go wait a minute, they,

111
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.730
they work for like 13 cents a day or whatever the they get. Right. Like what?

112
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.610
<v 1>That they figure out how to yeah. They they're modernizing slavery. Yeah.</v>

113
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.210
<v 0>Because somehow or another that's okay. Because we got 'em locked in a box,</v>

114
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.730
like they're supposed to be punished. Right.

115
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.450
They're supposed to be rehabilitated and taken it off the street,

116
00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:40.970
but we're gonna make 'em work for no money. I.

117
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.480
<v 1>Know white. Man's supposed, why don't we like black guys?</v>

118
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.960
We gotta start making white guys work for us.

119
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.280
&lt;laugh&gt; why don't we do the same thing. We're just as smart.

120
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.120
<v 0>Well, those,</v>

121
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.680
all the areas that were affected by that in the fifties and the sixties,

122
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.960
there's a residual effect that has never been addressed.

123
00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.960
Like the government has never said,

124
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.240
we've gotta figure out how to make these spots better.

125
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:05.960
Because the reason why they're so up is cuz slavery was there. Okay.

126
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.640
And then the subsequent, you know,

127
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:11.400
the race riots of the sixties mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and the,

128
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.040
this quest to, to, uh,

129
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.310
figure out what to do with those sort of stop short. There's not like a,

130
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:23.270
like, like Baltimore and places like that. Like Detroit,

131
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.910
south side of Chicago would just murder every year would just accept high. Yeah.

132
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:31.070
West side of Chicago, high numbers, high numbers of murder, right? Yeah.

133
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.630
Is west side of Chicago. Is that where it all goes down or? I mean,

134
00:06:33.631 --> 00:06:34.270
south side of west.

135
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.660
<v 1>Side. They're they're just really poor areas, but it's also like,</v>

136
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.060
how are these guys getting guns? Yeah.

137
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.780
<v 0>Well, if you can drive around, you can get a gun, then that's another.</v>

138
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.060
<v 1>Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; I just don't know, like you have money for guns,</v>

139
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:49.620
but you don't have money to like, I don't know, you know, get a backpack and go.

140
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.300
<v 0>To school. Well, also, if you see that around you all the time,</v>

141
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.980
the problem is you become a part of that world.

142
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.930
If everyone's got a gun everybody's shooting at everybody and you don't. Yeah,

143
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.330
no.

144
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.090
<v 1>You better get one. You.</v>

145
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.810
<v 0>Better get a gun. Yeah. You're gonna try to shoot at you. You gotta shoot back.</v>

146
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.170
Like what? Yeah.

147
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.450
<v 1>Like the' shooting, like yeah, yeah, yeah. You live in a war zone, bro.</v>

148
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:07.850
Go get a gun. That's what it.

149
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.330
<v 0>Is. It's an, it just like,</v>

150
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:12.210
it's not a war zone in terms of like it's official REI.

151
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.330
Uh declarationation by the government, but it's a war zone.

152
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:17.570
These are declared wars.

153
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.000
<v 1>Yeah. No people are shooting at each other. That's a, yeah.</v>

154
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:23.440
They're waring each other. Habi and McCoy is a it's it's a war.

155
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:24.200
It's a civil war.

156
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.880
<v 0>Yeah. This is it's like waring tribes. Yeah.</v>

157
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:31.080
Like if we have that in Siberia right now, I bet. Yeah. Bet.

158
00:07:31.081 --> 00:07:32.760
There' Siberian gang fights. Yeah. But.

159
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.640
<v 1>That's also, it's everywhere. That's depression and that's,</v>

160
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:36.320
that's another thing classism does. It's like,

161
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.240
they're telling you to kill yourself.

162
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.350
You're just poor and you don't know what to do. And it's like,

163
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.950
but that's not true. I mean, I'm a black guy like you guys. And I got,

164
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.670
I got family members who are, you know, in gangs like that.

165
00:07:47.671 --> 00:07:50.550
And it sucks down there. They're, they're so depressed because they,

166
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.830
what they say, they don't know how to get out of it. Yeah. And.

167
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.310
<v 0>They don't see any pathway and they don't see anybody who's gotten out of it.</v>

168
00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:58.990
So they feel like they're stuck. This is all,

169
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.260
lot of kids that grow up in bad situations. They feel inferior. Exactly.

170
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.301
And yeah,

171
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.380
they feel inferior because of the clothes they wear or how much money their

172
00:08:07.381 --> 00:08:09.220
family has or the, but then how do you empower.

173
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.053
<v 1>Those kids.</v>

174
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:14.500
<v 0>Through? Uh, I think through activities, I think, um,</v>

175
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:18.700
getting those kids involved in things that they can get good at that show,

176
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.690
they have value. And that with hard work comes rewards. I mean,

177
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:27.170
some of the greatest success stories in this country are professional athletes

178
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:29.050
coming out of impoverished neighborhoods. Yeah.

179
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:31.450
And they become these global superstars.

180
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.290
<v 1>Right. But then they stay in there for,</v>

181
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:33.930
but then they stay in their kids' lives though. Don't they?

182
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.370
<v 0>Some of them do it. Sure. Yeah. I mean there's but it's like, you can't,</v>

183
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.960
you can't fix all that's taken place, right? No,

184
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.200
you have to sort of figure out how to,

185
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.920
how to improve the way people look at life,

186
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.120
the way people interface with life. It's very hard if you're trying to do that,

187
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.800
but all around you is violence and crime and fear 100 and your all levels are

188
00:08:56.801 --> 00:09:01.800
all jacked up cuz you're in the hood and that that's not been addressed like

189
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.160
a serious health problem in this country.

190
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.920
That's like even an infrastructure problem.

191
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.280
We just sort of accept the fact it is an infrastructure problem.

192
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.080
<v 1>So if we're gonna put money back, if we're gonna repre,</v>

193
00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:14.240
if we're gonna repair these black communities, put money in the infrastructure,

194
00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:17.910
butll also, you've gotta incentivize incentivize parents to be there. Right.

195
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.990
<v 0>I think it's a good idea. I like what you're saying. Yeah.</v>

196
00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:22.950
Because you're not punishing them. No, you're just incentivizing. No,

197
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.550
I'm not saying.

198
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.550
<v 1>Like we shouldn't get money, you know, just for being black,</v>

199
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.470
I'm saying we gotta keep the parents there because that's what, that,

200
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.230
that Bill's a strong community. It really does. You know, I don't.

201
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.980
<v 0>Know a whole lot about Kamala Harris, but uh, I, I do know, um, you know,</v>

202
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.940
she's a very powerful wellspoken lady,

203
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.900
but she was talking once about this thing that they did,

204
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:45.020
where they had these parents, um,

205
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.740
be responsible for their kids truancy. And so they could go to jail.

206
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.900
Like the idea was, make sure this is correct. Make sure this is correct,

207
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:58.490
Jamie. Cuz I think the thing, what they were saying was they were,

208
00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.353
they were gonna,

209
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.730
they would have cops go to visit when a kid had been truent okay.

210
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:08.610
And they would sort of threaten the mother that she's responsible for the

211
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:11.850
child's truancy. The mother is not the father. Well, whoever was there,

212
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.770
single mother in this case of this one, one case they were talking about

213
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:21.800
and that this lady had to figure out a way to get her son to show up at school.

214
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.680
Hey I'm I'm I could go to jail, you know? And did, did it work?

215
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.920
I'm sure it worked right. I'm sure everyone was probably terrified.

216
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.840
But is that really what we want in America?

217
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.480
We want people to be scared that you might go to jail if you,

218
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.070
it doesn't go to school. So if the kid doesn't go to school,

219
00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:43.350
you're gonna lock someone in a cage that is so threatening. Yeah.

220
00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:44.310
Cause's it'.

221
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.350
<v 1>Home school. You know what I mean? I mean just cuz he's enrolled.</v>

222
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:48.030
It's almost like, you know, maybe I took it the sick day.

223
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.670
<v 0>Yeah. But if you wanna do homeschooling thing,</v>

224
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.110
I think you have to fill out paperwork, you apply for it.

225
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.670
You have to let them know that you withdrawing your kids in the school says.

226
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.740
<v 1>I think right. But how many truencies is this? This his first one.</v>

227
00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:58.780
I don't know how it's.

228
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.620
<v 0>Your first time offend him. I don't care if it was a hundred. Yeah.</v>

229
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:02.260
If someone's saying they're gonna lock you in jail.

230
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:05.860
Cause your kid doesn't go to school. That's bananas. That's bananas.

231
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.500
Like you he's 16 or whatever the he is. Yeah. Like when, when you were 16,

232
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:14.100
you were like, I was a latchkey kid. I was 14. I was out and gone.

233
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:14.980
We lived in different.

234
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.890
<v 1>Time though, Joe. I know, but you know, we had two, you know, race is race,</v>

235
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.650
you know, &lt;laugh&gt;, it's.

236
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.170
<v 0>Different for us. It's that's the only thing that bothers me.</v>

237
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:26.210
That's that just drives me crazy. The, the,

238
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.730
the idea of like the way you fix things is by scaring people and locking them

239
00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:34.330
up. That's how religion the GOLOG start, man. Yeah. That's that's really,

240
00:11:34.331 --> 00:11:37.290
that's how, that's how the Soviet union becomes this

241
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.400
empire of authoritarian re what's up. The.

242
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.960
<v 2>The jail sentences of some parents and multiple counties were in quotes.</v>

243
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:52.920
What she said an unintended consequence of a statewide law.

244
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.520
But I'm looking further into this in, uh,

245
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.600
this says this is from Los Angeles times.

246
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.040
<v 0>Well, it was that speech actually that she gave where she explained how she,</v>

247
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.600
she did it and how, how it was effective.

248
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.000
She was hard on people being truent I think your idea, what my point was,

249
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.760
I think that your idea is better cuz instead of punishing people for not doing

250
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:15.670
it incentivizes 'em for doing it. And if you could set aside,

251
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.510
imagine that as a project, right.

252
00:12:17.511 --> 00:12:19.870
You were saying that like it takes 18 years to see right.

253
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:23.430
If we could fund an 18 year project where they were doing that and just

254
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.310
incentivizing kids to succeed and all of a sudden they just started succeeding

255
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:28.190
like crazy. Yeah.

256
00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.710
Like what if we had a big jump because it was like financially VI,

257
00:12:31.711 --> 00:12:35.100
like you're competing for what's a great idea. Yeah.
