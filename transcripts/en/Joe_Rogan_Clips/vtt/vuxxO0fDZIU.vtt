00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. For people who don't know the,</v>

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.560
the docus series is called Sasquatch. And you look at it on Hulu, you go,

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.560
oh man, it's a Bigfoot documentary. Nope, not really. No,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.640
it's a lot scarier. &lt;laugh&gt; how did this come about? Like,

5
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:18.880
how did this project fall into your lap?

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.830
<v 1>Well, the Genesis of the pro really goes back to the fall of 1993.</v>

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.830
I was visiting, um,

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.110
a buddy of mine who was working on a dope farm and he kind of,

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.030
it was harvest season,

10
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:31.430
which is like particularly dangerous time of the year up there,

11
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.230
but he kind of got me a hall pass with the guy that owned the farm and vouched

12
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:39.670
for me, for me to, uh, parachute in for about a week. And, um,

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.100
he was something that didn't make it in the show is that, uh,

14
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.700
I went up there to do like a heroic mushroom trip with this guy. So the,

15
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.380
the, the day before, uh, the day that the, that the ship went down. Okay.

16
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.620
Um, we took about an eighth mushroom mushrooms each,

17
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.900
and went tripping around the Redwood. Now that didn't make it in the show. Okay.

18
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.370
But that night as we were coming down, we were, um, in the,

19
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.450
in the cabin, the A-frame cabin that belonged to the guy that owned the farm.

20
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.210
And these two dudes showed up late at night, covered in mud,

21
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.010
like splatter with mud soaked,

22
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
claiming that they'd just been to a nearby dope farm where they'd seen three

23
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.400
bodies. They, that were torn up like mutilated and these guys were freaking out.

24
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.920
Okay. They were, they, they seemed legitimately traumatized to me. They seemed,

25
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.000
they were exuding this like energy of like terror and having just seen,

26
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.441
you know,

27
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:37.480
mutilated bodies to the point where I was just trying to shrink into the couch

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.720
where I was, I was like, really not happy to be in that room at that point.

29
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.630
How old were you at the time? I was 23 years old. Yeah. Okay.

30
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.190
I was just getting, going in journalism, you know, and, um,

31
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.910
they, you know, they, the owner of the farm kind of pulled them off to the,

32
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.750
to the side and they were having a conversation in the kitchen and when they

33
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:56.670
were trying to keep their voices hushed, but these guys,

34
00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.710
they were so rattled also, like, I didn't know the signs at the time,

35
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.310
but now looking back I'm like they were on crystal. They were,

36
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.580
they were tweaked. Right? Yeah. And so they were like,

37
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:08.140
their voices were going up and down in volume, but they were,

38
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.820
but they were clearly saying that they just like seen these three bodies and

39
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:15.580
they seen like Sasquatch footprints at the murder scene and they knew it wasn't

40
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.700
a rip off. They were saying, because you know,

41
00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.540
it was all the weed had been harvested, but it was still there. Like,

42
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.340
so plants had been torn up and thrown around. Right.

43
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.770
But the bud was still there,

44
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.810
like hundreds of thousand dollars worth of weed if was a typical patch. And,

45
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.010
you know, it was like at one point the guy was like, are you sure they're dead?

46
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.610
They were like, yeah, with the, you not listening to us.

47
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:40.450
They were torn to pieces, man, they're dead, you know?

48
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.960
And a big foot killed these guys. &lt;laugh&gt; so,

49
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.160
and he kind of like got him out of the farm and like sat down and was like,

50
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:51.960
well, that was really weird. And we like had a laugh, you know,

51
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.840
but obviously that story stuck with me for the next quarter century.

52
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.840
And it was one that I kind of,

53
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.880
I told it around like a ghost story around the campfire kind of thing a few

54
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:01.714
times. Wow.

55
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.920
But then a friend of mine and a guy I collaborate with Joshua Fay,

56
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:09.040
who's the director of the series, Sasquatch. He, uh,

57
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.160
we were just finishing up another project together and he texted me outta the

58
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:15.760
blue and he become, he'd become a fan of this, uh, podcast,

59
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.350
Sasquatch Chronicles. Right. And he texted me. He's like, dude,

60
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:22.870
if we could find some sort of true crime story wrapped up with a Sasquatch

61
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:26.310
angle, like we'd really have something. What, what is a Sasquatch Chronicles?

62
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.990
It's a, I don't even listen to it. I've never listened to it, but it's,

63
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.030
it's a podcast that's like,

64
00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:34.470
it's basically like people's reporting their Sasquatch counters. Mm. Okay.

65
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.350
And so he sent me this text outta the blue and I hit him right back. I was like,

66
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.980
I might one. So he is like, dude, like, can you, can you look into that?

67
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:46.180
So the next step was to get ahold of, get ahold of buddy that was working on,

68
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.420
you know, that was working on the farm up there, get ahold of anybody.

69
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.020
I could find that worked in the dope game up in Northern Mendocino county was

70
00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:57.060
near a town called Branscomb that worked in that area at that time in the dope

71
00:03:57.061 --> 00:03:59.460
game. Be like, did you ever hear a story like this? Because,

72
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.890
but our thinking was, you know,

73
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.850
we can't like do a series if it was just me hearing that story in that cabin

74
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:06.930
that one night. But it's the kind of story where you think like,

75
00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:09.770
that probably spread beyond that one cabin. Right.

76
00:04:09.771 --> 00:04:12.330
Those guys didn't seem like the type that they were gonna keep that to

77
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:16.970
themselves. Okay. So, you know, after drawing a lot of blanks,

78
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.970
we finally like hit this one sort of information,

79
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.560
an ecosystem sub circle up there, if you will,

80
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.680
where people had heard that story and they were like, yes,

81
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.160
three guys did get killed, but there's, you know, there's, there's more to it.

82
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.600
Right. They were like, there's, there's a story behind that.

83
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.400
And it doesn't really involve a Sasquatch actually killing these guys.

84
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.600
But I don't, I mean, I don't wanna spoil the show frame, but hasn't seen.

85
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.590
<v 0>It for anybody who hasn't seen it. It's well worth the three,</v>

86
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.910
uh they're like 50 minutes or so. Yeah. Yeah. That's something like,

87
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.830
like a like hour TV show link. Yeah. Um, it's,
