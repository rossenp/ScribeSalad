00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.820
<v 1>It's weird, man. It's like a wonder what's going on.</v>

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:10.320
I wonder if like there's a thing that happens to a virus when it goes through a

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:14.670
number of hosts that it sort of dies off, that it becomes weaker, you know,

5
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.950
and that's part of herd immunity.

6
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.560
Part of herd immunity is a bunch of people develop antibodies for it.

7
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:23.700
And also like, like the Spanish flu, like the Spanish flu kind of just died off.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.840
Like they,

9
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.410
and there's a thing about Fowchee the other day said the virus plateaued.

10
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.720
The problem is like, you don't know what these,

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.530
how much of what they tell you is political.

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.860
Like how much did they not tell us while Trump was in office?

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.440
And how much are they telling us now? You know,

14
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:45.180
like in terms of what's safe and what's not safe, opening businesses,

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.300
what you can do for your health. Like, it's weird. It's a,

16
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.680
it's such a weird time.

17
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.250
<v 0>I guess the UK has a new version. That's more deadly, not more contagious,</v>

18
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:54.040
but more deadly.

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.040
Another new one that just came out yesterday or today it's like mixtape. I know.

20
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.720
<v 1>Oh God.</v>

21
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.850
<v 0>Yeah. And China's wide open. Yeah, yeah. Or that where the,</v>

22
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.200
the, uh, where it started. I saw this whole thing where they're just like,

23
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.690
nightclubs are all open. Everyone's like going crazy.

24
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.360
<v 1>I don't know about that. If that's real, that might be propaganda.</v>

25
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.720
You might get there. And the everybody's welded inside their homes, you know?

26
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.700
Yeah. Like who knows. But I do know New Zealand, which has zero cases at all.

27
00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.780
Like Dan just fought on fight island and he can't go home.

28
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.561
He's from New Zealand.

29
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.650
He can't go home until he's quarantined until February 21st.

30
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.290
So if that means maybe he, if he goes home,

31
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:37.770
he has to just sit tight and can't go anywhere and can't leave the house till

32
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:39.510
February 21st where he goes outside.

33
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.180
But they have like very strict quarantine laws.

34
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:46.110
When you get outside the country. I think they have that in America, too. Right?

35
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.250
What is this? Oh yeah, this is [inaudible]. But it's not real.

36
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.760
<v 0>These pictures are from the twenties.</v>

37
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.240
<v 1>A couple days ago. They do kind of have masks. Some of them do the one way.</v>

38
00:01:57.241 --> 00:02:00.270
I was like, she's she pulled out her mask to smell that dude, look at her.

39
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.580
Just smell you. Wow. February 20, 20.

40
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.040
No, it's March, I guess.

41
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.240
And here we are in 2021 and they're buck wild.

42
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.630
So what has happened? They've gone through, it's gone through the city. Do they?

43
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.130
They haven't been vaccinated. Right? Do they have a vaccine?

44
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.770
<v 0>I wonder, I wonder if or if everyone just got it, I'll look,</v>

45
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.610
I'll look through and see if they have a conclusion.

46
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.630
<v 1>Finally, people are accepting the idea that this might've come from a lab.</v>

47
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.280
It's hilarious. I, I brought it up once with Bret Weinstein and some

48
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.220
ridiculous liberal smear website was saying that I'm

49
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.670
promoting a dangerous conspiracy, that it emanated from a lab.

50
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.750
Like the lab is right there. It's not a conspiracy theory. The labs right there.

51
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.830
Like, it's not like there's,

52
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.560
we're making up the fact that there's a level four lab right there.

53
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:55.680
It's right there. There's two labs there, by the way, like,

54
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:58.320
what are you talking about? Is that a dangerous conspiracy?

55
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.880
Because thought it was because Trump, because Trump,

56
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.020
Trump was such a problem for so many people that any theory that you had,

57
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.900
if Trump was like, anti-China,

58
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.820
you can say anything that possibly would connect China to making a mistake

59
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.370
that causes virus to be released. You,

60
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.600
