00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 1>Experience. Some people think it would be better if all fights were five rounds,</v>

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:08.250
like a, like a world kickboxing fight.

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.500
And that guys would just also fight harder.

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.390
They would just go after each other for five.

6
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.180
<v 0>Rounds. It would definitely be more entertaining. I wonder.</v>

7
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.540
<v 1>Man, you know, it's like, you want to see a good fight,</v>

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.390
but do you want to see guys sort of pace

9
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.060
themselves to try to fight 12 rounds?

10
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.630
Or do you want to see guys go ham for six rounds? Like what's better.

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.330
I don't know. It's a good argument. You know, the,

12
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:37.200
the best argument that I ever heard, um,

13
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.580
about about fights is the one where for AZA Hobie was talking about the other

14
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:45.510
day. And I agree with him a hundred percent, like why you have a time limit?

15
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.720
Just like start the fight. Like, let's see what happens.

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.220
Like let people figure out when to, when to expend their energy, like,

17
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:57.720
why is there breaks? Why do you have breaks? You should.

18
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.050
I mean, if we had it like the early days of the UFC,

19
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
then you would really understand all the nuances of comedy.

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.220
You really can't sprint. Cause if you,

21
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.950
if you hurt someone and you don't take them out, you're going to get exhausted.

22
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120
He blew all your energy out and the fight goes on forever.

23
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.140
It goes on until somebody wins.

24
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.660
That's when you really find out what fighting is.

25
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.330
But if you're going to have boxing like boxing, those rounds like three minutes,

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.640
three minute rounds is a with just your hands. You can,

27
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
you can get a lot of action in there if you made that up to five, six rounds,

28
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.190
but I don't know, it's nothing wrong. It's also a great thing.

29
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.040
Seeing someone slowly figure somebody out or a five, six rounds,

30
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.890
and then start working them in the seventh, eighth, ninth, and 10th,

31
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:45.960
and get a knockout in the 11th or something like that.

32
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.770
It's always interesting to see someone break someone's style down,

33
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.720
figure them out, impose their will,

34
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:55.230
and then also see their conditioning as the fight goes on,

35
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.930
their superior conditioning, play out.

36
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.080
There's some guys that just don't get tired, man.

37
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.370
<v 0>Those are the ones that I love, especially in UFC. Yeah.</v>

38
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.970
Nate Colby, yo Ana, these people.

39
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.760
<v 1>Colby and Guzman this weekend. That's a big one.</v>

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.490
That's a big one with two guys with enormous gas tanks.

41
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.320
What a fascinating fight that is to me because people want to pretend Colby

42
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:20.154
can't fight.

43
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.090
<v 0>I know, right? When someone's a bad guy,</v>

44
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.800
that it sways everything in their reasonable, rational mind.

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.330
It's so crazy watching what he did to Robbie Lawler makes someone so undeniable

46
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:35.040
that it's ridiculous. Meanwhile.

47
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.560
<v 1>Dylan did. Now they're in less denial though,</v>

48
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:41.370
than they would be there in less denial than they would be. It's a real problem.

49
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.480
He's a real problem because that style of

50
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.820
shit-talking is infuriating.

51
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.320
And you can't say a thing to him because he's in a character.

52
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.760
So if he you off, you say something back to him. Yeah.

53
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.920
Why don't you go suck Trump's Dick. You'd be like I would, Mr. Trump is good,

54
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:03.430
man. I bet it's dictates like lollipops was, he could say whatever.

55
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.580
<v 0>Juan Colby gets it, man. He gets it.</v>

56
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:11.470
He's full Rick old-school Rick flare with a new style twist. And it's,

57
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.090
he's a real fighter man. Yeah.

58
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.090
<v 1>A real fighter. He's absolutely one of the best welterweights in the world.</v>

59
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.140
And this is a very, very close fight. But Kamara Uzman, um,

60
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.130
is he's a tank of a man. He's a spectacular athlete.

61
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.970
He's got big power. I mean, he only has,

62
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.360
I think a couple knockouts in his career,

63
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.900
but it's because he's learned how to Kickbox after he learned how to wrestle,

64
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:36.010
he was an elite wrestler,

65
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.870
but he does put people away and he hurt Tyron Woodley and he beat him standing.

66
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.370
And Tyron is a fan. And I don't think Tyron was at his best in that fight.

67
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.740
I think there was some issues that Tyron had. Uh,

68
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:48.940
but it doesn't take anything away from,

69
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.500
[inaudible] been running through competition, me as one loss in his career,

70
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:57.190
15 wins and the, then he talks about the loss on the podcast.

71
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.180
You just got caught a rear naked choke, uh, tapped, made a mistake. It happens,

72
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.010
didn't know jujitsu that well, but as a, an elite wrestler,

73
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.550
who's transitioned to become a world-class mixed martial arts fighter.

74
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.180
You don't get much better he's he was scared or he was scary.

75
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:15.250
Rather everybody was scared of him. Nobody wanted to fight him.

76
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.300
Everybody was ducking him for the law. You,

77
00:04:17.301 --> 00:04:19.960
you never heard anybody call out tomorrow. Ooh, Swan.

78
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.230
When he's running through competition, everybody was like, you know what?

79
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.100
This guy, and then they get to USVI and be like, no, no.

80
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.520
He's uh, he seems like a nice guy. I don't want to fight him.

81
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.240
<v 0>Colby's my favorite thing to watch right now. I think he's just, uh,</v>

82
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.650
he's just so he,

83
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:40.270
I think he really gets so many aspects of the basic part of this sport.

84
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.290
Right? Endurance learn, train and be entertaining.

85
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.100
<v 1>Dude. Have you seen his new suit? No, he's got an orange one now.</v>

86
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.060
And he brings that Donald Trump Jr. Book everywhere. He goes, I love it.

87
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.450
He's got an orange suit, just as gross as the blue one.

88
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.850
It is hilarious.

89
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.030
There's photos of him at the press conference with the orange suit, bro.

90
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:05.290
He is look at that suit. It looks like it costs less than the blue suit.

91
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.450
I didn't think that was possible. And he's a genius. Listen that this guy,

92
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.630
let me mark. My words. When this guy is done fighting,

93
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:17.380
he will be a huge pro wrestling star. Oh huge.

94
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.790
And he might do it quick. How about that? He, if he wins,

95
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.230
if that guy wins and maybe he fights Mazda dog, maybe fights one more time.

96
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.350
He goes right into pro wrestling and he may, I try to change.

97
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.330
<v 0>And what's crazy is that I've been pitching.</v>

98
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.440
We do a wrestling podcast at the comedy store and I've been pitching for years.

99
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:36.820
Now, read the book.

100
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.220
<v 1>He said he did the press coverage, reading Donald Trump.</v>

101
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.910
<v 0>Tutors book.</v>

102
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.680
And I've been pitching for years that the WWE is missing out on having

103
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:47.590
this pro-Trump super bad guy, character.

104
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.640
And then Colby comes out of nowhere and does it in real life, in the UFC.

105
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.130
And they still haven't done it in WWF. And.

106
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.030
<v 1>You can't call him a joke. Cause he smashes Robbie Lawler, smashes.</v>

107
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.790
Hofeld Osan. Josee watch him fight like, oh my God, this guy's a.

108
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.790
<v 0>Uh, record setting performance against Robbie Lawler. 500.</v>

109
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.030
Some punches landed.

110
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.390
<v 1>No, not just that. He mostly beat him standing up. Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.070
It was mostly a standup fight.

112
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.550
And he is the guy that you thought of as the wrestler.

113
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.730
And Robbie's the elite striker is a former world champion and Colby ran him

114
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:20.630
over. It wasn't even a close.

115
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.270
<v 0>And all this promo stuff that he does,</v>

116
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.430
how good he is at that it's cause he it's,

117
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.870
he wants to be it's cause he's a learner. He came and saw me perform at, uh,

118
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.920
at the improv in uh, in Florida, west Palm beach.

119
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.350
And afterwards we were in the green room and he's like, you know,

120
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:40.400
I learned a lot about timing and beats from watching you up there tonight.

121
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.500
Give them those, you know what I mean? How you,

122
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.920
how you get these laughs using your timing and your pauses in this.

123
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:49.970
I need to do more of that. I'm like, yeah, dude. Exactly.

124
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.300
It's so cool to watch a guy that's, you know,

125
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:56.990
while he being on top of a big business, a lot of, I feel like a lot of people,

126
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:00.260
you know, their egos, this and that, or it's just about the game, you know?

127
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.170
<v 1>Right. But it's a genius pursuit and you know, he has openly now said it.</v>

128
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:07.820
We talked about on the podcast, be saying it.

129
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:10.850
Now he did it on the Candace Owens show. He's like they were going to cut him.

130
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.300
They're going to cut him. They had told him that his style wasn't fan friendly.

131
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.800
And so he beats Damian mine in Brazil and calls him a bunch of filthy animals.

132
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:21.620
Everybody goes crazy and they're like, go hold on a second.

133
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.440
We might have something here. So he talked about it on the podcast, like, look,

134
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:26.420
I got to do something. My career is in jeopardy.

135
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.210
Like I'm going to create a character. So he created this character,

136
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.270
like I've called his fights before. And I called his fights early in his career.

137
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.230
Before that he was just a really tough guy who had a great gas tank,

138
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:39.170
who I knew from my friend cam Haynes. He trains with cam Hanes.

139
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.680
So just imagine the kind of gas tank this must have.

140
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.620
If you do anything with cam Haynes, you have to have a crazy gas tank.

141
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.590
<v 0>The scary thing about them, right? It's almost like, again,</v>

142
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.950
it's like a pro wrestling character already. It's like, oh, you don't know.

143
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.050
Even if, if you don't, if, if you don't somehow find a way to finish it,

144
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.290
you're stuck in rounds four and five.

145
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.380
Now it's always going to be championship rounds now with this guy and you're

146
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:04.910
going to be stuck in there with him.

147
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.140
<v 1>You can't take them out in one, two or three and you can't maintain that pace.</v>

148
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:11.540
And if you try to take them out and you empty your gas tank,

149
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.070
he never empties his gas tank. Right. And the thing is about his style.

150
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:17.900
This thing that he's doing, not as style,

151
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:21.470
but as a promotion style with the cheap suits and the book,

152
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.560
you think it's a joke, but then you watch his fights.

153
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:28.670
If you didn't have any information about him and his character and you just

154
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:32.900
watch his fights, you'd be like, man, this guy's driven. This guy's driven.

155
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.460
But then you add into that, this character and then everybody's pretending,

156
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.220
you know that, oh, that guy's a joke. That guy's a joke.

157
00:08:40.221 --> 00:08:42.170
That joke he's running over everybody,

158
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.130
everybody just because you don't like Trump. And this is like,

159
00:08:46.131 --> 00:08:48.560
it's a genius thing to attach himself to Trump.

160
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.640
<v 0>Right?</v>

161
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.750
And what's interesting is like even fighters that maybe have paid more dues and

162
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.410
are maybe are more respected. Like if you put them all at the table,

163
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:02.100
like when we were behind, when we were backstage at MSG and the rocks there,

164
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:05.850
and Dana's got the new BMF belt and all this stuff's happening,

165
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.380
they were doing that press conference for this one, a max Holloway's on one end.

166
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:14.490
And they have these guys on another and w being backstage sometimes as a

167
00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:15.090
blessing.

168
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.630
Cause you can hear things that maybe wouldn't notice if you're out front. Right.

169
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.390
And the roars and the cheers and the hoopla and everything was every time he.

170
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.880
<v 1>We had a good time just sitting there watching it from the sidelines. Wow.</v>

171
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.860
It was great. It's a, it's a,

172
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.930
we were seen as a masterclass in promotion and adaptation.

173
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.010
He adapted,

174
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.110
he created this character and this character is it's so obviously a

175
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:43.050
character, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I mean,

176
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:45.300
it's so obvious I'm wearing that suit on purpose.

177
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:49.200
Like the things that's good looking. No, he's trying to be a dork.

178
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.320
He's trying to be a pro Trump dork. Like if I was Trump,

179
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.690
I'd be a little annoyed. Yeah. I'd be like, Hey man,

180
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.150
I see what the you're doing.

181
00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.890
You're making yourself look a goof because you support me. And you know.

182
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.830
<v 0>Please tell me you're following Colby on Instagram. Right?</v>

183
00:10:04.831 --> 00:10:06.270
Of course I am the best.

184
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:09.480
The videos with the girls where he just comes out with his hands on their butts.

185
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:10.470
Hey losers.

186
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.233
<v 1>Hey nerds.</v>

187
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.300
It's straight up pro-wrestling and super high level pro

188
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.810
wrestling like, like promos that he shoot, look at this.

189
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.350
He's got a Trump hat on instead of, of Trump towers. It's.

190
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.740
<v 0>Can this style even matches it too. Right? Cause like,</v>

191
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:32.370
if he was just a quick round one knockout artist, almost like, you know,

192
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:34.140
sort of like McGregor re-ask right.

193
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.370
I still don't think it works as well as a guy that has a never ending gas tank.

194
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.350
<v 1>Never in the gas tank and,</v>

195
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:44.490
and can take a tremendous shot to he's a nightmare for everybody in the

196
00:10:44.491 --> 00:10:45.810
division. Colby,

197
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:50.670
Covington is a nightmare because he seems like he's playing,

198
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:54.900
he's doing these promos with all these girls in bikinis.

199
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.440
So reading Donald Trump Junior's book.

200
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.420
He's he's making it seem like he's a goof and you don't

201
00:11:03.421 --> 00:11:08.220
notice along the way that this guy stomping world-class

202
00:11:08.221 --> 00:11:12.330
fighters. I mean stomping them. Yeah. He's amazing.

203
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.280
What he's done is it's like a masterclass in promotion for all the young

204
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:18.114
fighters coming up.

205
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.240
I don't necessarily think everybody should do what he's doing. Right.

206
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.590
And you know, but if I was in, if I was in his camp,

207
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.670
oh I was one of his friends I would for sure be cheering it on.

208
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.750
I think it's hilarious. It's hilarious. And everybody's mad at him.

209
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.070
<v 0>Everybody, and it, and it, and it goes two ways, right?</v>

210
00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:42.930
Like even the people that are mad at him are still sort of laughing and you can

211
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:46.260
usually catch them laughing while booing in between booing.

212
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.650
<v 1>Why the suit is so genius. Yeah. See, he didn't have to do the suit.</v>

213
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.440
The suit is the piece.

214
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.680
Tinder is his stance because why else would he wear that suit? That's Sue.

215
00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.110
Here's what the here's what's genius about the suit.

216
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.560
<v 0>It's terrible. It's literally one of the suits from dumb and dumber.</v>

217
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.310
That orange suit is the one that likes Jeff Daniels or Jim Carey.

218
00:12:06.311 --> 00:12:07.144
One of them has.

219
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.740
<v 1>Almost, yeah. Close enough, but they're gross. That's the point. It's like,</v>

220
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.950
he he's doing that on purpose. He's got money. He's a,

221
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.070
he's fighting for the title. He's made money, right?

222
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.210
Oh my God. It's so silly. It almost is. It almost is. No, go back to Colby.

223
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.190
<v 0>Two suits that he owns.</v>

224
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.940
<v 1>He doesn't have that suit in, in the, uh, oh, it's just the recent one.</v>

225
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:40.300
The blue one. He doesn't have the orange one, his Instagram he's slipping.

226
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.700
He's only got the blue one. Ah, it's so funny. But here's the thing, man.

227
00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:49.870
At the end of the day tomorrow loose man is a nightmare for every

228
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.760
living human being. That's 170 pounds. Go back to that real quick here that.

229
00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.040
<v 0>We need to.</v>

230
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.540
<v 1>Get him that top tomorrow. Oops,</v>

231
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.540
man is a nightmare for every living human that's 170 pounds.

232
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:05.560
And if I wanted to see him fight a guy that I thought presented a bunch of

233
00:13:05.561 --> 00:13:07.330
unique challenges, I would say Colby,

234
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.160
because Colby has a great wrestling pedigree,

235
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.920
fantastic take down defense. He could wrestle his off.

236
00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.040
His cardio's never ending. We saw in the Robbie Lawler fight,

237
00:13:18.041 --> 00:13:19.870
he puts pressure on you. Lands.

238
00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:23.890
Ridiculous tries can stand in there against one of the elite strikers ever in

239
00:13:23.891 --> 00:13:28.090
the welterweight division in Robbie Lawler. So like forget all the Trump.

240
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:33.400
Forget all the character. And you almost should have a name for that guy that,

241
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.560
but that put that aside, just stylistically stylistically.

242
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:41.410
It's one of the best matchups you're ever going to find for Uzman.
