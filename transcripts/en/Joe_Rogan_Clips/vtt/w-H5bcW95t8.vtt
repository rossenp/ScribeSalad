00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
Is there any evolutionary benefit to narcissism?

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.300
Like where does that come from? Cause does it,

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:11.460
does it exist in the animal kingdom?

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.820
<v 1>Yes. Um,</v>

6
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.340
so if you think about it from an evolutionary perspective,

7
00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:24.050
which some people have narcissism seems to be really good for short-term

8
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:25.220
mating success.

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.230
Like if I go to a bar in downtown Austin and I give narcissism questionnaires to

10
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:31.220
all the dudes there,

11
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.430
the higher scores are going to get the most numbers over time.

12
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:35.330
That's usually what happens.

13
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:39.110
So narcissism is usually good for short-term mating and it's good for status

14
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:40.580
seeking power seeking.

15
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.290
So it's probably beneficial in those contexts and it's,

16
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.070
and this is where it gets a little weird because in stable environment,

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.730
like on research and hunter gatherer societies and stable environments,

18
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:54.500
if somebody's, you know,

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.180
cheating on other people's wives or stealing stuff or steals extra food,

20
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.580
people don't like that. They'll just kill them. I mean,

21
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:03.290
they'll just go have a hunting accident. If you're in,

22
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:07.400
if you're kind of the Dick and the, in the, uh, hunter gatherer society,

23
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.390
it'll take you out and you'll just,

24
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:12.080
won't come back because they just don't want you. Right. But, um,

25
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:16.010
so narcissism gets, uh, gets weeded out in those places.

26
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.640
But when things get unstable and things, you know,

27
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:22.790
uncertain people who are narcissistic can get a lot of resources and do really

28
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.760
well. So sometimes they do well, just keeps it around.

29
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.950
And obviously in big societies,

30
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:32.630
you can become powerful enough to hire henchmen and hire a PR agent.

31
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:34.520
And you can kind of build your own status and,

32
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.430
and do a lot more than you can in a hunter gatherer group where everyone.

33
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.730
<v 0>Knows you, what is narcissism when you define it? Like, what is the,</v>

34
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.800
what is your definition of Narcan? So.

35
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.130
<v 1>It gets a little more complicated when we're talking like this,</v>

36
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:49.400
I'm talking about grandiose narcissism and that's a basic,

37
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.370
yeah, it's, I'll step back. So when we talk about narcissism,

38
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.580
um, in the, in the psychological literature,

39
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:01.610
we're talking about three different things that are related.

40
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.040
The first of these is narcissistic personality, and this is a trait.

41
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.150
And meaning that people go from a high level to a low level,

42
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:15.350
it's not a clinical disorder. And then this trait, when it's grandiose,

43
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.030
we say grandiose narcissism,

44
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.590
it's this combination of sense of entitlement and a sense of superiority,

45
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:25.070
but also you get extroversion and drive and ambition,

46
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.170
call it a agentic extroversion.

47
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.460
So somebody who is driven and extroverted,

48
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:36.440
but also a little bit self-centered and antagonistic and entitled.

49
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.920
So that combination of traits, um,

50
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.790
kind of a pre-Madonna or, you know,

51
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.640
overconfident or cocky or whatever you want to call it.

52
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.060
That's what we talk about is grandiose narcissism. And that's just a,

53
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.860
like I said, normal trait, um, there's another form of narcissism,

54
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.290
which we don't talk about as much in the normal world,

55
00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:58.730
but that's vulnerable narcissism.

56
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:01.150
And these are folks that are kind of think they're really important.

57
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:02.830
Think they should be in a lot of attention.

58
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:05.350
Think they're the smartest people in the room, but no one really looks at them.

59
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.120
No one pays attention to them. So they get insecure, they get depressed,

60
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:12.130
their self-esteem drops. They think, you know,

61
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:16.090
why aren't I getting the attention I deserved? I'm kind of a legend. Um,

62
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.520
you know, so legend in their own minds. You know,

63
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.710
since I bet it's like basement narcissists, you know,

64
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:22.360
living in their mom's basement,

65
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:25.420
thinking how great they are and fantasizing about it.

66
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.760
And those more vulnerable folks, you don't see it,

67
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.830
the bars as much because they're in the basement,

68
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.040
but you see them clinically because they're depressed and they go see a

69
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.440
clinician and say, help me out. I'm anxious.

70
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.220
So those are the two normal forms of narcissism they're traits.

71
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:43.360
And then there's this clinical form or psychiatric form called narcissistic

72
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:45.640
personality disorder, NPD.

73
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.220
And that personality form of NAR personality disorder form of narcissism is an

74
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:55.210
extreme form of narcissism. We have a high level of it, you know, like Trump or,

75
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.650
you know, a lot of paleo celebrities or, you know, academics. Um,

76
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.900
but you also to make it a clinical disorder,

77
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:04.030
you have to have that impairment we're talking about.

78
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:06.250
So it has to be clinically significant impairment.

79
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.190
And that's usually the narcissism is so bad. Your,

80
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.650
your marriage or your relationships are falling apart.

81
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.620
Your work life could be falling apart. So sometimes you find narcissistic, uh,

82
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.250
really successful people in offices who are narcissists, but they,

83
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.320
they kind of destroy the office culture. They're just bad workers. Um,

84
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.850
and so you can destroy that.

85
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.690
You can make really poor decisions because your ego is so big. You just,

86
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.710
you know, invest in something and, and it just doesn't work out for you.

87
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:38.590
So you start dysregulating your, your financial decisions.

88
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.750
So you can make kind of those kinds of mistakes.

89
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.730
The big ones are usually interpersonal,

90
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.740
but when you have that kind of impairment,

91
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:46.840
it can be a disorder and then you get treated for it.

92
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.770
<v 0>The vulnerable personality disorders. Fascinating.</v>

93
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.230
That's a fascinating one because you see a lot of them on

94
00:04:55.231 --> 00:04:57.090
social media in particular, right?

95
00:04:57.091 --> 00:05:01.230
You see people that feel like they should be getting more attention than they

96
00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:06.120
are, and don't understand why and feel upset by that. Or shortchanged.

97
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.160
Social media.

98
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.260
<v 1>Is such a strange beast because it gives everybody the chance to</v>

99
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.260
have a camera and have the audience of a billion people.

100
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.330
So I could go on there and get a billion audience, but I have to earn that.

101
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.880
And so you've lots of people that go look,

102
00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:27.570
I can have a billion people in my audience, but I've, don't have those people.

103
00:05:27.571 --> 00:05:30.630
Why aren't they there who's screw me over and not give you my,

104
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.020
where are my followers? You know, the guy, the other day talking.

105
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.580
<v 0>About being shadow banned. And he had a thousand friends and I'm like,</v>

106
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.670
are you sure? Yeah. Are you sure your shadow band,

107
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.160
are you sure people are just not interested in what you're.

108
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.340
<v 2>Saying? Maybe you're just not that interesting, but that's.</v>

109
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.790
<v 0>The weirdest thing to ever say, like I'm being shadow banned.</v>

110
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.600
Do you have evidence of this? Like, what is, what is happening here?

111
00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.640
<v 3>Why are you kind of a outlaw?</v>

112
00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.390
<v 0>This is not saying the shadow banning is not real,</v>

113
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.190
but like people are using that as an excuse for why they're not getting the D

114
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.010
the attention that they deserve. I.

115
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.730
<v 1>Would be the next Joe Rogan. If it weren't for those dastardly shadow.</v>

116
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.640
<v 3>Banners, taking me down, holding me back, they.</v>

117
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.160
<v 0>Know that they can't silence me. They can't. Yeah.</v>

118
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.590
<v 1>They, that, if I got out there, I would change the world,</v>

119
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:20.560
but these guys are holding me back and you can see how that turns into like a

120
00:06:20.561 --> 00:06:22.660
delusional system. If you get, you know,

121
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:25.750
with sort of more schizophrenia where there's a whole world of people out there

122
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:26.740
trying to hold me down.

123
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.920
<v 0>To that, too,</v>

124
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.370
I wanted to ask you if it gets afraid that we might as well get to it right now.

125
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.740
Is there a connection between schizophrenia and narcissism,

126
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:40.720
because many people who are schizophrenia have these grandiose ideas of who

127
00:06:40.721 --> 00:06:42.490
they are or who they should be,

128
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.350
or where they fit in that are these ridiculously distorted

129
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:48.184
perceptions of reality.

130
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.240
<v 1>Yeah, I it's, uh, so grandiosity,</v>

131
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.420
you can see with narcissism, you know, with the, you know,

132
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:58.120
I have this fantasy about a great am, this illusion,

133
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.360
but it's usually within the scope of reality. So if I'm talking to somebody,

134
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.940
an artist is like, they're like, I'm a 10, I'm pretty honest. And you're like,

135
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:04.450
not.

136
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.010
<v 3>Really, man. You're just not you're okay. But like, maybe go back to the gym,</v>

137
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:09.730
you know, but.

138
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.540
<v 1>It's usually not, it's not, uh, it's not crazy. Right. Um, I was working in a,</v>

139
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.150
in a hospital with a woman who, who was a patient who said that she worked,

140
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.130
she was the tooth fairy. And she worked for Reagan as the tooth fairy.

141
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.990
I thought, well, that's a grandiose delusion, you know, Reagan wasn't president,

142
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:33.400
but he was still helping her behind the scenes. That's a grandiose delusion,

143
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:36.640
but you wouldn't call that narcissistic because she wasn't really,

144
00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:39.190
her personality really narcissistic.

145
00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:43.820
She was more schizophrenia and her presentation kind of flat affect, um,

146
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:48.130
a little bit strange, odd or unusual, um, uh,

147
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.780
anhedonia is of lack of feeling and stuff. But those weird delusions.

148
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.030
So you can have those grandiose delusions,

149
00:07:55.031 --> 00:07:57.130
but it's not quite the same as narcissism.

150
00:07:57.131 --> 00:07:58.660
It seems to be working a little differently.

151
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:03.160
And the other place you see them is mania with like bipolar disorder.

152
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.940
People get really manic and they get these manic phases and they're like,

153
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.180
I'm going to do this. I'm going to build this. I'm going to take over this.

154
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.910
My record's going to be the best. And, um,

155
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.280
and that mainly it can look like narcissism too.

156
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.410
And those are probably more closely linked.

157
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.990
<v 0>Um, w w w D the psychological disorders that we're aware of,</v>

158
00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:26.410
the ones like narcissism, the ones like schizophrenia, like,

159
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.510
do we know what's happening in the mind that causes a distortion of

160
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.370
reality? Is it, is it,

161
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.300
is it ego protecting you from the truth?

162
00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:39.790
Is it a chemical imbalance?

163
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:43.960
Is it a series of things that all coincide, like when you,

164
00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:48.820
when you have someone who's both a narcissist and possibly schizophrenia.

165
00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.210
<v 1>With narcissism,</v>

166
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:57.150
it's very hard to detect anything that's sort of clearly biological,

167
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:59.970
like, uh, uh, and this is true for all personality.

168
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:02.670
Really it's people have been looking at this last five years,

169
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:07.140
pretty hard for sort of biomarkers or neural structures. Uh,

170
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.950
you don't really see them very clearly. You do with schizophrenia. There's some,

171
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.110
I was going to say, it's not my area, and I don't want it. I say, Jamie,

172
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.870
if I say anything wrong, just check me and call me out.

173
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.600
Cause I don't want to screw up. Yeah.

174
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.030
<v 3>Please do that. You know? Cause there's.</v>

175
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.640
<v 1>That, you know, there's the old stuff about, you know, um,</v>

176
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.850
kind of plaque in the brain and things like with Alzheimer's you see some

177
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.350
missing, uh, neuro structure, but that's just out of my area. Um,

178
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.170
but with personality, you generally don't see it in there.

179
00:09:37.171 --> 00:09:41.430
You just can't find it so far. Um, and when you look at genetics, you, you know,

180
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.430
it's in the genes, but there's no single genes. It's like a swarm.

181
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.750
<v 0>So it isn't. So if your father is a narcissist,</v>

182
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.710
are you more or less likely to be a narcissist more, more,

183
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.960
but what have you learned from your father? You're like, my God,

184
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:54.920
my father has ruined his life.

185
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.750
Like many alcoholics have children that won't touch liquor and I've,

186
00:09:58.751 --> 00:09:59.990
I've known quite a few of them.

187
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.020
<v 1>Yeah. So in the, in the, in the clinical literature,</v>

188
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:05.800
they talk about that as sort of that identify, you know,

189
00:10:05.801 --> 00:10:09.050
you sort of identify with them or you do the opposite of the father saying the

190
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:10.730
alcoholic father, like you said, and you you'd be like,

191
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:14.660
I'm a teetotaler or your father's a narcissist. You become really nice. Yeah.

192
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.740
We don't really see that. What you tend to see. I mean,

193
00:10:18.741 --> 00:10:20.540
I was saying it doesn't happen because they know it happens.

194
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:24.290
But what you tend to see in the literature with these big family studies is that

195
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:29.210
traits like narcissism and all personality and really all mental disorders,

196
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.530
they tend to follow family lines. So they're heritable. Um,

197
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.730
but it's not really clear how that happens. So whether it's nurturing nature.

198
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.620
<v 3>Right? I mean, it's, it's in there, but we.</v>

199
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.300
<v 1>Don't know exactly what the genes are.</v>

200
00:10:41.301 --> 00:10:44.720
And when they start to look at the nurture question with a lot of personality,

201
00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:45.980
what you find is about,

202
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.760
and there's when they break these down into heredity care coefficients,

203
00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:52.670
they don't mean exactly what they sound, but generally find it's about 50,

204
00:10:52.671 --> 00:10:55.250
60% heritable. You're born with it,

205
00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.080
probably genetic and maybe 10% is parenting. And maybe the other 30,

206
00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:04.190
40% is something in the environment. That's just not really clear what it is,

207
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.370
the environment. Yeah. Just random environment. So that's why, you know,

208
00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:10.700
you have kids and if you, you have to, I have two daughters.

209
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.190
They're very different people. Part of that's genetics,

210
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:16.640
obviously they're very different and all, but it's also their environment.

211
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.800
I might've been a similar parent to both of them,

212
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:21.800
but there they have different friends. They grew up in a little different time,

213
00:11:21.801 --> 00:11:25.640
a little different culture and all those forces affect you in ways you don't

214
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:26.600
really understand.

215
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.110
So a lot of what happens to us is this non-shared environment.

216
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:34.700
We just can't really explain. The parenting is pretty small. Really?

217
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.130
Yeah. It's weird. Um,

218
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.810
what we say about parenting is that it really doesn't make much of a difference,

219
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:46.640
but it matters. So, so I have, I mean,

220
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.650
I have two daughters and,

221
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:52.430
and the idea that I could change them into the one end to the other,

222
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:54.400
through my parenting skills, you know,

223
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:57.580
I could take my one daughter loves to dance and I could turn her into the one

224
00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:59.950
that loves, you know, math and I can take the math one and.

225
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.200
<v 3>Turned it into it. Now I couldn't do that in a million years.</v>

226
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:04.690
They're just different people, no way.

227
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:09.340
<v 1>So I can't really shape my kid's personality very well. I mean,</v>

228
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.250
parents just can't really do that, but you matter a lot, you know,

229
00:12:12.251 --> 00:12:16.180
you put food on the table, you, you pride, you know, safe environment.

230
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:18.850
You're not threatening the kids. You know, you know, there's a lot,

231
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:20.200
you do as a parent that matters,

232
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.680
but you can't really fine tune your kids' personalities.

233
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.370
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

234
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.520
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

235
00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:34.950
They're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

236
00:12:34.951 --> 00:12:38.640
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

237
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.660
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

238
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:47.460
That's all we're asking you just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
