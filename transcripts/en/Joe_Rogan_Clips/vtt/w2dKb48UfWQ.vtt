00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.540
<v 1>But drugs are up in general, man. Like I just wanna say rest in peace to DMX.</v>

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.540
That's a sad one. Rest in paradise, man. There's I,

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.220
I wish I was able to tell him this story. I'm about to tell you,

4
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.980
cuz this is real deal. And it's like, he means so much to my family. It's crazy.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.883
Sounds nuts.

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.850
My wife was in labor for 18 hours and she had the doula there.

7
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.450
I told you there aren't some spiritual,

8
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.330
a Peruvian flute playing for 17

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.170
hours straight. The Peruvian flute music,

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.040
17 hours in the like the bro,

11
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.400
she starts freaking out. I'm like, yo, listen,

12
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.520
we have an hour left or we're gonna have to do C-section or whatever.

13
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.120
And she no chance.

14
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.360
So turn the Peruvian flute music off and I

15
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:01.000
put DMX on &lt;laugh&gt; stop

16
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.590
drop. That jumped out of her.

17
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.950
&lt;laugh&gt; I swear on everything. It's on camera. It's on film.

18
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.910
As soon as the Peruvian flute, music stopped DMX, Cavan,

19
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.070
he heard the dog and he came out. He just jumped out.

20
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.140
I just that's amazing. It's the CRA the, the doctor was going nuts.

21
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.540
He was cause everyone was just sick of that everywhere. I wanted to jump tired.

22
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:31.780
Right? I wanted to jump out the window from the music.

23
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.140
And so it just changed the vibe of the room, man.

24
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.940
He popped right out on everything like man, I can't make that up. The hood,

25
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.460
the hood. Nah, not on that. Would've been good one.

26
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.370
But he came out on the hit stop drop, shut him down.

27
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:49.450
Open up shop whoop. He had some jams.
