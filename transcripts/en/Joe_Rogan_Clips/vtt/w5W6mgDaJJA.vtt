00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 3>There's something special. And we're going to kick this off with a bang.</v>

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.280
Oh yeah. Something I don't know about something you don't know about,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.120
but we'll get into it. Okay. Yeah. Special. Yeah.

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.950
Tell me you can do it now. Sure. Awesome. Let's do it. What's happening.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.530
Well, you and your team, you, uh, picked fight for the forgotten,

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.940
uh, my nonprofit as charity of choice with Buffalo trace. Yes.

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.980
And we're going to do something really special for all your fans. Oh. But first,

9
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.990
um, I want to do something. I talked with Beau Beckman, his great grandfather,

10
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:40.530
his great-grandfather I think his name is like T H I dunno,

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.050
Eckert or something like that. He, um,

12
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.400
he started basically the modern day bourbon in America.

13
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.820
So anyways, I asked him, I was talking with Bo and say,

14
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:52.170
could we do something special for Joe?

15
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.470
<v 0>And he was like, yeah, what do you, what are you thinking?</v>

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.560
And so I talked to them, my buddy Ryan, who's the vice president of our board.

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.140
And we thought about it. And we were like,

18
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:05.970
what if we could get a barrel from Buffalo trace and we could give it to

19
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:06.804
Joe.

20
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.760
And so we thought we do a sample tasting for you and you get to pick

21
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.440
a single barrel select, basically, I guess I'm not a whiskey kind of sewer,

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.110
but basically you're about to be able to do a wine or not wine,

23
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:20.730
but whiskey tasting really,

24
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.000
you're gonna be able to pick out your own Buffalo trace barrel that doesn't

25
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:28.410
taste like any of the rest. What I didn't know about barrels of whiskey is that,

26
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.280
what is it? They come from like 70 to 90 year old trees.

27
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.540
And then each one of them starts off as kind of like this moonshine looking it's

28
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:38.970
clear when they put it in the barrels. But then the,

29
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.920
the taste of whiskey comes from like 67% of the taste comes from the barrel

30
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:47.910
itself. Really? Yeah. But the trees are all different trees, right?

31
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.360
So those things, I think they call them staves or something.

32
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
It's like a 28 to 35 of those things that make the barrel.

33
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.620
But they come from all these different tree. Lots. Yeah. The wood slats. Um,

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.720
and so they all taste different every barrel,

35
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.870
whenever it's a single select barrel. So I guess like,

36
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:06.600
what you do at Buffalo trace is they take a bunch of those barrels and they put

37
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:09.360
them all in there together. So it has one consistent taste.

38
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.140
But whenever you just take one barrel, it's always a unique flavor. Okay.

39
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000
So we've got a few of them for you to try whiskey nerds. I'm not a whiskey nerd,

40
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.850
but here we go. Here's going to be sample one.

41
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.830
And did you put that maybe to the left to right?

42
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.880
Yeah. But here here's the idea. I'm going to get hammered again,

43
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
need glasses. We got them right here. I got them right here.

44
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.380
They'll help us out. So did you like here's with water in it or no. No.

45
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.880
What am I? Well, this,

46
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.600
this is the idea or this is how we wanted to say thank you is you have to pick

47
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.380
your own thing. Yup. Here's the glass. Oh, this is hilarious,

48
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.700
but this is why we're doing it. It's nerdy. Sure. And this is.

49
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.790
<v 1>Don't worry. It's not a negative.</v>

50
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.550
<v 0>Yeah. Here. Here's why we're doing it is.</v>

51
00:03:02.551 --> 00:03:05.050
We wanted to say thank you from fight for the forgotten and Buffalo trace,

52
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.590
because we're about to do this big raffle for fight for the forgotten,

53
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.170
but you'll get 220 bottles yourself from whatever whiskey you

54
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.520
choose. 220.

55
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.820
<v 1>Bottles of whiskey. Yeah. But what we're going to do, you trying to kill me?</v>

56
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.400
<v 0>No, we're trying to give you a gift that you can give your guests.</v>

57
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.120
If you'd like to have the Joe Rogan experience logo on it.

58
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.550
I have a thank you from fight for the forgotten. So.

59
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.410
<v 1>This is sample number one. That's sample number.</v>

60
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.240
<v 0>One, going to the left with sample number.</v>

61
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.280
<v 1>One, sample number one. We'll give a little right there.</v>

62
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.650
<v 0>And then.</v>

63
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.170
<v 1>It's going to be a real problem. This episode, I'm going to start crying.</v>

64
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.350
<v 0>This is sample number two. Okay. And I can tell you about them actually.</v>

65
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.170
<v 1>Can you really, a little bit specifically.</v>

66
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.490
I like how they come in these little like whiskey flask type deal.

67
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.001
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:54.880
So they took this straight from the barrel and each one of these should have a

69
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:59.350
very distinct or different taste. And so basically you can choose it.

70
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.710
I mean, you can figure out, I don't know if you want me to take notes.

71
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:05.770
That's real nerdy, but they gave me one of these. Oh, those are great.

72
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.740
<v 1>Guys. What is it? Nurse Hanson tastes.</v>

73
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.420
<v 0>New barrel. 1, 2, 3, 4.</v>

74
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.270
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no. Are you going to remember that this right here?</v>

75
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.590
But at the time I get to Vail three, it's just guesswork. I did a pot,

76
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.780
a tasting thing. Once it was a tasting cannabis. Yeah. It was a, um,

77
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.800
cannabis cup. I was one of the judges. It was ridiculous.

78
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.600
I was a obliterated,

79
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.680
but by the time I got to like the third or fourth choice,

80
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.280
I had no idea where I was. I'm like, I couldn't feel my legs. All right.

81
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.510
So let's try number one.

82
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.590
<v 0>The sample number one is seven years and nine months old. Okay.</v>

83
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.200
Came from warehouse, L four on the fourth floor. It tastes good.

84
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.280
<v 1>It tastes good. Very.</v>

85
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.110
<v 0>Good. So now you would have.</v>

86
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.930
<v 1>To choose if you want this place. They make a good whiskey. Yeah, they do.</v>

87
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.670
<v 0>All right. And they've been so good to us.</v>

88
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.040
<v 1>That's number one. Now I'll try. Number two.</v>

89
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.740
I feel like such a dork. I'm smelling it and. Like, you know,

90
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:05.470
I didn't do that at wa like if I buy a glass of wine at a restaurant,

91
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.140
they poured for you. They let you smell it. I don't know what the I'm doing.

92
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:09.910
I pretend you would know.

93
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.500
<v 2>I I've. I've asked that too. Cause I used to serve it. I'd be like,</v>

94
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.570
why aren't people doing this? This seems so dumb.

95
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.880
No one's ever given one back on a rare occasion.

96
00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:17.810
You have to send one back because.

97
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.340
<v 1>Uh, one time I did have to send the glass back by the glass because I think they</v>

98
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.100
added open too long. I was like, I'm just saying I never do this.

99
00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:29.030
But I go with this tastes like vinegar. It was terrible. Yeah. Rarely happen.

100
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.540
But,

101
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.080
but I think that was at a place where the bottle was just sitting around for

102
00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:35.690
like a couple of weeks or something and nobody had ordered it. Oh, here we go.

103
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:36.980
Number two, number two.

104
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.940
<v 0>This one is eight years. Three months old.</v>

105
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.283
<v 1>Very good too.</v>

106
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.010
<v 0>Which one do you like between the two? Do you know?</v>

107
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.890
<v 1>They're both really good. I don't know. Yeah, they do make good whiskey.</v>

108
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.250
Like you T you can taste the difference. Like some people, like,

109
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.500
how do you tell what's the difference is this.

110
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.990
<v 0>Is how Bo said it. All you got to do is like,</v>

111
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:02.870
if you have four pancakes in front of you, keep it simple.

112
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.370
Which pancake do you like the best.

113
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.163
<v 1>Pancakes?</v>

114
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.170
It was three. Yep. Three has got a nice taste. That's that's a little unusual.

115
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.010
Is it ranked three.

116
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.690
<v 0>Is eight years. Two months old.</v>

117
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.400
<v 1>So three the oldest.</v>

118
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.630
<v 0>Uh, actually two's the oldest. So far, eight years, three months.</v>

119
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.460
<v 1>Two and three are my favorites.</v>

120
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.323
<v 0>Two and three.</v>

121
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.630
<v 1>We talk one guessing if you gave me one and said it was three,</v>

122
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.250
I'd be like amazing. I have good tastes.

123
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.720
<v 0>So you could see if one has more character and like a bolder flavor.</v>

124
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:38.270
One that you think your friends would enjoy more that don't know much about

125
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.104
whiskey.

126
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.793
<v 1>They're all the same.</v>

127
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.660
<v 0>They're all the same online.</v>

128
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.650
<v 1>I'm lying to these people. I can't tell the difference. They're all great.</v>

129
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.020
I think three was slightly different.

130
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.420
<v 0>Through a slightly different, but they're all tastes.</v>

131
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.220
<v 1>Like really good whiskey.</v>

132
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.380
<v 0>Do I need to take two? All right.</v>

133
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.670
<v 1>Here we go. We're going to do two and three. I narrowed it down two and three,</v>

134
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.730
but that's just like, if you gave me a bottle of one and told me it was three,

135
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.470
I'd be like, perfect. I really wouldn't know. Okay. I'm just lying. Here we go.

136
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.603
Here's three.

137
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:19.610
It's real good. All right. Here's two.

138
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.810
I mean, maybe there's a slight difference between two and three.

139
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.230
Let's just go with three. That's a good number three is a magic number.

140
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:34.220
According to de LA soul.

141
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.600
<v 0>Three is the magic number.</v>

142
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.580
And that one was born October 25th, 2012. All right. Perfect.

143
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.230
Cause that's when it was born. Yay.

144
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.890
So the base of what we're gonna do is we're gonna be able to do that and make

145
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:49.970
you a bottle of 220 bottles and we'll have the Joe Rogan experience logo on it.

146
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.360
