00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.270
Tech is a really important conversation to have with you right now.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.510
You're in the middle of this lawsuit with Google. Explain that.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
<v 1>So, uh, the first debate that we had in this presidential election,</v>

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.661
you know,

6
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:19.800
we had hoped that I would do well going into it and that people would go and

7
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:22.200
start their internet search and say, Hey, who is Tulsi? Gabbert?

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.750
I've never heard of her before. And so we went and got her, you know,

9
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.560
the Google ads set up, got them improved, everything was ready to rock and roll.

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.210
Uh, I was the most Googled candidate of the night, uh,

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.120
as I have been for every debate that I've participated in,

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.690
the issue was during that first debate. Uh, you know, while,

13
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:41.540
while that peak period was happening, our,

14
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.960
our Google ad account was suspended by Google with no explanation

15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.780
whatsoever. No like, Hey, you.

16
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.613
<v 2>Guys.</v>

17
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.250
<v 1>There was nothing like, Hey, you guys screwed up, fix this,</v>

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.473
we'll put your account.

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.140
<v 0>It's good to hear from y'all.</v>

20
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.760
<v 2>That is so.</v>

21
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.990
<v 1>And, and it, and so, you know, our tech guys are freaking out. They're like,</v>

22
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.080
man, this is what we were waiting for. And now you guys took our account on,

23
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:10.260
tell us we got to do to get it back up. And, uh, a,

24
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.900
we didn't hear back for a while. Once we started hearing back,

25
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:15.870
we heard back from different people with different answers, nothing clear,

26
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:20.130
cut to say, you did this wrong, fix this, we'll put your account back nothing.

27
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.160
And then all of a sudden, you know, hours and hours had gone by,

28
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:27.210
and then our account was reinstated without any explanation about what happened.

29
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.250
And you know, this is,

30
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.870
this is bigger than just the, the loss in opportunity that,

31
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:36.420
that my campaign had, uh,

32
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.660
because this happened on that night during that peak period,

33
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:44.220
it's a bigger issue about the power that this corporation has in

34
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:46.350
Google, in interfering,

35
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.090
essentially in fair elections and in what kind of information they are willing

36
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:52.020
to put in front of.

37
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.190
<v 0>Don't they own Boston dynamics to does Google on Boston dynamics. They did,</v>

38
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.750
and they sold it. Good move.

39
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.203
<v 2>Bring it.</v>

40
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.120
<v 0>Jocko's was ready for the real black mirror. I'm not in.</v>

41
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.590
<v 2>And you get, you get extra a double bonus credit for me right now, Tulsi,</v>

42
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.100
because that right there is so crazy. And for you to be like, yeah,

43
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.230
it's bad for me, but it's also bad for the American people.

44
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.890
I would have been stuck at bad for me. That is no.

45
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.520
<v 0>So gnarly that they did that. And it's so transparent.</v>

46
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.910
And very few people talked about it and very few people know about it. Exactly.

47
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.650
That's what it was so stunning about it.

48
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:31.620
It's like there's people pulling strings who,

49
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.450
why not undefined and no investigation into it until you

50
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.630
put out this lawsuit, there's really no way to find out.

51
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.440
<v 1>Yeah. It started to force that conversation that we're continuing to push to the</v>

52
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:47.550
forefront about how, particularly with Google and Facebook,

53
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:51.510
the inordinate amount of power that they have to,

54
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:55.170
as we sit in type in a Google search for whatever, or, you know,

55
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:59.290
what's popping up on our Facebook feed, they control that. I.

56
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.090
<v 0>Think that we have a real issue in this country with advertising in those things</v>

57
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.440
in Google and Facebook,

58
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.600
a real issue that it's never really been fully discussed.

59
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.270
Cause those things just sort of came up out of nowhere. You know,

60
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:13.780
we had social networks, we had MySpace and we had, you know,

61
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:15.640
we didn't think anything of it. And then all of a sudden,

62
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:19.900
not only are they here, but they have this extraordinary amount of influence,

63
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.290
they have algorithms. So it's not just, they're putting out what people put out.

64
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.060
They have algorithms that figure out what you're into and then show you that.

65
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.820
So if you just really in a conflict, which most people are,

66
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.600
they just showing you conflict all day long and it's getting everybody riled up.

67
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:38.800
So it's having a direct effect, whether it's planning coordinator or not,

68
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.010
it's having a direct effect on discourse in this country.

69
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.100
And I think it's one of the reasons why, what you were talking about before,

70
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:47.500
where you're either with us or you're against us.

71
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:51.220
And it's never been more hard line than it has been right now.

72
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.780
And all of this is because of advertising money and advertising. What, like,

73
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.700
what are you even selling all you're do.

74
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.240
You're just a portal to connect people with each other. And through that,

75
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.290
you're gaining an insane amount of influence and an extraordinary amount of

76
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.350
money is being generated. And we never agreed to it. Right. It's just sort of,

77
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:12.100
we just looked down, we saw the ad, oh, what are they selling? Oh yeah. Okay.

78
00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.170
That looks like a nice watch. And they would just all of us.

79
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.470
And then everybody's just getting bought and sold.

80
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.450
And it's happening to a point now where that is one of the

81
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.880
main town halls.

82
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.860
One of the main places where people discuss ideas in the world is

83
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:32.410
these social media networks. And they're not getting smaller.

84
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:35.350
They're only getting bigger. So they keep growing and they keep stacking up.

85
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.530
And whether it's Google or Facebook or any Twitter, any of these,

86
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.490
the amount of influence they have is insane. And they're just people, right?

87
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.880
They're just people. These are just regular folks. Like I know Jack Dorsey,

88
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:50.560
he's a nice guy. So regular person, the fact that this guy has so much power,

89
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:53.830
this company has so much power that any of these companies have so much power.

90
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.780
We are not ready for this.

91
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.620
And this is happening right under our noses and it's happening so quickly.

92
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:03.580
And then when something like your Google situation happens where it's like,

93
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.870
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not only you profiting, but now you're pulling strings.

94
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.500
You're showing us you're pulling strings. And everybody's like, whoa,

95
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.220
what's going on? Nothing. Oh. Or account got suspended,

96
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.870
whatever they're interfering with democracy and this weird sort of

97
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.340
semi legal way, you know, like you could just say the violated policy,

98
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:28.270
like what policy, what policy did you violate? Did they just cancel your ad?

99
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.420
<v 1>They still have not told us that. That's insane that.</v>

100
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.220
<v 2>You violated was being a viable candidate for president.</v>

101
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.673
<v 0>United States.</v>

102
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.520
<v 1>Exactly. Not only a viable candidate, but one that's saying, Hey,</v>

103
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.470
you guys are too big.

104
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.060
I'm going to break up these monopolies and provide the kinds of oversight and

105
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.620
accountability that will protect the consumer that will protect the American

106
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:55.150
people will protect fair and honest discourse, protect freedom of speech.

107
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.330
That's the issue. And that's, I frankly, that's a difference, um,

108
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.860
between me and, and somebody like, uh, mayor Pete, for example, uh,

109
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.900
other candidates. And he's not the only one,

110
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:10.670
but other candidates who refuse to take a strong position in

111
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:15.610
recognizing the threat to, um, our public discourse and,

112
00:06:15.611 --> 00:06:20.450
and our democracy that these tech giants have really within the hands of

113
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.540
just a few people. Um, you have, um,

114
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.430
I think this is just broken the news recently, uh, mark Zuckerberg, who,

115
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:31.040
you know, people were taught, he's like wanted to run for president,

116
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.760
not that long ago and was seriously considering it. And, and you know,

117
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:37.280
he's trying to start his own, uh, um,

118
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.520
cryptocurrency wants to have his own currency that he controls,

119
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:44.240
like the amount of power this guy has and that he wants to continue to grow, uh,

120
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.540
is, is so dangerous. He decided not to run for president,

121
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.730
but he and his wife started emailing, uh, mayor Pete's campaign manager saying,

122
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.370
Hey, here's some guys we think you should hire for your campaign.

123
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.590
And so they hired two of Zuckerberg,

124
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.220
Facebook guys who are now working for mayor Pete's campaign.

125
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.610
And so they're going to have a seat at the table. Should this guy get elected?

126
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.800
Which means Facebook is going to have a seat at the table.

127
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.660
<v 2>Nevermind. If he gets elected,</v>

128
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:12.980
when he's got two people that are inside track at Facebook, that show up there,

129
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.310
I don't know if you've ever done anything with Facebook as far as advertising,

130
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:18.710
but like people that understand how all that stuff works,

131
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.860
I've talked to them before. It's a whole science behind it.

132
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.940
So now that they're in there, he should get a big bump across the board. Yeah.

133
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.940
<v 0>I don't know mark Zuckerberg, but I don't like the way he drinks water.</v>

134
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.060
I've seen touch those little sips when he's being grilled.

135
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.080
Have you ever seen that? Did the weirdest little sips of water? I don't,

136
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:37.850
I don't trust a person, man. Woman,

137
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.240
or non-binary creature that takes sips of water like that.

138
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.030
That is just not the way you drink water. When you drink waters,

139
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:45.830
like I'm thirsty. I'm going to have some more.

140
00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.340
<v 1>That's how you should show me how he did it.</v>

141
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:53.450
<v 0>I'll show you we'll play the video. It's like this.</v>

142
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:57.560
He's like he puts this glass up to his mouth and like touches the lips of the

143
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.440
wife's like a robot. Why? Here we go, watch this. Look at this.

144
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.870
He's a robot pretending to drink. Watch this.

145
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.630
What the is happening here? What is happening here? The water didn't move.

146
00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.970
I never noticed this before. Barely moved. It barely like slit of that.

147
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.900
<v 1>JV was able to find.</v>

148
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:15.733
<v 0>That same.</v>

149
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.440
<v 2>So, so Tulsa, let me ask you this from a strategic perspective.</v>

150
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.520
All right. Do you feel like these moves,

151
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.080
like you coming out strong against Google,

152
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:30.860
Facebook saying that you could break up those types of monopolies strategically?

153
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.270
Are you thinking right now? Well,

154
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.540
maybe that wasn't the best call because you know,

155
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:39.920
you could have not been so strong against them and played along with them a

156
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:42.350
little bit and maybe they look at you and go through the list that,

157
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.620
that Joe went through earlier, which is, you're a veteran, you're a woman,

158
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.720
you're a woman of color. You're from Hawaii.

159
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.410
You've got this experience Congresswoman, Congresswoman, you got all this stuff.

160
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:53.360
They could look at you go, wow. Yeah, she's good.

161
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.580
We can get her on our side and then maybe, you know,

162
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.760
increase your chances of getting elected. Then you get elected, then you go,

163
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:01.290
okay. You know what I've thought about this? And guess what?

164
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.990
We're not doing it that way. And I'm going to break you guys up.

165
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.390
Do you think strategically or is that just,

166
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.450
you're the type of person you are is like, you know what, I'm just gonna,

167
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.000
I'm just gonna tell the truth from the get go. Is that basically what.

168
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.170
<v 1>I'm going to tell the truth and call it straight no matter what and, and, uh,</v>

169
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.330
you know, no matter who, who I'm dealing with, because, uh,

170
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:26.190
a that's who I am and B people are sick and tired of politicians

171
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.810
who play this game and do this political dance as they're trying to get people

172
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:34.020
elected and be like, okay, well, if I just, if I just say this,

173
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:37.110
or if I just kind of cozy up to these people or these interests,

174
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.080
they can help me get elected. And then when I win,

175
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:43.140
then I'm going to do the right thing. Well, guess what? As you,

176
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.990
when you win all of you, okay, I've got to win the next reelection.

177
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.620
That means I need more money from wall street. I need more money from Google.

178
00:09:49.621 --> 00:09:53.100
I need more money from these guys. So I can't say anything to him off just yet.

179
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.960
I'm going to wait until I get reelected.

180
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.310
Then that's when I'm really going to start to do the right thing. And,

181
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:03.120
and I think people across party lines are sick and tired of the same old

182
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:06.810
politicians who say one thing and do another,

183
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.480
and instead are looking for real leadership.
