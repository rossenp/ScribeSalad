1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Quantum physics is weird enough as it is. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.480
Without adding that,

3
00:00:07.481 --> 00:00:11.160
that movie was literally created by a channeler, right?

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.920
<v 1>A friend, friend of mine, uh, David Albert,</v>

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.640
who is one of the leading philosophers of physics.

6
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.320
And I should also give credit to philosophers here because they have been taking

7
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:21.230
quantum mechanics seriously longer though. Physicists have to be honest. Um,

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.990
so David is one of many people who got a PhD in physics and then switched to

9
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.270
philosophy because he cared about the foundations of quantum mechanics and no

10
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.230
physics department would ever hire him. Right. That's hilarious. And, uh, yeah.

11
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:33.070
I tell the story he going through the back door. Yeah.

12
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:33.910
I tell the story in the book,

13
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:37.150
like he wrote a bunch of influential papers as a graduate student,

14
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.180
and then he went and said, uh, I would like to, you know, make these papers,

15
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.180
my PhD thesis. And they said, no, that's not really serious physics.

16
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.580
And they punished him by making him write this incredibly technical mathematical

17
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.060
paper on quantum field theory, just to prove he could do it.

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.020
And then he's like this, I, I don't wanna take this anymore.

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.780
I'm switching fields. But anyway, he was in that film,

20
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.860
he was in what the bleep and they lied to him.

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.930
They represented themselves. They said,

22
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:04.850
we're doing a documentary about quantum mechanics.

23
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:08.970
And they sat him down for three hours and asked him all these questions,

24
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.090
you know, leading questions.

25
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:13.650
Like doesn't this mean that we're bringing reality into existence by looking at

26
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.810
it. And, and he's like, no, that's not what it means.

27
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.690
Let me explain to you then in the final film,

28
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.120
there's like 32nd clips of him going yes. Is a really important question.

29
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.280
&lt;laugh&gt; right, right. Like completely misrepresent what he said.

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.800
And so he went public after that and, uh, and complained about,

31
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.040
and about the film. And he did in a hilarious story.

32
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.880
There was a, uh, event,

33
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:42.830
some sort of convention put on in Santa Monica by supporters of the film

34
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.750
that they thought it would be fun to get all of the people who were in the

35
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:48.710
movie, what the bleep do we know and get them at, you know,

36
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.910
and talk to them and charge people money to listen to them.

37
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.750
But these people were not affiliated with the filmmakers.

38
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.630
So they didn't know that David Albert had been completely misrepresented in the

39
00:01:57.631 --> 00:01:57.711
film.

40
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:02.670
So they invited him and he goes to this event in Santa Monica and he gave a

41
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:04.660
talk. You know, he, he decided, you know, he wondered like,

42
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.940
should I just go at all? But okay, look, why not?

43
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.820
Let's reach a different audience. And he, he gave a talk and he said, look,

44
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.620
there's two things you can do when you are faced with fundamental puzzles of

45
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.500
reality. One is you can face up to what the world is trying to tell you,

46
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.780
and you can accept it and take it as what it is. No matter what you like.

47
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.890
The other is, you can choose to tell a flattering story about yourself.

48
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.090
&lt;laugh&gt; and the people who made this movie have decided that the mysteries of

49
00:02:32.091 --> 00:02:35.770
quantum mechanics are really stories about how they are powerful and have

50
00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.490
influence over reality and so forth. But it's all nonsense.

51
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.010
And the punchline is the audience loved it. They went nuts because what,

52
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.160
what they wanted was a guru of some sort. And like,

53
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:49.440
he was just as good a guru as anybody else. Right. Right. So, you know,

54
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:52.640
he had a better story to tell a reality based girl, a reality guru. Yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.240
Yeah. So I think you're right. I mean,

56
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.520
I think that quantum mechanics I've said before is, uh,

57
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.120
of all the theories in the history of science,

58
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.640
the most easily distorted and misrepresented in the popular mind.

59
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.760
<v 2>When my first movie came out,</v>

60
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.600
I think every review basically said something along the lines of worst movie

61
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.400
ever made. I hate this movie and now people do, that's your best movie,

62
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.080
you know? Like you've been chasing it ever since. So it's just weird.

63
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:20.990
How say with white zombie, when our first G I still remember this,

64
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.590
our first Geffen record came out. I saw the first review.

65
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.390
It was this magazine alternative press who two years ago gave me this

66
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.030
lifetime achievement award. And I had to read the review while,

67
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.390
except the award, the review said, this is the worst band ever &lt;laugh&gt;.

68
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.620
I was like ever come on.

69
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.940
And it said, this is the worst band ever ignore this band. Mm.

70
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.100
So there was something a, you know, there must have been something.

71
00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:49.840
Did you ever contact.

72
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.580
<v 0>The person who wrote.</v>

73
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.380
<v 2>That? No, I don't. I, back then, I was just like.</v>

74
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.340
<v 0>Just, I mean, like, I felt like maybe a few years later, once you.</v>

75
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.260
<v 2>Were really successful, I can't remember who it was. I,</v>

76
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.850
I used to be upset by reviews until I saw who wrote them. Mm.

77
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.650
Yeah. You know? Yeah.

78
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.090
<v 0>That's a.</v>

79
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.850
<v 2>A problem that guy.</v>

80
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.050
<v 0>I like it. A lot of critics or critics, cuz they really wanted to be writers.</v>

81
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.690
They just don't have a lot to contribute. And so they just on things. And it's.

82
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.290
<v 2>Just like you as a, when you're young and you're new and you're reading it,</v>

83
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.880
you think that the guy's writing it for writing. I asks you like, oh,

84
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:24.600
this dude must look like Lemy. He must be this hard guy. And ah yep.

85
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.080
And then you see guy like that guy wrote it. Oh him.

86
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.760
&lt;laugh&gt; you everyone else who ever writes anything again? I don't give a.

87
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.720
<v 0>Yeah. But the thing is about music is it's so subjective and you know,</v>

88
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.720
someone who grew up wearing the right eyes, odd shirts,

89
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:41.230
hanging with the cool crowd. They're not gonna, it's your,

90
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:44.470
music's not gonna resonate with them the same way it's gonna be with other

91
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:47.310
people that felt like they were outsiders. I.

92
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.143
<v 2>Mean,</v>

93
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.230
I can only do what I do and I don't know what would be popular.

94
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.830
Right. I don't understand popular culture in a way.

95
00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:00.190
Cuz when people are like gushing over something, a movie or something, I say,

96
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.500
I go, I hated the, that movie.

97
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.620
I know it made 500 million and it's everyone's favorite movie. I go,

98
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.500
I could barely sit through it and.

99
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.340
<v 0>Yeah, there's a lot of.</v>

100
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.460
<v 2>Those being made. Same with music. Like, I'd be like,</v>

101
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.820
oh I love the velvet underground. Everyone's like, but what about,

102
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.260
and they'll name something like, you know,

103
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.540
I don't wanna bash anybody but something so popular.

104
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:19.740
Like I go that makes me want to kill myself. When I hear that,

105
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.850
literally it's sickening. The.

106
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.930
<v 3>Thing is as well. Like what happens is like on a Friday, our gym,</v>

107
00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:26.930
like the whole gym will like be changing partners and stuff like that.

108
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:28.410
So if I come across someone who's a bit,

109
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.250
a bit less experienced and stuff and they're going out and they're not too sure

110
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:34.210
about what they're doing and you end up getting hurt. Like yeah.

111
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.410
So that's why I just like,

112
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.930
I took myself out of that and don't really do it anymore.

113
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.570
<v 0>Yeah. That's a wise thing, man.</v>

114
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.040
It's wise and I really wish more young fighters would appreci ate that early in

115
00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:46.200
their career because I think so many of 'em are compromised by the time they get

116
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.720
to the big leagues. Yeah. You know,

117
00:05:47.721 --> 00:05:51.680
by the time they get to beator or MMA with the UFC or you know,

118
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:55.080
even kickboxing guys, by the time they get to big fights,

119
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.680
they've already been dinged up too much and they can't take a shot anymore.

120
00:05:57.681 --> 00:05:58.360
Yeah. 400%.

121
00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 3>I've seen that Lord recently as well, like fighters, well like 27,</v>

122
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.520
28 should be just starting the prime now for the next four or five years.

123
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.640
And they're already punchy as. You know what I mean? Think.

124
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.120
<v 4>You said an interesting thing. Sorry sec. Alexand SEK. Cause I'm, you know,</v>

125
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.200
I'm boring and I'm always watching thought fight. Even if it's in, you know,

126
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:18.350
Russian and or reading his subtitles. And there's one about Alexander,

127
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:19.790
you say he's boring. No, I'm boring.

128
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.830
I just sit there watching fights all the time. It's that's just what I do.

129
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.270
But um, there's a video of sec.

130
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.270
And he was saying about now people aren't moving the feet. He said,

131
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:31.150
you watch the American styles and the British,

132
00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:33.670
they're all like doing this and the, the Philly shirt,

133
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.030
shell and stuff like that. They're not moving the feet anymore.

134
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.900
Which Anne was really interesting. Cuz if you look that the footwork is there,

135
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:42.940
footwork is so superior. Yeah. Him LA Himman LA him Lama.

136
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.700
When he waveed for Tony, bellue pop a great performance against him,

137
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:50.580
but he just put him in a position at the end of it. He was. Yeah. Not many.

138
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.420
<v 3>People realized what he'd actually done ever as well.</v>

139
00:06:52.421 --> 00:06:54.540
He he'd put him there and he were waiting and waiting and waiting.

140
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:56.260
When he got him there, he knew he couldn't get go out and he.

141
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.650
<v 0>Bang. Yeah. He would've amazing if we got a chance to see Floyd versus Loma.</v>

142
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.610
Oh God. When Floyd was in his project. Gotcha.

143
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.210
That would've been incredible to see which style superior. Yeah.

144
00:07:06.211 --> 00:07:08.410
Cause Floyd would move towards you like this.

145
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.770
He would just get right up on you and he'll.

146
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.850
<v 3>Be trying to like move on the back of him with the fly. Would've been amazing.</v>

147
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:13.530
You said.

148
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:14.330
<v 4>That like I think,</v>

149
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.570
I think it was one that when you said he was talking to someone where he was,

150
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.400
uh maywether Floyd, pretty boy Floyd and money.

151
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:23.760
Maywether it's like two different fighters. Really? Yeah. Hundred 100 percent.

152
00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:27.360
Yeah, because money maywether. Yes. The pretty boy Floyd was better on,

153
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.520
was more on his feet, sharper on his feet. More aggressively. Yeah.

154
00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:31.240
More aggressive.

155
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.920
<v 3>As well. He were.</v>

156
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.321
<v 4>A fighter around,</v>

157
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:34.440
especially with the right hands when he fought Philipp pen doing it and with

158
00:07:34.441 --> 00:07:35.560

174
00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:29.490
Dan bought some mushrooms Uh-oh and I guess they were legal there.

175
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.330
I never, I didn't Dan bought 'em and bought 'em on the,

176
00:08:32.331 --> 00:08:36.970
we were traveling in a van at the time and they were giant fresh &lt;laugh&gt;

177
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.890
mushroom. Not even dried. No man. It was like a meal.

178
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.040
And then he bought him. He like, you guys, you should take some,

179
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:48.320
you should take some. And I was like, I ate like the stem and it was massive.

180
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.400
I mean, it was like eating a burrito. And I was like,

181
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.320
and after like 20 minutes after 20, 30 minutes, it's like, I don't feel,

182
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.480
I don't feel anything. Dan's like, oh, seat to rest, man. I don't know.

183
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.360
&lt;laugh&gt;&lt;laugh&gt; I eat the rest of this thing. It massive thing.

184
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.520
And like I just instant start sweating.

185
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.160
It smells like a portabello mushroom seeping from my skin. And I yell,

186
00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.560
I yell to the driver. I'm like starting to spin out. I'm like,

187
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.710
&lt;laugh&gt; I like how to, how do you get this to stop? He turns around,

188
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.790
he only wore black and his shades on. And I thought,

189
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.790
I really thought at the time he was like Satan.

190
00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:26.390
He was like drink loads of beer &lt;laugh&gt; and I was like,

191
00:09:26.391 --> 00:09:28.710
what the? And then I just like in the back,

192
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.350
just like like freaking out for like two hours.

193
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:36.820
And then finally we stopped'm. 'm like we got, I gotta get the outta this van.

194
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.940
This is, this is in 2003. This is a long time ago.

195
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.780
<v 6>Know you were whiteuckling your girl, girlfriend. &lt;laugh&gt; I was like, I.</v>

196
00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.860

197
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:49.580
I just think it's the fresh air man. I'm like, uh,

198
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.260
we stop at this gas station in Belgium and I walk into the bathroom

199
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
with Dan and they're like, this woman's like speaking in French, like,

200
00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.770
you know it basically saying it. I was like, what the? She what's happening Dan?

201
00:10:01.771 --> 00:10:05.410
Like it costs money to pee here, bro. &lt;laugh&gt; and I'm like, what? He's like,

202
00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:09.010
I know, man, it's that crazy? And I'm like freaking out. And I,

203
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.010
all I had was like 50 euros and I put it on the tray and Dan grabs it and

204
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.400
puts it in my pocket and then puts like a cool there, like, like, dude,

205
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:20.560
it doesn't cost that much to pee. And like, uh,

206
00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.720
and then we both started laughing at that moment. And then it,

207
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.240
I turned the edge from that. And then it was an amazing experience.

208
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.080
We started being like laughing at like how clean their dumpster was.

209
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.280
Like they had a bright, like even the dumpsters here clean,

210
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.750
it was like bright. Rather he could eat off it. You could, yeah, he could eat.

211
00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.870
You could really truly dumpster dive here and be like eating a regular meal

212
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.190
America. And, but I,

213
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.990
but I got that panicky thing right there at the top and I swear that opened it

214
00:10:49.991 --> 00:10:51.910
up for me, man. There was no natural light in the back.

215
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.510
<v 6>Of the van. Also all the windows had the really dark, dark tint, black tint. Oh.</v>

216
00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.820
So we were just in this panic van.

217
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.700
<v 0>You know? Yeah. You need to get outside.</v>

218
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.580
<v 6>Yeah. I remember when the sliding door went open.</v>

219
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.500
It was like when they went into Willie wonco's place. Yeah.

220
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.740
<v 5>Oh the light came in and, and then it seemed like it was crazy.</v>

221
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.660
Cuz when we got back in the van three hours later, like our driver's like, dude,

222
00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:15.700
we gotta go. It's like, we've been here for 20 minutes. He's like,

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.370
<v 0>Colin. I love by the way. Very underrated. Oh yeah. Super.</v>

226
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.770

And I was thinking murder.

236
00:11:58.041 --> 00:12:02.320
He's like right now doing something that's way better than the show itself.

237
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.560
Oh interestinteresting Thising is so weird. Right? Cause like his standup,

238

239
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.590
And tough crowd fans. So they were laughing hard. But what that show was,

240
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.270

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.870
<v 7>It wasn't fake. Like they try to react reenact the ball busting.</v>

245
00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.220
And it's always, you can bear you. That.
