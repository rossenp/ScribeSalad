00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.590
At the heart of it in every expression of executive power,

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.240
right? And by executive, we mean the white house here, uh, the CIA,

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.450
the NSA, the FBI, the DOJ, right?

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:19.800
These guys exist as a part of the executive branch of government,

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.310
uh, in a real way. They work for the white house.

7
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.820
Now there are laws and regulations and policies that are supposed to say,

8
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:28.530
they're supposed to do this, and they're supposed to say,

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:32.280
they're not supposed to do that. Um, but when you look at federal regulations,

10
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.560
when you look at policies as an employee of government,

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.410
when you violate these policies,

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.240
the worst thing that happens to you is you lose your job because there's no

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.470
criminal penalty for the violation of these laws. Uh,

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.520
and so it's very easy, um, for,

15
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.710
for people who exist in these structures,

16
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.160
particularly at the very top levels of these structures to go look,

17
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.220
we have a given set of lawful authorities,

18
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
and these are defined very broadly, um, to, to give us leeway,

19
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.960
to do whatever it is we think is proper and appropriate.

20
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.250
And just now take that proper and appropriate.

21
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:15.120
And just from the perspective of any given individual,

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.010
right in any given president now intersect that with

23
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.070
what's good for them politically. Uh,

24
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.030
and that's where problems, uh, begin to arise. Now, uh,

25
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
the safety measure that's supposed to protect us from this, uh,

26
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.310
in the U S system in any democracy broadly is these people are

27
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.380
supposed to be what are called public officials.

28
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.850
That means we know their decisions. That means we know their policies.

29
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.170
That means we know their programs and prerogatives and powers like what they are

30
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:50.760
doing, both in our name and what they're doing against us.

31
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.050
And because they are transparent to us, we,

32
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:58.350
the people can then police their activities. We can go and disagree with this.

33
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.590
We can protest it. Uh, we can campaign against it, right.

34
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:05.820
We can try to come to present and do whatever they are,

35
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.850
public officials. And we are private citizens.

36
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.370
They're not supposed to know anything about us, right. Um, because we,

37
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.780
in relative terms, hold no power and they hold all the power.

38
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.900
So they have to be under the tightest constraints. We need to be, uh,

39
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.300
in the freest circumstances.

40
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.550
And yet the rise of the state secrets doctrine, right.

41
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:31.110
This whole classification system that goes all the way back to last century

42
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:32.910
about the middle of the last century,

43
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:36.330
I believe is when it really started getting tested in court. And I think,

44
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.890
you know, more about this, uh,

45
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.660
in many cases than I do when you start talking about, um, what happened in,

46
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:43.620
in, uh,

47
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.840
the FBI and the CIA and the NSA's sort of old dirty work,

48
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.240
um, in the, the 20th century is, uh,

49
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.470
they abused their powers repeatedly and continuously. Uh, they did active harm,

50
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.770
um, to domestic politics in the United States.

51
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.620
The FBI was spying on Martin Luther king, um,

52
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.160
and trying to get Martin Luther king to kill himself, uh,

53
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.840
before the Nobel prize, uh, was going to be awarded. Uh, in fact, after,

54
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.080
uh, MLK gave his, uh, I have a dream speech two days later,

55
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.710
uh, yeah, that's the, I classified him as the greatest national,

56
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.630
or I think it was the greatest, uh,

57
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.740
national security threat in the United States. Um, and get,

58
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.560
this is the FBI. This is the, the,

59
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.760
the group that everybody's applauding today saying, oh,

60
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.960
these these wonderful Patriots and heroes, uh, now I'm not saying everybody,

61
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:40.560
the FBI is bad. I'm not saying anybody, everybody at the CIA and NSA is bad.

62
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.820
I'm saying that you don't become a Patriot based on what you work. Um,

63
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.320
patriotism is not about a loyalty to government.

64
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.690
Um, patriotism. In fact, it's not about loyalty to anything.

65
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.390
Uh, patriotism is a constant effort to do good for the

66
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:04.110
people of your country, right? Um, it's not about the government,

67
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:08.980
it's not about the state. Uh, and this is, uh,

68
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.070
we'll, we'll get into loyalty, uh, later, because, you know,

69
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.370
I think one of the big criticisms against me that should be, uh,

70
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.050
talked about is, um, they go look, this guy is a disloyal. He broke a nose,

71
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.960
she did whatever, uh, uh, loyalty,

72
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.110
loyalty is a good thing when it's in the service of something good,

73
00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.260
but it is only good when it's in the service of something good.

74
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:37.130
If you're loyal to a bad person, if you're loyal a bad program,

75
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:41.090
if you're loyal to a bad government, uh, that, that loyalty is actively harmful.

76
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.790
Uh, and I, I, I think that's overlooked, but yeah,

77
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:48.350
when you get back into this whole thing about, um, sort of where it came from,

78
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.040
uh, why it happened,

79
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.950
how it could come amount of just the small group,

80
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.600
and then they could see lowly kind of poison by implication,

81
00:04:59.601 --> 00:05:02.990
by complicity, by bringing them in conspiracy,

82
00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:07.610
and then having them not say anything about it, wider and wider bra, uh,

83
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.630
body of people. And then yeah, once you've got enough people in on it,

84
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.540
it's much easier to convince other people that it's legitimate because they can

85
00:05:14.541 --> 00:05:17.300
go look, we've got 30 people who know about this,

86
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.890
and none of them have objected to it. Why are you going to object to this, uh,

87
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.680
all of this derives from that original sin,

88
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.760
which is in a democracy, uh,

89
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.330
creating a system of government that is in fact,

90
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:38.160
a secret government, a body of secret law body of secret policy, um,

91
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.030
did is far beyond what a legitimate government secrets could be.

92
00:05:42.031 --> 00:05:45.210
This is not to say like, government has, can have no secrecy doll.

93
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.160
If the government wants to investigate someone, uh, without having them respond,

94
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.410
right. We're talking traditional law enforcement. Sure.

95
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.450
You're not going to tell this mobster, Hey, you know,

96
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:56.580
we're going to start investigating you. Uh, we,

97
00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:59.930
the public don't need to know the names of every terrorist suspect out in the

98
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:03.710
world. Right. Uh, but we do need to know,

99
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.330
again, the powers and programs, the policies that our government is asserting,

100
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.630
at least the broad outlines of it, because otherwise, how can we control it?

101
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.410
How do we know if the government is applying its, um,

102
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.750
authorities that are supposed to be granted to it by us,

103
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.310
if we don't know what it is that they're doing. Uh,

104
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:25.970
and so this is the main thing,

105
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.020
and really the story behind the title permanent record, um,

106
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.200
is look, Joe, when, when you were a kid, uh, you know, when I was a kid, um,

107
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:41.050
when you were a teenager, right? Like what's the worst thing you ever said? Uh,

108
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.640
you know, did you say anything you weren't proud of?

109
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:47.270
Did you do anything that you weren't proud of? Something that today, uh,

110
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.830
in like the weakest of Twitter land, uh, you would get in trouble for sure.

111
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.790
Um.

112
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.720
<v 1>And that's one of the horrible things about kids growing up today is that they</v>

113
00:06:56.721 --> 00:07:00.140
do have all this stuff out there on social media forever.

114
00:07:00.141 --> 00:07:04.250
And they can be judged horribly by something they did when they were 13.

115
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.520
<v 0>It's exactly that, um,</v>

116
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.270
our worst mistakes, our deepest Chames, uh, were forgotten,

117
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.900
uh, right. They were lost. They were ephemeral. Uh,

118
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.290
even the things we did get caught for it, they were known for a time.

119
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.930
Maybe they're still remembered by people who are closest to us,

120
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:26.540
whether we like them or dislike them. Um,

121
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.020
but there were people connected to us now, uh,

122
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.950
we're forced to live in a real way, naked before power,

123
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.000
whether we're talking about Facebook, whether we're talking about Google,

124
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.060
whether we're talking about the government of any country,

125
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.370
they know everything about us or much about us rather.

126
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.960
And we know very little about them and we're not allowed to know more everything

127
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:53.780
that we do now lasts forever.

128
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:56.840
Not because we want to remember,

129
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.060
but because we're not allowed to forget just carrying a phone in your pocket is

130
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:05.870
enough for your movements to be more realized because every, uh,

131
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.830
cell phone tower that you pass is keeping a record of that. And, uh,

132
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.620
at and T keeps those records, uh,

133
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.860
going back to 2008 under a program called hemisphere.

134
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.720
If you search for hemisphere in, at,

135
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:20.270
and T you'll get a story in the daily beast about it,

136
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.890
the 18 key keeps your phone records going back to 1983,

137
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.720
if any of your listeners were born after 1983, right. Born after me,

138
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.080
or it might be 1987, excuse me, 1987. Uh,

139
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.900
if they were born after 1987 and they're 18,

140
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:40.100
is he customer or their calls cross 18 days network at and T has every phone

141
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:43.430
call they ever made, uh, rather than the record that had happened,

142
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:46.460
not necessarily the content that's on the phone call. Um,

143
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.440
and so let me turn this around for you, Joe.

144
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.580
Cause I feel like I've just been given a, given a speech. Um,

145
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.770
when you look at this stuff, right,

146
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:58.440
when you look at what's happening with government,

147
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.220
when you look at what's happening with the Trump white house,

148
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:05.940
the Obama white house, the Bush white house, you could see this trend happening.

149
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.100
When you look at what's happening with Facebook.

150
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:09.300
When you look at what's happening with Google,

151
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.100
when you look the fact that you go to every restaurant today and you see people

152
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:17.640
looking at phones, you know, you get on a bus, you get on a subway, you know,

153
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.740
you see somebody sitting next to you in traffic,

154
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.480
you see people looking at phones, these devices are connected all the time.

155
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.800
Now people are getting Alexa right now. Now people have, uh, okay, Google,

156
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:32.130
they have, uh, you know, Siri on their phones, they're in their house. Uh,

157
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.640
they've always got these connected microphones. Um,

158
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.620
where do you think this leads and what is it that gives you a sort of

159
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:44.070
trust in the system, faith in the system? Like how, uh, just,

160
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:48.810
just so we can start a conversation here. What strikes you about this?

161
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.250
<v 1>Well, it's completely alien and it's new.</v>

162
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.620
This is something that's unprecedented.

163
00:09:54.621 --> 00:09:58.970
We don't have a long human history of being completely connected via

164
00:09:58.971 --> 00:10:02.540
technology. This is something we're navigating right now for the first time.

165
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.790
And it's probably the most powerful thing that the human

166
00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:10.700
race has ever seen in terms of the distribution of information.

167
00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:14.900
There's nothing that even comes close to it in all of human history.

168
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:17.120
And we're figuring it out as we go along.

169
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.980
And what you exposed is that not only are we figuring out

170
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.310
as we go along, but that to cover their,

171
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.590
these cell phone companies in cahoots with the government have made it legal for

172
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:34.970
them to gather up all of your phone calls, all of your text messages,

173
00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:39.650
all of your emails and store them somewhere. So that retroactively,

174
00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:42.770
if you ever say anything, they don't like or do something they don't like.

175
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.730
They can go back, find that and use it against you.

176
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.520
And we don't know who they are. We don't know why they're doing it.

177
00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:53.180
And we didn't know they could do it until you exposed it. The,

178
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.300
the connection of human beings via technology is,

179
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.250
is both amazing and powerful and incredible in terms of our access

180
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:02.270
to knowledge,

181
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.430
but terrifying in terms of the government's ability to track our

182
00:11:07.431 --> 00:11:10.250
movements, track your phone calls, track everything.

183
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.480
And under the guise of protecting us from terrorists and protecting us from

184
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:18.230
sleeper cells, protecting us from attacks. Look, if they really are attacked,

185
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.340
protecting us from these attacks, that's great, but there's,

186
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:28.010
there's no provision in the constitution that allows any of

187
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:28.820
this.

188
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.450
And this is where it gets really squirrely because they're making up the rules

189
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.590
as they go along and they're making up these rules the way you're describing it.

190
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.940
This is step-by-step.

191
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.080
This has happened to sort of protect their and keep themselves from being

192
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.970
implicated in what has been a violation of our rights and our privacies and the

193
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:47.804
fourth amendment.

194
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.400
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I, I think, I think one of the things that, that</v>

195
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.930
everybody needs to understand, um, when you look at these things, um,

196
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.710
and the reason, you know, we talked about before, when I got this information,

197
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:05.320
why I didn't just put it on the internet and people criticize me for this,

198
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:08.140
they go, I didn't share enough information, uh,

199
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:10.210
because the journalists are gatekeeping, right.

200
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.820
They've got a big archive and they haven't published everything from it.

201
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:14.980
And I told them not to publish everything.

202
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.370
<v 1>Why did you the instruction? Why did you do that?</v>

203
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.040
<v 0>Cause, so again, it gets back to legitimate secrets and illegitimate secrets.</v>

204
00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.690
Um, some spying from my perspective, you know,

205
00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:30.120
career spy is okay. Right.

206
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.390
Agree if you have hacked a terrorist's phone, right.

207
00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:36.120
And you're getting some information about that useful. Agreed. Yeah.

208
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.740
If you're spying on a Russian general in charge of a, you know,

209
00:12:40.741 --> 00:12:45.630
rockets division useful, right. Um, but there, there are,

210
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.710
or lines and degrees in that where it's not useful. Now,

211
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.680
the examples that I just gave you, these are targeted.

212
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.140
This is where you're spending on an individual.

213
00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:00.090
There are known named person that is being monitored for specific reason that is

214
00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:04.050
related hopefully for people. Right? Well,

215
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.240
even for foreign intelligence and some,

216
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.030
you don't need a warrant strictly, although I,

217
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.040
I think they should have warrants for all of these investigations because they

218
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:16.170
established a court for precisely.

219
00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:19.830
This reason called the foreign intelligence surveillance court right now.

220
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.300
And there's not a judge in the world who wouldn't stamp a warrant saying, Hey,

221
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.490
uh, spy on Abu jihad over here. Right. Um, and if you want to,

222
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.970
uh, spy on, uh, another guy, uh,

223
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.120
Boris Baton off of the rocket division, right. That that's okay,

224
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:40.950
they're going to go with that. Um, but then you look at,

225
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.720
uh, these edge cases in the archive that I provided to journalists.

226
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.780
There've been stories that have come down where they've spied on journalists,

227
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:53.070
right? They've spied on, uh, human rights groups and these kinds of things.

228
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:57.900
I think people miss I'm going to throw up some slides

229
00:13:57.901 --> 00:14:02.400
here. So forgive me if this gets weird and I put up the wrong ones. Uh,

230
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.400
but since I came forward, uh,

231
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:09.360
this foreign intelligence surveillance court that the government says

232
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.620
authorized these programs 15 different times, uh,

233
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.580
was overruled by the first open courts to look at the program.

234
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.040
These are federal courts here, right? That said, uh, no,

235
00:14:20.041 --> 00:14:23.370
actually these programs are unlawful. They're likely unconstitutional.

236
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.340
When you start looking at the facts you see,

237
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.870
even within the context of the very loose restrictions and laws that apply to

238
00:14:30.871 --> 00:14:35.820
the NSA and surveillance, they say they broke their own laws,

239
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:39.840
you know, 2,776 times in a single year.

240
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.480
And then you asked about that thing that motivates me,

241
00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:44.820
like why I came here forward. Um,

242
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.900
we had been trying as a country, uh,

243
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.840
before I came forward to prove the existence of these programs

244
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.850
legally, uh, because this is our, this is our, uh, means of last,

245
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.860
uh, sort of recourse in our system. Right. We get the executive,

246
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:08.030
we got the legislature, we got, uh, the judiciary, right? Uh,

247
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.820
so Congress makes the laws, the executive supposed to carry them out.

248
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:15.650
The courts are supposed to play referee. The executive, uh,

249
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.120
had broken the laws. Uh, Congress was turning a blind eye to the laws,

250
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.820
uh, and the courts were,

251
00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:26.900
and this is just months before I came forward going, well,

252
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:29.660
it does appear, uh,

253
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:34.280
that the ACLU and amnesty international, like all of these, um,

254
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.350
uh, human rights groups and non-governmental organizations, uh,

255
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.480
had established that, you know, these programs are likely unlawful.

256
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.650
They likely exist. Um, they're simply classified,

257
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.640
but the government responded, uh, with this argument that you just saw, uh,

258
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.080
saying that, well, it's a state secret. If they do exist, you,

259
00:15:57.081 --> 00:16:01.700
the plaintiffs don't have a hard, concrete evidence that they do exist.

260
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.190
And the government is saying, legally,

261
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.090
you have no right to discover evidence from the government, right? Documents,

262
00:16:08.091 --> 00:16:09.170
demand, documents, or demand,

263
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.160
and answer from the government as to whether things these are as to whether or

264
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:16.580
not these things exist. Uh, because the government's just going to give, uh,

265
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:18.560
it's standard with a called Glomar response.

266
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.620
We can neither confirm nor deny that these things exist,

267
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.000
which leaves you out in the cold, which leaves the courts out in the cold.

268
00:16:26.001 --> 00:16:30.500
The courts go, uh, look, the government could be breaking the law here. Look,

269
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:34.010
they could be violating the constitution here, but because you can't prove it.

270
00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:37.610
And because the government doesn't want to play ball, and the government says,

271
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.570
if we were doing this,

272
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.410
it would be legal and it would be necessary for national security,

273
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:50.210
whatever the court can't presume to know national security better, uh,

274
00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.020
than the executive, because the courts aren't elected. Um,

275
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:57.500
and so this leads to this fundamentally broken system where, okay,

276
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.570
the only way to have the courts review the legality of the programs is to

277
00:17:02.571 --> 00:17:06.380
establish the programs exist, but the programs are classified.

278
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.010
So you can't establish the exist unless you have evidence.

279
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.870
But providing that evidence to courts, to journalists, to anyone,

280
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.120
uh, is a felony, right? Uh,

281
00:17:17.121 --> 00:17:20.600
that's punishable by 10 years per count under the espionage act. Uh,

282
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.400
and the government has charged every, uh, source of public interest journalism.

283
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:26.360
Uh,

284
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:29.990
who's really made a significant difference in these kinds of cases since Daniel

285
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:33.800
Ellsberg, really going back to that, uh, under the same espionage act,

286
00:17:33.801 --> 00:17:37.250
it's always the same law. Uh, and this is there's no distinction, uh,

287
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.030
to government between whether you've sold information to a foreign government

288
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:43.760
for private benefit, right? Uh,

289
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.560
or whether you provide an information only to journalists for the

290
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:53.430
public. And then that's a fundamentally harmful thing.

291
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:57.450
I think when you look at, uh,

292
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.300
things that have come in the wake of this, we're talking about the,

293
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.630
the post 2013 court rulings that, that found, uh,

294
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.330
what the government was doing was unlawful. Um,

295
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.730
you see the courts saying actually that leaks or, uh,

296
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.930
air quotes, leaks, uh, can actually be beneficial,

297
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.860
uh, leak is used in the governance and this, you know,

298
00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:23.280
this is from a federal court. These are not exactly my biggest supporters.

299
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.030
They're recognizing that although leak implies harm,

300
00:18:27.031 --> 00:18:29.940
it implies something that's broken. It's actually helpful.

301
00:18:29.941 --> 00:18:34.110
It's a leak that's letting in daylight, uh, in, in this context, uh,

302
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:37.410
that is the only thing that allows, um,

303
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.820
the system to operate in a context where, uh,

304
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:43.710
one year before I came forward,

305
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.360
we had the NSA saying this kind of stuff didn't happen. Um, we had,

306
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.080
uh, hang on, uh, this famous exchange,

307
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:55.440
which more than anything made me realize this was a point of no return because

308
00:18:55.441 --> 00:18:59.190
I've told you this, you've heard this, but if you haven't seen it,

309
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.950
uh, you might not believe me. Right. Um, maybe I'm a sketchy guy, whatever. Um,

310
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.180
one of those senators,

311
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:09.510
I told you that objected to this stuff that was doing the Lassie barks for all

312
00:19:09.511 --> 00:19:12.510
those years, Ron Wyden, uh,

313
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:15.570
was confronting the most senior spy in the United States, uh,

314
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.980
general James clapper, who was then the director of national intelligence,

315
00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:23.130
right? Uh, there's no guy higher than him. Uh,

316
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.990
the buck stops with him when it comes to intelligence.

317
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.370
He's testifying under oath in front of Congress right now,

318
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.730
but more broadly in front of the public. This is televised.

319
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:36.960
And Ron one asked him a very specific question about a program, mind you,

320
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.220
that Ron Wyden knows exists because he has security clearance.

321
00:19:41.221 --> 00:19:43.500
He sits on the intelligence committee, uh,

322
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.500
and he knows there's domestic mass surveillance. And this is how it goes.

323
00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:48.330
This is how the top spot responds under oath.

324
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.810
<v 2>So what I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the</v>

325
00:19:56.811 --> 00:19:57.644
question,

326
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:02.600
does the NSA collect any type of data at all on

327
00:20:02.601 --> 00:20:07.340
millions or hundreds of millions of Americans? No, sir.

328
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.170
It does not, not wittingly.

329
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:17.870
There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps, uh,

330
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.840
collect, but not, not wittingly. Alright.

331
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.330
<v 0>So that was a lie. A widen knew it was a lie.</v>

332
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.310
Clapper knew it was a lie. He actually admitted it was a lie after, um,

333
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.400
I came forward, you know, three months later. Uh,

334
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.930
but he said it was the least untruthful thing he could think of to

335
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:43.140
say, uh, in the context of, of being in the hot seat there.

336
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.610
But what does it mean for a democracy when you lie under oath to Congress and

337
00:20:48.611 --> 00:20:50.950
the Congressman even knows you're lying to them,

338
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.060
but they're afraid to correct you and widen, uh, by the way,

339
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:58.480
it wasn't a surprise. Widen gave him those questions, 24 hours in advance.

340
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:03.520
And he wrote a letter afterwards asking for collaborate to amend his testimony

341
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.430
right now, not even at a press conference, but just to say, ah,

342
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.960
this was incorrect, whatever.

343
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.880
So he could go through the legal process and show his fellow congressmen, uh,

344
00:21:12.881 --> 00:21:14.560
that there was a problem and that they needed to do.

345
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:18.910
But all of that was refused to us. All of it was, uh, denied to us.

346
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:22.420
And here I am sitting at the NSA, uh,

347
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.570
next to my buddies who I've talked to about these programs, you know,

348
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:29.320
I've gone look at this and they're laughing at it. You know,

349
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:32.490
I'm laughing at it and it's not, it's not that we go, oh, ha ha.

350
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:36.220
He's getting away with it. It's like, what are you going to do? These guys are,

351
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:40.840
you know, they're, they're bullshitters that the system is built on

352
00:21:40.841 --> 00:21:43.690
lies, uh, that even many people,

353
00:21:43.691 --> 00:21:47.020
many experts who have studied this know are lies.

354
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.330
But if you can't prove are lies, how do you move beyond that?

355
00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.950
And that's really a question that has never been more relevant than I think it

356
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:59.100
is today under the current white house. Okay.
