00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, it.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.290
<v 1>Seems like trying to enact change is so</v>

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:09.420
difficult that when actual change happens,

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.430
it's one of the reasons why it happens in such a big way.

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.300
It's like there was so many people bounding at the wall and pounding at this

6
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:19.080
wall that when boom, when the George Floyd protest broke through,

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.780
then all of a sudden it's, we've got real change.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.080
Let's take down these statues and light everything on fire.

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.100
And there's this feeling of change and of chaos.

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
That is also representative of the fact that it takes so long to turn our

11
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:37.920
cultural battleship. It's like to actually get a real turn is so.

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.880
<v 0>Hard. It's so everything stays the same, no matter how mad people get.</v>

13
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.550
<v 2>That turn. Even at that point, that's still the easy part.</v>

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.460
The easy part like this,

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.960
not going to get fixed by HBO max pulling, gone with the wind. Like,

16
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.290
like when you pull a movie,

17
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.170
nobody was planning on watching on a streaming service.

18
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:04.250
Nobody can find like we're still at the symbolic stage.

19
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.310
We're still doing the that is symbolic when,

20
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.680
and this is where leadership becomes such a crucial component.

21
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.250
So you have this great awakening of energy.

22
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.480
It has to be channeled into something lasting and meaningful.

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.130
And we have to diagnose the real problem underlying

24
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.680
this moment so that we don't make a mistake and just changing the window

25
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.400
dressing and, and the gilding on the buildings.

26
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.231
And this has to be,

27
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:40.580
this has to be foundational in a way that

28
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.590
will create something lasting. And that's, that's the hard part seems.

29
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.770
<v 1>Like the shift is big enough that something's going to happen in that regard.</v>

30
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.460
It just seems like this shift is nothing like anything we've ever seen in our

31
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.400
lifetime. And it's worldwide, which is really crazy.

32
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:59.750
Like the George Floyd deaths sparked all these protests worldwide,

33
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.990
which has really never happened before with anything that really has taken place

34
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:03.824
in America.

35
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.900
And it just seems like there was also a lot of frustration during the bailout

36
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:10.880
period of, of the COVID crisis,

37
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.240
that all these corporations were getting so much money that people got one

38
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.070
$1,200 check. And then, then there was no more talk and that this.

39
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.020
<v 2>You don't know where the money, you know,</v>

40
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.440
there's really no accountability even for where that money went. Right.

41
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.630
That's a great point, Joe, because that's,

42
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.600
so that's what I'm talking about by structural change. Like,

43
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.880
I feel like in this moment,

44
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.780
this horrible, uh,

45
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.920
crime and murder sparked something, but what's underlying.

46
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.670
That is not just the racial inequality than the inequities,

47
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.890
but this whole idea of we build our society economically from the top down,

48
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.410
like, that's the that's got to change. Right? You have to, well,

49
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.780
like when, when you talk, when you're in a pandemic, right.

50
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.170
And tens of thousand people are dying. And then we say to ourselves, all right,

51
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.771
well,

52
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.690
who are the essential workers who are the ones that are the fabric of our

53
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.670
society and culture that keep the wheels turning and,

54
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.640
uh, the trains running, like who are those people? Well,

55
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.470
it turns out they're the most poorly compensated people in

56
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:25.060
our society because we flipped the paradigm.

57
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.880
For some reason, since the eighties, the investor class has gotten,

58
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.500
uh,

59
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.070
the break and the working class has gotten minimized we've we've devalued work

60
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.950
while overvaluing investment.

61
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.770
It does.

62
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.510
I don't think we can have the structural change until we flip that. Like,

63
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.890
man, when people talk about freedom and Liberty,

64
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.720
what's more, uh,

65
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.010
for freedom and Liberty than not having your health insurance tied to your job.

66
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.933
Right.

67
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.290
What kind of freedom do you have to make decisions in your life

68
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.120
when you fear that? If I take a chance, if I go for something,

69
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.040
if I try and change my lot in life,

70
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.630
my kids will no longer be covered by, uh,

71
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.960
like all the things that we built up to accept.

72
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.540
I think we have to turn it over and it has to lean more

73
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:26.860
people should be able to have like a dignity.

74
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.010
You should be able to work a job and not be poor.

75
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:34.540
You should have a working job and not need food stamps. Like that's where we're.

76
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.640
We spent how much in this pandemic, like $3 trillion,

77
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.950
something like that, 4 trillion,

78
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.390
something along those lines who knows if a hundred million of it went to Coca

79
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.310
Cola. Like we have no idea. Right.

80
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.600
But you got 80 bus drivers in New York who were dead

81
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.690
because they had to keep going in the Panda. Yeah.

82
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.620
<v 1>I think you're making a really good point about what's essential as well. Uh,</v>

83
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:05.370
when w when we found out that what the essential workers are, right.

84
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:09.390
People who work at supermarkets, um, people build homes,

85
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.440
like all these.

86
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.330
<v 2>Essential jobs bunker down. Yes. Can't afford to. Right.</v>

87
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.170
You're putting yourself in, you know, it's funny.

88
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:22.590
I was talking in front of mine and DG, who is, uh, you know,

89
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:27.060
he was really like grievously wounded, uh, in war. Right.

90
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.140
And I, we saw, we were talking about like Corona virus. And I was like,

91
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.970
I feel like I'm in danger when I go out.

92
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.430
Yeah. Welcome to being downrange. Like, you know what I mean?

93
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.850
It's just not, it's not something that we,

94
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.360
as Americans would ever consider our lives,

95
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.790
where we're really sheltered in a lot of ways to what

96
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.060
rate a vast majority of the world faces, but also what a vast majority,

97
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.970
our own citizens space in terms of having lives that lives,

98
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.330
that they feel are built on sand as opposed to Brannon.

99
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.980
And so his point was like, yeah, you know,

100
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
that's what it feels like when you're in a war. But I signed up for that,

101
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.690
but like bus drivers and grocery store orders, like they had to decide,

102
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.063
like,

103
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.110
I need this money more than I need to protect my life.

104
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.060
And maybe the health of my family,

105
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.550
what a terrible position to have to be in and unprecedented.

106
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.230
<v 1>And we're ill-prepared for it.</v>

107
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.380
And it really did highlight what's essential though,

108
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:39.790
which is good back to your point about this idea of income equality.

109
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.600
Like people will balk at that. Like, Hey, this is a game.

110
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.300
If you want to figure it out, figure out how to make more money,

111
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:48.340
invest and do this and become a banker.

112
00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:51.720
And you up and you wanted to be an artist or you up and you wanted to be a,

113
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:55.450
a carpenter. You should have been, uh, you know, whatever. And,

114
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.190
but what they don't understand or don't consider is when

115
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.450
hits the fan, like it did with the COVID crisis, you recognize like, Hey,

116
00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:07.690
all that stuff is nonsense. If someone doesn't take out the garbage,

117
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.680
all that stuff is nonsense. If you don't have health care,

118
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.430
all that stuff is not, none of that money means anything.

119
00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:19.390
If the fabric of society deteriorates to a point where literally everybody has

120
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:22.180
to stay in their home and you can't work, and that's what happened.

121
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.030
And it really flipped the whole thing on its head, because we,

122
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.010
we had to consider survival.

123
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.270
We had to really consider survival instead of just existence. We were saying,

124
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:31.661
oh my God,

125
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:36.430
we have to protect ourselves from this viral viral

126
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:37.264
attack.

127
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.730
<v 2>And what it makes you realize is how much money it takes</v>

128
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.080
to ante up to the American way of life. What I mean by that is like,

129
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.860
if you want to buy, if you just want to buy into play a hand, right?

130
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.110
What's your antique. Well, now they say you got to go to college.

131
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:57.880
So you're talking about a $200,000 auntie to get in the

132
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.110
game.

133
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.411
<v 1>Right.</v>

134
00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:02.140
To get a job when you get out where you're not going to make a fraction of that

135
00:08:02.141 --> 00:08:04.120
every year. So you're going to be behind the eight ball for the rest of.

136
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.920
<v 2>Your life. Right now, think about, you know, uh, black people,</v>

137
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:12.610
not being able to build equity and wealth through generations,

138
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.200
you know, government policy that excluded them from, you know,

139
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.710
from whether it's the homestead act of the federal housing administration or the

140
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:24.790
GI bill, you know, all these government interventions,

141
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.850
socialism, if you will, entitlements, if you will,

142
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:33.400
were made to help white families build equity, right over generations,

143
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.240
blind people were explicitly excluded from that.

144
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.460
So add that on top of the amount of money that you go in and you start to see

145
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.650
the hole that we've dug for people.

146
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.100
And if we don't address that whole,

147
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.650
I don't care how many comedy sketches we pull and how many things

148
00:08:53.651 --> 00:08:56.670
go like we've, we're not anything. Yeah. We haven't.

149
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:00.150
<v 1>Addressed the hole that exists from being 150 years removed from slavery,</v>

150
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.070
which is crazy. That's not, that's a blink in time.

151
00:09:05.071 --> 00:09:05.904
It's nothing.

152
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.810
<v 2>And how crazy is it that like, and you always,</v>

153
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.840
I always hear it from like the bug people. They're like the George Floyd thing.

154
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:15.740
Yeah. That was terrible. But as soon as they say the bottom, I'm like, no, no,

155
00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:18.770
but no, but he wasn't an angel. No,

156
00:09:18.771 --> 00:09:22.040
but you know what? Doesn't matter.

157
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:26.240
And when you're upset that people are pulling on Confederate statues,

158
00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:30.770
like people have been begging for that since they got th th those things got put

159
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.970
up in the 1920s to really lock in Jim Crow.

160
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:40.160
Like those things, aren't there. They're not memorials to the dead.

161
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.930
They're hate geography to a war for slavery.

162
00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:49.220
Like what? We shot the movie down south man. So I saw these monuments.

163
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:53.210
You would think, they would say like, here's a statue of a robbery, leave this

164
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.040
to keep people slaves.

165
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.370
And then we built this thing in the twenties to make black people kind of afraid

166
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:05.580
so that they knew they couldn't take it. But it doesn't say that this,

167
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:07.010
this great man, like,

168
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.540
of course people are going to pull them down because they've been begging for us

169
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.080
to do something about it for a hundred years.

170
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.640
<v 1>So the origins of those,</v>

171
00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:20.000
a lot of those statues were actually put up during the civil rights movement.

172
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.620
And they're cheaply made.

173
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.100
They were put up as a middle finger to the civil rights.

174
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.600
<v 2>Movement. No, no question. But,</v>

175
00:10:28.601 --> 00:10:30.470
but we need something.

176
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.210
I like there has to be a process.

177
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.940
I always think about like what South Africa did.

178
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.290
There has to be a painful led process that allows us,

179
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.350
because I still think to this day, and I don't know how,

180
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.150
how your experience with this is, but like,

181
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.530
I still think there's a large swath of, you know,

182
00:10:51.531 --> 00:10:56.330
white people in society who feel like they blame black people for not

183
00:10:56.331 --> 00:11:01.160
being able to get out of this hole that we put them in or that

184
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.720
the government put them in.

185
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.280
But they think it's a problem of culture and virtue like, Hey man,

186
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:11.900
if they would just, uh, pull the pants up and, uh, talk different, you know,

187
00:11:11.901 --> 00:11:14.800
they wouldn't have such a hard time. Hey, why don't you just work harder? Well,

188
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:15.933
that's a.

189
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:18.400
<v 1>It's a ridiculous perspective. And it's also not based.</v>

190
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.320
You don't have anyone who would think like that.

191
00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:24.070
Doesn't understand how human beings develop and grow. If you have someone.

192
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.490
<v 2>It's widespread. Yeah.</v>

193
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:30.010
<v 1>It's, it's, it's a dangerous narrative.</v>

194
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:33.250
Whenever you blame people for their circumstances.

195
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.850
If their circumstances are grossly out of their control and really severely

196
00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:37.780
limit their progress.

197
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.700
And that exists also for if you want to talk about coal mining populations in

198
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.110
the tacos, it's the same.

199
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.490
It's people that we don't all start out at the same starting block.

200
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.640
So all you pull yourself up by your own bootstrap,

201
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.840
you're lucky have arms, okay. There's people out there are born with no arms.

202
00:11:55.841 --> 00:12:00.280
Like we should all be thinking of ourselves in this country as a

203
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.790
community, not as a bunch of people in competition with each other,

204
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.830
we're all piling our money together. Every year,

205
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:09.400
we throw our taxes into the mix to try to take care of the infrastructure and

206
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:10.990
the government and the housing and all the,

207
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.310
all the different things to get paid for by our taxes. We're a community man.

208
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:17.110
And we're not thinking like a community.

209
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:21.940
We're thinking like a bunch of people that don't want other people to

210
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.620
have the same shot in.

211
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.330
<v 2>Life. That's a good, I think you struck on something though.</v>

212
00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:30.120
That's very important in all this. And that is

213
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.570
a theory of limited resources,

214
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.640
like the conflict between what you would consider,

215
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:42.600
like the, the more nativist wing of American politics. And,

216
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.520
and the more progressive side is this idea of resource

217
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.360
guarding. Yeah. We're going to, they're going to take, I work my off.

218
00:12:51.361 --> 00:12:54.660
I play by the rules and they're going to take all my labor and they're going to

219
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:55.800
pour it into these people.

220
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.750
And I do think we have to address that idea that like

221
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.010
we're here to build equity. Let's all get together.

222
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.780
And the project of this next generation is to build a

223
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:11.490
stronger foundation,

224
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.750
a granite bearing for everyone to stand on.

225
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.740
So that there's a few people standing on Mount Everest and everybody else's in

226
00:13:19.741 --> 00:13:20.970
sand and sand.

227
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.710
Isn't the way that we run the society and think of these programs,

228
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.170
not as entitlements,

229
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:33.060
but investments in dignity of work and

230
00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:35.610
start building that up. Well,

231
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.010
food stamps and welfare start to go away because we're building something

232
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.630
more substantial.

233
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.260
We built a great middle-class in the fifties for white people.

234
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.380
We have to do the same now for the country and for,

235
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.820
and also reassure, you know,

236
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.980
people who are resentful of that,

237
00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.360
that they're not being left behind either that nobody is saying,

238
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.700
and your lives are cake. And it's not.

239
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.370
<v 1>Like it's going to change your life that much either, man, this,</v>

240
00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:07.710
this mentality that, oh, Bernie Sanders,

241
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:10.020
like when I was a supporter of Bernie Sanders, when he was running,

242
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.810
I got pushback from people that were like, uh,

243
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.380
so you want to give your hard earned money,

244
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.600
more of it away to the government.

245
00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:21.660
And you think the government is going to solve this. My perspective was,

246
00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.230
if you just looked at it this way, if you could give, let's just get crazy.

247
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.500
If you could give 25% more money to taxes,

248
00:14:28.501 --> 00:14:33.120
but the world would be 50% better, right? Wouldn't you want to invest in that?

249
00:14:33.121 --> 00:14:36.330
Like, I understand that people are checked to check. I understand.

250
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.400
But if people like me and people that earn a good amount of

251
00:14:41.401 --> 00:14:42.930
money are the ones who are going to be hit the hardest.

252
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.260
If you wanted a better world,

253
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.910
wouldn't you be willing to invest some of your money into that better world.

254
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.040
And if that money goes to making sure that no one has to do this in the future,

255
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:59.240
and that we, we develop this better communities,

256
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:02.900
better communities in these places that have been for decades, you want,

257
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:05.450
you don't want that. You don't want a better world for your children.

258
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.910
You want to, you don't want to save her. Well,

259
00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:09.830
what do you want to do die with all this money in the bank? Like, it's crazy.

260
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:11.680
<v 2>It's a question of, you know,</v>

261
00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:14.530
when you look at the greatest anti-poverty program we've ever put in place in

262
00:15:14.531 --> 00:15:15.364
social security.

263
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.530
Now the flip side of that is what they'll say is that the problem with some of

264
00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:25.210
this is they don't trust the mechanism by which that money is going to be

265
00:15:25.211 --> 00:15:29.560
invested. Right? Of course, because they've been sold to some extent,

266
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:33.490
a little bit of a lie that, that this trickle down theory.

267
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:38.200
So every administration that comes in is going to stimulate the economy.

268
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.990
They all do it. We don't have a free market.

269
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.770
The fed right now is driving so much money into stocks.

270
00:15:44.771 --> 00:15:47.710
You're talking about zero interest rates, negative interest rates, right.

271
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.780
They're driving everything away from bonds and savings

272
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.620
so that the stock market, which for some reason,

273
00:15:56.621 --> 00:16:00.520
we've come to look at like a pulse oximeter of the nation,

274
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:05.320
which it's not it's, you know, oh my God, we lost 300 Dow's today. Like,

275
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.650
we've come to look at it. Like, it's our temperature. Yeah.

276
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.430
So everybody's going to stimulate the economy. So what did,

277
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.930
what let's look at what Trump did. So a $1.5 trillion tax cut, right?

278
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.700
Overwhelmingly though it went to people who already have ton of money.

279
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.850
And then we cut the corporate tax rate from a hundred.

280
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.890
I think it was 35 down to 21. Right?

281
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.960
Supposedly they were going to reinvest it, but they mostly did buybacks.

282
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.500
So they're increasing their investor wealth through that as well.

283
00:16:35.501 --> 00:16:40.030
So you're talking about trillions of dollars of stimulus,

284
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.260
right? That are just going to that same theory,

285
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.150
take those trillion dollars and let's invest.

286
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.230
Let's stimulate the economy, but not from up there, from down here, let's do,

287
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.750
let's take that and Marshall plan our

288
00:16:58.751 --> 00:17:01.010
country and,

289
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:05.950
and build it so that it's sturdy on the legs. You know, you know,

290
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.450
you were a fighter starting on the legs. If you're not starting on the legs,

291
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:11.890
you got nothing. My.

292
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.910
<v 1>Idea is we should get Dick Cheney involved and we should hire Halliburton to fix</v>

293
00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:18.760
up the inner cities. Like it did all the places we bombed in Iraq.
