00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Kyle Kalinsky sent me something.</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.100
<v 1>Today. I wanted you to see Jamie. It's a, some thing.</v>

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.800
There's some going down with UFO sightings.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 2>Oh yeah. I've been there before.</v>

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.310
<v 1>Yeah. But yeah, I'll send it. I'll send it to you.</v>

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.850
I've been following this stuff. Yeah. It's um, hold on one second, Jen.

7
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.190
All right. I just texted it to you. Pentagon officially releases UFO.

8
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.150
This is the tweet.

9
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.190
It says a new Pentagon formally released three mysterious UFO videos captured by

10
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:38.090
Navy pilots.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040
The already leaked videos showed what DOD insist on calling

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.520
unidentified aerial phenomenon. Um,

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.020
moving at incredible speeds and per performing near impossible maneuvers.

14
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.790
This isn't weird subject because it's one of those subjects where people

15
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.310
automatically dismiss it because it's been,

16
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.490
so it's been so touted by kooks.

17
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.260
There's so many wacky that have talked about UFO's that

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.350
anybody talking about UFO's has to be out of their mind.

19
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.340
But then when you see these videos and you see them performing these

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.030
impossible tasks, like th these,

21
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:20.390
these things are moving in a way that we've never seen anything move before

22
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.920
flipping upside down and sideways, moving at insane rates of speed.

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.980
Like they don't know what these are. Yeah. Phenomenon.

24
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.941
<v 3>Interesting though,</v>

25
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:35.690
as I was reading one of these stories and they passively mentioned that the

26
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:39.350
siding was near a technology and a us Naval like technology station of some

27
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:42.530
sort, like a top secret development. And I'm like.

28
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.060
<v 1>Okay, it could be one of two things either, right?</v>

29
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.630
It's developed by the people that are at that base,

30
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.140
or they're monitoring the people that are out that base. These aircraft,

31
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:54.410
we call them aircraft are displaying characteristics that are not currently

32
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:59.120
within the U S inventory nor any foreign inventory that we are aware of.

33
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.770
Maybe they see this that's going down with China and all the ships being moved

34
00:02:03.771 --> 00:02:07.760
and like, listen, you heads. Yeah. Maybe they'll listen to you.

35
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.880
morons. You territorial. [inaudible].

36
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.440
<v 3>I'd like to think that, but you don't think so Manhattan project, man. I mean,</v>

37
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.320
the U S has probably got some crazy weapons.

38
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.220
<v 1>You know, it could be,</v>

39
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.600
but the Manhattan project was also coincidentally right after they started

40
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.750
detonating bombs and the aliens started showing up. That's what they think.

41
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.351
Right? Yeah. Well,

42
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:31.850
that was when the bulk of us sightings started jumping and worldwide.

43
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:32.684
I believe too.

44
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.580
<v 3>You know, maybe, uh,</v>

45
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400
we we've slowly been getting more and more information about this.

46
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.980
I've been actually reading a lot of these stories over the past several months.

47
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.780
Um, more admissions from government,

48
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.830
more release of documents and more sightings. So there's been a big,

49
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.660
I don't want to call it. Well,

50
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.650
a lot of people murmuring that April was going to be the month when we finally

51
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:53.780
learned the truth. April almost up.

52
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.080
<v 1>It's almost up, I'm going to stop. We've got like a few days and 27th,</v>

53
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.550
no more days is left. You know, 30, you.

54
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.460
<v 3>Know, about what happened. Uh, do you know about the O'Hare airport siding?</v>

55
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.850
Which one's up? So this was, I think in like,

56
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.430
oh six at Chicago's international,

57
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.450
O'Hare a UFO came down and hovered above.

58
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.750
I think it w I can't remember what terminal it was, uh,

59
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.820
hovered for a few minutes, I think, and then shot straight,

60
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.150
punched a hole in the clouds. Everybody saw it happen.

61
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.070
Now I had just quit working at O'Hare around this time when the siding happened.

62
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.780
So I had friends who were still there.

63
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.370
I had a friend telling me that when this UFO came down, people on Manheim road,

64
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.030
where, which is the road on the side of O'Hare got out of their cars,

65
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.760
like just stopped. The light, got up and were looking and staring at it.

66
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.490
And that the people were, who are working, where we worked.

67
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:43.930
We worked for American Eagle airlines,

68
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.260
walked out of the rooms and we're just staring at it float,

69
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.740
and then shoot up and punch a hole in the clouds. You know,

70
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.530
they said weather phenomenon. So there's a photo of it. Uh,

71
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.510
a pilot took a photo of it. This is back when like very early phone cameras.

72
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.040
It's a very grainy, awful picture. There it is right there.

73
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.510
That's that's not it. No, no, no. That's super fake. Uh, I think no,

74
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.220
th these are all people trying to fake.

75
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.310
It's really hard to find that one is not that one might be it,

76
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.070
but I don't think so. It, it barely.

77
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.860
<v 1>Looks like, oh, hair, UFO sighting, 2006. Is that it right there?</v>

78
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.560
<v 3>I do not believe those are it. No. So.</v>

79
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.070
<v 1>It will click on that article. See what it says, Jeremy, it's just some.</v>

80
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.650
<v 3>Blog that one might be on the left,</v>

81
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.300
but so many people try exploding this stuff for clicks and for views.

82
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:33.990
And they make these fake photos and links not working.

83
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.410
I'll click on a few times. It was a very, very faint photo from the,

84
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.610
from the cockpit. It might be that one right there in the middle, on the, uh,

85
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.390
on the, so on the left side, it might be that one. No, no, that's not.

86
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:49.110
It that's not it. Well, there was a really crappy photo of it.

87
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.110
And that might be it. That might be, it was a really,

88
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.980
it was out of the cockpit of a window. A pilot took a photo and, you know,

89
00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:59.370
I wonder where have all the sightings gone since phones became ubiquitous.

90
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.390
I mean, this is a simple, you know, I guess,

91
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.990
excuse the aliens. They're sentient. They know we have phones. They're like,

92
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:10.530
okay, stop, you know, de cloaking or whatever, but I want,

93
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:12.330
or I wonder if you know,

94
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:15.300
why is it there were so many UFO's and around the time cell phone cameras come

95
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:16.134
out, they're gone.

96
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.100
<v 1>Well, I think most people are full of. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.950
I think most people like to pretend they see things that don't really see

98
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:27.720
things, but know, I don't think that excludes the possibility. It's not like,

99
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.860
it's not like it's, these are the things are mutually exclusive.

100
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.320
Like people are full of. Therefore aliens don't exist.

101
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.800
I think aliens could be real and people are full of.

102
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.330
And I think that it could be, it's very rare that they visit us.

103
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.100
But if they do like, well,

104
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:48.180
how often does scientists go to the Congo to study chimps? I mean,

105
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.920
how many people do they send? Let me,

106
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.670
let me the bottom of the ocean to look for new life forms. How rare is it.

107
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.310
<v 3>Trip you out? Okay. On that idea, we put decoys up for animals. Animals.</v>

108
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.910
Can't tell the difference. What if you've actually met a decoy person?

109
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.050
You couldn't tell the difference.

110
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.780
<v 1>Maybe it's you bro. Maybe it's me. That's right. Hey, let's, we'll be here,</v>

111
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:08.470
but it works so much. You don't get tired. No.

112
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.480
So you're interested in news and disseminating factual evidence because what

113
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.960
we're actually doing is collecting a database.

114
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.820
<v 2>For the, for the aliens.</v>

115
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.110
<v 3>Now. But I thought about this because I saw a photo on Reddit of, um, a Puffin.</v>

116
00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:22.300
I think it's called the bird and they,

117
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.020
they put up a fake Puffin and it's because I think they're called puffins.

118
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.820
It's because the birds don't like, you know,

119
00:06:27.821 --> 00:06:30.640
nesting in places where they're alone. And so I put in the decoy there,

120
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:33.850
the other birds would start coming and like one bird showed up and was hanging

121
00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:38.370
out with the decoy. And I'm like, could you imagine, like you see, like, we, we,

122
00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:41.770
we put duck decoys in the water. We do duck calls and the ducks like, Ooh, Hey,

123
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:44.140
fly, honey. I'm gonna come over and check this out. And it's like a woodblock.

124
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.191
Could you imagine,

125
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:47.560
like seeing like a beautiful woman or someone you're attracted to and being

126
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:48.191
like, Ooh, look at that.

127
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:52.000
And it's really like an alien decoy just to like probe you and like better

128
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:54.070
understand you or something. Decoy.

129
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.150
<v 1>Just the term decoys weird. Because decor are used for hunting,</v>

130
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.380
like a Turkey it's Turkey season right now. And the way the hunt,

131
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.080
most guys hunt for turkeys, they take a rubber Turkey.

132
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.370
You put that out in the middle of the field and then you hide behind a Bush with

133
00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:13.330
a shotgun. Yeah. And then turkeys like,

134
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.580
hear it and they'd come over. They, and they,

135
00:07:15.581 --> 00:07:17.980
they try to get some and then they get shot.

136
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.760
<v 3>You know, you see some dude and or it's like, you see it for you.</v>

137
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:24.820
It'd probably be a beautiful woman. You want to get that and you know,

138
00:07:24.821 --> 00:07:25.654
and then she's going.

139
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.410
<v 2>Hey, Hey, come over here. And you're like, oh, Hey me. And then I get eaten. No.</v>

140
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.390
<v 3>No. They just, you know, take it from the ship. Probean.</v>

141
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.630
<v 1>What about your button? This is the thing about putting things up your button.</v>

142
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.790
Most doctors don't even do that.

143
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:40.510
Like they have MRIs now doesn't aliens need to probe you and your.

144
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.730
I think it's just what everyone's afraid of.

145
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.900
They're afraid of things go in their.

146
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.030
So that's what they think is going to happen.

147
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:48.280
If the aliens get them freeze me and somebody's.

148
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.670
<v 3>Somebody told the dumb story back in the day and it was the most sensational</v>

149
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:53.560
version. Everybody had to have it. So they were like,

150
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.610
that's what they went with.

151
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.500
<v 1>You know, maybe, or maybe they do that to keep you, keep your mouth, shut the,</v>

152
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.420
you in the. Just so you keep your mouth shut.

153
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.550
<v 3>Or some dude actually got abducted, right? Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.300
And he comes back and he's like, they think they won against me.

155
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.100
I think they beat me. They put up with my butt. They're weirdos.

156
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.220
<v 1>Do you ever hear the word? It's a story of a Betty and Barney hill? No,</v>

157
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.200
it's the very first UFO abduction story. It's an ancient story. And, uh,

158
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:20.530
what's crazy is Angela Hill. Who's a UFC fighter.

159
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.260
I had her on the podcast and after the show,

160
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.360
she told me her grandpa was Barney hill. Whoa. And I was like, holy. Like,

161
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:30.430
we forgot that we didn't talk about it during the show,

162
00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:33.490
but she wanted to bring it up because she knows I'm kind of obsessed with UFO's.

163
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.070
But the account that they have,

164
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.300
like they get hypnotized and he's recalling the abduction and they have like the

165
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:44.440
same story. It's very terrifying. But you hear him crying and screaming.

166
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:48.670
And you know that he was taking a board of this craft and examined then brought

167
00:08:48.671 --> 00:08:52.120
back and they have missing time. But here's the thing. If they only did that,

168
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:56.850
occasionally they only came down once every few years just scoop some person up

169
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.960
in the middle of some rural place. Like if you're flying over, you know,

170
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:04.080
I think their instance was in, I believe it was in Maine.

171
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.210
If you're flying over somewhere like Maine,

172
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:08.160
which is a very low population state,

173
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.810
and you see a loan car and it's just traveling on the highway and there's places

174
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:15.810
in Maine where you go from like Portland to Bangor.

175
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.760
When you're traveling on that road, it's like 60 miles with nothing,

176
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.190
not a gas station. Nothing.

177
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.810
If you were an alien and you saw a car by itself, like no other car was move in.

178
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.644
We got one.

179
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.820
<v 3>Isn't it just easier to think it's the us government.</v>

180
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.600
<v 1>No, cause we didn't have the capability of doing something like that.</v>

181
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.440
I don't think,

182
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.700
I don't think the capability of the scientists working for the government is any

183
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:44.690
different than the capability of the science scientists that are working for,

184
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:45.800
you know,

185
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.390
project X or w fill in the blanks in terms of like

186
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.010
what Raytheon publicly traded companies, uh,

187
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.420
how long.

188
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.980
<v 3>Look at quad copters don't seem all that complicated to me. Quad copters. Yeah.</v>

189
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.750
Like a helicopter, like drones, you know,

190
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:05.840
we've seen a little drone toys you buy, they got four propellers take,

191
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.360
take that concept, use thinner, you know,

192
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.680
jets and surround it in a disk so that it's, you know, universally,

193
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.800
like it can move in any direction because it's gotten, you know,

194
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.753
cause it's one pressure.

195
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.960
<v 1>Source. Where's the gas tank.</v>

196
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.090
Well lithium-ion battery or come on that you talking space,

197
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.610
like this is, this hasn't even been invented yet.

198
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.790
Think about how little mileage you can get out of a Tesla. You know,

199
00:10:28.791 --> 00:10:33.470
they had none as advanced as Tesla is still, when it's going full out,

200
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.120
it can only go for, I mean, you get 307 miles if you drive like a grandma,

201
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.910
but if you drive like a maniac, you know what I mean? You'd have that.

202
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.520
<v 3>You know, uh, I, I could be wrong about this, but uh,</v>

203
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.880
I'm pretty sure that they had this flying platform in the seventies that uses

204
00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:48.830
gas power. And they've also had jet packs for a long.

205
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:49.251
<v 1>Time. No,</v>

206
00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:53.690
they've ha sort of they've had jet packs that are capable of going for like 30

207
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:56.480
seconds. They don't I've I've experienced.

208
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.640
<v 3>I'm pretty sure the jet packs back in the day when for a long.</v>

209
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.210
<v 1>Time. No, no, they definitely didn't. We can look it up. Yeah, let's look it up.</v>

210
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.171
Cause they definitely didn't.

211
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:06.860
The whole thing was the fact that they were burning gas and to propel you in the

212
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:08.480
air, they only had a certain amount.

213
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.010
<v 3>Okay. I thought it was like 20 minutes, 20, 30 minutes. Maybe. Now my,</v>

214
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:15.260
my understanding of why we abandoned jet pack technology was that it was

215
00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:18.500
inefficient and heavy and you couldn't carry it without it being turned on.

216
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.000
So they opted for larger, like, you know, like, um, what are they called? Uh,

217
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.370
GenOx helicopters that can carry multiple people,

218
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.280
multiple people at once when you're wearing a jet pack,

219
00:11:28.281 --> 00:11:31.910
it has to be on idle re uh, negating its own weight,

220
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.890
which means it's burning as you're walking around,

221
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:37.070
which means you get a good 20 minute jump and you gotta abandon the tech and

222
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:38.330
then you don't want your, your enemies to get.

223
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.250
<v 1>It. Have you ever seen a guy fly a jet pack? Yeah. There's a video on YouTube.</v>

224
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.350
No, I mean, in real life.

225
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.090
<v 3>Oh, I sent that one guy, the iron man, dude.</v>

226
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.210
<v 1>I've been there and real, and my friend, Willie B from, uh,</v>

227
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:52.130
in Denver on the radio, he had a radio show in the morning. I choose radio show.

228
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.240
I think he still has a show shout out to Willie. And, um,

229
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.220
he had this guy who was a Jetpack pilot who

230
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:03.760
came in and in the parking lot of the radio studio and, you know,

231
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:07.000
fans of the radio show came and did it too. And, and watched it rather.

232
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.990
And this guy flew in the air for about 15, 20 seconds and then landed,

233
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:16.240
this guy was so banged up. Both of his legs were blown apart. He had, uh,

234
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.800
he had big braces on both of his knees. I'm like, what happened to your knees?

235
00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:23.140
He's like just crash landing. Both my knees are blown to.

236
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.180
Had no ACL's and neither one of his knees. But what's what I'm saying

237
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.520
that this is back then. It was good for about 30 seconds, 30 seconds of flying.

238
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:33.790
Well.

239
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.140
<v 3>So the point I was trying to get to is if you take something like a quad copter,</v>

240
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.560
you could absolutely feel it with, with, you know, gas or be loud as,

241
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.790
but it would, it would, depending on how you mitigate that orange,

242
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.990
it'd be an engine. It would be loud as. And you'd hear from the,

243
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.003
from the quad rotors.

244
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.430
<v 1>What these people are describing is nothing like that.</v>

245
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.710
These people are describing things that are silent,

246
00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.150
that go from zero to a thousand miles an hour in a split. Second.

247
00:13:00.151 --> 00:13:01.710
The things that defy physics,

248
00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:05.850
as we understand that this is not something that I think that the U S government

249
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:10.290
has. I just said, if you look at like, okay, like Elon Musk's company,

250
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:14.340
project X or a space X space, X is right now,

251
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:18.900
one of the premier, civilian companies, private companies,

252
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.420
that's making rocket ship. They up all the time.

253
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.220
They're in the middle of innovating all the time.

254
00:13:23.221 --> 00:13:26.010
He's one of the smartest people on earth. He's one of the,

255
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:31.050
in terms of technology he's he knows as much about propulsion as anyone and

256
00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:31.950
they still can't get it. Right.

257
00:13:31.951 --> 00:13:34.920
They're still trying to figure it out that trying to come up with something that

258
00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:39.570
could be viable in terms of commercial space flight and they're working on it

259
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.310
daily. And these,

260
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.080
these people with the brightest minds we know of right now that are in this jet

261
00:13:46.081 --> 00:13:49.920
propulsion space, travel business, there's, you know,

262
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.460
Virgin is working on something is a couple of other companies that are working

263
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:54.181
on things as well.

264
00:13:54.181 --> 00:13:58.170
And then you have NASA which worked there the best they could come up with was

265
00:13:58.171 --> 00:13:59.130
the space shuttle. Right?

266
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:01.980
Do you think that there is something way better than space shuttle?

267
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.910
They just never used that they had, and they, they kept it on the back burner.

268
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.170
Didn't want to let anybody know,

269
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:09.750
but the way they would use it as they would pick people up and erase their

270
00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:13.560
memory and X Hornets are. That's crazy. Well,

271
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:17.880
that's less likely than the hundreds of billions of galaxies

272
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.830
just in our own, in our own known universe, right?

273
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.350
Each one with hundreds of billions of stars,

274
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.460
each star with who knows how many planets that somewhere out there,

275
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.670
that something more advanced than us, maybe a thousand years,

276
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.310
maybe a million years, but it's figured out how to come here.

277
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.240
<v 3>Why hasn't, why, why hasn't anyone discovered them? Why,</v>

278
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.140
why is SETI failed search record search for extraterrestrial intelligence?

279
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:43.710
I haven't.

280
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.220
<v 1>The chimps invented guns. They've started using more tools,</v>

281
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.030
but why haven't they invented guns though? I don't know. So why hasn't said he,

282
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.770
you, if that was the same answer, they're not advanced enough yet. Really? It's,

283
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:59.840
it's a real simple answer. The industrial age is pretty recent, right? I mean,

284
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.870
you think about when people invented cars, you're talking about 1800,

285
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.560
that's really recent and we've only used lights, 18 hundreds.

286
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.840
<v 3>A high power radio transmission is only in the past a hundred years or so.</v>

287
00:15:10.841 --> 00:15:11.670
Right.

288
00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.160
<v 1>You saw, ever seen the movie contact. Maybe that's an old one, right?</v>

289
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.400
It's Jodie foster and Matthew McConaughey.

290
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.660
It's based on Carl Sagan's book about contact with space and with aliens,

291
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.850
how it's going to go down. I think I did see it recently. I can't interesting,

292
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.750
interesting take on it.

293
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.640
But the idea is that they've received the signal that we sent out.

294
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.720
Way, way back in the day, actually, when the,

295
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:40.060
the first broadcast signal was Hitler announcing the Olympic games to start at

296
00:15:40.061 --> 00:15:42.910
the Berlin games. Uh, this was the first signal they got.

297
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.660
It was a really controversial moment in the movie or controversy, you know,

298
00:15:46.661 --> 00:15:47.740
in the plot with that,

299
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:52.570
once they were trying to decipher the image that was being sent,

300
00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:53.920
they realized it was Hitler. Yeah.

301
00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.110
The first thing they see is a swastika and they're like,

302
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.550
what the is this back to us? And then they had to realize, oh no, no, no.

303
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.080
This is the first image that we sent out to space.

304
00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:05.980
They wouldn't be able to understand the political or historical context of this.

305
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:06.850
Well, so.

306
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:07.990
<v 3>So I got a few,</v>

307
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.310
there's a few issues I see in terms of aliens and earth contact, right?

308
00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:16.790
We are substantially more connected, you know, in,

309
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:20.470
in an evolutionary chain to ants than we are to any alien. So we,

310
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.440
we can't communicate with them for the most part.

311
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.240
We kind of can we understand how they communicate,

312
00:16:25.241 --> 00:16:27.580
but when an ant sees a super highway, this something,

313
00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.420
this is someone else's quote, they don't think twice. So it's possible.

314
00:16:31.421 --> 00:16:33.970
There are aliens that have super highways right above us.

315
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:35.020
We can't tell what it is.

316
00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:38.650
Same as a dog doesn't understand other than stay away from it. But one of the,

317
00:16:38.651 --> 00:16:42.400
one of the issues I think is often neglected in the conversation about aliens is

318
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.720
the, uh, we, we assume aliens would be on a very similar planet to us.

319
00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.240
We assume that they would have some kind of gaseous atmosphere,

320
00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.740
perhaps it's a liquid atmosphere.

321
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.220
And one of the things that I would ask of a researcher,

322
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.370
because I'm not the expert is the fact that we have the proper balance of oxygen

323
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.080
in the atmosphere to manipulate fire,

324
00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.100
which allows us to separate elements and then create, uh,

325
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.900
computers and components and fuels wouldn't exist on a planet without the same,

326
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.850
you know, atmosphere stop.

327
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:10.990
<v 1>I can answer that really easily. Yeah.</v>

328
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.080
There's no known propulsion system for any of these crafts.

329
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.650
These things are not using fire. They don't have a heat signal there.

330
00:17:17.651 --> 00:17:19.630
They don't know what they are. They don't know how that works.

331
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:22.630
<v 3>I don't, I don't mean propulsion. I mean the separation of elements,</v>

332
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.030
the manipulation of elements, right? So we,

333
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.970
we melt things and separate them and break them down.

334
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.340
They don't believe that that's how it works. No,

335
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.850
but I mean like how do you even start from, I'm sure there's an answer.

336
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.070
You know, let's say you have,

337
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.080
you have a species that lives on a planet with no oxygen and has no access to

338
00:17:38.081 --> 00:17:39.160
fire. What energy,

339
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.600
like what dense energy source do they have that will allow them to manipulate

340
00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:44.470
matter?

341
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.680
<v 1>Do you know the Rob, those are the, Bible's our story. I do. Yeah. Well,</v>

342
00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:52.560
one of the things that he talked when he first stopped working for

343
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.850
[inaudible] and the government was tapping his phones and, you know, there's,

344
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.150
there's a lot that can be documented about him. There's a lot that can't be.

345
00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:03.540
But one of the things that he talked about was a thing called element one 15,

346
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.070
right? That element one 15,

347
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:09.150
this insanely dense element that they use to bend gravity.

348
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.090
And that the way he described the way that propulsion system works,

349
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:16.710
it's like putting a bowling ball in the center of a very soft mattress and that

350
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:20.040
all of the other mattress, all the rest of the mattress,

351
00:18:20.041 --> 00:18:23.580
the mattress bends around the intense mass of the bowling ball.

352
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:28.320
And that this is how these incredibly advanced aliens from this other

353
00:18:28.321 --> 00:18:32.390
planet use. This is their propulsion system. That was from.

354
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.880
<v 3>From star Trek though. The, the concept of warp was around for a really long.</v>

355
00:18:37.881 --> 00:18:38.510
I think.

356
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:43.280
<v 1>The concept is based on Einstein's theory of gravity.</v>

357
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.880
I mean, this is the whole idea. If you could find something that could do that,

358
00:18:46.881 --> 00:18:51.530
but here's the thing when Bob Lasar talked about this in the late eighties,

359
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.430
early nineties, this element didn't exist. Now it does it wasn't,

360
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:59.390
it wasn't proven until they did it in a particle Collider.

361
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.920
I believe it was 2013.

362
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.850
So your name is talking about this element far before it was, it was,

363
00:19:04.851 --> 00:19:07.940
and he's apparently this is the big rumor.

364
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:12.950
He apparently had taken some of that from a lab and through George

365
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.810
Nori. And it was a George Nori. Yes. They did some experiments on the,

366
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.460
on television and showed that this stuff had made a light and

367
00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:25.730
fog bended away that they couldn't describe.

368
00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:29.320
<v 3>And he also did. He also claimed to see a small alien creature on his way out.</v>

369
00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.240
<v 1>He said he saw something that was sitting down,</v>

370
00:19:32.241 --> 00:19:35.090
but he doesn't know if it was a model that they were using.

371
00:19:35.091 --> 00:19:39.260
Like if they had created something that was supposed to be the size of a thing

372
00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:42.350
that could fit in these crafts, because these crafts, he said,

373
00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:45.890
were designed for things that were far smaller than human beings. I'm pretty.

374
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.320
<v 3>Sure in the initial interview he gave, when he went public,</v>

375
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.050
was that he saw an alien. And then later on changed at saying,

376
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.640
I don't know if it was maybe a model or.

377
00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.690
<v 1>A puppet. Yeah. He said,</v>

378
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:57.410
he thought he saw something sitting down and two people standing over it,

379
00:19:57.411 --> 00:20:01.700
looking at it. He said, he thought he saw an alien, you know, but he's probably,

380
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:03.440
I mean, I don't know. I mean, look,

381
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.900
he said it was literally for like a half a second.

382
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.570
Like he was walking by a window and he sees something inside of it.

383
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:13.280
Imagine being a guy who was in your twenties and you're a propulsion expert,

384
00:20:13.281 --> 00:20:16.670
and it's been proven that he worked at Los Alamos labs has been proven that he

385
00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:18.830
did put a jet engine. Yeah.

386
00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.790
It's been proven that he did put a jet engine on a Honda. I mean, he's a genius.

387
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.610
And then you'd talk to him. He's an incredibly smart guy.

388
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.860
Now imagine you get sent off to area as four and they show you this thing

389
00:20:30.861 --> 00:20:32.300
that, you know, doesn't even exist.

390
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.880
And they tell you about this propulsion method that they don't understand.

391
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.800
And they say that they found this a long time ago in an archeological dig and

392
00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:44.300
they want you to back engineer it because you're a propulsions expert and

393
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.320
they're running out of options. They've been studying this for decades.

394
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:49.900
No one knows what the it is or how that, how you can make it work.

395
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.120
And then they do test flights with this thing.

396
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.950
And then he tells his friends about these test flights after he gets fi you

397
00:20:56.951 --> 00:20:58.930
know, how you got fired. Do you know the story about him getting fired?

398
00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:02.770
He leaked it or something? No, no. His wife was her flight instructor. Oh.

399
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.110
And so when his wife was her flight instructor,

400
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:07.510
they told him he couldn't work anymore. And he's like, why not? Well,

401
00:21:07.511 --> 00:21:10.720
they were tapping his phone because when you have top secret clearance to work

402
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:12.700
on UFO's, I guess they don't want your fight. Your,

403
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:17.850
your wife her flight instructor, because then you're going to go crazy. And you,

404
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.950
you have a lot of imbalance at home, right?

405
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.860
So he doesn't know why they don't tell him why.

406
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.730
So he takes his friends and he tells them, listen, this is, this is real.

407
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.910
They're they're running these experiments. I know you think I'm crazy.

408
00:21:30.911 --> 00:21:32.140
This is what I've been working on.

409
00:21:32.141 --> 00:21:35.830
So he takes them to this area where you used to be able to have access to.

410
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:36.611
But once he did this,

411
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:40.420
they closed off access and pushed it far back to where the public has access to.

412
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.910
And he showed them these things,

413
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.180
doing these impossible maneuvers in the desert in the night sky.

414
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.180
This I remember. And so then he gets arrested. And so when he gets arrested,

415
00:21:49.181 --> 00:21:51.940
he was fear. He was in fear of his own life.

416
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.870
He goes public and tells this whole story. And then they erase his past.

417
00:21:55.871 --> 00:21:59.530
They erase his social security number. They erase his education background,

418
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.400
even though people that knew him and knew he worked at Los Alamos labs,

419
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.250
he takes George Nori have a tour of Los Alamos labs,

420
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:09.280
knows the people that work there. They all say hi to him.

421
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.530
He takes them on a tour around the laboratory,

422
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.320
shows them around and shows them the, the, the,

423
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:18.210
the devices they use for biometric security. And.

424
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.410
<v 3>I think the one thing you can't ignore is that he, he, there was,</v>

425
00:22:22.411 --> 00:22:25.410
there was documentation that he did work at one of these places and they later

426
00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:28.080
claimed he didn't. And like, I, I think I was watching the thing on,

427
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.140
maybe it was Netflix. I think like, he, he promoted that, right.

428
00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:34.080
It was on Netflix. They show the paper, like we found it. Yes.

429
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.580
Like he clearly was there.

430
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.550
<v 1>He was on the employee register. Yeah, no it's but.</v>

431
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.840
<v 3>But you know, for me, um, you know, man, I'd love to believe at all. He's been.</v>

432
00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.180
<v 1>Insanely consistent about that story. Yeah.</v>

433
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.840
<v 3>For 40 years, I, I want to believe, you.</v>

434
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.990
<v 1>Know what I mean, 30 years, whatever I want to believe too. That's the problem,</v>

435
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.590
man picks her didn't happen. I want to believe, but that's nonsense.

436
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.130
Pixer it didn't happen is nonsense. Well, how do you, how do you, you know,

437
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:04.110
how do you, what about Neanderthals? No. What about dinosaurs? It's not mix.

438
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:07.560
<v 3>I'm more so joking. Right. But I mean, show me the evidence. Right? I get it.</v>

439
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:12.510
Let's, you know, the, the, the challenge with any theory. I, I don't like it.

440
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.390
I don't like saying conspiracy theory because they're not always conspiracies is

441
00:23:15.391 --> 00:23:17.700
that people want something to be true.

442
00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.850
And so they end up looking for things to justify what they think it already is.

443
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.510
Of course,

444
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.790
instead of starting with what you've got and trying to figure out where it goes

445
00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:24.210
from there.

446
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.130
<v 1>But when you start with what you've got,</v>

447
00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:30.810
you've got a guy who was living in Vegas, was taking these flights out to area.

448
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.320
[inaudible] knows the place, knows it inside out. Can describe it.

449
00:23:34.321 --> 00:23:37.260
Very accurately. Also worked at Los Alamos labs.

450
00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:40.440
He describes that very accurately. Yeah. It proves he worked there. Yeah.

451
00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.280
But also proves he's he's also a legitimate scientist. But what I mean,

452
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.620
when you talk to the, he's a brilliant guy, he's like, he's not a nut. Right.

453
00:23:47.621 --> 00:23:50.750
But what are you saying, aliens? That doesn't mean aliens.

454
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.640
<v 3>No, I'm just asking like, so.</v>

455
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.010
<v 1>It doesn't mean aliens, but that's what he was told.</v>

456
00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:00.290
What he was told is this is something that has come from somewhere else and

457
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.360
they're trying to figure out how to work it and how to use it if.

458
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:06.530
<v 3>Uh, we're in a simulation and this was something that was leftover code,</v>

459
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:09.050
or it wasn't supposed to be placed in this curtain.

460
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.011
<v 1>Interaction or would,</v>

461
00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:14.060
if there's multiple dimensions that we don't have access to and that these

462
00:24:14.061 --> 00:24:14.300
things.
