WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, you've done underwater exploration as well.</v>

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.440
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. What have you done.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.080
<v 1>There? I live for two weeks, uh, in the bottom of the sea. Oh, Jesus.</v>

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.480
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;. Oh, get weirded out. I get weirded out. Just talking,</v>

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.400
just you saying that &lt;laugh&gt; two weeks at the bottom of the ocean. Yeah. How,

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.343
how deep?

7
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.550
<v 1>Uh, it was exactly, uh, 20,000 millimeters under the sea. It was about 60 feet,</v>

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:27.630
which works out to be about.

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.430
<v 0>Oh, only 60 feet. That's okay. Yeah, that doesn't freak me out too much.</v>

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350
I thought you were gonna say like miles. No.

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.550
<v 1>I'd start panicking. No, it's about 60 feet, but,</v>

12
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.470
but the cool thing was we stayed there for weeks. Wow. No, no. If you're normal,

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.340
if you normally scuba diving and you go down 60 feet,

14
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:47.260
you have 60 minutes and then you gotta come back up or,

15
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.460
or you get too much nitrogen in your blood and you're gonna get bent. Right.

16
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.580
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so, uh, so we, if you,

17
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:58.300
but it is not a problem. If you just stay, the problem is then if you stay,

18
00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:01.770
you build up all that nitrogen in your blood. Now you can't go back at up.

19
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.490
So like, if you run out of air or you lose sight of your buddy or something,

20
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.930
you can't go to the surface cuz within a couple hours you'll be dead. Wow.

21
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.970
So you have to stay down there.

22
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.010
And we use cave diving techniques that we did a lot of training for to be safe.

23
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.450
And we had redundant tanks, redundant, manifolds, redundant, um, regulators.

24
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.320
And we could head valves that we can flip around so we can always make sure we

25
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:29.080
can get air without ever having to, in an emergency ever having to come up,

26
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.440
cuz coming up is not an option.

27
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.920
<v 0>So how do you eventually get out?</v>

28
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.600
<v 1>It's a freaky thing. It takes about a day. And what you do is you take,</v>

29
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.360
so we we're living in this habitat and it was kind of like a submarine on the

30
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.910
bottom of the ocean, but it didn't have a motor.

31
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.870
So it just like stuck on a floor, like a big, like a big, uh, cylinder.

32
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.550
And it had a hole cut in the side here. And um,

33
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.870
and the only thing that was keeping the ocean out was the air pressure inside.

34
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.710
Whoa, kinda like taking a cup and flipping it over,

35
00:01:59.711 --> 00:02:02.710
putting it in the bathtub and trapping the air. Oh God.

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.900
And you just scuba dive on down and then you swim into that thing. And then if,

37
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.420
then once you pop up in that hole,

38
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.420
it's like you're in a swimming pool inside the habitat and then you just step

39
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.660
out into the habitat. Whoa. Is, have you ever seen the movie? Uh, the Abys yes.

40
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.020
It's like that. It's like that. Oh yeah.

41
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.940
<v 0>How accurate is that movie?</v>

42
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.570
<v 1>I think, uh, what's the guy, what's the Navy seal in there. He gets like, like,</v>

43
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.730
uh, gets crazy from.

44
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.690
<v 0>The bend. Get like, like.</v>

45
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.010
<v 1>Uh, what they called it, uh, deep dementia or something. Yeah. Is that fake?</v>

46
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.570
Yeah. That's.

47
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.610
<v 0>Fake. &lt;laugh&gt; God Hollywood.</v>

48
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.530
So this process of getting back to surface level,

49
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.970
how long you said it takes a day, what do you have to do? So.

50
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.400
<v 1>We do is you close up that hole and you convert the habitat into a pressure</v>

51
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.560
chamber. And what you do is you very,

52
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.640
very slowly bring the pressure back to sea level.

53
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.640
So you decrease the pressure and you slowly as if, as if you're slowly,

54
00:02:56.641 --> 00:03:01.520
slowly going up in the water column and then over as you do it gradually, the,

55
00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:04.600
the nitrogen slowly comes outta your blood and you could feel it,

56
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.880
it kind of tingles. Oh wow. Over the course of a day, you just lie.

57
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:11.800
You try to lie still in your bunk and just like read a book or something. And,

58
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.160
but you feel like this tingling. And then after about a day of that,

59
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.790
they get you all the way back to sea level slowly so that the nitrogen, wait,

60
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:21.710
you know what it is. It's like, if you take a can soda and you shake it up,

61
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.910
if you open a, you open the top quickly. Right, right.

62
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.110
But if you open the top really slowly and you let it slowly come out,

63
00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:33.110
you don't get all the bubbles. Right. It's it's, it's that same effect.

64
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.870
<v 0>Ah, that's a, that's a great analogy. Yeah. Oh,</v>

65
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.540
what's freakier being in the bottom of the ocean or being up in space.

66
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.660
<v 1>Up in space is more surreal. Yeah. Cuz the, the floating, the,</v>

67
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.380
the earth out the window, the views are better.

68
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.620
But being it down there was pretty wild too. I,

69
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.500
I remember once we were doing this experiment where I had my crew mate and I had

70
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.980
an ultrasound and we're doing this telemedicine experiment.

71
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.770
So there were these docs in Houston looking at the screen,

72
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.650
but there's a delay and I'm supposed to find her kidney and I'm like searching

73
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:09.890
around for a kidney. And then, uh, I, I look up and I,

74
00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:13.090
I look out the window and I see a six foot hammerhead shark right out the

75
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.250
window. And we have a guy in the water and I was, and,

76
00:04:16.251 --> 00:04:21.200
and I dropped a giant FBO. I'm like F you know, and &lt;affirmative&gt; and all the,

77
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:23.320
all the, all the docs in Houston are freaking out. They're thinking like,

78
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.200
in a moment, they're gonna see her liver explode on the screen or something.

79
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.400
And they're like, what's that? What? How's the patient? How's the patient.

80
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.080
I'm like, patient's fine. Got a six foot hammer. Head out the window. &lt;laugh&gt;.

81
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.480
<v 0>Yeah. That's gotta be really weird. Right.</v>

82
00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.080
You're you're in that thing in their world for how long? Two weeks.

83
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.383
Yeah.

84
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.990
So is that the weirdest animal that you saw is the hammerhead?

85
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.430
<v 1>The scariest thing I saw was one night I was taking a dump. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

86
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.190
that's a true story. Uh, I, the way you do this, okay. Number one,

87
00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:01.860
you just pee in the pool. Okay. But if you have, have to go, number two,

88
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.860
you go into the pool cuz you it's gonna, you don't wanna floater in your pool.

89
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.820
Right? That's of course like caddy shack. You don't want that. Right.

90
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.620
So what you do is you go, you, you don't take a tank,

91
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.300
you just take your mask and your fins, you go down naked,

92
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.420
you can, uh, we had a, we had a mixed gender crew, so I wore some trunks,

93
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:25.610
but it, you know, and then you just go down and you have to swim.

94
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.210
I don't know. It's like maybe 10, 15 feet. It's not that far. And there's a,

95
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:34.730
what we called a gazebo, which is just a little dome, uh, that has, uh,

96
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.810
air inside. Now you're out in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.

97
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.170
Like with no tank, no, in you're 60 feet down it's night.

98
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.960
You can't see a thing you're alone in the ocean,

99
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.400
but you can see this little gazebo,

100
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:49.920
you swim to that you pop in and then you got air into some valves.

101
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:53.440
You lead in some fresh air and then you hold on and you just,

102
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.480
and you take off your trunks and you just let it rip.

103
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.600
But the problem is the fish get accustomed to this. Oh Jesus.

104
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.320
<v 0>Yeah. So they go there knowing that you're gonna poop.</v>

105
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.360
<v 1>As soon as you drop in the water at night,</v>

106
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.440
it's like the dinner bell going off and there's like school. Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.680
Cuz this is feeding time.

108
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.120
<v 0>Whoa. And so you feel them like, yeah. Pecking at.</v>

109
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.960
<v 1>The back door, the worst or the angel fish,</v>

110
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.430
cuz that shape they can get like right up in there. Oh it's like not cool boy.

111
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.550
So you take your fin off and you're like whacking them. Oh Jesus.

112
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.763
<v 0>Christ.</v>

113
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.310
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; so that's all bad enough. But like,</v>

114
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.390
but as you're doing that and you're in the pitch, black Atlantic ocean,

115
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.790
60 feet down, no scuba tank at night, at night with the,

116
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.460
the ocean, like, like lapping against the,

117
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.100
the dome and you're looking down and this endless black, you know,

118
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:46.740
just a black void.

119
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.420
And you're thinking about every single scary ocean movie,

120
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.060
like jaws, you know, the Meg, uh, whatever, the Abys,

121
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:57.220
all those scary movies. Right.

122
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.210
And you think about all this things that could be down there, you can't help,

123
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:04.010
but going through your head. So it's kind of freaky.

124
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.290
And then you finish and you put your mask back on.

125
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.010
And I took a big breath and I went down and I opened my eyes

126
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.770
in my, in my mask, in the darkness with my flashlight.

127
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:19.800
And I saw like right in front of me, this huge eyeball,

128
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.560
like about the size, I don't know of, of like a, of a,

129
00:07:25.561 --> 00:07:27.160
of a saucer, you know,

130
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:31.320
like this big staring unlinking right at me.

131
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.080
And I freaked out, you know, I, I just tore off for the, for the pool,

132
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.030
for the moon pool and the habitat I jumped in there, I surfaced, I'm screaming,

133
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.670
I'm screaming. And my crew come running and thinking, I like,

134
00:07:44.671 --> 00:07:46.270
I've been bit by a shark or something.

135
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.670
And I'm like giant fish &lt;laugh&gt; and it was, what was it?

136
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.990
It was a Goliath grouper.

137
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.790
<v 0>Oh, I've seen those things before. They're enormous.</v>

138
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.150
<v 1>Size of a cow. It's like, yeah. Hundreds.</v>

139
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.780
<v 0>And hundreds of pounds, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God.</v>

140
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:02.100
<v 1>Yeah. Scared to live in hell at me.</v>

141
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.100
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah. Those things could literally eat a person. Yeah.</v>

142
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.420
<v 1>It, it, uh, uh, I, it was big enough that's for sure.</v>

143
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.740
And so it was just the sight of it. Scared the heck outta me. They.

144
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.500
<v 0>So where were you were in the Atlantic? Yeah.</v>

145
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.650
How far away were you from like floor? Like where were you at?

146
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.530
<v 1>We were just off the coast of Largo.</v>

147
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.290
<v 0>Okay. Cause that's what I'm saying. Like they live down there. Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.890
That's an enormous fish man. Huge.

149
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.090
I've seen videos of people catching them off of boats and it seems surreal.

150
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.290
I'll give you that. Yeah.

151
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:33.210
<v 1>There you go. Yeah.</v>

152
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.570
<v 0>There's one, it's like a giant large mouth bass.</v>

153
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.970
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's what it's like, if you go bass fishing,

154
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.920
they're so similar to bass, like in.

155
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.160
<v 1>The way they look. Yeah. Now imagine like Jesus Christ. Look at that thing.</v>

156
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.960
Imagine like being eye to eye with that thing in the middle of the dark Atlantic

157
00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:49.320
with no scuba tank.

158
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.920
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; they're delicious to it. Bet. Like,</v>

159
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.280
I don't know if they taste as good as regular grouper. Uh.

160
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.593
<v 1>I, I had.</v>

161
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:57.920
<v 0>Yeah, I wasn't gonna, so you get it differently.</v>

162
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.960
I wasn't gonna find out I get the mouth on that thing. Good Lord.

163
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.520
<v 1>I'll tell you another quick story about down there.</v>

164
00:09:04.521 --> 00:09:07.720
So I went out for a night dive once and I spent the,

165
00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:09.560
the beautiful thing about saturation diving.

166
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:13.640
Like this is you can do basically infinite time. Bottom time.

167
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.590
You you're not living it to like 60 minutes.

168
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.070
You can stay out there for six hours, you know, whatever.

169
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.070
So I was not doing this night dive and I found this beautiful shrimp and it was

170
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:26.190
just spectacularly gorgeous. It was like, translucent, you could see through it,

171
00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:29.630
you could see its organs move like internal organs, like doing their thing.

172
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.230
And I stared at it for at least like an hour,

173
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.060
just held my light on it and just there and stared at it.

174
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.540
And it was really beautiful.

175
00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.020
And I come back inside the habitat and I'm kind of hungry and the best space

176
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:45.220
food we got is shrimp cocktail. &lt;laugh&gt;

177
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.100
and I fold that thing off the shelf and I'm like, oh, that looks good.

178
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.460
Then I'm like, I can't do it. I can't do it, man. You.

179
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.420
<v 0>Felt bad. Cause you just saw the shrimp. Wow. I didn't.</v>

180
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.253
<v 1>That next day.</v>

181
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.690
<v 0>The next day. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, but that for that day though, you really felt bad.</v>

182
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.090
I.

183
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.923
<v 1>Felt bad.</v>

184
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.010
<v 0>Mm wow. Group. Or you would've felt bad,</v>

185
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.730
like a nice group or sandwich me.

186
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.890
<v 1>I think I would. I would've been okay with that after &lt;laugh&gt;. Cause it was,</v>

187
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.530
yeah.

188
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:15.090
<v 0>I wonder if they've ever eaten people. Cause it seems like they could, I mean,</v>

189
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.400
they swallowed giant fish. It seems like if you're not a large person,

190
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:21.400
they might be able to just suck you right in there.

191
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.313
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

192
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:24.493
<v 0>You know.</v>

193
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.920
<v 1>See now if, if this happens to me again, I'm gonna be even more freaked out.</v>

194
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.870
I feel like.

195
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:32.280
<v 0>I've read that grouper have bitten people before. Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.440
Like probably trying them out. Like if they get hung, if you're that big, you,

197
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.590
we have to eat so much.

198
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:42.150
<v 1>Yeah. This nonstop. Yeah. Buffet for those guys and yeah.</v>

199
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.870
<v 0>So when you're down there and you're doing all the swimming,</v>

200
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:50.030
you're using a rebreather, no regular you're using tanks, regular scuba tanks.

201
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.830
And what is the capacity of these tanks? Like how,

202
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.750
how long can you stay down to swimming around for? We.

203
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.340
<v 1>We have two and, and we can isolate 'em in case we, one of them Springs a leak.</v>

204
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.220
Uh, but you don't have that much more time than a standard scuba tank,

205
00:11:03.221 --> 00:11:05.220
but we have is refill stations. Oh,

206
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.500
all around the floor with high pressure hoses.

207
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.780
So we have these quick disconnects on our,

208
00:11:09.781 --> 00:11:13.260
on our system that you can plug in and sh fill it right back up.

209
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.940
And then you're good to go for, you know, another couple hours. So.

210
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.450
<v 0>When you swim to go take, you have to do that.</v>

211
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.770
You have to wear the tank or do you just hold.

212
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.530
<v 1>Your breath? Just hold your breath. You're not going that far.</v>

213
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.370
How far are you going? Uh, like 15 feet or so in total.

214
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.213
<v 0>Pitch black.</v>

215
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.410
<v 1>Yeah, there is a light on the gazebo, but that's all</v>
