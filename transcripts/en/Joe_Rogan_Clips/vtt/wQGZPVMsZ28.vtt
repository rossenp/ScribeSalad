00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Now,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.600
how do things like Xanax work?

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.300
What what's the mechanical process?

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.910
<v 1>Okay. So the, uh,</v>

5
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.190
that's a part of the class of drugs called benzodiazepine and

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.260
they, um, will

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.660
they bind to receptors in the brain and the brain has receptors for all kinds

8
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.000
of, uh, chemicals.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.010
And many of these things are things that exist in nature and what they want

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.980
that they bind to is a receptor called the GABA receptor,

11
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.860
which is the major inhibitory transmitter in the brain.

12
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.240
So when you have a benzodiazepine binding to a GABAA receptor,

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.220
what it's going to do is increase inhibition. So the, you know,

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:51.870
the kind of simple reason why those things can help is

15
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:55.980
they kind of inhibit. So they toned down the brain a bit.

16
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.240
And so things that would normally trigger a response, no longer trigger it.

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.890
So it's like increasing the threshold for something to bother you in a.

18
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.750
<v 0>And a lot of people enjoy that with alcohol and not supposed to.</v>

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.470
<v 1>Well, the alcohol also attacks. Those are separate. So it's like you get.</v>

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.710
<v 0>Double the effect, right? Is that why they tell people don't have Xanax?</v>

21
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.540
<v 1>Cause you can, you know, if you,</v>

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
if you take a lot of sandbox and drink a lot of booze, you can, oh, D.

23
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.300
<v 0>Or you could just say crazy things,</v>

24
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.690
not totally be aware. Do you remember that story about a woman? She was a,

25
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.930
I believe she was a publicist and she got on a plane.

26
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.040
She was flying to Africa and she said, I'm going to Africa.

27
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.250
Hope I don't get aids. Just kidding. I'm white, LOL.

28
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.270
She thought she was just being funny and you laughed.

29
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.040
And she landed in Africa. That's a bit a surprise. Do you know the story?

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.210
<v 1>No, but there are other stories.</v>

31
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.740
<v 0>This was one of the original stories of someone ruining their entire life with</v>

32
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.890
just putting, you know, one little tweak online.

33
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.700
She thought she was being funny. Like she, she would say a bunch of snarky,

34
00:02:02.701 --> 00:02:06.030
things like that. A bunch of funny, trying to be funny. Right. Um,

35
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.620
but she was on Xanax and drinking and woke up, uh,

36
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.810
completely oblivious and her life had been destroyed. She was fired, you know,

37
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:20.580
she was a social pariah and I'm pretty sure that was

38
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.070
Xanax and alcohol that she was blaming it on.

39
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.240
<v 1>Yeah. Well, you know, these are powerful drugs.</v>

40
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.470
And so w you know, back to how they work and they work.

41
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.020
So a drug like that,

42
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.360
all of the drugs that we take go to the entire body,

43
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.960
you know, they don't, they're not able to just, you know,

44
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:46.200
find their way to one little spot in the brain and do their trick. There's this,

45
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.600
you know, talk about magic bullet, uh,

46
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.220
bullet drugs that might be able to be targeted for specific circuits,

47
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.590
but that's a fantasy at this point.

48
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.790
So if you reduce inhibition in the entire brain,

49
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.240
yes, you might reduce anxiety,

50
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.140
but you're also going to change a lot of other things. So you're going to make,

51
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.850
um, um, for example, forethought and, uh,

52
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.140
ability to reign in things like the stuff the woman was saying, uh,

53
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.950
more difficult because they're attacking the prefrontal cortex where you have

54
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.920
some inhibitory control over behavior. Um,

55
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.810
they're going to alter your ability to retrieve and store

56
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:33.280
memories and to be, uh, to attend to things. And, um,

57
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.500
you know, to the extent that these drugs have a positive effect on some people,

58
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.520
uh,

59
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.690
it's been said that part of the reason is that it's kind of a general blending

60
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.150
of emotion. It's not an anti-anxiety drug.

61
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.670
It's just kind of a dulling of everything.

62
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.450
And you get anxiety anti-anxiety as a part of that.

63
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.680
But if we want to understand how to do better, um,

64
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.970
we have to, you know, figure out what the,

65
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.300
the brain circuit that's really making us anxious is.

66
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.070
And not just, what's making us, you know, not,

67
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.320
not toning down to everything. It's kind of like, you know,

68
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:14.110
you go to a restaurant, the music's too loud. Somebody says,

69
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.270
please turn it down. So they turned it down a little bit.

70
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.070
The music stays the same, the same song, but it's not as annoying, you know,

71
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.570
because you've turned the volume down.

72
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.130
And I think that's what a lot of what these medications can do is turn the

73
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:29.890
volume down a bit, or turn it up, you know, depending on what you're doing.

74
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.040
<v 0>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there some sort of a Slingshot effect,</v>

75
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:36.340
like after you take these things in your anxiety's ramped up afterwards.

76
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.720
<v 1>Well, it can be a rebound the fact that it can also be kind of a, uh,</v>

77
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.900
a lot of people next day, feel depressed. No,

78
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:48.010
because they're just the stuff is out of your system. And just come to the,

79
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.010
you know, if you take, it's kind of like taking sleeping pills,

80
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:55.270
things like Ambien are of the same general category of drug benzodiazepines.

81
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.400
And so you get this hangover the next day.

82
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.480
<v 0>Okay. So it's just a physiological response to the medication.</v>

83
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.150
It's not that if you alleviate some anxiety,

84
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.370
then the anxiety wants to come back, you can start over.

85
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.350
<v 1>No, I mean, so I, you know,</v>

86
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.470
I've often I've proposed and in my previous book that, uh,

87
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.700
we each have an anxiety set point that, um, you know,

88
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:20.560
that let's say you're worried about something and all of a

89
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:25.450
sudden that gets resolved. I just makes room for the next thing.

90
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.560
So, you know, we each kind of fill that for, because our brain is, you know,

91
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.210
we've developed a brain that has a certain kind of set point for everything it's

92
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:38.860
doing. And that just makes room for, you know, to fill that, fill that up.

93
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.910
If you're an anxious person, you probably will always be somewhat anxious.

94
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:45.670
So there's no magic bullet. That's going to take that out.

95
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.710
What you have to do is attack the process from knowledge of how it all

96
00:05:50.711 --> 00:05:51.544
works.

97
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.260
And that requires that we have a more sophisticated understanding that when

98
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.900
then, uh, as possible from simply observing behavior,

99
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:04.760
because behavior does not tell you necessarily what's on the

100
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:09.020
mind, behavior tells you how the, the, the brain has responded.

101
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.000
But, you know, just to go back to the, the fear threat example,

102
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.460
um, when let's say I, uh, bring you into the laboratory,

103
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.520
uh, show you a picture of something like a blue square. Uh, my colleague,

104
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.050
Liz Phelps, who used to be at NYU is now at Harvard, did experiments like this.

105
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.930
Uh, and every time the blue square would come on,

106
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:35.000
the person would get a mild shock to their finger.

107
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.890
And so then she would present the blue square subliminally.

108
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.980
That means, you know, really quickly with the, you know,

109
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:44.990
something that follows it, the kind of mass that,

110
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.790
and that prevents the information from getting into the conscious mind. Uh,

111
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.920
and so the person, so I didn't see anything,

112
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.050
but if you put the person in an imaging machine FMI

113
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.790
and, uh, image what's happening, that stimulus that threat,

114
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.770
the blue square gets to the amygdala, turns it on the heart,

115
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:11.060
begins to race. Palms are sweating. Um, but the person has no fear.

116
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.400
Hmm. The person doesn't know it's there. And doesn't experience fear.

117
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.470
The Migdal is not about fear.

118
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:23.450
It's about detecting and responding to danger in order to be afraid that has

119
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:28.430
to reach your conscious mind so that you can experience it

120
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.540
as a state of this oughta Noetic consciousness that we're talking about.

121
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.570
Self-involved consciousness.

122
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.650
<v 0>That's hard for people to separate. Yeah, well that,</v>

123
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.290
there's a physical response, but that your mind's on aware of it. Right.

124
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.440
<v 1>Um, but when you understand that, that's why you come to understand,</v>

125
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:47.180
that's why the medications are not working.

126
00:07:47.181 --> 00:07:52.130
They're targeted to work on these underlying systems in rats or mice,

127
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.520
but that's not where we are experiencing our anxiety.

128
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.700
<v 0>These medications are very profitable, right. I mean, people enjoy it.</v>

129
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.000
Millions of prescriptions get written. We're just going to phase those out with.

130
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.740
<v 1>You know,</v>

131
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.210
they're probably all going off patent and because the company can't find

132
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:09.080
anything new,

133
00:08:09.081 --> 00:08:12.860
they're not going to keep pursuing it because know that it's not going to be a

134
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.053
profit anymore.

135
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.000
<v 0>But don't people still want them. I mean,</v>

136
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:19.520
it seems like that's a really popular medication.

137
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.200
<v 1>Yeah. So it'll be like, they'll go to, um, you know, they'll become,</v>

138
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.783
uh,

139
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.360
generics and people will be able to get them for less money and they'll just.

140
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.140
<v 0>And do with whatever they want. Yeah. Off label, whatever.</v>

141
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.060
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, it's, I do think that for example,</v>

142
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.610
the drugs that are available do help people because it's important to reduce

143
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:48.020
the behavioral timidity and the physiological arousal that goes with that.

144
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.940
Cause if you don't treat that, then the conscious, uh,

145
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.350
um, mine will be reactivated by those responses.

146
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.690
If you only treat the conscious mind, then, uh, the physiological stuff,

147
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.270
we'll bring the conscious stuff back, you know,

148
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.760
everything we'll bring back there, everything else,

149
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:11.520
unless you treat the whole system and you have to do that,

150
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.790
you have to understand the system. And we've just misunderstood it,

151
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.810
I think for so long.

152
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.320
<v 0>I have a friend who he takes it every day, takes Xanax every day. Yeah.</v>

153
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.670
And he says he needs it. And he says, without it, and he's just a mess.

154
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.450
<v 1>Well, you know, whatever gets you through the day, I guess know,</v>

155
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.660
I'm not a therapist. I'm not advocating that.

156
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.760
<v 0>No, I understand. But from your perspective,</v>

157
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:38.970
from an understanding of the human mind and all the systems that are at work,

158
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.240
it seems like that's really not the way to do it.

159
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.250
