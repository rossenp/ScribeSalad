00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.920
<v 2>When you were doing this,</v>

3
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.800
he was just a local celebrity in the New York restaurant scene. Right. Had,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.240
had no reservation started yet, or this was kitchen confidential. Yeah.

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.840
<v 0>So kitchen confidential came out in 2000 mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so he was already</v>

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.590
on the rise. I think he was, uh, a season or two into a Cook's tour,

7
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:26.550
which was the very first iteration of Tony on television mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.110
uh, but there was no, you know, he was always would say like,

9
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:33.910
I've got my 15 minutes. I have no expectation that this is gonna, you know,

10
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.990
last forever. I'm gonna do as much as I can while I can.

11
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.300
But I think he was always waiting for someone to pull the rug out from under

12
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.740
him. You know, I, I, as far as being a, a celebrity.

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.940
<v 1>Whatever that is. Yeah. He was, it was really interesting. It was like, it's,</v>

14
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:51.580
it's hard for people to realize that other people appreciate them.

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.420
I think mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; especially people that are genuinely humble in a,

16
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.140
like, he's a, he was a genuinely humble person. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like,

17
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.810
he really didn't buy into his own at all. Right.

18
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.850
So when you would talk to him about it, he was like,

19
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.970
this could then terribly at any moment, you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

20
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.330
<v 0>Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; yeah. I remember being with him in the green room, uh,</v>

21
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.330
he did a book tour for our,

22
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.170
the cookbook appetites that we wrote together in 2016.

23
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.370
And he did a series of lectures,

24
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:21.090
basically like a one hour standup routine. Yeah. Uh,

25
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.040
in these theater and then book signing.

26
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.480
So we were at the last one at bam in Brooklyn and uh, in the green room.

27
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.280
And he was just like, oh God, I hate this. I feel like such a,

28
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.360
what was the word? He used such a fraud. Yeah. You know, and I was like,

29
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.440
what are you talking about? You just had like 13 sold out shows.

30
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.910
The book is doing amazing. Like you're literally Tony Bordain. You was like,

31
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:44.630
yeah, it was it's. I just, it's all.

32
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.510
I'm I'm embarrassed that people have paid money to come and see me talk,

33
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.750
you know, it was really illustrative to me to,

34
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.670
to hear him talk like that, you know, to realize like he doesn't,

35
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.830
he doesn't think he's as great as we know he is.

36
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.260
<v 1>You know, that's a common thing amongst, uh, Lee east,</v>

37
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.660
my people amongst comedians, it's, it's, it's in many, um,

38
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.900
successful people it's called imposter syndrome.

39
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.700
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it exists because you have a certain sort of a set

40
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:18.580
perception of who you were just going through life sort of anonymously.

41
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.380
And then it radically changes and it doesn't feel real.

42
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.010
And so to other people who have just as covered you, they love your show.

43
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.450
They love your writing. They love your, your,

44
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.210
your take on the world as you travel and eat everywhere, you know,

45
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.010
you think like I'm the same idiot that I was, you know, he's,

46
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.410
he's probably thinking he's the same guy. He wasn't 95. And now here,

47
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.770
all these people love him. It doesn't make any sense.

48
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.930
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I just feel like this is gonna fall apart. Does he fake?

49
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.140
Yeah.

50
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.000
But that's also why he was so interesting is because like the people that are

51
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.440
like legitimately full themselves and really think everything they're doing is

52
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:56.160
great are gross. Yeah. They're gross.

53
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.000
They come off gross when you see someone, right.

54
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.760
Like I'm the mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know,

55
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.560
like what mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, that is so gross. Yeah.

56
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.040
And it's such the opposite of what anybody ever wants to hear, you know,

57
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.600
and maybe you could say it in jest and, you know, people think it's funny,

58
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.960
but for the most part,

59
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.680
the people that are really enamored with themselves and their work are just not

60
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.870
nearly as interesting as that people that are tortured by it.

61
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.910
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's, it's such a conundrum, right?

62
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.390
Mm it's. Like a guy like Tony, who is such an interesting,

63
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.310
fascinating person just to talk to, just to have a commun a conversation with,

64
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:33.590
because he had such a clear perspective on things, the way he looked at things,

65
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.910
he was very aesthetic. He had like very into, like, he had a,

66
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.060
he enjoyed certain style of communication and of hanging out

67
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.073
and like he had,

68
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.180
there was an art to just conversation with the guy mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

69
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.540
So it's like, it makes sense that he hated himself. Yeah. You know,

70
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.300
in the most up way possible. It makes sense.

71
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.580
<v 0>Yeah. I think too,</v>

72
00:03:56.581 --> 00:04:01.530
there was this disconnect between the guy that he was before he got famous and

73
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:04.810
the guy after, you know, and I think he always thought about how the guy,

74
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.850
the old guy probably would've made fun of the new guy, you know,

75
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.970
and or he would've, he, and all his, his buddies who were cook,

76
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.170
stuck in the kitchen would, would sort of hate this, you know,

77
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.370
guy with the expensive shoes and the nice apartment and flying first class, you.

78
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.360
<v 1>Know? Yeah. That's what happens, you know, you,</v>

79
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.200
you want to be punk rock and then all of a sudden you have a million dollars in

80
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.160
the bank and you're like, Hey.

81
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.823
<v 0>Yeah, yeah.</v>

82
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.920
<v 1>I think I'm gonna eat it a nice place tonight. &lt;laugh&gt; mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,</v>

83
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.040
you know, I think I'm gonna, I think I'm gonna buy a watch, you know, it's it,

84
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.480
you really can feel like a fraud.

85
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.040
It's fascinating because so many people are really,

86
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.790
they ha did in a lot of ways by the past. And, you know,

87
00:04:43.791 --> 00:04:46.670
there's sort of like this, uh, rebellious,

88
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.030
rigid attitude that you develop when you're struggling,

89
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:54.150
when you're coming up and, you know,

90
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.430
it becomes like the structure of where your attitude comes from mm-hmm

91
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.710
&lt;affirmative&gt; and then when that structure is sort of,

92
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.140
of by success in Tony's case, and then you're left with, okay,

93
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.140
I'm not even like in his eyes,

94
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.780
he had done all these hours of being in the kitchen. Right.

95
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.220
The real work those long days and long nights. And that's,

96
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:20.020
there was something noble about that mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

97
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.890
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then all of a sudden he's just going to visit these

98
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.770
guys and he is not in the game anymore. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you know,

99
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.650
he's going to visit these incredible cooks and seeing these amazing dishes and

100
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:36.610
these insane restaurants. And I think part of that,

101
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.010
he felt like a little bit of a fraud because of that.

102
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.233
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

103
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.040
He was always very careful to say I'm I was not a great chef. You know,

104
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.640
I think it's very people kind of just in the same way that people thought that,

105
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.120
you know, the whole, with the AI thing, that it was all of the,

106
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.200
the movie versus 45 seconds, there's just a,

107
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.480
a glossing over a kind of, uh, sloppiness of recollection. And so,

108
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.440
because he was a chef, everyone, you know, would say, oh,

109
00:06:05.441 --> 00:06:09.520
he was the gr a great chef or a celebrity chef or a famous chef, you know?

110
00:06:09.521 --> 00:06:12.760
And he was always really careful to say, I wasn't, you know, I was like,

111
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.670
I was good at leading a kitchen. I was good at getting food out on him,

112
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:21.310
but I was not in any way, a world famous creative chef. I was a leader of men,

113
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.510
you know, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and there was, I think a lot of, uh,

114
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.710
I don't know, insecurity, but just a rec,

115
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:30.870
just a recognition that he wasn't the kind of chef, uh,

116
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.510
like Eric repair, his good friend or any of these guys that he really admired,

117
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.700
you know? And he wanted everyone to be, to know that he knew that too.

118
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.260
<v 1>Yeah. That just the genuine humility mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; about him.</v>
