00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>Doing doing that, doing the edibles.</v>

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.560
I remember Alex Jones being there once and Diaz's giving him a cookie and he

3
00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:08.200
goes, that's right. He goes, Hey, this cookie Vegas. Yeah. And Alex Jones,

4
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:11.160
like what's in the cookie and Diaz' goes, eat the cookie. Like,

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.240
like what kinda of stupid question is that, you know, what's.

6
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.000
<v 1>In there's right. We went to eat with him afterwards. He was barbecued. He was,</v>

7
00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.960
he was so much more reasonable back then. He, I never a.

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.440
<v 0>Different guy.</v>

9
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.190
I never understood how they made him from crazy conspiracy theorists

10
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.350
to arthritis. I didn't get the connection there.

11
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.300
<v 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.750
that connection happened when he became United with like Alex Jones became

13
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:38.030
United with Donald Trump, right? Like, cuz he was a big part of Donald Trump in,

14
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.740
in the campaign days. In what way Donald Trump would call in,

15
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.980
he would call into Infowars. Right.

16
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:47.140
And he knew that Alex Jones had a big base and Alex Jones would help him get

17
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:48.540
elected. Donald, you know,

18
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:52.060
Donald Trump is very clever in who he aligns himself with.

19
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.660
Like when you see him standing there listening to Kanye west where Kanye west is

20
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:01.380
ranting and saying all this crazy skitzo nonsense and he is like this.

21
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.490
Hmm. That's a smart cookie. Mm-hmm like, he's very smart in when he calls.

22
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.610
And when he doesn't call, you know what choose I' to call. Yeah.

23
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:12.850
It's like imagine if Kanye west was debating him and they were doing a

24
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:15.170
presidential debate and Kanye was talking like that, he'd be like,

25
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:17.570
what the is this guy saying exactly.

26
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.130
<v 0>Like you think you're giving up for me so I'll let you talk. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.440
<v 1>He's know.</v>

28
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.040
<v 0>I just don't get how Alex Jones went to that though. Super popular besides that.</v>

29
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.960
So that's what it was. Cause he would have him on a bunch.

30
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.960
<v 1>Well, you know, also Al AltRight wasn't a thing back then. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:34.880
You gotta realize when, when Alex came with us to, to the fights,

32
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.800
there was no AltRight but he was.

33
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.760
<v 0>More like lizard people. Yeah. Or like, or like,</v>

34
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:43.230
oh it's a government conspiracy. Yeah. He was all about don't get a on nine 11.

35
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.590
It's like, yeah. He was all about.

36
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.310
<v 1>Certain conspiracies.</v>

37
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.110
<v 0>I remember we were in Austin once when there was a shooting at a, at a,</v>

38
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.110
a army base. We were there.

39
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.830
<v 1>Right with him. Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.950
When the thing he was finding out about whenhappened and we were at a bar.

41
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.350
<v 0>Remember that? And he goes, I guarantee you, uh,</v>

42
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.470
they're not taking that guy alive. I guarantee they won't let him talk.

43
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.550
And then an hour later, like they got him alive.

44
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:04.340
They shot him in the leg and they got him' alive. He goes, yeah,

45
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.020
of course they got him'em a alive because they want him to be a martyr for this

46
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:09.940
thing. And it's like, or whatever. I don't want him to be martyr. Right. Yeah.

47
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:13.340
And it's like, no matter what, he's just, I'm spinning this to conspiracy.

48
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.380
And then I, I just, that.

49
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.060
<v 1>Business is a tricky business, man. I.</v>

50
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.980
<v 0>Don't how they said like, now you gotta be off the air now. It's like.</v>

51
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.500
<v 1>Well, that's where it's up it E lizard per.</v>

52
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.800
<v 0>Guy. Well.</v>

53
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.571
<v 1>It's not though,</v>

54
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:30.410
because like people were concerned that you're giving out bad information.

55
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.570
Right? Yeah. And they're concerned about it. But then with Alex,

56
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.610
what came out was the Sandy hook thing. The Sandy hook denial thing was when,

57
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.493
again, conspiracy.

58
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.290
<v 0>I don't get why that's why, but it was a conspiracy.</v>

59
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.960
<v 1>Involving children being murdered and their parents actors.</v>

60
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.760
And that everyone was like some sort of a crisis actor.

61
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.800
And they were hired by the government to take away people's guns. This is,

62
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.360
this is the okay. Okay. Okay. The most radical version of.

63
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.480
<v 0>Spirit. Right. I understand. And I understand that's that's wrong and crazy.</v>

64
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; where do you get from there to you?

65
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.800
Can't be allowed to say these CRA you've been saying these made up things

66
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.480
before, right? You're saying it's still, well, it's a, I,

67
00:03:06.481 --> 00:03:07.640
I don't get why it's a hateonger.

68
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.680
<v 1>You got a really good argument, but here's the argument.</v>

69
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.520
The argument is what is Facebook? What is Twitter?

70
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.920
What is YouTube?

71
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.190
Are they private companies or are they gonna be Moster most certainly or even

72
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:24.110
more. So are they utilities? Is it like the electricity?

73
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.430
Is it like a phone?

74
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.870
Like what should you be allowed to tell someone that can't use it?

75
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.430
<v 0>Like, I wonder if Jack said, Hey, I'm shutting down Twitter.</v>

76
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.270
If the government's like, we're opening a back again.

77
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.910
<v 1>Right? Or is it like NBC? Cuz if NBC is a private company and our,</v>

78
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.780
or shapfi says, Hey, the lizard,

79
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:44.220
people are eating kids and that's that's that who run 60 minutes. Yeah.

80
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:46.660
And they say, no, no, no. Are you're fired. Look,

81
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.780
Roseanne made one bad ambient joke.

82
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.500
And they canceled her and they kicked her off of, uh, the, they were looking.

83
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.380
<v 0>To get rid her for any other reason. Weren't it's they were, they weren't,</v>

84
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.233
that's not true.

85
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.380
<v 1>Why do you say that? The show was a huge hit.</v>

86
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.090
<v 0>Because of the outrage over the first season when she was like,</v>

87
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.290
she supports Trump. Yeah. But I talked to Morgan.

88
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.850
<v 1>About, it was a giant hit.</v>

89
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.130
<v 0>But they were looking to get rid of her. This whole group was already saying,</v>

90
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.530
we want you out. We're looking for an excuse.

91
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.050
Kind of like when they got rid of you at the comedy store over filming,

92
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.400
when it was like, come on, they already wanted to get rid of you. Well,

93
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.880
and then they found an excuse to get it done.

94
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.800
<v 1>Mm that's a tricky.</v>

95
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.040
<v 0>Argument because they wanted her out. So I think.</v>

96
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.560
<v 1>So bad. I don't think they wanted her out.</v>

97
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.000
I think they wanted to minimize her the left. She was telling that's true.

98
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.720
But she was telling me how they were changing the way they were writing things.

99
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.240
And they weren'tncluding her in the process where she was very much included in

100
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.550
the process sister in the first season,

101
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.110
when they were writing for the second season, they were,

102
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:47.710
they were basically excluding her from the process of premises and the way they

103
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:49.150
were writing the show. I mean, I.

104
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.350
<v 0>Read, I read all the outrage about early on. It's like you're a Trump supporter.</v>

105
00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:57.110
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and I read, I, I saw, uh, someone like Ray,

106
00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.020
so some young female comedian going like when, when, when Silverman was like,

107
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.380
Hey, watch my friend show Roseanne. She's great, great show. And she goes, oh,

108
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:07.580
this is the. I gotta be fake with, at a party and kiss her on the cheek.

109
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:09.740
Pretend I'm cool with her. And it's like,

110
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.260
what is all this outrage over this protrump thing? And I finally I'm like,

111
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:15.940
let me go watch it. And my friend Jewish,

112
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.380
female leftist Morgan Murphy who wrote it. Um,

113
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.930
I talked to her later about it by, I finally watched it and it's,

114
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.730
there's 12 characters in the show.

115
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.090
10 of them don't talk about who they voted for at all.

116
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.370
One of them is pro-rump one of them' is anti-Trump there's also a little trans

117
00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:35.130
kid on there and that's it just one pro-rump one anti-Trump.

118
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.810
And the outrage that I saw was almost like,

119
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.450
I don't think you guys could have possibly watched this episode. Mm.

120
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.760
I thinkre all reading headlines about stories.

121
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.080
And that's what I talked to Morgan about. I'm like,

122
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.560
it doesn't seem like it could have come from the actual facts. Yeah.

123
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.120
<v 1>There's a lot of that going on. Right.</v>

124
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.760
<v 0>Yeah. And so I, I feel like it's the same thing with Alex Jones.</v>

125
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.640
I'm getting hate monger. I'm like what? Alex Jones. Just crazy conspiracy.

126
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.320
<v 1>Guy. Most of it. Yeah. Most of it where's hate monger. Well, yeah. Um.</v>

127
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.320
<v 0>Did you talk about taking away trans rights or like that no'.</v>

128
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.080
<v 1>There was some talk, there was some talk Alex Jones was saying in one of the,</v>

129
00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:15.800
one of the last final straws,

130
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.470
it was talking about out people taking up arms and that people are not gonna

131
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.750
stand it. And you know, it's, it's basically Rable roussing,

132
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.470
which is like a lot of what people do when they're,

133
00:06:26.471 --> 00:06:29.510
they're talking about the other side, trying to take away your rights. Yeah.

134
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:32.910
Trying to take away your guns. We're not gonna stand for it. You know, you know,

135
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.380
and, and people are gonna get shot. You know, that kind of talk. I mean,

136
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:39.660
I don't know specifically what he said,

137
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.980
but there's a problem that you don't know specifically. Right.

138
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.220
There's a problem that they can just decide that you represent a certain faction

139
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.300
of thought. Yeah.

140
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.860
And that this should be eliminated from you should be de-platformed

141
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.260
instead like the.

142
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.020
<v 0>Platform for a conspiracy guy. And they goes, people are going up to those,</v>

143
00:06:57.021 --> 00:06:59.290
those P parents is saying like your kid's not dead.

144
00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:01.130
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and it's like, that's a real issue. Yeah. But it's like,

145
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:04.690
he's not calling for that. That's what they're doing on their own. Right. Um,

146
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.730
somebody shot two cops in New York because of the black lives matter movement.

147
00:07:07.731 --> 00:07:09.970
Right. You don't shut down the black lives matter movement over that.

148
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.410
They weren't asking for them to shoot cops. Right.

149
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:14.170
Someone did that on their own. He was also in,

150
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.970
he wasn't asking for them to do that. Right? No, he wasn't. So like, so like a,

151
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.280
I don't see how you deepplatform.

152
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.640
The only great article I've read was by a trans woman who said,

153
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:23.040
when I hear crazy like that,

154
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.080
I feel like you're supposed to roll your eyes and then walk away.

155
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.440
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you don't say, Hey, you need to get gone.

156
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.120
<v 1>Well, you know, deep platforming.</v>

157
00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.720
<v 0>People, that's a good.</v>

158
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.440
<v 1>Way to put it. That that is what they're saying. And it, it is also,</v>

159
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.390
it seemed like it was a universal deepplay at forming because Twitter was one of

160
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.510
the last places that kept him on mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then they decided that

161
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:46.790
they were gonna remove him. But I didn't see anything specifically.

162
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.990
<v 0>Yeah. I, yeah. Like they have some rules like that when they got, um,</v>

163
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.670
who's a woman that was rose mcallwan and then she was claim talking about a rape

164
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.910
and people like, how dare you? She, she, she outed a rape. And then, and then,

165
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.540
uh, you deplatformed her from that. Or you took her down from that. Um,

166
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.020
and then that was the story. That was a headline. Everyone's like, how dare you,

167
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:07.740
Jack? Is that the guy from Twitter? Jack Dorsey. Yeah. Yeah. How dare you?

168
00:08:07.741 --> 00:08:10.820
And then he actually responded, he goes, oh no, no. She docked somebody.

169
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.060
She gave somebody's information about where they live and stuff like that.

170
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.060
And that's we already had that rule. You can't do that.

171
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.770
Nothing to do with why she docked him. Well, let's let's is.

172
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.330
<v 1>Just over that. Why don't you Google?</v>

173
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.690
What exactly got Alex Jones kicked off Twitter? Cause he would,

174
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:31.530
Twitter was one of the last platforms and then they can say he hates speech

175
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.210
and hate speech is one of those weird, so broad.

176
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.770
<v 0>Broad terms. It's like, well, I hate you. Yeah. Okay.</v>

177
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.600
I mean, I, I, I, I really am like, I, I don't,

178
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.840
I think people are forgetting how the a C L U defended the Klan members mm-hmm

179
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.560
&lt;affirmative&gt; because the free speech is too big. A a, a, a,

180
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.320
a issue to worry about how I feel about what they're saying. Well, you know.

181
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.680
<v 1>What's really interesting is that.</v>

182
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.213
<v 0>Leftle people,</v>

183
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.960
the leftists are the ones that wanna censor and de-platform and silence people

184
00:09:01.961 --> 00:09:04.640
on the right. It is. It's also both. I think we see the left more.

185
00:09:04.641 --> 00:09:06.920
Cause we're in that bubble. Think the right is doing it too.

186
00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.160
We just don't we're not friends with them. How are.

187
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.160
<v 1>The white doing it? They have no,</v>

188
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.760
no power in technology that the tech companies, whether it's Facebook, Google,

189
00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:17.630
Twitter, they were all left. Yeah. And they're the ones who have the, I mean,

190
00:09:17.631 --> 00:09:21.470
this is where it's weird. Right? It's cuz nobody saw this coming. It was media.

191
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.670
Like you had Fox news, you had NBC, you had,

192
00:09:24.671 --> 00:09:28.190
you had your left and you had your right more left than right. Of sure.

193
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.110
But there was power in the Fox news, you know, faction. They had their voice.

194
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:36.460
But in the, in, when it comes to technology,

195
00:09:36.461 --> 00:09:38.820
there's not really an equivalent or commit people.

196
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.020
Those mostly company people it's all left. Yeah. It's all left.

197
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.660
There's not one rightle large social media platform.

198
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.260
Right. They don't exist.

199
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.780
<v 0>It should just stay out of it. But I, I get why that you,</v>

200
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.780
you get a Reddit situation where it's like, okay, but it suddenly, it, it,

201
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.930
it devolveed into just child, a porn.

202
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.370
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; well, Reddit, the problem with Reddit is an anonymity.</v>

203
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.090
When you give people anonymity and one guy actually lost his job because of it,

204
00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:07.490
because somebody decided, Hey, this guy's such a creep piece of.

205
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.250
Let's find out who the he is. And they got his IP.

206
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.450
And then they figured out who he was.

207
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.130
And then he was like some guy who was a dad. Right.

208
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.720
He was like some regular guy with a job. And they got him. I heard. And like,

209
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.920
you know, like he had a bunch of weird, you know,

210
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.000
kid type posts and a bunch of that.

211
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.160
<v 0>Just people, but some of it's just like,</v>

212
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:28.560
it's almost like role playing exactly where it's, you're not serious. Exactly.

213
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.653
<v 1>And it's all.</v>

214
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.240
<v 0>Said, it' Halman, as people are running outta the room yesterday,</v>

215
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.360
or two days ago, he got a full room randomly &lt;laugh&gt; at the end of the night.

216
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.470
Yeah. He spent his first three minutes. Like, like, uh, yeah.

217
00:10:40.471 --> 00:10:42.190
It's 20 many people. I don't know what to do.

218
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.550
I never get in front of these many people. Like he couldn't handle it.

219
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.590
And then he starts going,

220
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:48.070
they start leaving and he starts getting angry and more into his pocket,

221
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.270
you know, into where he is belongs. And then as people are leaving,

222
00:10:51.271 --> 00:10:55.630
like he's talking about child and stuff like that. And uh, and um, he goes,

223
00:10:55.631 --> 00:10:59.940
Hey guys, uh, peek behind the curtain. I didn't a baby.

224
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.740
&lt;laugh&gt; just so you know, there were no babies, so calm down.

225
00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.260
<v 1>Well, people don't want to hear about that subject. Right. And.</v>

226
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:09.340
<v 0>That's fair. Yeah. It, they.</v>

227
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.141
<v 1>Come to the common store.</v>

228
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:12.900
It's gross to hear some wonderful jokes about people losing socks in the dryer.

229
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:13.180
Right.

230
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.020
<v 0>So actually honestly, walking out is a fine response. Yeah.</v>

231
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.850
Saying he can't go up in him more is not a fine response. It's.

232
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 1>A different response. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

233
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:22.570
And saying you're gonna boycot the comedy store because they don't do your kind

234
00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:23.730
of comedy. And if.

235
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.250
<v 0>You want a boycot that's also okay.</v>

236
00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.450
But just trying to get other people to and all right.

237
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.530
<v 1>But there's that this is a problem in that there's no</v>

238
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.970
balance, right. If people are just right leaning and,

239
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:41.640
and people want de-platform them because they have rightle beliefs,

240
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:45.560
rightlean ideas. Like say if they support president Trump, I mean,

241
00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:47.560
he is the president. Whether you like it, like, and.

242
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.440
<v 0>It's like, you're allowed to vote it. You like it or not. Whether you.</v>

243
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:49.561
<v 1>Want,</v>

244
00:11:49.561 --> 00:11:53.040
whether you like it or not that guy's the president and whether you like his

245
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.520
policies or not, they are his policies. He's the president of the United States.

246
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.560
And if someone supports that deplatforming people who support him or support

247
00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:03.240
that is not the right response,

248
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.600
the right response is a well worded argument against that. That is against that.

249
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.480
That is convincingly

250
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.270
articulate to the point where you, you make an argument that this is a,

251
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:20.230
a terrible policy, a terrible idea. And,

252
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:24.230
and an objective fence rider like myself, that watches that and reads,

253
00:12:24.231 --> 00:12:26.350
it might go, okay, this guy's got a good point in the.

254
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.350
<v 0>Left. I want to hear both sides,</v>

255
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.990
but I need to hear that side in order to hear the alternative side,

256
00:12:29.991 --> 00:12:32.590
like Dave Smith, who hates all politicians pretty much. Mm-hmm,

257
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.020
&lt;affirmative&gt; he,

258
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.620
he's pointing out these like separating their kids from their parents thing.

259
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.620
Yeah. And he's like, it's gotten real bad with Trump now. And he goes, okay,

260
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.320
that's true.

261
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.580
But look at the picture they're using on the bottom right hand corner.

262
00:12:41.581 --> 00:12:43.500
There's a date stamp on it. And it's 2014.

263
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.660
<v 1>Yeah. There's definitely a lot of shenanigans. So photographs.</v>

264
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.420
<v 0>Your anger is not even who you, so I, it can, can't even bring that. That's.</v>

265
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.890
<v 1>Just journalism. That's what that is. And, and online line journalism, there,</v>

266
00:12:54.891 --> 00:12:58.090
there look, journalism. No, but are fighting for their lives right now. They're.

267
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.970
<v 0>Back. Their' state of journalism.</v>

268
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.210
<v 1>Is terrible. It's terrible. And it's also, there's no money in it. There's,</v>

269
00:13:02.211 --> 00:13:03.810
there's a problem is nobody wants to buy newspapers.

270
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:05.170
Nobody wants to buy magazines.

271
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:09.850
And it's really hard for online journalism to not resort, to click date anger.

272
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.970
Yeah. I mean, that's literally how they make their living now is click date.

273
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.400
And so, you know, they have a photo. This is with the stock photo.

274
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:20.200
We got a little kid who's crying and he's standing in front of a border patrol

275
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:23.840
guy, throw it up, use it is what we got. The story's real.

276
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.800
The photo's not it's it's journalism. And I.

277
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.600
<v 0>Think it, it really comes down to like,</v>

278
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:30.520
when you see like a nor McDonald where he's like, okay,

279
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.480
I haven't done anything to anybody wrong. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I just want,

280
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:37.590
wanna look at, with compassion on another human I'm like, these are PE,

281
00:13:37.591 --> 00:13:39.430
these are friends of mine, the people I know, what.

282
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:41.270
<v 1>Do you, what? Just be specific. What are you're saying about nor.</v>

283
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.190
<v 0>McDonald'? Well, he said like Roseanne and, and Louie, and like,</v>

284
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:46.870
they've lost everything in a day and people don't really understand what it's

285
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:50.350
like. Right. And I would like to see these friends, human beings,

286
00:13:50.351 --> 00:13:53.310
friends of mine come out with the way. And he goes, honestly,

287
00:13:53.311 --> 00:13:54.950
I don't think Roseanne knew that lady was black. I,

288
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.740
I don't think she makes that comment. And, and then people go, you,

289
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.540
your CA your tonighttro appearance is canceled. Yeah. And it's like,

290
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:03.380
why didn't even do anything mean robertmcdonald,

291
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:07.260
didn't do anything instead of taking that opportunity to go, Hey,

292
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:11.340
let's hear himem out. Maybe you can clarify what you mean. Right. Um, even say,

293
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.460
no, I didn't mean it that way.

294
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.770
A de-platform they de-platform cuz these women are P people.

295
00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.490
I don't really know who they were at the tonight show had their opportunity to

296
00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:22.450
fall on their sword and they go, now we get to stand up for women's rights.

297
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:25.330
So we get to stand up for racial rights. Well, the way to stand up for,

298
00:14:25.331 --> 00:14:27.090
instead of going, like, let let' have 'em on. Exactly.

299
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.210
Have 'em on and say have Jimmy Fallon go, what did you mean by that? Exactly.

300
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.530
And then to clarify his position to now show, oh, I'm on your side,

301
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:35.890
but people don't want that. They're more in,

302
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.000
they're more interested in punishment. Yes.
