00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.650
If you're a person who was advising a president or a governor,

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.310
how to fix an economically disabled community,

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.290
if you have a community that's always had a history of poverty and crime and,

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.760
uh, uh, you know, uh,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.700
drug use and gang use in these communities. Like w w what would you do?

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.980
Like, how do you use this idea of like capitalism to fix something

8
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:32.940
that clearly requires some charity? It requires.

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.650
<v 1>First of all, we can, we can stop making the problem worse.</v>

10
00:00:36.651 --> 00:00:39.830
We can decriminalize drugs and end the war on drugs.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.090
Just like the war on poverty. It's backfired. The war on drugs is a failure,

12
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.220
right? People look in a free society. People have a right to,

13
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.140
to consume what they want to consume course.

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.710
Especially if they want to do drugs, let them do drugs, right?

15
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.780
And even if those drugs are harmful,

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.150
adults can make decisions and deal with the consequences of their decisions. So.

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.340
<v 0>The legal alternatives are just as bad.</v>

18
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.080
<v 1>Right? But the problem is when you, when you have the,</v>

19
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.590
the war on drugs and you, and you make it a crime,

20
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.530
now you incentivize criminal activity.

21
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.140
Because whenever something is illegal,

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.020
it's much more expensive than it would be if it were legal.

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.190
And now you create this huge profit opportunity for criminals to come in and

24
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.190
fill that demand, because people still want the drugs.

25
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.040
They just can't buy them legally through a reputable source.

26
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.180
The only way they can get them is illegally through a criminal. This is.

27
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.820
<v 0>The best example of what we've created in Mexico.</v>

28
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.040
The best example of that in Mexico, right?

29
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.960
<v 1>And then what you do is you increase the cost of the illegal drugs.</v>

30
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.620
So let's say there's a heroin addict, and now heroin is illegal.

31
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.940
And so heroin is very expensive. Well, where is this heroin addict?

32
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:56.660
And he get the money to buy that heroin. He goes out and steals. I mean,

33
00:01:56.661 --> 00:02:00.800
most of the robbery is committed by drug addicts because they need the money to

34
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:03.920
buy their expensive heroin. Well, if heroin were legal,

35
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.310
it would be much cheaper and they wouldn't have to steal. Of course, you know,

36
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.230
we create all these other crimes.

37
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:11.270
I'm not saying that people shouldn't do heroin,

38
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.700
but they should be free to make a decision,

39
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.180
but they shouldn't have to Rob other people to, to support their habit. And,

40
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:21.290
and, and you know, and when you, when you, when you have heroin, when, when,

41
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.290
you know, when it's illegal and there's all these profits, you know,

42
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.380
that the drug guy, the pusher has an incentive that gets you hooked on it.

43
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.540
You know, I think it should, you know,

44
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.700
maybe you should have to go get a prescription for it,

45
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.890
where the doctor can try to talk you out of it. Hey,

46
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:35.690
are you sure you want to use this stuff? You know,

47
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:37.160
this is going to really hurt you. I mean,

48
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.540
do you really want to become an addict?

49
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.360
Here's some movies watch what happens to you. You know, I mean,

50
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.940
most people probably wouldn't necessarily make that decision.

51
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.690
If they were confronted with a lot of evidence that shows why it's a very

52
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:52.340
disruptive way to live your life. But so we got to get rid of the war on drugs,

53
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:55.280
get rid of the crime in that community. You know, you know,

54
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.830
th that's number one, but then as far as if you've got a lot poor people,

55
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.290
why are people poor? Right?

56
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.120
You're poor because they don't have the skills or they

57
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:11.320
can't earn enough money. They're not productive enough to generate income,

58
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.910
you know, above the poverty line. So if you have people who were poor,

59
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.950
the way to make them less poor is to increase their productivity,

60
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.190
right? One way obviously is through education when they're young.

61
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.390
But I don't think government education is a solution because I don't think

62
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:30.580
government education is educating anybody.

63
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.170
I think government schools are run for the benefit of the bureaucracy,

64
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.680
of the, of the school districts, of the, the, the teacher's unions.

65
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.810
I want free enterprise.

66
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.040
I want vouchers or private schools to compete for

67
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.860
educational dollars. Just the way, you know,

68
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.400
the cell phone companies are competing. You know, they,

69
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.810
they want me to buy their cell phone instead of somebody else's,

70
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:55.270
they have to make it better and they have to make it less expensive.

71
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:58.480
So let's have schools that are competing to be the best,

72
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.600
the opt for the best education, at the best value.

73
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.890
And we've got in these cities,

74
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.370
we've got these poor kids trapped and he's failed government schools.

75
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.660
They waste their time. They learn nothing. A lot of these kids graduate.

76
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:15.130
They're not even literate. I mean, they can't even do basic, basic arithmetic.

77
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.940
<v 0>We need real education, but in the current state of the world,</v>

78
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.080
those people don't have any other options. Those people.

79
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.260
<v 1>Have any other options because the government has taken away that option.</v>

80
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.730
But what is government.

81
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.310
<v 0>Real time, but what do you do for them in real time?</v>

82
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:34.290
If you have a guy who's in a lower income family and he has a seven year old

83
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:36.880
son, and that kid is going to school right now, like how, how,

84
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.150
how do you fix that right now? By making it, if we have private schools,

85
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.580
the kids could go there. They couldn't afford, right?

86
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.800
What if they couldn't afford five in schools.

87
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.150
<v 1>For people who are really poor private schools would give out scholarships to</v>

88
00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:54.030
kids that have a lot of potential and their parents don't have the money.

89
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.110
But when the private sector educates kids, it's cheaper.

90
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.670
A lot of potential.

91
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.650
<v 0>A lot of potential. That bothers me because like,</v>

92
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:03.720
what if a kid doesn't have a lot of potential than he does,

93
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.630
he doesn't get an education cause he can't afford a school.

94
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.710
<v 1>Not every, but let's say it. Let's say a kid doesn't have a lot of potential.</v>

95
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.200
A certain type of education might be a waste that would be better off learning a

96
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:19.080
trade. Hold on. You might be better off learning how to do something.

97
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.233
Learn a trade.

98
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.380
<v 0>Kid is seven. If the kid's in first grade and is seven,</v>

99
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.290
how do you know whether or not that kid has a lot of potential? That's crazy.

100
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:28.500
Yeah.

101
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.380
<v 1>Seven is, I dunno. Seven might be a little young. How would I.</v>

102
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.140
<v 0>Think the total tuition tuition.</v>

103
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.300
<v 1>In first or second grade is probably going to be less than in high school,</v>

104
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.700
because in order to teach a second grader,

105
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.290
the teacher doesn't have to know as much as a teacher needs to know to teach a

106
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.124
10th grader.

107
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.390
So you wouldn't have to pay a second grade teacher as much as a 10th grade

108
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:52.260
teacher see the problem.

109
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.620
The problem in the government is everybody get paid the same,

110
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.160
whether they're a lousy teacher, a good teacher,

111
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.710
whether they're teaching a first grader or a high school,

112
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.870
they did this all based on seniority.

113
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.820
It's a crazy crackpot system that only the government could devise.

114
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.120
And it's only because they have a captive audience. The people,

115
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.650
the customers don't have a choice and the parents aren't even involved.

116
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.310
If the parents were actually writing a check and paying for the education,

117
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.260
they would make sure that kids did the homework.

118
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.050
They would make sure they were getting their money's worth when you get it for

119
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.450
free. I mean, you just, you don't take it for granted.

120
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.200
So we need real education for the kids that can benefit from it.

121
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.040
We need to get rid of the minimum wage law and all sorts of occupational

122
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:38.570
licensing laws and other things that the government does that prevent people

123
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.060
from getting jobs or starting businesses.

124
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.550
The government is creating all sorts of barriers,

125
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.180
artificial barriers that would not exist absent.
