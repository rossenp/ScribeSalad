00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Might take in the Chad situation is.</v>

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.610
<v 1>They're doing exactly. I was talking about it with Cooley.</v>

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.700
Nawara the other day they're doing exactly the same thing. They get mad at.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.270
When they think about a country, they put up walls, they have borders,

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.210
they have police and enforcement. They beat the out of people.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.920
There's been murders inside. It's not all kumbaya. You know, it's like,

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.170
you just made a shittier smaller version of a city.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.820
Of course you did. Of course you did, but it's got borders, a regular city.

9
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.760
You can just, you can, should strive in Albuquerque. They let you in.

10
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.110
Jazz is like, you. We got border walls. You could go to the Sanford.

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.100
<v 2>No one could come in here.</v>

12
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.180
<v 1>If we have a plastic barrier, how did that happen there? LARPing.</v>

13
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.860
How did that happen? [inaudible] it's what it is for sure. I mean,

14
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:55.910
that's what it is. And.

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.480
<v 2>They took over the city, they took over the LARPers.</v>

16
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.900
<v 1>Well, they need to learn, you know, I mean, there's,</v>

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.060
there's a thing that happens when a lot of these protesters get acquainted

18
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.990
with progress, right? Whether it's Antifa or any, like, you know,

19
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:16.580
real Marxist left wing, progressive socialist movement,

20
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:18.140
they have good intentions. Right.

21
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.270
And they get lumped in with the idea of progress.

22
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.270
So people let them get away with stuff. They cunningly loud,

23
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:26.510
just they're just it's program because it's going to work out.

24
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:28.460
It's going to work out, but they don't have a real plan.

25
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.380
These folks don't have a long-term plan when Seattle gave them that just back

26
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.870
to, it's probably the most brilliant move ever. Like, okay. Oh,

27
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:39.320
you think you can do better? Why don't you go ahead? It's like, you have kids,

28
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.990
right? When your kids look good, no auditorium or shoes, like, okay,

29
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.070
good tie your shoes. They stand there for a minute. You want some help?

30
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.740
I'll help you. Cause you don't know how to tie your shoes. This is a,

31
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.930
you make the money here is you go to the link,

32
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.120
but sometimes you have to let a kid. I bet. Particularly boys. I have all girls,

33
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.820
but I would imagine with boys even more. So they get a little stubborn,

34
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.740
know what I'm doing, dad, you got to go. Oh, okay. Do you? Okay? Chaz?

35
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.130
Good luck. Good luck. Okay. Six blocks.

36
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.470
Guys had two murders inside of a week.

37
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.740
<v 2>I just don't understand how that happened. I don't understand the city.</v>

38
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:15.770
Just let it go. I think it's like a publicity stunt and they want it.

39
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.320
I think the city lost charge of that.

40
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.150
There's a lot of them letting them do that,

41
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.900
but they're not being overrun with like guns and bombs and.

42
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.670
This is like, we're gonna let these guys have it. And then we're going to,

43
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.950
you know, let this fail. Like I don't even know.

44
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.990
It just doesn't make any sense to me. It seems like a joke.

45
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.090
<v 1>You talked to Pete, my friend,</v>

46
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:38.270
Rob Wolf reached out to me because some folks from the Seattle police department

47
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.160
reached out to him. They're trying to get their message out.

48
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.173
They're trying to figure it out.

49
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.090
And the sense that they were saying that the media is not telling the true story

50
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.110
and that the true story is every time like the media will show them,

51
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:51.020
tear gassing people. But they don't say that they had set up boundaries.

52
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:52.820
And they said, you got to stay out of the precinct.

53
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:56.570
You got to stay out of this area. You guys, you can't just in invade.

54
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.820
And every time they put up these boundaries, they would push through and vile.

55
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.000
And then they had to use tear gas. They fell to defend their position.

56
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:05.800
And then they eventually had to give up the whole precinct.

57
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.840
And then they had to give up like six blocks and they don't feel like there's a

58
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.360
lot of support for their position in the news.

59
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.490
And they also don't feel like they're,

60
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.500
they're being given the freedom to defend it properly. Like they, they really,

61
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.840
they couldn't. They had to get out of there. That's why they took,

62
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.050
that's why those people took it. That's why it's still locked down today.

63
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:29.380
And the mayor's been saying lately, uh, it's time to go home now.

64
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.080
But the mayor before gave a up answer of it,

65
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.300
like saying that peaceful protest has always been great.

66
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.110
Maybe this is the summer of love, like, oh, okay, good luck lady.

67
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.770
Like these ideas, they get connected with progress, right?

68
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.050
So those people who really want better, right?

69
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.880
They're angry that George Floyd got murdered,

70
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.210
but we all are every normal rational. Person's angry.

71
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.440
They all want to see change, but we all do. But they decided to see change.

72
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.040
And six blocks of Seattle that had nothing to do with George Floyd.

73
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.260
They just took over and they just took over these buildings.

74
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:03.100
So they basically did what Columbus did. They came and took over an area,

75
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.050
but they, then they did what Trump did.

76
00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:08.260
They put up a wall and then they did what those cops did.

77
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.690
They beat the out of people. I mean, they, they,

78
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.370
they ruined their own idea within a couple of weeks. So it really was like,

79
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:18.480
Seattle, just going good. Oh, you know how to do better? Yeah. Oh,

80
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.230
you got to do better. Okay, go ahead. Yeah. And now they're like,

81
00:04:22.231 --> 00:04:24.630
it's time to go home, but there's, you know,

82
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.970
there's people in there that are armed. It's not that simple. You know,

83
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.410
I don't know how they think they're going to get these people out of there.

84
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.320
Cause you can't even get homeless people out of San Francisco.

85
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.890
They've basically taken over Portland. Portland's filled with tents.

86
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.680
San Francisco's nuts, man. It's nuts.

87
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.140
You drive down the seat and stumped some neighborhoods in San Francisco.

88
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:46.830
You see like multi-million dollar houses and there's five tents in front of the

89
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:51.060
house. Like, what is this? What is you? Can't litter.

90
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.560
You can't throw beer cans on the ground.

91
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.390
How can we can leave a tent and a little camp stove and a cardboard box filled

92
00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:58.224
with.

93
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.020
<v 2>And then everybody's just waiting for somebody else to come clean.</v>

94
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:03.090
The 10 out in front of their yard. Everybody's waiting to fish.

95
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.610
If there was three tents in front of your house.

96
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.140
<v 0>It's a good question. I don't know what to do.</v>

97
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.780
<v 1>I don't want to go to jail. So I don't know.</v>

98
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.390
Probably hire somebody to clean it up. I don't know what to do.

99
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.490
I wouldn't know what to do. What are the, what is the law?

100
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.160
Can my kid not play in the yard? Because some,

101
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.570
if someone threw a heroin needle in the yard and he's got a tent right there.

102
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.760
And if you're in Venice and you got this little,

103
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.630
little tiny patch of grass where your kid can play and your kid runs into a

104
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:29.700
heroin needle that someone chucked over the fence.

105
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.300
But we have to be progressive. We have to be nice as people.

106
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.130
<v 2>Well, you go knock on the tent. Hey man, you can't ever stay here. Get the out.</v>

107
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.790
Oh it. Dude, go actually. Won't you're going to get the out.

108
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.170
You're going to get the up. Nope. Got to go. I'm a crack baby.

109
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.080
All right later, you got.

110
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.460
<v 3>To go. I'm looking at, I was leaving said, they're gonna leave today.</v>

111
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:54.690
There's like an official, uh,

112
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.120
Capitol protest on it says there it's concluded as of tonight.

113
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:02.990
And they expect some people to not actually leave, but they're saying it's over.

114
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.370
See, I.

115
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.340
<v 2>Think somebody else funded that. I think that was a big joke.</v>

116
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.410
I think that was like a big, I don't know,

117
00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:12.520
probably somebody in a deep state or whatever,

118
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.340
the guys that fund all the other stuff. That's crazy. Right? The.

119
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.500
<v 1>Guys should throw Epstein witnesses out of buildings.</v>

120
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.410
<v 3>How does that money go around? Who gets it?</v>

121
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.400
<v 1>It goes in Bitcoin. They buy tacos with it. No.</v>

122
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.600
<v 2>I think people are, are funding and, and I don't know.</v>

123
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.980
There's so much going on.

124
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.060
I can't just blindly believe any of these narratives anymore.

125
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.590
It's just beyond to.

126
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:36.423
<v 0>Me.</v>

127
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.570
[inaudible].
