<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 1>Experience. Yeah. So, so when I,</v>

3
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.630
when I was into my career and just kind of getting, you know,

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.040
kind of trying to figure out like what what's next for me, you know, um,

5
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.230
it, it was hard, you know, it was just a hard place because, um, you know,

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.580
I really have anybody to talk to.

7
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.330
I didn't really know what I was going to do next in my life, you know?

8
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.370
And then when I started fighting again,

9
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.970
I still was in that place where I just wasn't, you know,

10
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:31.890
totally back to fighting my mentality because fighting is something mentally

11
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.990
that it takes, it takes a certain mentality for, you know, and for me,

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.890
fighting was something that I did to, uh,

13
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.740
exercise some demons a bit, you know, but,

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.110
but having some time away from the sport,

15
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.910
it allowed me to figure other ways to exercise. So G-Man demons and, you know,

16
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.410
figure out some things around them. You know,

17
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.910
the things that made me mad and things that were my fuel before I kind of made

18
00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:00.990
peace with them and then making peace with a lot of the things that I was using

19
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.550
for my fuel. It just changed the way I fought in the way I seen fighting.

20
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.690
So coming back to fight, I just wasn't that same fighter anymore.

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580
And then when I got to the point where I was like, man, I can't keep myself.

22
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.020
Like I was like, man, I'm not fighting the way I want to fight. And you know,

23
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.070
there's, I mean, what's the point. If I can't go and compete the way I want to,

24
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:27.450
I'm only torturing myself. So then I decided to retire. But then when I retired,

25
00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:31.950
I was still was in a space where I was like, man, it's still something missing.

26
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.530
So then when I did the five MEO DMT,

27
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.050
that kind of put things in perspective in a, in a whole different way, you know?

28
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.790
And, and it just, um, it, it changed me. It changed me a lot.

29
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:46.920
It changed the way that, you know, like I said,

30
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:49.770
the way I think the way I eat everything, everything about it, you know?

31
00:01:49.771 --> 00:01:54.120
So it was, um, it was so cathartic and so many, so many, uh,

32
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.920
sense that a word, you know, do you think.

33
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.920
<v 0>We did something like that would be really beneficial for fighters that are in</v>

34
00:01:58.921 --> 00:02:00.480
the Twilight of their career?

35
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.820
<v 1>I think, I think it could be. I think,</v>

36
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.370
I think every fighter gets to a point where, um,

37
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.760
you fight enough then fighting it, kinda, it kinda,

38
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.920
you kind of get in a weird space about it. And you know,

39
00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:15.030
I seen fighters go through that period where they just kinda like figuring out

40
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.830
that, why, why am I still doing this? You know,

41
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:19.260
they've had great moments inside the cage,

42
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.820
but then they have those down moments.

43
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.500
And those Dom almost either the moments where it's hard to come back from.

44
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.430
And I think those are the times where you, you know,

45
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:33.620
a psychedelic or something like that could put things in perspective and,

46
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:38.340
and allow the fire to see the why behind the reason they're

47
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.980
doing it and maybe create a new why it's.

48
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.521
<v 0>You know,</v>

49
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:45.660
like what happens to them if the Corona virus hits and they get locked doors for

50
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:50.160
six months and you just become a gore phobic and lose your. Well,

51
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.450
we were talking about this the other day,

52
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:56.160
that most of what this is all happened from the Reagan administration,

53
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.690
during the Reagan administration,

54
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.240
they changed the standards of what it means to be mentally ill.

55
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.910
And they just release people from asylums cause they didn't want to pay for it

56
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:08.410
all. And you know that look,

57
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.880
if LA is LA is a city of 20 plus

58
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.240
million people, which is as many people in LA,

59
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.020
as I think is in all of Australia. So think about that.

60
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.100
Think about the amount of money and that they can't make a silence here.

61
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.490
Think about how many abandoned buildings there are, how much money,

62
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.500
how much money would it cost is there's currently somewhere in the neighborhood

63
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.420
of 70,000 homeless people.

64
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.070
<v 2>Some statistic that said there's more empty apartments in this town than.</v>

65
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.440
<v 0>Homeless people. The thing is though that those folks don't just need a place.</v>

66
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.310
Cause they'll that place up and punch holes in the wall and in there and stuff,

67
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:49.930
smear it. No, they're crazy. Yeah. They,

68
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.490
what they need is help and they need medication and they need counseling and

69
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.870
they need, I mean, some people I don't, I mean, I'm not a mental health expert.

70
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.990
I don't, some of them, you might not be able to do anything to some, some,

71
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.470
some are so gone, might not. And also they get so filled with despair.

72
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.370
I knew a bunch of guys that were homeless back from my pool hall days.

73
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:12.010
There was a bunch of guys that would hang around the pool hall.

74
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.350
They would even sleep on the floor. And you know,

75
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.700
I knew guys who tried to sleep in people's couches and sleep at the bus stops.

76
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.090
And then they'd come to the pool all and try to hustle up enough money to get

77
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.680
some drugs. And it was,

78
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.900
they were stuck in this place where they could never get past where they

79
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.260
were. They were just in a rut and they can never get out of it. And it was just,

80
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.640
it's heartbreaking. Yeah. Despair so much despair because just.

81
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.750
<v 2>What happened. The, for instance, the other day,</v>

82
00:04:40.751 --> 00:04:44.590
I'm walking down, Santa Monica Boulevard over by, um,

83
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.510
Barney's Beanery and I just hear up and I look over and this

84
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:53.860
kid's like had to be 22, 23 years old.

85
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.810
And I was like, what happened?

86
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.020
<v 0>And where are your parents? One too many auditions blew a few.</v>

87
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.610
<v 2>Just snap. If I hear no one more time.</v>

88
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.430
<v 0>Oh, yay. Dropped him. And he's just out there randomly.</v>

89
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.570
<v 2>I'll show you Hollywood reporter.</v>

90
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.220
<v 0>Got,</v>

91
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.180
there are people though that you meet in this town when you meet them early in

92
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:20.350
their journey and they still have hope, like it's not worked out yet,

93
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.610
but it's gonna, I'm going to make it. And then you run into in comics. Yeah.

94
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.450
<v 2>Oh, I mean, that's the thing. I think it's so relatable in our field as well,</v>

95
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.440
because none of.

96
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.273
<v 0>Those people.</v>

97
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.790
<v 3>So radio Raheem, you just said, uh,</v>

98
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.910
your people have been fighting for 400 years. Okay. First of all,

99
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.590
I'm in the midst of my question. I don't do these things. Uh, uh,

100
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.040
haphazardly. I wear my questions very carefully. Yes.

101
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.880
But in the ears of black America, later in the, later on the story,

102
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.460
you'll find out that your people,

103
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.350
that part of the question became incredibly important and moving people were

104
00:05:56.351 --> 00:06:01.160
very sensitive about that because you said your PR people instead of our

105
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.760
people, but I'm quoting the guy. Okay.

106
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.230
I'm not speaking for him. I'm quoting what he said. He said,

107
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.690
my people have been fighting for 10 years. So if he had said our people,

108
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:19.100
I would have said our people, but I can't take possession of your quote.

109
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:21.530
It's not me saying it. Jews saying it, right.

110
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.900
Your people have been fighting for 400 years. What did you mean by that? So,

111
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.970
uh, he laser-focus turns to me he's already at 10.

112
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.040
Like there's no ramp up at this time. And he started shouting my face,

113
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:41.300
like, uh, your people too, but you know what I'm talking about? He says,

114
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.440
don't try to bait, you know what I'm talking about when I'm saying these things,

115
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:49.730
when I'm like, well, yeah, I do. Can you tell them, what'd you talking about?

116
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:50.810
And to get them to explain,

117
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.000
tryna get them to explain to the world what he said to me on

118
00:06:56.001 --> 00:07:00.170
numerous occasions, in different interviews and off camera.

119
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.940
I know exactly what he's talking about.

120
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.650
And I know that this is the moment that he finally gets to talk about it to

121
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:11.030
people who have never been listening to him before. Right. But

122
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.640
we heard your, it was a trigger for him to, I'm so blessed.

123
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.270
And I even looking back, I'm like, man, how did you miss that? I do.

124
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.280
I swear to God, I didn't know what the was. The problem.

125
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.930
He started seeing shout in your people and I'm like, whoa, whoa.

126
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.260
It took me him. He couldn't, he needed to keep saying it.

127
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.280
I didn't know why he was saying that. Yeah. My people to my people to,

128
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.000
oh, there's a moment. I'm like, oh,

129
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.190
I thought he sounded, oh my goodness. Oh no.

130
00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.350
Uh, uh, you know, our people have been fighting for 400 years to this day,

131
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.393
to this day.

132
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.590
And so what I wanted, what I wanted,

133
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:10.160
what I thought was happening was that, okay,

134
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.420
this moment now has become about him.

135
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.500
Like attacking me because he thinks I'm attacking him. He thinks,

136
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:21.650
because I do know what he's talking about. He knows we've spoken about it,

137
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.240
but numerous times he thinks I'm pretending not to

138
00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:30.620
know like some, you know, air quotes, uncle Tom, or, you know,

139
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.040
the numerous names I've been called on the internet. Since,

140
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.810
as though I'm trying to pretend like, oh, I don't want 400 years.

141
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.960
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Fine.

142
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.120
<v 4>China has behaved now, you know,</v>

143
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:52.820
they call it socialism with Chinese characteristics.

144
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.640
That's the official name of, of,

145
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:59.010
of this long drawn game to Institute,

146
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.400
market reforms, usher in, uh, richest for the, for the,

147
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:04.440
middle-class lift a lot of people out of poverty,

148
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.000
but in a very controlled way. And in the way that's like, see,

149
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:10.270
that's the thing about like Asian culture.

150
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.030
People understand it's that the there's a fundamental

151
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:18.700
difference between the China dream and the American dream. Right. And,

152
00:09:18.701 --> 00:09:23.340
and see Jinping is outlined. What he thinks is the China dream. It's, it's,

153
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.210
it's basically a top-down way to, to, uh,

154
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.500
it's a goal to national goal. And,

155
00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:31.410
and basically what they're trying to say is that, okay,

156
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.410
we're going to lift a lot of people out of poverty, but you have to,

157
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:37.170
your generation has to make sacrifices. So it's not about the individual.

158
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.090
It's about building a strong China and implicitly also about,

159
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.330
uh, you know, ensuring that the CCP stays in power.

160
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:46.770
The Chinese communist party stays in power,

161
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.010
but it's it's that you might have to give up, you know,

162
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.660
personal sacrifices for the sake of China versus the American dream

163
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.650
is, is bottom up. It's about your right to life,

164
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:01.800
Liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That's it. And if you do that,

165
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.620
that's the American dream. And if you achieve a certain level of happiness,

166
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.560
if you achieve, you know, it's all like it's bottom up. It's not,

167
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:08.580
it's not centralized.

168
00:10:08.581 --> 00:10:11.430
And it's not something that the Chinese government is kind of trying to stuff

169
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:14.940
down your throat. Um, and China's willing to play the long game.

170
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.500
So it is still a Lenise Lenise,

171
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:23.430
Marxists government, see pink still believes in all of that.

172
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:27.900
That's why it's also totalitarian, but it's, you know, they,

173
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:32.190
they know that like the way to get gain power in the world is to get rich.

174
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.910
And they did it on some, you know, on the backs of,

175
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.360
on the backup trade with other countries through very unfair practices,

176
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:43.260
actually many cases. So if you think about like how the, I think there's,

177
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.830
there are a lot of estimates of how much they've actually stolen from the United

178
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.150
States in terms of intellectual property, um, corporate, corporate espionage,

179
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.760
um, now even like academia is being infected.

180
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:59.310
So they just arrested the head of the chemistry department at

181
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:00.144
Harvard.

182
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.170
<v 0>Oh, that's right. Yeah. But it wasn't that they didn't,</v>

183
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:08.550
they think that that guy was in connection with some weaponized.

184
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.230
<v 4>Was that a virus thing? No, no. Ma'am, that's something else.</v>

185
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.390
There was a, an article linking some Canadian researchers to the virus.

186
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:20.940
No, but this was, this was different.

187
00:11:20.941 --> 00:11:24.690
The head of the chemistry department in Harvard was found to have lied about

188
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:26.310
receiving money from the Chinese government.

189
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.350
So there's this program called the thousand talents program in China. Basically,

190
00:11:31.351 --> 00:11:34.410
they're offering a lot of money, the New York times that are really good expos,

191
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:37.860
the youngest, um, they basically offer money to like academic cause you know,

192
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.230
it's kind of sucks to be one here in the sense of like,

193
00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.870
you're not paid that well. Right.

194
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:45.870
But China's dangling like a lot more money and say, okay, if you,

195
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:50.430
if you do research here in China, um, there's going to be like less bureaucracy.

196
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.220
Um, so that's their way to lure these people in. Right.

197
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:57.100
So he was hiding the fact that he was come from him, correct.

198
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.120
How was he hiding it? He just, he didn't report it. Oh.

199
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.780
And put it in the bank anyway. Right. And so at the end of the day, when, when,

200
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:06.700
when you do, when there's a relationship there,

201
00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:11.110
China owned your research and if you're researching something sensitive,

202
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.400
that's a big issue.
