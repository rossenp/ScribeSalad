00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How do we promote looking at people as individuals?</v>

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.080
Cause I think that is really that that's,

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.240
that's one of the keys to getting out this mess. It is,

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.000
is to stop tribal ideological recognition and,

5
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.640
and definitions of humans. Just to look at people's. This is Tom,

6
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:22.750
this is sad. This is this guy. This is that girl.

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.670
This is this non-binary person, whatever the they're.

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.470
<v 1>I think that's a lot to learn from children in that regard.</v>

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.070
Cuz I don't think kids generally do that. They don't give a. Kids don't care.

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.550
They don't give a. Kids don't care. I mean, where I grew up in Saudi Arabia,

11
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.590
I mean off the bat,

12
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.110
I was just surrounded by people of all different skin colors,

13
00:00:38.111 --> 00:00:42.700
different nationalities, different religions. And it was just always cool.

14
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:46.780
Some of these ideas, like I'd never heard people talking about race

15
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.180
anytime more in my life than now, which is really weird to me. Right.

16
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.620
You know, in, in the nineties, in the thousands,

17
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.140
I wasn't hearing people talking about, you know, white privilege, this white,

18
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.850
white man that white and suddenly it it's like, you know, oh,

19
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.250
let me tell you about my, my blackness or you know,

20
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.770
you're hearing terms like blackness and whiteness. And I'm just like,

21
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:10.330
what are you even talking about? Like, this is, this is nonsense.

22
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:13.690
People of color this, but I, I can't stand that term by the way. Um, you know,

23
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.530
&lt;laugh&gt; like just all this terminology and people are just talking in these

24
00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:21.850
really bizarre ways and just kind of grouping people into these

25
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.200
weird groups. And I'm just like, what's the point of all this? What's.

26
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.720
<v 0>The purpose here. They, they get some juice out of it. You know?</v>

27
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.680
That's why it for them it's worth the squeeze. Yeah. Cuz they get something,

28
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.161
you know,

29
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:38.080
they get something by appealing to fellow Europeans or by appealing

30
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.360
to, you know, like the straight pride parade, you know,

31
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.790
they got a bunch of people to follow parade. They got together.

32
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.510
Like I'm so proud of being straight, like, oh great.

33
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:52.670
You're proud of being 90% of the population. More than that. Yeah.

34
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.550
Straight people are under attack. Like what does that mean? But it's so crazy.

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.990
I don't know. Gay pride makes sense. They,

36
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.620
I know a bunch of guys,

37
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.540
well I know at least three that are in the closet that wanna come out.

38
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.300
But can't yeah. They're scared. Yeah.

39
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.700
Whether it's cuz of their career or cuz their life, you know,

40
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.580
they're gay amongst their friends, they let their friend,

41
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:19.100
but they don't want to tell anybody. So for them it's.

42
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.700
<v 1>Like a lot of conservatives, right? Gay.</v>

43
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.370
<v 0>Gay is the only thing that you can hide.</v>

44
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.330
Right? Like if, if you are black, it's obvious. Yeah.

45
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.210
If you're white, it's obvious if you're gay. No one knows. Yeah. No one knows.

46
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.450
Yeah. So you could hear people say gay jokes and say mean things and,

47
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.330
and you could just swallow it and like, you know,

48
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.680
and you could feel terrible and you could hear pastors talk about how you're

49
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:49.400
going to hell if you're gay and you're like. And they are gay. Yeah.

50
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:54.040
And they can't come out. So for them, the idea of gay pride makes sense.

51
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.920
It's a celebration. It's an affirmation that it's okay to be who you are. Yeah.

52
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.480
That's that makes sense. Straight pride is preposterous.

53
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.600
&lt;laugh&gt; it's so ridiculous, man. Every, most people are straight.

54
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.000
What are you doing? Yeah.

55
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.600
You you're taking time outta your busy day and you're gonna March.

56
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.000
You gotta fly. What what's if the gay pride thing is a rainbow,

57
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.800
what do, uh, what does straight people get? I dunno.

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.670
<v 1>What's the, it's kind of greedy. They took the whole rainbow though. They did.</v>

59
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:20.910
They.

60
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.270
<v 0>Stole it from the Lecan it's greedy. What is the, uh,</v>

61
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.670
let's stop and think about that. Like what is the straight pride flag?

62
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.390
What color would it be?

63
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.830
<v 1>Um, maybe all black or all white. I don't know. Uh, or black and white.</v>

64
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.703
I don't know.

65
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.390
<v 0>What is it? Black and white. White. Is it black and white for real?</v>

66
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:42.380
There's a flag. There is. I said. I meant to say flag. &lt;laugh&gt; sorry. Canceled.

67
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.740
&lt;laugh&gt; uh, really? There's a, I mean Googled it.

68
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.540
There's pictures of it says it's from box. Please put up the stray. Oh, there.

69
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.740
<v 1>We go. Yeah. Black and Christ. Oh, it's exactly what I thought it would be.</v>

70
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.100
I was gonna say it'll have the mail in females. You.

71
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.650
<v 0>Nailed it. Look at that. That's incredible a meme, but I don't know, bro.</v>

72
00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:03.170
We need to get that. Yeah. We need to hang one of those in the studio.

73
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.190
Straight pride flag. Holy. Holy.

74
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.030
There's a straight pride flag.

75
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.950
<v 1>It's flags for everything though. Aren't they?</v>

76
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.310
<v 0>God. That's hilarious though. Meanwhile, the gay one,</v>

77
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.870
they have a way better flag. &lt;laugh&gt; make America straight again. Oh my God.

78
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.740
Oh my God. It's straight dude. That's why there's so many of us. You idiot.

79
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.860
&lt;laugh&gt; America is mostly straight. That's why there's 320 million people.

80
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.940
Oh God.

81
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.780
<v 1>Yeah man. Look, people, people can do what they want, man. I.</v>

82
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.140
<v 0>The fact that I was joking thinking there's a straight pride flag and the fact</v>

83
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:44.650
that you, you nailed it perfectly. Oh, that's probably black and white.

84
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.250
That's another one. Red and pink and blue. The outta here with that one. Nah.

85
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:50.330
Is that another one? Yeah. Oh,

86
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:54.370
so there's does division amongst the straight pride folks that can't decide.

87
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:58.490
What's what, it's great to be straight. Look at this. Oh, what do you get?

88
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.400
What do you get? People that no one wants a. Look at him.

89
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.920
Look at him that guy's got an American flag bandana. You ain't Hulk Hogan.

90
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.840
You take that thing off right now. &lt;laugh&gt; better bandana around his head stop.

91
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.520
Oh, well what do we dozo? Oh, keep.

92
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.840
<v 1>Doing, keep doing what we're doing, man.</v>

93
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.640
I think discussion to answer your question.

94
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.760
I think discussion is what is needed to keep the,

95
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.390
keep the lid on the lid on the pot. I think,

96
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.270
I think that's why it's, you know,

97
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:30.070
when we're talking about like de platforming and all that kind of stuff,

98
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.310
all that stuff plays into the polarization. As far as I'm concerned. I agree.

99
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.990
Um, you know, it drives people underground.

100
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:36.950
It pushes people to radical fringes and whatnot.

101
00:05:36.951 --> 00:05:40.390
What you want is just keep the communication channels open. I mean,

102
00:05:40.391 --> 00:05:43.580
you've only got three ways of dealing with any conflict. You can talk,

103
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.860
you can segregate or you can fight. Yeah.

104
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.260
It doesn't matter if you're talking individually or countries that those are the

105
00:05:51.261 --> 00:05:52.094
only three options.

106
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.700
So as soon as discussion breaks down or people don't want to talk or people

107
00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:58.840
think, oh, I can't talk to that person. Cuz they,

108
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.640
they voted Trump or they voted leave or they voted, uh,

109
00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:04.640
liberal or they voted Democrat or whatever. Yeah.

110
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.800
As soon as that breaks down and I mean, it's crazy.

111
00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:12.560
You're seeing all these stories about couples breaking up or families where

112
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.080
the parents won't talk to the kids anymore or vice versa or mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;

113
00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:18.230
people are kind of, you know,

114
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.950
exiling and denouncing their own friends and family over politics.

115
00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:26.270
And when I see stuff like that, I'm like, that is sad. Yeah. That's very,

116
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:29.670
very sad. I mean, if you, you can have a disagreement, you can say, okay,

117
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.390
I believe in this, I think this I'm gonna vote that way you vote that way. Cool.

118
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.470
But you can still be friends. You can still be brothers.

119
00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:37.700
You can still be cool like that stuff. I mean,

120
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.540
if stuff is functioning correctly,

121
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.660
politics shouldn't play such a huge role in your life.

122
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.900
It should be a very much a background thing. You know what I mean?

123
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.580
It's just there. Um, I.

124
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.380
<v 0>Mean it's also one of the main characteristics in cults yeah.</v>

125
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.060
Is to separate you from anybody that disagrees it is. It really is. I mean,

126
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:59.050
that's one of the things that they do in, they separate you from your family.

127
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.130
It's one of the first things.

128
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.490
<v 1>They do it is. And that's how people end up in echo chambers. People are like,</v>

129
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.490
oh how did we not see Trump coming? It's like,

130
00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:08.850
you didn't see Trump coming cuz you don't talk to half the population. Right.

131
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.370
<v 0>And if you live in these high population areas where everyone has the same sort</v>

132
00:07:12.371 --> 00:07:15.690
of ideology or shares that ideology, it becomes a real problem.

133
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:17.250
New York and LA in.

134
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.160
<v 1>Particular, it's weird. I mean it happens the two things, it,</v>

135
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.200
I guess it happens with most are politics and, and religion, right?

136
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.880
So if you live in a place where everybody is religious and everybody is of the

137
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:29.714
same faith,

138
00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:34.840
then it's easy to sort of assume and behave in a way that everybody

139
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:39.710
else in the world or outside thinks and believes the exact

140
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:43.950
same things. Everybody, you know, does, mm. The same thing can happen.

141
00:07:43.951 --> 00:07:45.670
Politically. If someone lives in a, you know,

142
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.390
a super liberal area or a super conservative area, you can just think, okay,

143
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:51.790
well everyone, everyone I know thinks this. Yeah.

144
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:55.390
So that's what everybody thinks. Yeah. And a lot of people, I mean,

145
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.950
I'm a musician, you're a comedian. We,

146
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.700
we both go own respective countries to, to different places.

147
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.900
And you talk to different people. You have this podcast,

148
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.980
you've had all kinds of people of different persuasions on here,

149
00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.220
religious non-religious, you know,

150
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:10.060
political all across the spectrum and whatever.

151
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.420
So I'd imagine that you can understand and empathize

152
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.140
with all of the positions. You've got your own views, but it can be like, okay,

153
00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:20.810
I get what I get at where that person is coming from.

154
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.530
Or I get how that person believes that. Or I, or I get that.

155
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:27.490
And just that level of empathy is really what is needed.

156
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:28.850
I think it's really just about empathy.

157
00:08:28.851 --> 00:08:30.770
It's about being able to understand that most people,

158
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.570
most people want the world to be a better place.

159
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.370
There aren't that many people who wake up every day think it are.

160
00:08:35.371 --> 00:08:37.970
I wanna make the world worse. I wanna make my life worse.

161
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.640
I wanna make my families. Most people wanna make stuff better.

162
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:45.080
People have different ideas on what will make things better.

163
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.520
But I think as long as people sort of extend that charity to other people,

164
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.480
and don't try to consider things in the worst possible way.

165
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.040
If somebody says something, whether online or offline,

166
00:08:57.041 --> 00:09:01.600
don't try to interpret it in the worst possible way that you could or read some

167
00:09:01.601 --> 00:09:03.280
kind of malice to it. That's not there.

168
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.360
Just understand that coming from a good place, you may disagree.

169
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.640
And then you can have that discussion.

170
00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.840
And even if people don't change their minds,

171
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.640
you at least understand other people better.
