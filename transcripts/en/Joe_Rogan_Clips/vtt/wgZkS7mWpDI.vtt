WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
<v 0>Going on. Oh, I know what I really wanted to ask you about,</v>

2
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:04.920
cause we've been discussing this and I don't really understand it. Um,

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.800
it was about Wawe that, uh,

4
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.320
Chinese company electronics company, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

5
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:15.080
they make these kick phones and the state department has said,

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.800
please do not buy them.

7
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.150
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. Along with ZTE another corporation. Yeah. Um,</v>

8
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.470
I, if you start from the premise that the China is the number one perpetrator

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.110
of economic espionage and theftf of intellectual property, uh,

10
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:35.990
and also by the way, the number one perpetrator out there of cyber shenanigans,

11
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.270
you know, activity in cyber space because they it's.

12
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.510
<v 0>So bad with theft, theft of intellectual property.</v>

13
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.380
They have have fake apple stores over in China with all fake

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.900
apple stuff. Yes. Fake apple laptops, fake apple phones,

15
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.860
everything fake, the labels look identical.

16
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.540
None of it is actually apple products. Right.

17
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.100
<v 1>And it all works frankly, as well. Does it? Yeah. I mean, it's all good stuff.</v>

18
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.890
Um, you know, I, uh, I would say, um, it, yeah, it's astounding.

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.170
And so the, the reason why they're,

20
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:11.050
they're raising the alarm with Huawei and, and, uh,

21
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.970
ZTE is because of the voracious appetite of,

22
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.930
uh, the Chinese government and, um,

23
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.880
their commercial sector for information &lt;affirmative&gt;. And, um,

24
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.280
it's a little bit like, you know,

25
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:31.160
shutting the door after the horse is headed down the hill because we're late

26
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.360
to the game they've been doing this for years and years and years they've been

27
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.640
oddly enough, you know,

28
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:39.280
a lot of our military gear have parts in it manufactured in China. Right.

29
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.240
And so, you know, if, if we,

30
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:46.310
we should have been raising the concern about this and talking with China and

31
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:50.310
trying to come to terms with this issue years ago. I mean, we're, we're,

32
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:54.310
we're trying to have that conversation with them now. And up on Capitol hill,

33
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.890
you know, the,

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.270
the Congress is trying to enact legislation kind of like the sequaua thing,

35
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.910
they're doing it in the clumsy fashion, but the overriding principle,

36
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.980
correct in that China made some decisions years ago,

37
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.620
that they were going to become a major power in the world, um,

38
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.900
in a certain timeframe. And to do that, by definition,

39
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.900
you gotta compress your research and development time, right?

40
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.860
And there's one way to do that. And essentially, and that's to steal,

41
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.890
inform to acquire information if I wanna be diplomatic about it. And, um,

42
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.810
that's what they've done.

43
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.770
Japan came outta world war II and their idea was we're gonna become a major

44
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:33.730
power through manufacturing. And so they did,

45
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:37.690
they built up their manufacturing base and created this, uh, this, this amazing,

46
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.090
uh, result. China decided we're gonna skip the R and D for the most part. Um,

47
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.800
and all of that tales, the cost and time involved. And they've,

48
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.880
they're very adept at it. They,

49
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.160
they throw an enormous amount of resource out there into hoovering up

50
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:56.240
everything, not just from us, but from everybody. And using that, uh,

51
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.560
to advance their goals.

52
00:02:57.561 --> 00:03:02.000
They have no firewall between their Intel service and the PLA military

53
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:06.560
intelligence and others and their commercial sector. So, you know,

54
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.120
not only are they there to protect national security, they're there to promote,

55
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.440
uh, the commercial, uh, side of, of China. Um, and that's why it's so important.

56
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.040
And so that's why they're, they're talking about Huawei, uh,

57
00:03:18.041 --> 00:03:22.830
because of the potential for them to, uh, use their, uh, their reach,

58
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.790
uh, to further their desire for information, whatever it may be.

59
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:29.910
They'll Hoover it up and then decide whether it's useful or not,

60
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.670
but they have the resource to do that as opposed to, you know,

61
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:35.870
a smaller country that maybe doesn't have the resource and is much more targeted

62
00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:39.820
and focused on their Intel collection or their efforts to get other information.

63
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.140
So that's, that's sort of the, yeah, that was a wordy explanation.

64
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.780
<v 0>No, but it makes sense. And it's, uh, when I read it,</v>

65
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.660
I read a bunch of tech articles where people were questioning whether or not

66
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:56.020
it's even possible for Huawei to be using those phones, to spy on people.

67
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.130
But then there was some other articles where Huawei was being charged with, uh,

68
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:03.010
what was it again that they were using? They were,

69
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:07.450
they were selling illegal technology to Iran. There, there was something,

70
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:10.170
they were, they were breaking the sanctions. I think. Yeah, they were,

71
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.910
there were.

72
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.690
<v 1>No &lt;laugh&gt; no I'm saying, I saying shock. No, that couldn't happen.</v>

73
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.970
<v 0>Yeah, they were. But is what, so they were,</v>

74
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.000
they were selling things to Iran and this was a,

75
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.280
a big part of it that they were what the tech people were saying.

76
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.120
They were incredulous here. Huawe under mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is that you again?

77
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.760
You saw the. Jesus Christ.

78
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.680
<v 1>I've turned this thing off too. I don't understand why it keeps going.</v>

79
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.360
It's your watch. I got, you know what? I have a dope, I would,

80
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.510
I would put it on airplane mode, but I don't have a clue how, what I.

81
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.310
<v 2>Gotta swipe up from the bottom. I gotta swipe. Jamie.</v>

82
00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.630
<v 1>Can I gotta swipe up from the bottom? Okay. Everybody gets your phones.</v>

83
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.950
Watch is ring. Get your watch out. And now it, I feel like Dick Tracy.

84
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:53.350
<v 0>It really does feel like Dick Tracy, when we were kids,</v>

85
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.350
the idea of talking on your phone, be so ridiculous. Like what?

86
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.630
That's never gonna happen. You.

87
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:58.643
<v 1>You do that for me.</v>

88
00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.220
<v 2>Well, you, you gotta your password on I ah. Oh, Christ. You,</v>

89
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:05.580
when you take it off, the password comes on immediately. Oh really? As.

90
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.780
<v 1>Soon as you take it off. No, no, that's a dial tone. That's that's uh,</v>

91
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:09.260
that's keykeyboardkeyboard yeah. Yeah.

92
00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:13.940
I don't even know Lord right now people are thinking really that guy worked,

93
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.993
worked at the.

94
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.460
<v 0>Let's. Listen to him. It's perfect with your phone call. Hopefully they,</v>

95
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.461
I don't know that it's,

96
00:05:19.461 --> 00:05:23.970
it's hilarious because you are talking about technology and then this happens.

97
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.010
So we're talking about whether or not we should be worried about Huwe and you

98
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:28.610
can't even figure out how to use your watch. Yeah.

99
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.850
<v 1>Well, I'll tell you what that's, that's perfectly understandable.</v>

100
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.890
Anybody that knows me knows that that's the case, because I mean, and,

101
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:35.810
and back to be fair back in the old days, again,

102
00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:38.330
we had compassasses and maps and we just, you know, but, uh,

103
00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:42.560
even when we started developing new technology and care, quite frankly, um,

104
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.040
if you gotta go out and do anything,

105
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.240
the first thing you do is throw everything away. That's got a battery in it.

106
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:50.480
Right, right. Yeah. And so we weren't necessarily, you,

107
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.160
you dumb it down because you assume something's gonna go wrong.

108
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:57.960
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and usually it does. Um, and usually it's based on, on kit,

109
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.640
on gear. And so, yeah, I never really became very adept at it. We've got a,

110
00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:06.480
we've got a, um, I got I this three little boys, uh, yeah.

111
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:09.360
Scooterluuggo and Mugsie and, and, uh, I got.

112
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.200
<v 0>Them those hilarious names and they're, they're.</v>

113
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.240
<v 1>Hilarious. There's great kids, but we got a, we got a gaming system.</v>

114
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.150
I'm trying to remember what the hell, Xbox.

115
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.950
<v 0>Or PlayStation, uh.</v>

116
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.230
<v 1>Xbox it's at Xbox and, uh,</v>

117
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.310
cuz my youngest Mugsie he's uh he's he's always six.

118
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.830
And so he still says he he's thrilled to pronounce his words. Right. So it's X,

119
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.910
Xbox, and it's, it's very cute. I can't do it. It does.

120
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:34.030
It sounds stupid when I do it, when he does it' enormously cute.

121
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.060
So we got this thing and I'll sit there with him and try to play NBA twok or

122
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.700
something and it just doesn't work. It's not intuitive to me. Right.

123
00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.820
There's nothing that's intuitive about it. Kids know how.

124
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.740
<v 0>To fineangle and press the right button. They're.</v>

125
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.420
<v 1>They' scared of it or they're not, they, they just assume they're gonna get it.</v>

126
00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.660
You.

127
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.020
<v 0>Know, the, they can unlock hidden characters by moving the joyick a funny way.</v>

128
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.810
Yeah.

129
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.380
<v 1>Mugy talks to the LeBron, LeBron James directly.</v>

130
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.170
Apparently they communicate through Xbox now. Yeah, I know. Interesting. There.

131
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.650
<v 0>There you go. So the, the tech people that are, uh, skeptical,</v>

132
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.450
what they're saying is that if Huawei really did have something in their phone

133
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.170
that allowed them to spy on people, you'd be able to find it.

134
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.770
And the tech guys would find it. Do you buy that?

135
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.680
<v 1>Um, here, uh, here's what I would say about that is that,</v>

136
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.000
um, I'm sure. Yeah. There's obviously a lot of very smart tech guys and within,

137
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.760
uh, diligence for all your information and security needs,

138
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.680
we have some very smart tech people. Um,

139
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.280
but when you're talking about the Chinese state and the resources and

140
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:40.150
capabilities that that entails, uh, yes, if you're,

141
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:42.630
if you're saying that NSA could possibly detect this,

142
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:45.070
but if you're talking about just dispersing, you know,

143
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:47.110
kid out into the marketplace, uh,

144
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:50.270
and the way that that then gets spread and disseminated and inserted into

145
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.590
companies and, and, um, uh,

146
00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:56.070
then potentially allows points of access into these businesses. And again,

147
00:07:56.071 --> 00:07:56.740
it doesn't matter.

148
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.780
It's not like they just have to go after IBM or Raytheon or something they're

149
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:03.940
going after everything because it, it potentially is all of interest to them.

150
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.690
So their.

151
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.980
<v 0>Idea is to just steal as much technology and as much intellectual property as</v>

152
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:11.060
they can and recreate it over in China.

153
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.420
<v 1>That has been the, the plan. I don't wanna keep, you know, I don't wanna,</v>

154
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.313
you know.

155
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.900
<v 0>Uh, demonize an entire nation. Right, exactly. But.</v>

156
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.250
<v 1>They have proven themselves enormously adept at doing this. And, um,</v>

157
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.770
they've they, and not that others don't right. Russia does the same thing,

158
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.010
a variety of others, you know, even, you know, a lot of our allies,

159
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:32.290
everybody to the degree that they have the resources and the motivation and they

160
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.930
consider it an issue related national security, whatever it might be,

161
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:39.050
they're willing to do it, they're willing to try. Um, so it, it is, uh,

162
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.160
it is interesting, but yeah, the, the huay thing and the ZTE, again, I, I,

163
00:08:43.161 --> 00:08:46.000
I think the, the roll out of that con concern and the,

164
00:08:46.001 --> 00:08:49.520
the roll out of sort of trying to provide guidance has been a little clumsy. Mm.

165
00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.120
<v 0>So, so one,</v>

166
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.320
one thing that was speculation was that people didn't have to worry about the

167
00:08:56.321 --> 00:08:56.660
phones,

168
00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.000
but what essentially they're trying to do is cripple the company financially and

169
00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:03.080
not allow them to get a foothold in America,

170
00:09:03.081 --> 00:09:06.400
because they're the third largest cell phone manufacturer in the world.

171
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.080
Number one, apple, number two, Samsung they're number three, but in America,

172
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.240
no one knows who they are.

173
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.310
And so the idea is what they're trying to do is make sure that the Chinese

174
00:09:15.311 --> 00:09:17.950
government doesn't get a foothold in this company,

175
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.550
in this country where those companies, or, or wawei the company Wawe,

176
00:09:21.551 --> 00:09:25.350
mm-hmm becomes a, a, a popular brand for people to buy.

177
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.710
And that would allow them,

178
00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:29.270
even if they didn't have any spy device on this phone,

179
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:33.110
it would allow them to get other devices into people's homes that could

180
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:36.980
potentially spy on them. And then more and importantly, get into companies,

181
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:38.780
right. And spy on the companies.

182
00:09:38.781 --> 00:09:41.940
And this was one of the pieces of speculation that I read about was that they

183
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:46.220
had certain servers that were sending an exorbitant amount of information,

184
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.060
uh, out. And they, they were trying to figure out what was going on with them.

185
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:50.501
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

186
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:54.380
And that there was like an excessive amount of information that was data that

187
00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:57.570
was leaving the server verse versus coming in. And they're like,

188
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.170
this really seems like some up going on with this. Right.

189
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.210
<v 1>Right. I mean, hu Huwe, first of all,</v>

190
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.450
Huai is already present here in the country. Right.

191
00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:08.970
They manufacture a lot of things besides phones. And so they've already got a,

192
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.570
a pretty big footprint in this country and, and, and with our allies as well.

193
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.890
Um, so I mean,

194
00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:19.720
I think it's smart to consider the,

195
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:25.120
the nature of a particular regime or government, you know, when you're,

196
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.680
um, talking about the potential for their products to enter into,

197
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.480
um, the commercial sector where they may have access. Because if, you know,

198
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.390
if they've shown a pattern of activity for acquiring intellectual property,

199
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.470
which is again, a very delicate way to put it,

200
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.950
then I don't think it's a stretch to say we should be concerned by their

201
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:52.390
efforts to put, um, communications gear,

202
00:10:52.391 --> 00:10:56.550
even if it seems pedestrian at the outset, uh, into the marketplace.

203
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.980
So I, I, I'm not sure that I'm,

204
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.180
I'm buying the idea that it's some nefarious plan to shut out Huawei so that

205
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:07.700
they, they don't get a, a foothold in the phone business. Um, no,

206
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.220
and I say that because I've been, you know, 30 years I've been, you know,

207
00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:15.380
dealing with the Chinese, uh, in terms of their, uh,

208
00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:17.100
efforts to acquire information,

209
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:21.250
both in the government and commercial side of things. So, uh,

210
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.050
I come at it from a very cynical point of view, uh,

211
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.850
much like I do with the Iranian issue and,

212
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.330
and the likelihood that they have not been living up to, you know, their,

213
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:33.730
their part of the bargain. Um, and people will say, well, again,

214
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.850
I go back to the same thing. Well,

215
00:11:34.851 --> 00:11:37.290
but we've been inspecting and they've been complying with all of that. Well,

216
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.600
yeah. You know,

217
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.720
this limited amount of inspection that we have to their civilian sites,

218
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.600
and it's it, it's not a secret, you know,

219
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.760
at this point it shouldn't be a secret that again,

220
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:50.920
we have no access to their military facilities. So, um, I,

221
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.800
I tend to look at things in that view. And I, and I,

222
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.080
if I see a pattern of activity, uh, I'm,

223
00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.800
I'm very reluctant to think they're somehow going to stop that pattern of

224
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.160
activity for whatever reason. Right? So again, North Korea, same thing,

225
00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:05.920
the problem with all of this North Korea, Iran, Syria, chemical weapons,

226
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.640
the problem with all of that, I realize I'm kind of jumping around. I've just,

227
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.920
uh, uh, oawes over here,

228
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:15.270
but is the verification issue. It's always the,

229
00:12:15.271 --> 00:12:20.150
the weak link in any type of agreement related to containing a weapons program

230
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.310
is verification. And we know that we, you know,

231
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.790
it's something we should know anyway, we keep, we seem to keep forgetting it.

232
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.550
So unless we can lock that down with the north Koreans,

233
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.791
then, you know,

234
00:12:32.791 --> 00:12:35.580
aeighteen deal with them or a deal with the Iranians or a deal with the Syrians

235
00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:39.220
over their chemical weapons efforts. And it it's, it's, it's not worth anything.

236
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.820
So that's, that's where the focus has to be. And for whatever reason,

237
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.140
the previous administration was keen to get this deal done.

238
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.260
And they were willing to set aside this issue of all the military sites set

239
00:12:50.261 --> 00:12:52.820
aside the issue of ballistic missiles. And by the way,

240
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:57.850
the deal that president has just scuttled did nothing to,

241
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.890
uh, impact or affect or tamp down or moderate

242
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.450
their behavior.

243
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.130
They've got more influence in the middle east than they've had ever before.

244
00:13:07.131 --> 00:13:11.450
They're engaged in more, uh, activity related to, uh,

245
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.400
you know, uh, the country in the middle east against our interests, uh,

246
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.920
than they have been in, in, in decades. So that,

247
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.160
that all by itself should tell us, well, you know,

248
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.200
I'm not saying that they're using all the money. We gave them to, uh, support,

249
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.800
you know, uh, actions against our interest by hesboah or by, uh, uh,

250
00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:34.870
revolutionary guard or others, but they are. And though,

251
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:37.310
you know, I, I, again, I'm, I,

252
00:13:37.311 --> 00:13:38.990
I don't have a lot of angst over the idea that we,

253
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.070
we step away from the deal for a period of time.

254
00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:43.830
Maybe we can come up with something better. Um, and we should,

255
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:45.630
we should always keep demo, uh, diplomacy open,

256
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.310
always have a channel of communications. That's important. Keep doing that,

257
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.990
but be pragmatic and realistic about what you got right now. We don't,

258
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:56.140
we don't have that much and don't buy wallway at phones and don't, well,

259
00:13:56.141 --> 00:13:59.020
I would interesting enough, you know, that actually came out. No,

260
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:01.460
they make a great phone &lt;laugh&gt; uh, but that came up in that,

261
00:14:01.461 --> 00:14:05.020
in the CIA confirmationary. Oh, really? Yeah. They literally said, um,

262
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.540
I forget which center it was asked Gina Hasell about Huawei and ZTE

263
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.500
and, um, I dunno where they were going with it,

264
00:14:13.501 --> 00:14:15.500
but then it devolved into just trying to get us all,

265
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.570
all those Senate confirmation questions do it just comes, you know,

266
00:14:18.571 --> 00:14:21.130
the senators saying, well, I just want a yes or, and no answer, you know, like,

267
00:14:21.131 --> 00:14:23.250
like, wait a minute. Why, why don't you want some detail?

268
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.010
But so they would say yes or no. Would you buy Huwe? And Chah Hassman was like,

269
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.610
well, no, I wouldn't buy a Huwe fault. Okay. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. I'm,

270
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:31.850
that's your answer. So,

271
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.930
but I'm sure it left a lot of people wondering and scratching their heads and

272
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:36.520
go, what are they talking about? Chinese phones for.
