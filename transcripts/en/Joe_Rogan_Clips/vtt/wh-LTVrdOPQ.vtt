00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.450
<v 2>What made you decide to write about comfort? Isn't comfort. A good thing.</v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:09.330
My goal, what is going on? Well, you have a problem with comfort.

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.180
The comfort crisis. Is it really.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.050
<v 0>Crisis? I argue that it is a crisis. One. I don't have a problem with comfort.</v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.130
Uh, I do have a problem with always being comfortable,

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.520
always leaning into comfort, which is what we're doing now. All right.

8
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.160
So if you think of the average person's daily life,

9
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.640
they wake up in the soft bed, temperature controlled home.

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.510
They shuffle over to the microwave microwave, a breakfast burrito, right.

11
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:36.450
That came in from who knows where and is made with who knows what?

12
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.710
Then it's like, I go to work. I drive to work. I sit behind the screen all day.

13
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.680
I don't have to move at all or put any effort into this day.

14
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:46.170
And then it's back to bed in front of the TV.

15
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
And you just rinse and repeat that at no point in daily life,

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.050
I would argue, are people really challenged or really uncomfortable anymore?

17
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.310
Like we were in our past.

18
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.120
<v 1>Some people, of course, some people David Goggins is still alive.</v>

19
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.490
<v 0>Yes. David Goggins is starting right now.</v>

20
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.580
And so he's like the type of person you see what happens when you start to push

21
00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.190
against that. Right. When you kind of have this moment where you go,

22
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.660
maybe I'm a little too comfortable and you start to sort of investigate, okay,

23
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.780
what is it with discomfort? How can I get into some discomfort?

24
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.370
And what can that do for me? And then at the extreme end of that is, is Goggins.

25
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.683
Yeah.

26
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.700
<v 1>Well, uh, it's for folks that just like say,</v>

27
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:30.270
if you work in an office and this is how you make a living and you have to do

28
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.090
that commute and there's no other options and this is what you do,

29
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.400
like for them to hear this, they're like, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So what, what,

30
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.293
what now?

31
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.860
<v 0>Well, I mean, the answer is not to totally overhaul your lifestyle, right?</v>

32
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:45.630
I mean, we have amazing lives right now.

33
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.380
The fact that we don't have to go out and hunt for food or put physical effort

34
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:53.580
into every day is great. But at the same time, I think,

35
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.130
and I argue in the book, the comfort crisis that we need,

36
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.120
these moments that push back at us and we need to sort of investigate these

37
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.070
discomforts that we used to face in our evolutionary past. So for example,

38
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.110
to that's the percent of people who take the stairs when there's the choice of

39
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.590
2% people who take the stairs, when there's the choice of an escalator,

40
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.660
70% of people,

41
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.470
more than 70% now are overweight or obese 20,

42
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:22.500
only 20% of hunger, uh, sorry,

43
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.220
only 20% of eating is actually driven by physiological hunger.

44
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.780
80% of it is just not on board. Uh, it's noon,

45
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.720
I guess I'll eat or I'm stressed out. Right?

46
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.210
We exercise more.

47
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.740
We exercise 14 times less than our ancestors nowadays.

48
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.290
<v 1>So ancestors just, just by virtue of trying to survive, you mean?</v>

49
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.250
Yeah, exactly. So they didn't exercise, right? Like our hunter gatherer,

50
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.570
they never did chin up to.

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.980
<v 0>Exactly. That was life to them.</v>

52
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.540
We're trying to get by and we spend 95% of our time indoors as well.

53
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.360
And we know that there's benefits to getting out and moving more.

54
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.310
We know there's benefits to being outside.

55
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.750
We also know that there's benefits to truly being challenged in life. It's like,

56
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.710
like I said before,

57
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:13.690
you can basically never be challenged as you go through life in a real

58
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:18.430
sort of fundamental way. And you'll probably have a decent life, but you know,

59
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.070
if you think about potential and human potential,

60
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:25.540
let's say that human potential is this big circle around us right

61
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.710
now, most of us live in this sort of dinner plate sized place.

62
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:32.950
We never go out and explore the edges of our potential by trying to get

63
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:36.370
uncomfortable and doing things that are maybe a little outside of our comfort

64
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:36.581
zone.

65
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:41.230
We can just kind of exist in this sort of soft space that we've created for

66
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.980
ourselves right now. And of course there are people who get out and, you know,

67
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:49.360
into that, those edges, like, like the Goggins of the world,

68
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.520
like the campaigns of the world. Uh,

69
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.900
but I think most people don't really go out and see what they're

70
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.913
capable of.

71
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.300
<v 1>No, I don't think anybody's going to push back against this book. Yeah,</v>

72
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.880
no I don't. Which brings,

73
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.490
it creates kind of a dilemma for you.

74
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.760
Is there comfort and just writing about discomfort, right.

75
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.700
Is there a debate here because I don't think there is. I mean,

76
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.610
I think what you're saying is like irrefutable, I don't,

77
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:17.530
I don't think anybody can say, well,

78
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:20.740
there's nothing wrong with being sedentary and having your body turn into jello.

79
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.340
Well, there's nothing wrong with living a boring life with no stress at all.

80
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:27.250
And, and while stress, but mental stress, no,

81
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:31.840
no actual physical adversity to overcome, which stresses out the body,

82
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.060
but actually relaxes the mind, which is,

83
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.300
which is w that's that's what people are missing, right? That's

84
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.940
when you actually physically exert yourself, it actually calms the mind.

85
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.400
And I think there's probably direct correlation,

86
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.810
although I haven't done any studies,

87
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.650
I would imagine there's a direct correlation between physical inactivity and

88
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.640
mental depression. I would,

89
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.810
I would have to imagine that there's at least some crossover there. Yeah.

90
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.310
<v 0>There absolutely is. Uh, I think that exercise, the studies show that grow the,</v>

91
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.570
it grows the hippocampus,

92
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.660
which is an area that tends to be shrunken and people who have depression.

93
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.670
So this is why the APA now advocates that a psychiatrist recommend

94
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.710
exercise to a lot of their patients.
