00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 1>Experience. To meet where the funniest thing is,</v>

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:09.780
how much we lie to ourselves. That's where it gets amazing. It's like,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.580
you know, you were talking about,

5
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.960
and I've done the exact same thing with screen time when you're presented that

6
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:17.580
humiliating number of hours.

7
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.580
And you've been telling friends you're busy and you're looking at that,

8
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.150
just thinking like, dude, I've been like, you know, looking at,

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.780
but then before you do that, you're like, but it's my job. You know,

10
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.390
I've got to kind of be online. It's like, no,

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.090
you're addicted to technology.

12
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:37.680
And because you can't stand the fact that you don't have the discipline to stop

13
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.514
using it,

14
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.930
you would rather make up a story involving some absolutely

15
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:47.910
verifiable so that you don't have to deal with the fact that you aren't in

16
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:49.590
full control of yourself in this.

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.920
<v 0>A non rewarding addiction, which is really strange. It's like,</v>

18
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:56.850
when you looking at stories on like the apple news feed or something that you're

19
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.280
scrolling, looking for something that's going to captivate you, what is, oh,

20
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.590
the apple having problems with keyboards. He started reading this and it's like,

21
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.030
oh, you can Walway can.

22
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:09.330
So laptops knew I was getting more like how much of that am I?

23
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.540
Like you were saying earlier, how much of that is junk thoughts? Yeah.

24
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.580
He's a junk thoughts. Like junk food, junk.

25
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.410
<v 1>Food. You're just consuming, consuming. And I don't think it's useless.</v>

26
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:22.080
I think it serves a purpose. Like if, I mean,

27
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:25.680
in the sense of maybe not a purpose in the way you're going to be as a human,

28
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.810
but a purpose in the sense of like,

29
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.060
if you apply a little bit of like mindfulness,

30
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.700
when you're using your phone, how do I feel right now?

31
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.440
You know what I'm talking about? Like, how do I feel?

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.690
You realize you feel a specific way. It's a kind of like numbness.

33
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.070
There's a quality of like a kind of like sedated numbness to the

34
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.700
hypnotic state you've been lulled into by the algorithms.

35
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.370
And there's some pleasant kind of like,

36
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.620
I guess you could compare it to some like low level euphoric painkiller,

37
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.940
but not very euphoric, mostly just a mild numbness.

38
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.620
That is pretty good at turning off anxiety in the, this.

39
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.350
Or you could at least displace your own personal anxiety.

40
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:14.880
Like if I'm scanning through my phone and I find the inevitable, bad news,

41
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.650
whatever form it's in,

42
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.660
I could pretend that my anxiety is related to that news.

43
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.531
You know?

44
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:26.550
And then that's when you get people who are very anxious and they I've seen it,

45
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.413
I mean,

46
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.430
who has a famous person tweeted I'm here in this beautiful place

47
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.930
and I can't enjoy it because of our president. You know what I mean? It's like,

48
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.280
whoa, I don't,

49
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:43.050
I'm not sure that's the real reason why you

50
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.670
can enjoy that place.

51
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.530
I think it might be actually that you haven't dealt with the fact that you're a

52
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.400
vet. You're freaking the out. Right? That to me is like this,

53
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.570
the purpose of a phone.

54
00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:58.560
It's very good at tricking yourself into thinking that the reason you feel like

55
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.640
is because of something happening in.

56
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.480
<v 0>The world. It's a bandwidth eater too. And here's what the problem with that is.</v>

57
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.470
Sometimes you have these legitimate thoughts and when you have these legitimate

58
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:09.304
thoughts, meaning like,

59
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.950
meaning like something you're working on something you you're like,

60
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.160
whether it's a, an idea you're trying to do on stage or something else,

61
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.900
or another project that you're doing, these things, they require your bandwidth,

62
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.960
right? And when you're always looking at your phone,

63
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.530
it chips away percentages of your bandwidth 10 here,

64
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:32.980
5 27 there. And you don't think about it because no,

65
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.620
I'm still concentrating on the project. I'm still on the project, the project,

66
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:36.520
the project, the project,

67
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.380
but really no really you're in two rivers at the same time,

68
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.450
you're in this wacky river of nonsense and wondering who got this and how much

69
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:49.660
they're getting in this divorce and who died in the Dominican Republic?

70
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.290
Oh my God, another person, another tourist. Oh my God. Yeah. You know,

71
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.460
and you're just you,

72
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.120
if you want to look at all the bad stuff that happens amongst

73
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:03.100
7 billion people, you have to think of all the interactions that humans have.

74
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.380
All the literally billions of interactions every day,

75
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.280
people constantly, and occasionally one goes Western.

76
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.270
One goes sideways, and that's the one you see on YouTube, Jesus Christ.

77
00:04:16.271 --> 00:04:17.104
This world's going to.

78
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.680
And then you watch another one and you watch another one and you watch

79
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.280
infectious diseases and snake bites.

80
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.070
And what happens when you get neck and neck,

81
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:31.750
Cropsey when your flesh starts falling off flesh-eating bacteria say how they

82
00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:34.810
get that snorkeling. And then the next thing you know, you're,

83
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.000
just numb,

84
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.170
numb to your real life because you're taking in data from.

85
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.760
<v 1>Everywhere. Yeah. That's it. man. And it's like, eh,</v>

86
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.570
then that gets inside of you. And now you're just a turbulent.

87
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.530
You have a turbulent self that is digested a version of the world.

88
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.410
That's only half true. And so because of that,

89
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.600
you're going to be half a person because you're not looking into

90
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:06.190
like your own, whatever the you are, you know, what are you,

91
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.390
what are you.

92
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.120
<v 0>Like that? How much do you even think about what are you.</v>

93
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.700
<v 1>Yeah. How much time have you spent to me?</v>

94
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:17.580
It's like the craziest that like you're you're

95
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.630
we were talking about the sex drive,

96
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.160
being this insane compulsory engine inside

97
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.900
every sentience being the way that I know of course there's exceptions.

98
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.580
But like, this is if you're writing a computer code, right,

99
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.300
this would be a line of code. Right? It keeps you going, keeps you going,

100
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:41.650
keeps you going. So to me, something that's astounding.

101
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:47.080
Lee weird is why the can people not sit still and be

102
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:50.800
quiet for periods? Exceeding 10 minutes,

103
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.140
20 minutes, 30 minutes,

104
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.310
literally the least metabolically outside of sleeping.

105
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.293
Right? You're you're,

106
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.060
you're not really exerting energy when you're sitting still and being quiet.

107
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.710
You're uh, not really doing much. And yet if you ask,

108
00:06:06.711 --> 00:06:10.220
I get asked a person, if they wanted to go for a walk, that was sure,

109
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:11.390
I'll go for a walk. But if you're like,

110
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:15.980
do you want to sit with me for like 10 minutes quietly? It's weird. I get it.

111
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.190
I I'm like, no, I don't want to. I'm not into that. No, I don't want to do that.

112
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.530
What the is that to me?

113
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.740
That if not that I believe in simulation theory,

114
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:27.830
but if I wanted to prove it or like play around with it,

115
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.130
the idea that we're like non-player characters and some super event simulator,

116
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.440
one of the ways I would experiment would be like, oh, sit still.

117
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.550
Why the? Can't you sit still? Why is it that suddenly your mind goes insane?

118
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:44.120
Why is it suddenly that you got to get out? Why do you feel bored or crazy?

119
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:47.510
Or like overheated or anxious or nervous?

120
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.430
<v 0>The productive Duncan. Yeah. That's why, that's why everybody wants stimulants.</v>

121
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.690
Yeah. Yeah. That wouldn't be more productive. Yeah. You want to contribute more?

122
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.410
Yeah.

123
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.640
<v 1>People, I mean, I think it's, that's what someone might say as an explanation,</v>

124
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.190
but I think the real reason is like,

125
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.650
people are carrying a disordered universe inside of them.

126
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.310
And when they sit down and there's nothing to look at,

127
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:14.870
except what's around them,

128
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.240
they're forced to deal with the fact that actually a lot of the disturbance in

129
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:23.300
their life is more related to an interior,

130
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.940
like maelstrom of thoughts and an explored

131
00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:33.890
feelings. And then this is just basically shaping their entire existence.

132
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.900
They're like in every single moment,

133
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.850
recreating a universe of disorder and then getting really upset because if you

134
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:44.720
see disorder in the world and it keeps reappearing, like your friend, he's like,

135
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.650
why do I get taken in by these people all the time? It's like, whoa,

136
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.570
you can take it in by these people all the time.

137
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.520
Because inside of you is a behavior pattern that is replicating this,

138
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:57.013
uh, phenomenon.

139
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.700
And you're pretending that it's not in you to the point where it's a mystery.

140
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.480
It's like, why did you know when I drive somewhere? I'm not like,

141
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:09.590
why did my car drive me here? You know, unless I'm like high out of my mind,

142
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:14.210
it shouldn't be driving Uber, man.

143
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.990
You know what I mean?

144
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.880
<v 0>But pull over and find a Starbucks, a.</v>

145
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.870
<v 1>Person will legitimately be like, I don't know. I did that.</v>

146
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.390
And it's like, well, what is.

147
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.340
<v 0>What are you? Are you something different? If you have sugar in your gut?</v>

148
00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.660
Yeah.

149
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:34.370
Are you when your candida level hits a certain

150
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:38.120
number? Yeah. And it starts telling you, you need sugar. Dunkin.

151
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.320
How about a nice cold Coca-Cola Duncan? Yeah. Dunkin. Just crack open one.

152
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.810
Coke. It's not going to hurt you to have one Coke.

153
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.700
<v 1>You're right. I need a cake to go along.</v>

154
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.130
<v 0>With it. Water. Who wants to go and buy water? When.</v>

155
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.860
<v 1>The Coke nasty waters, flavorless air thing.</v>

156
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:56.063
Flavorless.

157
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.590
<v 0>Here with my water. No, I want.</v>

158
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.570
<v 1>The sewage brown sugar death poured into</v>

159
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:04.890
my guts.

160
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.570
<v 0>Nice IPA. Yeah. It's bitter yellow liquid.</v>

161
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.010
It tastes like wheat. Yeah.

162
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.510
<v 1>Yeah. I having an addictive personality, man.</v>

163
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.020
I like it because it's like, it's fun to play around with it.

164
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.140
Meaning that when I am reaching for the thing,

165
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.160
whatever it may be that I know I shouldn't be doing as in the sense of fun.

166
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:26.611
Well,

167
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:31.530
I like watching the rationalization that my mind starts spitting out for it.

168
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.790
You know? Like, oh, I'm doing this because it's like, you know, I'm relaxing.

169
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.240
You know, it's a celebratory moment. I feel a little bummed out.

170
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.190
And you look at like the instant way.

171
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:45.990
Your mind tries to come up with a story to write off the fact that you are

172
00:09:45.991 --> 00:09:49.800
riding around in a vehicle that you can't control.

173
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:54.450
And that is not a very appealing way to be.

174
00:09:54.451 --> 00:09:58.080
No one wants to hear the pilot say guys,

175
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.540
taking my hands off the wheel.

176
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.390
Once you see what happens for the next 10 minutes up here.

177
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.910
And yet their whole lives are like that.

178
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:07.860
They've just taken their hands off the wheel.

179
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.260
But then they're trying to make sense of it. You know?

180
00:10:10.261 --> 00:10:13.950
Like how many times do you mean an alcoholic who has an accepted yet?

181
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:17.730
They're an alcoholic. And they're like telling you all these reasons for,

182
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.320
you'd see my childhood, man. You just got to understand my childhood or,

183
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.390
you know, it helps my writing.

184
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.710
I sit and I'm a better writer when I'm drunk or on and on and on and on.

185
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.610
And it's like, no, the reality is you're hooked. You're addicted.

186
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.810
You can't stop your hand from bringing something into your mouth.

187
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:41.040
And you can't deal with that because who wants to deal with that, man,

188
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.210
I want to be in control. So I'll make up a story. I'll make up.
