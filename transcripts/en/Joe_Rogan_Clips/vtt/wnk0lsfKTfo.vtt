00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.070
how much longer do you think you're going to compete?

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.380
<v 1>I have no idea, man. How old are you now? I'll be 40 this year. Oh. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.030
That's the magic number, you know, the, since the day I started, you know,

5
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:16.460
I didn't start till I was 23. Yeah. And.

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.120
<v 0>So let's tell your story because it's, it's an, it's a fascinating story.</v>

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.070
Cause I love a guy whose life is up and then he figures something

8
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.250
out and then becomes a role model. And in a lot of ways,

9
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.380
that's what you've done. Yeah.

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.420
<v 1>It's a long story. And I am,</v>

11
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.440
I'm actually in the process of writing my Albert autobiography right now, um,

12
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.280
which I've been working on pretty consistently for the last five years.

13
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.680
Something that, you know,

14
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.450
I really was doing it for myself in a lot of ways to

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.200
have an understanding of the things that I've been through and the things that

16
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:55.640
I've learned and processed and acquired over these years, which is,

17
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.060
you know, in a lot of ways it's been extremely rewarding doing all of this,

18
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.030
but it's also been very difficult,

19
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:05.810
very painful and emotional going back through all of these

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.150
things that happened to me in my childhood and my upbringing and things that,

21
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.410
um, even to this day,

22
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:17.240
I'm still trying to process and understand a

23
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:19.160
lot of and um.

24
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.210
<v 0>Where were we going with this? The story? Well,</v>

25
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.540
your story of not starting till you're 23 and before that,

26
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.340
too much partying.

27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.290
<v 1>Yeah. So summarize a lot of this. You know, I was,</v>

28
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.290
I grew up in a lot of different places, moved around a lot, you know,

29
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:42.170
my parents split up very early. Um,

30
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.210
me and my mother and three brothers, four brothers, sisters, um,

31
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.830
you know, we basically lived in somebody's basement for in the beginning

32
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.840
and uh, we're living on welfare and bouncing around from place to place.

33
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:01.490
And so much of that shut me down emotionally. And,

34
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:04.400
and you know, when I was kid from what I'm told, I mean, I've,

35
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.660
I've really not much recollection of my childhood because I blocked so much of

36
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.201
this out.

37
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:13.280
And that's why it's been really difficult for me to write this book because I

38
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:14.870
don't really have many memories.

39
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:19.580
I have almost no memories of that time in my life where I felt like a

40
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:23.960
child that carefreeness of childhood and, and I've had to, you know,

41
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:28.550
talk to siblings and friends from back then and look through photo albums and

42
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.160
slowly things start coming together. And you know, that,

43
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:34.670
that's why a lot of this has been really therapeutic, but, um,

44
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.770
I was a fighting, I've always loved boxing and was very intrigued by it.

45
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:44.630
And martial arts, you know, Bruce Lee was always a hero of mine and, uh,

46
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.730
but I hated violence coming up. I hated it, but I was intrigued by it.

47
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:51.460
So a really good friend of mine, uh,

48
00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:53.150
we lived in Colorado for about a year or two.

49
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:57.740
He would get into fights on a weekly basis in school and I was

50
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.840
fascinated by it and I'm like, wow, that like, you're so brave and so strong.

51
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.280
And I felt like such like a week I was very allowed,

52
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:10.950
like weakness to, to, to, um, overtake me throughout the,

53
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.940
the events of my life. And I was very shy. I didn't talk, um, you know,

54
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:18.010
it was, I was always athletic and that kind of thing, but,

55
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.500
but as far as confrontation in that, I'd like,

56
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.830
it just shut me down and I didn't like it, it upset me a lot, you know,

57
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:28.210
when people would be angry with me. And, um, so I had this,

58
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.620
this strange dynamic where I was drawn to fighting and I was drawn to violence

59
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:37.510
in one way, but if I also hated it a lot and was scared by it. Um,

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.760
but, but over the years, you know, I thought about, I was like, oh,

61
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.210
maybe I'll try boxing one day and that'd be really cool. You know,

62
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.190
it was fascinated watching two people in the ring and then all

63
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.490
these people are watching and they're there with each other regardless of their

64
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.420
skill level. And then, you know, just thinking about what,

65
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.580
what it must be like in there to do that, you know? And, um, it fascinated me,

66
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.830
but, but again, like I said, I, I love martial arts,

67
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:04.270
so I wanted to be able to kick people.

68
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.880
I want to be able to elbow people and need people.

69
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:11.290
And I never saw any fighting that was like that, you know,

70
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.700
as I was coming up, I mean,

71
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:17.320
you'd see TaeKwonDo and karate and a lot of points sparring and that kind of

72
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:20.830
thing and forms. And, you know, even that I thought was I was fascinated,

73
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:24.820
but I wanted to fight like boxers did. And, um,

74
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.620
I just never really saw anything like that in one day. Uh,

75
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.760
94. Um, this is why when we moved to Vegas,

76
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.130
I was watching ESPN at like two in the morning.

77
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.270
And they used to have Thai fights on once in a while. And this fight came on,

78
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.420
I got this next fight is a Muay Thai fight between so-and-so.

79
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.430
And when that started, I was immediately hooked. It,

80
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.200
hit something in me that just like lit me on fire. I was like,

81
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.520
this is everything that I've been looking for. This is something so different.

82
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:02.380
And it just spoke to my soul. Um, and it fascinated me. And I was like,

83
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:04.480
if I am ever going to do this, that's going to be it.

84
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:09.400
It's going to be more Thai, but you know, for various reasons, um,

85
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.170
it scared me one, I didn't know how I'd be able to afford it.

86
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.230
Um, I didn't know if my parents would even let me and, you know,

87
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.680
coming up the way I did, I was partying and drinking all the time. Um,

88
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.740
even at that, I mean, I started drinking when I was like 12 years old. Holy.

89
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.140
Yeah. And by that time I'm, I was probably 18.

90
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:30.600
I was 15 physically dependent alcoholic.

91
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.250
I had to drink every day in order to keep my nerves from shaking. My mind,

92
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.570
my hands would, would, would, would tremor, how much were you drinking a lot?

93
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.010
A lot. Every day I would drink every day, all day. Um,

94
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.640
throughout the day, a little bit at night, I would just be pounding forties,

95
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.620
constantly, you know? And that's all, that's all that I did. I, uh,

96
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.120
that's all me and my friends did was we would just drink we'd drink every day.

97
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.080
And, uh, it was hard. How did you wean yourself off that?

98
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.830
Starting weight ties? What, what, um, what did it, I, um, as I said,

99
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.150
I, uh, I learned about it in 94 over the years, every once in a while,

100
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.390
I'd see a fight and I'd be like, oh, oh, I want to do this so bad.

101
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:18.980
And in 98 I actually started calling around gyms in

102
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:21.680
Vegas. I was like, oh man, I'm going to find a place to do this.

103
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.800
And for me it was one of those things where if I'm going to do it,

104
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.800
I want to do it right. And I want to do it to fight.

105
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.790
And if I'm going to do it to fight, what is the fastest way to get there?

106
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:36.350
And I was like, I need to take one-on-one lessons. I need to, um,

107
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.430
I wanted to learn from a tie, you know, and that was not to say, you know,

108
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.950
like Americans or anybody else can, can't teach it. But I was like,

109
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:45.140
if you're going to learn it, you might as well learn it from the source.

110
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:49.010
And the only place in Vegas that taught Moira. I,

111
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:51.380
one of the only places that even taught them, we tie in the indefinitely,

112
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:56.330
only place that had tie instructors was master Tati gym. And I called the gym.

113
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.840
Um, you know, went down and talked to, uh, one of the instructors.

114
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:03.590
And when he let me know how expensive it was going to be, I was like,

115
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.670
there's just no way. There's no way to be able to do this. And for me,

116
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:10.550
I also knew that if I am going to go after this,

117
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.850
I'm going to need to stop drinking, stop partying,

118
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.960
completely alter my entire existence.

119
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:23.060
I'm probably going to lose all my friends. Um, everyone's going to laugh at me.

120
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.270
I didn't even know how serious I took myself. You know, I was like,

121
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.340
I laugh at me when I say this, you know,

122
00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:31.880
like it's and if you knew me back then you'd probably laugh too. Like, well,

123
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.751
what do you mean?

124
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:36.560
You're going to fight you stupid as a stupidest thing I could ever think of.

125
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.510
And, um, one of my best friends, Mo he, um,

126
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.000
for whatever reason,

127
00:07:44.001 --> 00:07:47.660
this one night we were up on the roof drinking and smoking weed.

128
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:49.100
And he,

129
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.420
we got to talking just about life and he was actually born with a heart defect.

130
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.880
I can't remember the exact name of the disease that he had,

131
00:07:55.881 --> 00:07:57.020
but he was in and out of hospitals,

132
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.590
his whole life he's eventually gonna need to get a heart transplant. And, uh,

133
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.440
I said, what do you want to do with your life? You know,

134
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.240
I looked at him like he was asking me what, uh,

135
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:07.850
what I want to do when I got to the moon. I'm like, what do you mean what oh.

136
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.870
And do with my life. And he was like, I was like, well,

137
00:08:11.871 --> 00:08:16.070
I always wanted to fight and expecting him to laugh at me about this.

138
00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:19.370
He was like, well, why don't you, like, why don't you do it? You know,

139
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:22.820
I told him, well, well, I feel old already. I was 18 at the time,

140
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.280
I've already felt ancient then, you know,

141
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:29.180
and I've told them all my reasons and all my fears and doubts and all these

142
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:32.540
things. He's like, you know what, man? He's like, if anybody can do it, you can,

143
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.280
he's not going to think you should. And that really, that always stuck with me.

144
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.000
I was like, um, maybe I can. And in that moment, you know,

145
00:08:41.001 --> 00:08:43.340
I felt very motivated and wanted to do it,

146
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:47.450
but by continuing to drink and all these other things, I just put it,

147
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.490
suppressed it into the back of my mind. And then about a year later, um,

148
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.950
he was in the hospital and, um, he needed to get a heart transplant.

149
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.320
And they basically, he was basically at that point, it was like,

150
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.880
you're going to be here until you get one or you're going to die. And, you know,

151
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.650
I don't think any of us realized how serious it was or maybe we just didn't

152
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:11.010
want to. He ended up passing away, um,

153
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.690
while he was waiting for the transplant.

154
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:17.620
And that just obviously devastated me to

155
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.140
no end.

156
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:23.880
And through that night through my drunken

157
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:27.360
coping, I was like, I'm going to do this. I'm going to go after this dream.

158
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:30.240
You know, my friend, he didn't even get a chance to fail at a dream.

159
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:34.530
And I'm too scared to even try for no reason,

160
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.700
just out of fear that literally my only reason not to do this other than,

161
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.060
you know, financial and all those other surface things,

162
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:45.390
but it really just boiled down to fear. And I was like,

163
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:48.570
you know what I'm going to do. I'm going to go after this for him. You know,

164
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:49.950
he didn't get a chance to live. I'm going to,

165
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:53.610
I'm going to live for the both of us. But, you know, unfortunately his,

166
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.020
his death sent me even harder down that downward spiral of alcohol and

167
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.670
depression. And three years later, I,

168
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.650
um, I just had a realization one day. I was like, if he was still alive,

169
00:10:07.651 --> 00:10:10.500
he'd beat the out of me for wasting my life.

170
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.370
I've been wasting my life for 21 years because I'm

171
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.020
afraid, you know, I'm afraid and I'm, I'm, I'm too afraid to fail.

172
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.930
I'm too afraid of all these stupid reasons that,

173
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:26.820
that all of us give ourselves in order to make ourselves feel better about

174
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:29.760
not going after things. But really they're just that,

175
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:31.110
they're just that they're just excuses.

176
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.970
They're just things that make you feel better. And they're. They're all.

177
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.910
Almost every excuse we have is total.

178
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.840
Cause there's people with those excuses and with all those reasons and more,

179
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.910
and they're able, then they do it. Like, what is your excuse? And it just,

180
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.950
it just smacked me in the face one day. And I, I,

181
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.680
I was at that point when I could not ignore it any longer,

182
00:10:52.681 --> 00:10:56.760
and this was going into, um, 2003.

183
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.010
So I was like made it my new year's resolution to do this. And, um,

184
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.000
you know, one night I was sitting down with my father and we'd have these,

185
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.720
he'd get into these long talks with me. He was just, I was always very quiet.

186
00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:12.540
And he like took me off to the side and his way to kind of

187
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.290
talk to me and get to know me better. And he was like,

188
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.060
so why don't you tell me something? You've never told anybody, you know,

189
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:24.150
I'm like, what do you mean? Like what, what can I, like,

190
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:27.300
I killed somebody when I was little. And I'm like, like racking my brain,

191
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:30.270
what I could possibly tell them. And, uh, you know, that,

192
00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:33.000
that kept replaying in my mind that you want to fight. You wanna fight,

193
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:37.150
you want to fight. And, um, very like quietly, it's like, oh,

194
00:11:37.151 --> 00:11:40.170
I want a fight one day. And he's like, what? He's like, I want to fight.

195
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.300
And he's like, what do you mean you wanna fight? And, you know,

196
00:11:42.301 --> 00:11:45.600
I told him and he's like, well, why don't you? And I told him all these reasons,

197
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.720
he was like, well, I cannot help you with all of your fears and doubts in this,

198
00:11:48.721 --> 00:11:51.030
but look, I'll make a deal with you.

199
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.570
If you quit drinking and dedicate yourself to this,

200
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.420
I'll take care of, um, every,

201
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.890
all the financial things in order to let you do this. And I was like, he said,

202
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:06.120
we got a deal. I was like, all right. Yeah. And he's like, it was points.

203
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.720
I was drinking a 40 at the time. He was like,

204
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:10.600
what about that drink in your hand? And I was like, well,

205
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:13.390
I was going to start tomorrow. So I don't want to, you know,

206
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:17.800
maybe I can finish those, but, you know, I, I understood even at that age,

207
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.580
like you can't put things off like that, cause like you gotta to do,

208
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.950
if you're serious about it, you're going to do it now.

209
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.580
So I dumped out the rest of the 40 and the sink he had in there.

210
00:12:27.581 --> 00:12:32.110
And two days later I got into the gym. And was it hard.

211
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.290
<v 0>To wean yourself off the alcohol though, if you were physically dependent on it?</v>

212
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:35.740
It.

213
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.390
<v 1>Was, it was both extremely difficult yet.</v>

214
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.950
I was so focused on this goal that

215
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.750
none of those

216
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.440
I had to overcome so much, not just the physical dependency on alcohol, but,

217
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:56.590
but my lifestyle changed so many things,

218
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.140
but I'd been putting this off for so long that I

219
00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:05.380
knew there was, there was no time for me to, to waste. You know,

220
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:10.120
I was so focused on this, that like once I made that switch in my mind,

221
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.900
like I'm going to go after this and there's nothing that's going to stop me.

222
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:18.850
And I've wasted so many years already that everything I'm

223
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:21.340
doing is, is going to be playing catch up. You know,

224
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.090
there's no way for me to get to like, I'd look at, you know,

225
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.170
like Sanchez and guys like that and be like, I'm never going to get there.

226
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:31.960
So everything that I do has to be

227
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.270
two, get me closer to this goal. And I can allow, you know,

228
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.860
my physical dependency or my doubts or any of these things

229
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.570
slow me down because everything I'm doing, I have to play catch up, you know?

230
00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:51.090
And, um, having that,

231
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.340
that focus allowed me to overcome all

232
00:13:56.341 --> 00:14:00.900
of those, those physical and emotional and mental challenges.

233
00:14:00.901 --> 00:14:04.290
And of course, that's not to say it was easy. It was extremely difficult.

234
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.640
It was extremely difficult, but it was, you got two choices,

235
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.260
you know, you can,

236
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.580
you can allow these things to slow you down and hinder you and weaken you.

237
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.190
Or you can say I'm going to go forward anyway.

238
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.970
It doesn't matter how afraid I am. It doesn't matter how hurt I am.

239
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.270
Doesn't matter how tired I am. This is what I want.

240
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.390
And I'm going to put everything that I have into this.

241
00:14:27.391 --> 00:14:32.040
So that way when I'm done, when my own, my life is over,

242
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:33.510
when I can't do this anymore,

243
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.460
or I can look back and have no regrets that I didn't allow these things to slow

244
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:38.911
me down.

245
00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:43.860
I didn't allow the excuses that we all have hinder me

246
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:45.870
and keep me from doing this. You know,

247
00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:50.730
because one day we're gonna wake up and realize we could have gone after these

248
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:54.530
things. And we didn't because of X, Y, and Z,

249
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.330
but really those things aren't aren't anything, you know.

250
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:04.150
<v 0>Do you stop and think about those moments when you first started</v>

251
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.250
this? Cause that's a profound life shift to go from being a guy who was kind of

252
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.810
aimless and partying a lot.

253
00:15:10.811 --> 00:15:14.770
But knowing that you should do something with your life to finally doing

254
00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:18.430
something, like, what was it like when you finally started to training?

255
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.700
What did it feel like when you actually,

256
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.360
because you hadn't had you done anything athletic before that?

257
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.030
<v 1>You know, I was, I was always athletic my whole life.</v>

258
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.450
I was always really good at sports. I hated,

259
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:34.240
I hated the team aspect of things though.

260
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:38.890
I despised being on a team of any kind. I love playing sports for the,

261
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.970
for the love of it, you know, but anytime I was on like a team,

262
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.390
I just hated it. I despised it. And you know, by the time I was like,

263
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.531
I think 12,

264
00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:52.360
I completely turned my back on anything team related because I felt to

265
00:15:52.361 --> 00:15:52.661
me,

266
00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:57.490
it felt like it just ruined all the beautiful things about the physicality

267
00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.810
of, of athletics. You know, it put this, this, this,

268
00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:06.280
it, it hindered me in a lot of ways, you know,

269
00:16:06.281 --> 00:16:09.910
and having to rely on other people, you know, it was always a big thing,

270
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:10.511
you know, it's like,

271
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:13.960
it doesn't matter how hard I work because this person might not have worked at

272
00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:17.680
all. And you know, that's why I was so drawn to fighting because it's it's,

273
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.370
even though you do have a team, of course it really is. Everything is on you,

274
00:16:21.371 --> 00:16:24.550
the good and the bad. There's nothing you can point,

275
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:28.810
you can point to all these other things, but it's really just you. Um,

276
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:30.791
so yeah, I,

277
00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:35.200
I think back and I look back to that time and what was the first day look

278
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.520
it was, do you remember? Yeah, yeah, I do. It was, um,

279
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.520
so I started out just doing private lessons.

280
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:47.860
I didn't even start doing classes until maybe six months to a year.

281
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.180
So I was, I was doing private lessons on a daily basis. My trainer,

282
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:55.930
a master Chan, who was one of, uh, toddies, original instructors.

283
00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.450
He had me in the gym at like 6:00 AM. It was men. So this is January in Vegas,

284
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.230
which is brutally cold, which, you know, a lot,

285
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.380
not a lot of people realize and their gym had no heat.

286
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.420
All the windows were like broken, so there's no insulation or anything. And,

287
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.860
um, I don't know. I was, I was just, I was, I was so excited, you know,

288
00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:20.740
so nervous and you know, obviously I want to do,

289
00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:23.920
do really well and perform and everything was just,

290
00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:28.630
everything was so new that I didn't really, I didn't really have a lot. Um,

291
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.930
I couldn't even really process it. So there wasn't a lot of, um,

292
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.140
I wasn't really a lot of thought that was going into it. I was just,

293
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.160
I was just excited.

294
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:41.020
I was just constantly excited and motivated and wanted to,

295
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.840
my whole goal was to fight. You know, I was like,

296
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.910
I want to fight even if it's only one time.

297
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.830
So everything I did was with that mentality, you know, I was like,

298
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.060
I want to get better. I want to get better.

299
00:17:51.061 --> 00:17:53.310
I want to do everything I can in every moment.

300
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:58.170
And I put every ounce of myself into every second of the day was

301
00:17:58.171 --> 00:18:02.720
geared towards this. You know, it was singularly focused on this goal. Can.

302
00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.050
<v 0>You remember the first day you remember the first day of foot work.</v>

303
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.520
<v 2>And yeah. Oh man. So.</v>

304
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.960
<v 1>The first day,</v>

305
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:14.480
the first day he has me up in the ring.

306
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.990
Oh, it must have been maybe the second or third day because, um,

307
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.561
there was another,

308
00:18:20.561 --> 00:18:23.480
there was other people there and that maybe they were just hitting the bag and

309
00:18:23.481 --> 00:18:27.800
stuff. So there, there was a couple of the other pro fighters. There are other,

310
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.790
they were pro fighters. I was nobody. And I'm up in the ring.

311
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.640
And so this is day one. He's like shadowbox,

312
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.530
I'd never done anything fighting related. I'm like, what do you mean? Like,

313
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.320
I don't even know what that is. You know what I'm saying? Like,

314
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.680
what do you mean shadow box? So like, so much of my,

315
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:50.150
everything in my career has been like thrown into the deep end.

316
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:54.840
Can you swim kind of thing? And like this forced learning curve, you know,

317
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:59.210
I didn't get babies into anything, you know, it's like, all right, shadow box,

318
00:18:59.211 --> 00:19:03.800
go ahead. And everyone, all these fighters are like staring at me, watching me.

319
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:08.840
I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing, but whatever, you know, it was, it was,

320
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.030
it was, it was traumatic in a lot of ways,

321
00:19:11.031 --> 00:19:14.690
but having to confront that and face that particularly me,

322
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.070
because I'm naturally a very shy person,

323
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.870
a person that doesn't speak ever to anybody. I mean, even now, you know,

324
00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:28.100
I'm still very quiet, but if you knew me back then I was basically a mute,

325
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.030
you know, and I had no interaction with especially strangers and people,

326
00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:33.530
I didn't know. And even the ones that I do,

327
00:19:33.531 --> 00:19:37.670
I'd still barely even communicate with. So all of this was so foreign to me,

328
00:19:37.671 --> 00:19:42.590
this was like an alternate universe that I was in. And, uh, yeah,

329
00:19:42.591 --> 00:19:46.190
it was, it was, it was so scary, but it was like,

330
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.540
you don't have a choice, like get up there and do it, or get the outta here.

331
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:52.760
You know what I mean? So there wasn't,

332
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.210
there wasn't time for me to really think about it or,

333
00:19:57.211 --> 00:20:02.030
or like even be really nervous about it was like, do it shadowbox.

334
00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:05.500
Like, and, and, and this instructor, he barely spoke English.

335
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.570
It's not like I can like say, Hey, well, I, I don't really know what I'm doing.

336
00:20:08.571 --> 00:20:11.570
And maybe you can show me some things just like, go. I mean,

337
00:20:11.571 --> 00:20:14.630
that's very much a tie approach. It's like, just do it.

338
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.510
I'm not going to tell you how I'm not going to explain the steps,

339
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:22.370
just go kick the bag or hit it, just do it. And, um,

340
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.790
yeah, it was, uh, it was scary.

341
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.120
<v 0>But then once you got some momentum,</v>

342
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.380
once you had a couple of weeks under your belt and this started becoming a real

343
00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:37.280
normal part of your life, what was that feeling like when you realized like,

344
00:20:37.281 --> 00:20:40.850
Hey, I'm actually doing this. Like it's this is actually, yeah.

345
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:45.920
<v 1>Well, every day, every day I was taking significant jumps. I mean,</v>

346
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:49.690
as I said, I've always been a naturally athletic.

347
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:53.260
So I was picking this up like quick, really quick. I mean,

348
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:57.310
even within a few weeks, people thought I'd been doing it for years. Um,

349
00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.670
you know, in a lot of that, uh, you know, does come from my, uh, physicality,

350
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:04.540
but, but, um, my drive to do it and, and to, to,

351
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:09.910
to have my sights set so high, um, that, uh, you know,

352
00:21:09.911 --> 00:21:13.540
I was taking these quantum leaps every single day. Um,

353
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.150
so over, over the weeks and over the months, you know, it just,

354
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.140
it really felt like I was like, oh, I'm on, I'm on track. You know, I'm, I'm,

355
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.880
I'm on the path I should be on. I'm gonna, I'm going to be amazing at this.

356
00:21:27.881 --> 00:21:31.000
You know, there's, there's great. I'm natural at this. You know,

357
00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:33.790
I'm going to be a, I'll be a champion one day,

358
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:37.270
I'm going to just be crushing people. And, uh, you know, everything,

359
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.270
everything was pointing in that direction, you know, with my,

360
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.000
my development and, you know, started, uh,

361
00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.350
eventually going into the classes and sparring and all of those kinds of things.

362
00:21:47.351 --> 00:21:50.620
And, um, you know, it was always like, when do I get to fight?

363
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:53.380
When do I get to fight? When do I get to fight? And, uh,

364
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.190
I think it was nine months in, I finally got, uh,

365
00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:01.390
I got to fight and I was like, oh, this is it. This is, this is my moment.

366
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:03.130
You know, I'm going to go out there, you know, I'm gonna,

367
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.820
I'm gonna crush this dude. And then I'm going to be, uh, you know, on my way to,

368
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.480
to, to the big time, not that there even, you know,

369
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:13.120
back then that there's no big time. There was no, this wasn't,

370
00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.080
this was before YouTube. This was before anyone even knew,

371
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:19.390
what would we tie was, you know,

372
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:21.700
you had to tell everybody you did kickboxing basically,

373
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.380
which just crushed my soul every time, every time I say, well,

374
00:22:26.381 --> 00:22:28.510
it's like kickboxing. And, you know,

375
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.830
for movie Thai people to have to say that is it's

376
00:22:32.831 --> 00:22:36.130
devastating. It's like, uh, someone say, well, it's like karate,

377
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.120
you know what I mean? No disrespect to any of these other arts. But,

378
00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:43.630
but to say that it's that in order to help people, you, most of the time,

379
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:45.040
I would just say, yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:22:45.041 --> 00:22:49.600
It's like kickboxing instead of having to explain to them what it is. And, um,

381
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.290
yeah. So nine months in, I got the, uh,

382
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.530
there was going to be a fight in salt lake city, Utah, and a bunch of,

383
00:22:57.531 --> 00:23:00.070
of the other people at the gym were fighting as well.

384
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:04.480
And we were all going to go up there, um, and compete. Is this an amateur fight?

385
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.150
Yeah, yeah. Um,

386
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.970
no, yes. Head gear, but you know, the funny thing was we had head gear,

387
00:23:12.971 --> 00:23:14.470
but we didn't have shin guards.

388
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.190
We had eight ounce gloves and we hadn't used the head,

389
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:24.250
which was a trip. So, um, anyway, so, so I was like, oh yeah,

390
00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.810
great. We get the fight. And I was so excited and, um, my pops and, uh,

391
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.460
Gina and we, uh, we drove up there and, um,

392
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.860
you know, like I said, I really felt like I was on my way,

393
00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:38.440
but when we got there, um,

394
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.140
the guy that I was originally supposed to fight,

395
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.980
I don't remember if he backed out or it was just that he was closer in weight to

396
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.640
somebody else. Um, you know, and that was kind of the thing back then,

397
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:52.220
we would just show up at places and be like,

398
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.840
you gotta fight for me or don't you. And, um, they didn't. And, um,

399
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.380
I was like, oh my God, I was devastated. I was devastated. I'm like,

400
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:04.490
I did all this work. I was so ready and now I don't wanna have a fight. And,

401
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.420
you know, my turn is like, well, is there somebody else you can get? And so the,

402
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.070
the, the, the promoter, you know,

403
00:24:10.071 --> 00:24:14.600
he's calling around calling around and then he finally, he's like, um, well,

404
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.690
there's one guy that's going to take it, but he always,

405
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:22.400
you buy 20 pounds and he's had about 30 fights already. I was like,

406
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.840
let's do it. I don't give a, man. I was like, I didn't do all this for nothing.

407
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.570
You know what I'm saying? And you know, and again, that, like,

408
00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.180
that was just our mentality,

409
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.420
the way that we came up in the people that we came up under was you fight

410
00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.180
anytime, anywhere, anyone, any style, any weight, it doesn't matter. And, um,

411
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.380
so yeah, I didn't even,

412
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.890
I didn't even really think about it as far as like that goes, you know,

413
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.700
it was like, I get to fight. That's a awesome man. And, uh, I felt,

414
00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:54.100
I felt, I felt confident in a way, but it's also that, yeah,

415
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.700
I have no idea what you're really doing. Like, you can train your whole life,

416
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.200
but if you've never fought, you don't know anything, anything,

417
00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:04.540
you have no concept of what it's like to be in there.

418
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.610
You have the hardest sparring in the world with,

419
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.740
with complete stranger and it's night and day between a real fight and

420
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:16.210
sparring. And so it's like, yeah, you, you,

421
00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.600
you want to feel confident going in there, but you have no concept of,

422
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:24.370
of what it is. So it's really just fake. It's fake confidence. And, um,

423
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:31.180
I got crushed, man. So I got there and, uh, I, uh, you know,

424
00:25:31.181 --> 00:25:34.840
I have no concept of like pacing myself or anything. So I just like,

425
00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:39.760
I'm like sprinting at this guy. And in like 30 seconds I was done.

426
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.470
I couldn't breathe. I couldn't think I couldn't. I could barely even see,

427
00:25:44.471 --> 00:25:47.950
felt like, felt like I was underwater. Um, and it was,

428
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.980
it w it was the worst thing in the world because nothing,

429
00:25:50.981 --> 00:25:54.850
this guy was doing was hurting me. And every time he had hit me the whole cross,

430
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.560
ah, and all I wanted to do was just say, it's, it's nothing bothering me.

431
00:25:59.561 --> 00:26:01.750
This isn't hurting. Like I wanted to like, tell everybody,

432
00:26:01.751 --> 00:26:04.330
like this isn't hurting me. I can't breathe. Like,

433
00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.860
all I'm really trying to do is not pass out right now. And, and I, I mean,

434
00:26:08.861 --> 00:26:10.720
like physically, I couldn't do anything, but,

435
00:26:10.721 --> 00:26:14.110
but I was able to last for awhile,

436
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.770
do a couple of decent things in there. But by the third round,

437
00:26:17.771 --> 00:26:20.590
he was just battering me, knee me in the face. And, you know, he,

438
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.350
he just kept clenching me up and we just needed the out of me.

439
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:24.610
And there was nothing I could do.

440
00:26:24.611 --> 00:26:28.180
And they finally stopped it in the third round.

441
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.290
And then I was, I was devastated, man. I was devastated.

442
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:36.970
And I remember walking, like I was, I was walking back to the locker room.

443
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.810
Everyone in the crowd was like cheering for me. And like, oh, that was awesome,

444
00:26:40.811 --> 00:26:42.520
man. Like, like good job, good job. I'm like,

445
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.540
what is with these people like that? Wasn't good. That was so terrible.

446
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:49.830
That's terrible. And, um, I was like laying in the back of bleeding,

447
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:52.440
a little place in the, my opponent comes in and he's like, dude,

448
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:55.650
that was your first fight. I was like, yeah, man,

449
00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:59.070
I hate to see you in like a year or two he's like, that was, that was amazing.

450
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.320
And you know, that really, that really stuck with me. You know, that,

451
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.840
that one that he said that, and also just the,

452
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.320
the impact I saw that you could have on people that,

453
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.920
that it's not necessarily about whether you win or lose,

454
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.680
it's what you show in there. It's the heart that you show.

455
00:27:13.681 --> 00:27:18.600
It's the spirit that you show. And, um, you know,

456
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:22.980
I had like a day or two when I was like, maybe this just isn't for me. You know,

457
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:26.670
I thought, I thought that this, that I was going to be so good at this.

458
00:27:26.671 --> 00:27:29.340
I thought that it was just going to like skyrocket to the top.

459
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:33.000
And I got crushed, man. I didn't even make it out of the fight. And like,

460
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:34.410
maybe this isn't for me,

461
00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.820
but I was forced to face that day one, like,

462
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.890
do you want to do this regardless of how good you are, regardless of you win,

463
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.820
if you, if you can't win and maybe you can't be the best in the world,

464
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:51.780
do you still want to do this? Yeah, I do. I love this so much.

465
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.250
And me having to face that so early on was, was,

466
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.490
was extremely significant.

467
00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:03.270
I saw so many of the people I trained with would go on these undefeated streaks,

468
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:07.770
like 10, 15, 20 fights, but inevitably you will lose.

469
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.540
And if you haven't had to confront that early on, eventually you do.

470
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.180
Most of those people never fought again,

471
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.840
or just like crushed a mentally where they weren't able to overcome it.

472
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.770
But I had to deal with that the first day and overcome it and be like,

473
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:24.840
you know what? That doesn't matter. I'm gonna,

474
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.680
I'm going to bust my in gym and don't make sure that never happens again.

475
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.720
And I went on to win like 1920 fights in a row from there. And, you know,

476
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:35.040
that was really, um,

477
00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:40.860
a significant moment in my career where I had to confront

478
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:45.440
the, the reality of this. And you know, that so much of,

479
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:50.160
of fighting is, is, is, is a perfect metaphor for, for, for things in life.

480
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:51.840
Like if you really want something,

481
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:57.270
you can't always focus on what the results are or their

482
00:28:57.271 --> 00:28:59.640
immediate results like winning and losing.

483
00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:04.470
And all of these things are so much of that is just on the surface ego level

484
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.640
of things. And when you break it all down, like, what is your,

485
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.790
why are you doing this? I'm doing this because I love it.

486
00:29:11.791 --> 00:29:14.370
I'm doing this to improve myself.

487
00:29:14.371 --> 00:29:18.300
I'm doing this because it's what keeps me healthy. Um, mentally, physically,

488
00:29:18.301 --> 00:29:22.020
spiritually, and all of these things. And that's the most important thing.

489
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:25.650
And yes, it was an extreme motivator to be better. And, you know,

490
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:30.150
not to let that have happened to me again, but, um, you know, really,

491
00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:31.140
it really, uh,

492
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.280
made things clear to me early on.

493
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.320
Like what's important here.
