00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 2>Well, I think some guys can at certain stages, right?</v>

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:07.560
Like there's moments in fights,

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.730
where don't you feel like you're in a zone sometimes and it just everything's

5
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:12.330
flowing.

6
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.070
<v 1>Saturday night. Saturday night. Yeah. I felt good. All backstage. Cause um,</v>

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.480
leading up to the fight, everyone was at run restaurant rest.

8
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:23.640
So I was kind of waiting for some feeling to say, where's run Russ. Right.

9
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.020
But I felt great backstage and a preferred far in wood with no crowd.

10
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.450
Did you really, can you get, you get to the, to the apex and it's like,

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.180
you get there, you wrap your hand in, warm up, you fight.

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.590
He's not hanging around for five hours backstage and just, it's like a gym.

13
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:44.130
Right. You get there, you're warmed and just go compete. So I,

14
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.150
I preferred it for sure.

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
<v 0>I prefer it because of the there's no noise, no distractions, no nothing.</v>

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.400
<v 1>And he can hear your coaches clearly instructions clearly. And yeah, I I'm,</v>

17
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:58.500
I'm a very good listener to my coaches. So I want to say I prefer it,

18
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:00.690
but it was, I, it was good. I enjoyed it.

19
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.330
<v 0>I have been in a very interesting position over the last few years where you are</v>

20
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.220
one of the top UFC Welter welterweights but just

21
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.470
be big because of bad fortune.

22
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.740
Just things just haven't totally lined up correctly.

23
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.690
Fights are falling apart, injuries and sicknesses and a bunch of went down and

24
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.620
you're until Saturday night, you,

25
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.830
you had been kind of ignored by a lot of fans.

26
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.010
Like a lot of people don't understand what the level you're at.

27
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.980
They don't understand.

28
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.590
I think they saw it for the brief moment that you fought Saturday night,

29
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:40.320
but then unfortunately there's the injury, you know,

30
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.000
Bella has the accidental IPOs and it's another,

31
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.400
you know, another unfortunate situation.

32
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:51.420
But at least during that first round, the first round,

33
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.680
they got to see your skill level.

34
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.550
<v 1>And I'll just get warmed up. As I got over the last year and half,</v>

35
00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:01.260
I've learned so much that I wanted to show him to have that the incident happen

36
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.400
is one in a million, right. When you, when you prepare on the camp, be like,

37
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.220
I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. And then when that happened,

38
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:12.540
I was like, okay, take five minutes late, late, late, late,

39
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.790
play out a little bit. And then hopefully he can fight again.

40
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:17.220
But he just is always that bad day.

41
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.130
<v 0>Yeah. And there was, it was not quite, it wasn't a potent. I want to poke.</v>

42
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.540
It was like a knuckle.

43
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.110
<v 1>The picture is like, you'll, you'll kick it. Right.</v>

44
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:32.430
So when you're kicking you don't hold you the old, your fist and kick like this.

45
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:32.611
Right.

46
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:37.500
You kind of use it to momentum to syncing your arm back and others doing it.

47
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.400
It kind of just like grazed. His eyes were not grazing, kind of went deep,

48
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.860
but it grazed his eyes a bit. And then what.

49
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.840
<v 0>Was it like the front knuckles?</v>

50
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.240
<v 1>He looked like it from the picture, the towel. I didn't feel it.</v>

51
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:49.770
I thought it was the, the,

52
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.760
the kid got him in his body and then he felt down and start, you know,

53
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.310
the one start grabbing his eyes. And I was like, oh, I got a God.

54
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.790
I call him in his eye. You know, I fought you just literally the kid,

55
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.470
I call him because I did this. And then.

56
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.800
<v 0>I think Dana put a photo on his Instagram. Jamie.</v>

57
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.180
<v 1>I think it wasn't knuckle. You weren't, you weren't into this for sure.</v>

58
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.080
<v 0>It's so unfortunate, man. But I mean, for you,</v>

59
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:19.000
what I was getting at was that it has to be so frustrating here you are another

60
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.340
ad blocker here, here you are.

61
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.970
You have this long layoff and fights keep getting canceled.

62
00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:28.150
And then you finally get a fight you're performing really well.

63
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.110
And then this happens is that.

64
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.260
<v 1>The bad luck, right? The last year, the last year or so, just one after another,</v>

65
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:38.050
after the Woodley fight, I'm going the fight Woodley in, um, in London,

66
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.740
in March. And, um, how'd that canceled the week before on the Sunday,

67
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:45.250
before the fight. And then from there just bad luck, bad luck,

68
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.540
bad luck trickling down. So.

69
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.690
<v 0>So yeah, it's like the bottom of your fingers.</v>

70
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.890
So it's not like it's straightforward. It's like, it's just getting in there.

71
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.180
<v 1>That's terrible. And it wasn't the eyeball, right?</v>

72
00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:02.930
It's like the under the eyelid. Yeah. You know,

73
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.760
cause so I felt a bit out, um,

74
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.470
Sunday in a casino in Vegas and his eyes was fine. Just the it's the lid.

75
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.660
Um, that was bruised, but book.

76
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.021
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:12.021 --> 00:04:16.160
He said the vision started returning the next day and now he said there's no

78
00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:20.300
permanent damage. So he's going to be okay. He had his lid stitched up. I wish.

79
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.253
<v 1>Him well. So.</v>

80
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.240
<v 0>Yeah, he's a great guy. And uh, uh, it was a great opponent for you too,</v>

81
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.600
because he's so relentless. He's, you know, he's constantly moving forward.

82
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:31.340
He's a tough guy, durable.

83
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.070
<v 1>Urban, and where to call them with a head kick in the first round.</v>

84
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:36.380
And I got a rush rush, my work a little bit.

85
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.630
I kind of went wild and started swinging smoking before him.

86
00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:42.350
But I should have picked my shots a little bit bad, but he's tough.

87
00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:46.850
He's durable, but he doesn't beat me in a, in a given day. You know, I,

88
00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:51.470
I believe it will fight 10 times. I'll beat him 10 times and that's just,

89
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:56.030
it is, it was a late stepping for hams that fell out and

90
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.700
I think he should go back, work his way back up,

91
00:04:58.701 --> 00:05:00.560
and then hopefully we can meet somewhere down the line.

92
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:03.620
But for now I'm looking towards the tower shot. I'm looking towards, you know,

93
00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:04.454
world champion.

94
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.930
<v 0>You think that, uh,</v>

95
00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:10.250
the title shot is warranted just because your previous work and just because of

96
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:12.380
the great first round that you had. But I mean,

97
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:15.050
do you feel like there's any unfinished business because of the way that fight

98
00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:15.884
ended?

99
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.120
<v 1>Yeah. With Balaam, I don't believe so.</v>

100
00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:23.960
I think from the first round, I'm normally I'm a slow starter, right?

101
00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:28.490
So if that's my, if that's my first round, you're not making it to the,

102
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.190
to the fifth, you know? So, um,

103
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.900
I think everyone saw where the fight was going and it wouldn't have made it to

104
00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:37.610
petition to number five. So w.

105
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.640
<v 0>I understand your confidence. I really do.</v>

106
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.820
And this is not to demean that at all, but you gotta,

107
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.350
you gotta give the guy an opportunity, right? Like, you know what I'm saying?

108
00:05:48.351 --> 00:05:51.530
Like, if here's my point, if the fight went the first round,

109
00:05:51.531 --> 00:05:53.870
if the eye poke didn't happen and the referee just stopped the fighter,

110
00:05:53.871 --> 00:05:56.210
but they're like, what are you doing? Well, you know where this flight's going?

111
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.750
Well, you don't know fights going. Cause fights are crazy. Like weird happens.

112
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.160
People slip guy gets him in a choke, like weird stuff happens. You know,

113
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.070
people get injured, you know, someone throws a calf kick.

114
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.850
All of a sudden your leg goes numb. You get hit with a punch. Weird happens.

115
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.983
You fight.

116
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.660
<v 1>That's crazy. But, um, you know what I'm saying? No, I know.</v>

117
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.180
I know you're saying, but I would have hoped out. I wonder if I clearly, Joe,

118
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.180
normally I normally am. I'm a slow starter in the first drive. Right.

119
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.400
So I would have felt great Saturday night and even a month.

120
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.240
And I felt good, but I wasn't not beating me. I ain't nothing. Come on.

121
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.570
<v 0>Really appreciate your confidence.</v>

122
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:35.600
But as a fan of you and as a fan of [inaudible]

123
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.433
, I don't think it would be a bad thing to run back.

124
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.410
<v 1>Straight away. And I'm looking to it. That's my nine, nine fight right.</v>

125
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:47.060
In a row. Um, I wonder if I win streak fought, but, um,

126
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.920
I would've won the fight. That'd be nine fight. Um, without, without loss,

127
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.520
from getting beat by Lisbon five, six years ago.

128
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.420
So I'll feel I've done enough work now to prove that, uh,

129
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.700
I belong at least in normal contender fight or title fight, you know? So I can.

130
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:06.650
<v 0>Totally appreciate your position, but I can also.</v>

131
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.720
<v 1>Appreciate Veloce because I know where it's coming from.</v>

132
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.760
I would say if I was him, I'd probably do the same thing. Right.

133
00:07:10.761 --> 00:07:12.440
It's ranking number of about 15, 14.

134
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:15.680
And you had this big opportunities first main event, um,

135
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.340
number three guy in the world. So I know where he's approaching it from,

136
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.610
but I am looking, looking for my own career. Right.

137
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:25.010
I wanna look towards the tower shot. I understand. Hopefully.

138
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.450
<v 0>We'll get it. Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:30.800
You've had all these weird situations where things fell apart. It's uh,

140
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.970
it's very unfortunate enough. Did you feel like the Hamza fight was strange too?

141
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:38.720
Because like, here's this guy who was only had a few fights in the UFC,

142
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:39.830
he's got a lot of hype behind him.

143
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.130
Cause he's at like the mere shart fight was a great result. He looked fantastic.

144
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.660
But then all of a sudden he's fighting you.

145
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.240
<v 1>Like, it was weird. Right? Cause we boom,</v>

146
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.230
two weeks before that Dana white came out on the news and I had never been a

147
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.010
fight lay on or no one in top five. And then next week is like, yeah,

148
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.690
you want to fight him? I was like, you just said, oh,

149
00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:00.770
I'm too high ranked for him. But where do you think that came from?

150
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.640
I don't know if everyone was turning him down, you know? And um,

151
00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.800
no one ever turned me down as well. So this is okay. You want to fight him?

152
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.710
I was okay. Let what, what about Kobe is that COVID said no.

153
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:14.870
What about Mycetoma? They'll say no. What about wonder boy?

154
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.770
When the boy is injured, that's okay. He's got the most hype in a division. Now.

155
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.840
