1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Sweden is more capitalist than we are.</v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.830
<v 1>Yeah. You know, the rich pay lowered percentage of taxes in Sweden than we do,</v>

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.281
you know,

4
00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:13.550
they don't even have an inheritance tax and there's no estate taxes Sweden,

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.800
really? Zero. No. Yeah.

6
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.040
I would have never looked this sweet Sweden.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.030
Sweden became a very rich country because they were a capitalist country.

8
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.750
And once they became very rich, they experimented with socialism,

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.590
which was an unfortunate experiment because there's no reason to experiment with

10
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:33.320
socialism because every time it's tried, it's failed,

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.320
but they decided to try it. And of course it failed.

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.460
And so they had to start rolling it back once they saw all the damage that the

13
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.590
welfare state in Sweden was creating. So they started dialing it back and, and,

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.340
you know, they've gone a long way. They haven't eradicated it completely. Uh,

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.233
but you know,

16
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.700
and if you look at the tax proposals by Joe Biden, I mean,

17
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.650
we're going to go so far above Sweden, as far as the,

18
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:01.700
the confiscatory req levels of taxation. I mean,

19
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:06.170
look what Joe Biden is wants to do, uh, with the income tax,

20
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:07.850
the corporate tax and the personal tax,

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.950
he wants to raise the corporate tax from

22
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.360
21 to 28,

23
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.820
but then he wants to raise the dividend tax from 24 where it is now

24
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.200
to about 40 something. Ish. I forget the exact amount,

25
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.240
but corporations are taxed twice, right? Their tax when they earn the money.

26
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:33.440
And then when they distributed to the owners, so you have to add up both rates,

27
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.660
but then he also wants to apply social security taxes to those dividends,

28
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.220
not just the Medicare taxes.

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.540
So he basically wants to take the corporate and the effective corporate tax rate

30
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.160
up from about 40% where it is now to about 60%. That's where he wants it.

31
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.470
You know, which is, uh, you know, a huge increase.

32
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.620
There was 70 per I forget the word. It's a, it's a, it's a massive number.

33
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.670
And it really is fascism because the government ends up owning all these

34
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.050
businesses. Because if you,

35
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.520
if you take more than half of the income of a business, I mean,

36
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.710
you basically own that business. I mean, it's your business.

37
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:08.750
You're getting half the more than half the income.

38
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.410
So the government is really nationalizing. All these corporations.

39
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.350
That's a food taxation, but it's not the corporations.

40
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.060
It's the individual shareholder right there.

41
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:18.470
They're the ones that own the business.

42
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.620
<v 0>Very important way to look at it. The way you look at it,</v>

43
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:25.460
there were half of the income is going to someone else and

44
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.390
I wanted to stop you for a second, but I wanted to hear that rant.

45
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.620
There's a connection that people make from

46
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.960
it. They connect socialism to empathy, socialism, to kindness,

47
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.950
socialism,

48
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:44.810
to people that are less greedy socialism to people that are more

49
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:47.300
interested in, in a community. This is,

50
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.020
this is coming from a person like myself who has no economic, uh,

51
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.160
86% of what I know about the economic world is from you.

52
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.270
So I'm an idiot. All right. I listened to people who are experts,

53
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.580
but when I think of the idea of community and of helping people out,

54
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.960
I think of the idea like what's wrong with some socialist policies.

55
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.810
We have the fire department. That's a socialist policy.

56
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.260
Nobody wants a fire department to be only for people who have money.

57
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.600
We want the fire department to be for the community.

58
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.680
It doesn't matter if you have $0. If your house is on fire,

59
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.530
we're all going to pay for the fire department to come put it out.

60
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.100
We all have a vested interest in keeping your house from burning down and you

61
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:29.560
dying. And the whole community from burning, right?

62
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:30.750
We have these certain degrees, the.

63
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.300
<v 1>Big difference between this type of.</v>

64
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 0>Hold on a sec, you're right. You're a hundred percent, right?</v>

65
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.090
But it's the idea behind it that comes from idealistic people.

66
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.860
And I'm putting myself in this category.

67
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.340
I am often naive and idealistic,

68
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.060
but also ruthless in my assessment of human character.

69
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:55.110
It's a big contradiction because I think there's a lot of people that really

70
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:56.430
could do more than they're doing.

71
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:58.860
And they know they could and they want to make excuses.

72
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.070
And it's part of the reason why throughout history,

73
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.140
they've left people behind.

74
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.070
There's certain people that if you had a tribe and you had to make it over this

75
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:12.660
mountain and Bob is lazy and he's like, you got to carry me, bro. Mike, Bob,

76
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.320
we're both walking. C'mon man. Bob's not supposed to make it.

77
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.230
He's not supposed to make it. We want them to make it,

78
00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:22.260
but we don't want our kids to die. We don't want our mom to starve.

79
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.680
We got to keep going, Bob, you lazy. Come on, bro.

80
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.340
There's always been people like Bob. And it's part of the problem with Cheetos.

81
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.540
So I'm a contradiction, but hold on a second. I understand,

82
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:38.400
but I'm gonna give you, but I that's what attracts people to socialist ideas.

83
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.240
It's just that they're nice that they want it. Socialist.

84
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.290
<v 1>Socialist ideas are very appealing. I mean, I get that.</v>

85
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.920
And that's why they're very popular with young people who don't know any better.

86
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:51.690
They don't have enough life experience, but.

87
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.460
<v 0>This is understand shift.</v>

88
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.840
This is the bridge because a guy like you who really understands economics can

89
00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:02.070
talk to a guy like me and we can explain it to everybody because otherwise we

90
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:04.830
just have, and I'm definitely not arguing with you,

91
00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:09.180
but your argument versus people who disagree with you, argument, you have this,

92
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.760
but there's a, there's an opportunity to make this bridge.

93
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.320
And for us to understand.

94
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.270
<v 1>I'm hoping, I think I'm here at this and make that bridge. And I know produce,</v>

95
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.400
I want to help people evolve from being socialists to being capitalists

96
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.590
because capitalists aren't mean, yes.

97
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.760
They just understand the unintended consequences of these well-intentioned

98
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:32.820
programs when that the left is in favor of,

99
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.510
but they don't understand that they actually backfire and make all the problems

100
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.400
that they're trying to solve worse.

101
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.000
<v 0>It isn't the fire department. Isn't the part. When you.</v>

102
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.010
<v 1>Have a local fire department, right?</v>

103
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.000
That a fire department is there to put out any fire to any house, right?

104
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:51.780
So everybody in the community benefits from having a fire department,

105
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:55.110
it's not there just for one person. It's for everybody in the community.

106
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.530
We're talking about where the government takes money specifically from one

107
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:04.880
person and gives it to somebody else for their specific benefit,

108
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.160
because they think they need it for whatever problem,

109
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.010
whatever reason they need the money agree.

110
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.270
<v 0>Then this would be like Bob, wanting money from you are lazy. Frank Bob,</v>

111
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.193
we were talking about.

112
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.370
<v 1>I am all in favor of private charity.</v>

113
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:23.140
I'm all in favor of people voluntarily helping out their fellow man.

114
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.200
And Americans will do that. I mean, we didn't do that.

115
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:29.680
We did that a lot more in the past when the government didn't take so much of

116
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.890
our income and taxes, we had a lot more money. Like I mentioned,

117
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:33.760
Grover Cleveland.

118
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.390
When he said that quote about the government not supporting the people,

119
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.190
there was a bill to appropriate $10,000 for some

120
00:06:42.191 --> 00:06:46.840
farmers in Texas who had been hit by a drought and Grover Cleveland vetoed the

121
00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:48.310
bill because he said, look,

122
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:52.030
there's nothing in the constitution that allows the government to give money to

123
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:54.520
people just because they need it. I mean, this is not right.

124
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:58.270
We can't take money from the taxpayers and just give it to somebody because we

125
00:06:58.271 --> 00:07:01.810
feel they're in need. And so he vetoed that bill,

126
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.460
but after he vetoed it,

127
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.690
the farmers got more than 10 times that amount of money in private donations

128
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.740
from individual Americans who wanted to help out. That's good.

129
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.600
So you get your own money at a charitable giving. That is great.

130
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.860
That is noble. But when you steal money from somebody else and give that money,

131
00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:22.240
there's no nobility in that.

132
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.200
That's Def doesn't care what you do with the money after you seal it stealing.

133
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.070
I see.

134
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.660
<v 0>What you're saying. It's I like what you're saying.</v>

135
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.140
Is there an opportunity where these two things can merge where people can

136
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:33.070
realize like, Hey,

137
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.900
we need less taxes and more charitable donations and it's both

138
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.400
possible and you would probably save money and we could figure out a way to

139
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:45.850
distribute that money in an equitable way that you have control over.

140
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.500
So if there's certain charities that you can really feel strongly about the

141
00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:51.010
people who.

142
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.450
<v 1>Are likely the people who are likely to give the most to charity are wealthier</v>

143
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:58.000
people because they have more discretionary income.

144
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.860
And if you have a lot of wealthy people who are paying 40 50%

145
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.540
axes, and I was doing that,

146
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:09.010
I was paying about half of my money in taxes before I moved to Puerto Rico.

147
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.930
Right. I didn't have any special tax breaks.

148
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.510
I'd paid about almost half my money in taxes.

149
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.150
So because half the money went to the government,

150
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.710
I had a lot less money that I could be charitable with. Right? I mean, I had,

151
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:23.980
I had all the money I needed to take care of myself. Uh,

152
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.520
the money that was taken away from me by government was money that I would have

153
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:31.240
invested to help grow the economy, or maybe I could have used it, uh,

154
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.330
in direct charitable giving. And, and,

155
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:38.050
and the other benefit of when you allow more private sector,

156
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:38.884
charity,

157
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.720
private sector charities are much more efficient because they really care about

158
00:08:43.721 --> 00:08:47.140
the people they're trying to help governments. Don't give a you,

159
00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:48.640
when you have a government program,

160
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.930
that program exists to benefit the bureaucracy of the program.

161
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.970
So they squander the money. And the last thing they want to do is,

162
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.750
is end poverty, because then they, there's no longer a need for their program.

163
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.090
They want to perpetuate dependency. You know,

164
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.000
if you go back to the great society and the 1960s,

165
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.170
if you look at the declining poverty rates in the 1940s,

166
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:14.640
1950s, 1960, you know, leading up to the 1960s when we had the, you know,

167
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.840
all the civil rights and all those big war on poverty, we were beating poverty.

168
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:20.250
We were kicking poverty,

169
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.180
but poverty rates were really falling in this country until the government

170
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:27.930
declared war on poverty. And then poverty won. That is the problem.

171
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.290
The government created poverty. They didn't eliminate it. Well,

172
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.700
what should they have done differently?

173
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.650
They should have allowed free market capitalism to keep lifting people out of

174
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:38.431
poverty. Look,

175
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:42.780
the reason people are poor is because they're not earning enough money. Well,

176
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:45.840
how do people earn more money? They become more productive.

177
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.140
How do you get more productive? You acquire skills and you have capital. You,

178
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.051
you, you, your,

179
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:56.130
your employer provides you with capital that makes your labor more productive.

180
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.510
And because you're more productive,

181
00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.630
you can earn more money and that lifts you out of poverty.

182
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:04.560
So it's free market capitalism that lifts people out of poverty.

183
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.040
And so the smaller, the government is the more capitalism we have,

184
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.850
the more wealth we can create, the more employment opportunities we can create.

185
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:13.440
Government just gets in the way.

186
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.860
<v 0>We'll see for a second. So you,</v>

187
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.390
what you're saying is there's an opportunity to be compassionate without like

188
00:10:20.391 --> 00:10:24.440
the demand for you being compassionate by the federal government.

189
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.160
And if people have to spend less money on the government,

190
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.290
there's opportunities for them to donate more money to charities, and this,

191
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:34.640
this would be better.

192
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:39.110
This would be a better way of managing our money and our charity and

193
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.783
all these things.

194
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.910
<v 1>Yes, it's much more efficient,</v>

195
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.090
voluntary give you look when people give money voluntarily their own money.

196
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.330
They don't want it to be squandered. They don't want it to be wasted. I mean,

197
00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:51.710
whenever you give the charities,

198
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.170
you always look at the charity and you want to know, Hey,

199
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:56.060
if I give you a thousand dollars,

200
00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.620
how much of it is used in bureaucracy and how much goes to the recipients,

201
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:02.630
their books. And you can say, Hey,

202
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:04.790
we're going to take 10 cents to run the charity.

203
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.210
And actually 90 cents is going to go to the, to the people that we're trying.

204
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.580
<v 0>To help the government in some way around.</v>

205
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.110
<v 1>If they take in a dollar and only 10 cents actually goes to the people that need</v>

206
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:18.440
the money. The rest of it is, is absorbed in the bureaucracy.

207
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.250
There's no incentive to be efficient. Charities have to be efficient,

208
00:11:22.251 --> 00:11:23.570
or nobody will give them money.

209
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.560
Government has no incentive to be efficient because they take your money.

210
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.860
There's no voluntary interaction there. They take your money from you.

211
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.530
And so they can be as inefficient as possible,

212
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.190
but then the private charity wants to help people out.

213
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.020
So they no longer need the charity.

214
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.050
The government wants to keep people impoverished.

215
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.030
So they're in constant need of the charity,

216
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.680
because that way they can get their vote.

217
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.820
The government knows if they steal money from Peter and pay Paul that they'll

218
00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:52.550
always get Paul's vote. And that's what they're concerned about.

219
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.850
They want keep people in, trapped in poverty.

220
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.530
So that there'll be reliable votes.

221
00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.311
<v 0>Is that,</v>

222
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:00.360
is that what they want or do they just want to maintain this system that they

223
00:12:00.361 --> 00:12:01.320
have control over?

224
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.410
Because if they just released everything to the public sector,

225
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:09.720
like if they are the private sector, but they just need to be, but if they,

226
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:15.020
everything from policing to wa the water purification,

227
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.640
everything they do, if they just re went into,

228
00:12:17.641 --> 00:12:19.650
instead of the government handling everything,

229
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.950
they just allowed it to the private sector. What,

230
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:27.390
how would we manage whether or not they were doing the good of the people

231
00:12:27.391 --> 00:12:29.310
overall? That's what everybody's worried about.

232
00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:31.080
What everybody's worried about is big business.

233
00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:35.700
Assuming this monopolistic gigantic monolith that crushes

234
00:12:35.701 --> 00:12:39.180
everything before it and pollutes the rivers. That's what we're worried about.

235
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.530
So the idea of the government stepping in for businesses to keep business from

236
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:48.060
only growing and not growing with concern for the consequences of all the other

237
00:12:48.061 --> 00:12:51.450
people around it, that's where everybody gets real suspicious. Right?

238
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.570
<v 1>And, and, and, and they shouldn't be,</v>

239
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.800
and this is something that always kind of bothers me that, uh,

240
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.720
people just attribute sinister motives to private businessmen.

241
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.800
Yet they think politicians are angels and just there to do the Lord's work.

242
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.430
Right? I mean,

243
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.870
there's just as many greedy people who go into politics as who go into business.

244
00:13:12.871 --> 00:13:15.810
In fact, probably more, but there's a big difference. See,

245
00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:20.400
I have protection because if a greedy person goes into private business

246
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.650
is greed can only help me, right?

247
00:13:22.651 --> 00:13:27.480
Because the way a business grows and gets bigger is by selling

248
00:13:27.481 --> 00:13:32.100
more products and services. Well, why would I buy those products and services?

249
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.240
I have to like them.

250
00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:36.630
I have to think they're better than the products or services that some other

251
00:13:36.631 --> 00:13:37.980
businesses is offering me.

252
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:43.050
And I have to value those goods and services more than the money I'm voluntarily

253
00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:45.120
exchanging to get them right.

254
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.200
The beauty of the free market is that you have all these businesses who may be

255
00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:53.760
greedy, competing with one another to best satisfy my desires,

256
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.990
my needs to make me happy. And if they don't make me happy,

257
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.080
if they can't satisfy my disease, I don't buy their products.

258
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:07.140
They have to win me over. They have to woo me and seduce me to get my business.

259
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.010
So I don't have to be worried about a greedy businessman who wants to make

260
00:14:11.011 --> 00:14:14.070
money, because he could only make money by making my life better.

261
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.263
On the other hand,

262
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:18.300
you take a greedy person and you give them the power of government.

263
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.980
They can make my life miserable.

264
00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.590
They don't have to get me to voluntarily do anything.

265
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.640
They just take my money by brute force. And they just do to me,

266
00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:27.480
whatever they want.

267
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.040
So where you have to fear greed and power is when it's in government,

268
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.760
where it can actually harm you, not in the private sector to help you.

269
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.030
I know was going to say, well, what if there's a criminal?

270
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:42.270
What if somebody is stealing my money? Yes, they are violating the law.

271
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.480
And we need government to protect me from thieves,

272
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.920
but businessmen that are honestly convincing me without fraud or deception,

273
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.420
but are being honest. And I'm buying their product that, you know,

274
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.110
their greed doesn't help me. Right. It doesn't hurt me. It only helps me.
