00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You want your name to be called one time?</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.530
And that's what the announcement says. Referee in this fight is such and such.

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.940
You don't want any complaints other than that,

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.400
because we noticed a lifetime opportunity for the spiders.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.090
We don't want to do anything negatively to affect them. So, yeah.

6
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.990
<v 1>That's a good thing. Well,</v>

7
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:19.990
it's such a difficult job because in impulse you have an impulse, like you,

8
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:23.970
you don't know when to stop. Like, is it now? Is he okay?

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
Is he going to be okay?

10
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.950
Like sometimes fights get stopped early and it is the worst feeling when a guy

11
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:30.000
is kind of rocked,

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.830
but then someone stops the fight and then the guy complains and crowds like,

13
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.170
boom. And you're like. Yeah.

14
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.220
<v 0>It's, you know, it's weird. Cause our philosophy and you know,</v>

15
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.810
I primarily worked with two of the commissioners,

16
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.680
Nevada state athletic commission in California to the top commissions in the

17
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.523
world.

18
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
You don't want to fight to go too long to risk long-term injury for the fighter.

19
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.070
So there's a philosophy of maybe stopping a fight,

20
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:54.960
one punch too early versus one punch too late.

21
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.640
Your goal is to stop it right on time.

22
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.400
But it takes a lot of hard work to get to that point,

23
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.070
depending upon the history of the fighter, you know,

24
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:03.870
their ability to come back and you know,

25
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.030
you gotta make that subjective determination right away.

26
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:07.860
When is the time to stop that fight. But man,

27
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.170
it's the worst feeling in the world. If you think you get to that point,

28
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.280
you let it go too long. Or if you mistakenly stop it too early. Ah, God,

29
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:15.480
it's a hard feeling. And trust me.

30
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.890
<v 1>It's such a difficult job.</v>

31
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.500
It's so much harder than anything other than fighting.

32
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.340
Like everybody else's joke. Judging is kind of hard, but they kind of,

33
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.360
they can hide like you on TV. That's right. You know, you're right there.

34
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:30.360
If it happens. And if it's you, that makes a bad call,

35
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.460
like all the hate comes your way.

36
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.190
<v 0>You know, you got to kind of stay away from, you know,</v>

37
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.600
some of the social media criticism.

38
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.840
Cause you've got someone in there that may not understand the detailed,

39
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.780
you know, specifics of how we officiate and what we do.

40
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.690
And you're going to have critics not tell everybody, going into a fight.

41
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.980
Fans are going to hate you.

42
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.890
A love you half of the fans account for fighter in the red corner,

43
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:52.920
half account for fighters in the blue corner. And depending upon the call,

44
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:56.100
you make, it may be the referee's fault. It may be the judge's fault,

45
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.280
but your goal is to go in there and be as objective as possible.

46
00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:00.720
And fighter safety is always number one.

47
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.260
<v 1>Yeah. And some guys just want to see people get beaten almost to death. They,</v>

48
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.440
they, they don't want to be stopped.

49
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.910
Even if the guy is covering up and in a turtle, they think they should,

50
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.170
they shouldn't stop the fight.

51
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.630
<v 0>If you stop a fight while somebody is standing up,</v>

52
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.910
you're just going to get crucified for that. So.

53
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.260
<v 1>Well there was a call like with max Holloway and Calvin cater,</v>

54
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.740
there was a lot of people thought you could have stopped that fight standing up.

55
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.970
But herb was like, not quite. And I think it was the right call.

56
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.030
He gave them, but it was touch and go.

57
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.150
You could tell he was looking at Calvin very carefully.

58
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.320
<v 0>And there's that, you know,</v>

59
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.380
you obviously go to there's no one better than John McCarthy and herb Dean,

60
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.970
right? Doing this. They've been doing this for so long.

61
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.820
That's the goal of what they're looking at.

62
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.700
And then it comes down to intelligent defense.

63
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.890
That's not just holding your hands up,

64
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.320
but that needs to translate into doing something offensive.

65
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.160
And if you could tell that a guy's listening to your verbal commands and he's

66
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.720
doing something to fight back.

67
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.300
As long as he's showing good cognitive skills and showing something off

68
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.100
offensive where he's not looking at long-term injury,

69
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.100
there's a possibility of him letting that FICO. But man,

70
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.420
if it started to stem on a 10,

71
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.540
seven round where the fighters does get destroyed and they're going to get hurt

72
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.910
now it's our responsibility to step in with fighter safety.

73
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.740
<v 1>Yeah. It's, it's a V like I said, it's a very difficult job, but you do it well,</v>

74
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:18.640
you do it. Excellent.
