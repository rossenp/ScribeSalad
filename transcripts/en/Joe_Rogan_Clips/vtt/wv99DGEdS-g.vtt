00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, the,</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.080
the Tik TOK craft or tic-tac craft tea,

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.200
contact talk. Can't can't get away from that word. The tick tech craft, um,

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.670
that was spotted off San Diego.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.110
It performed something spectacular in terms of its ability to go from the

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:20.580
surface of the,

7
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:24.450
of the water to 60,000 feet in how long?

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.880
<v 1>Uh, less, uh, less, less than a second, but there's actually more to it. There,</v>

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.960
there was a craft.

10
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.570
Remember I was talking with commander Fravor before this was public. Yeah.

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.090
There was a craft under the water to the tic-tac would

12
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:41.540
drop from 60,000 feet is what they're saying 60 to 80,

13
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.480
but that's the scan volume of the spy one radar.

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.480
So everybody I've talked to said they were coming from above.

15
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.310
They were coming from outer space,

16
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.960
dropping down within a second and stopping on a dime

17
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.880
and then making the movements, commander, Fravor song public inside of a glass.

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.000
Then he said to me in our first talk ever,

19
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.030
I'll never forget this because I'm talking to a fighter pilot and I got to talk

20
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.030
fighter pilot, man, I don't, you know, and he says to me,

21
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.720
it noticed me and I go, what do you mean? It noticed you? And he says,

22
00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.270
as I was descending rapidly to engage it,

23
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.380
it turned its nose and began to intelligently mirror.

24
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.150
My movements came right up by me and he says faster than you can

25
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.740
see, like, you can't even see a bullet, leave a gun. No, it just,

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.000
bam shot off. He goes, we don't have anything like that. I wish we did.

27
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.740
We don't whatever propels that is not a reactionary propulsion system.

28
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.570
<v 0>Meaning it's not pushing something off the back to get it to go forward,</v>

29
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.620
like fire and explosion. It's a field proposal.

30
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.860
<v 1>Yet.</v>

31
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.950
Like anything else we know you've got to have something going back to go forward

32
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:51.110
rockets. We're still using the same ones for back in the day.

33
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.690
This thing instantaneously without effects of inertia can move

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.080
now.

35
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.940
And that distortion that's exactly how Bob described these things would work

36
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.500
or do work in his opinion. So commander Fravor got to see it now.

37
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.200
And these incursions, by the way, look, there's stuff.

38
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.980
George reports on there's a lot. He doesn't as a filmmaker myself,

39
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.720
people tell me stories all the time. These incursions, it's not a rarity.

40
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.890
These are happening to this day. I just heard about one in Guam,

41
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.500
incursions over high security airspace over

42
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.450
our weapons systems. And in Guam, there was just recently an incursion,

43
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.580
the Pantex facility with the igloos where we hold our nuclear weapons and stuff

44
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:41.300
like that. There are incursions over these. So to George's point,

45
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.050
the reason why maybe all of this is secret is not because we can't handle it.

46
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:45.920
People flip out.

47
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.940
Maybe we just want to make sure we get this tech first because it's a game

48
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:50.774
changer.

49
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.070
<v 0>Now let's talk about the people that have tried to debunk this and why they're</v>

50
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:59.920
off because they've made some debunking claims about

51
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.960
some of these videos and about the technology that was used to track these

52
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.750
things. That's incorrect, where they don't,

53
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.470
they don't really understand what they're debunking. Right? So please,

54
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.590
please explain that because that's one of the things that people are immediately

55
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:16.120
going to go to. They're going to go well,

56
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.390
make west has already debunked it and I've read the stuff that he says.

57
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.400
It's mental gymnastics.

58
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.880
To try to explain it the way he's explaining it.

59
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:28.930
Without recognition of the fact that these things were actively blocking radar.

60
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.840
These things were actively blocking tracking systems.

61
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.220
These were physical crafts. This is not like a bird. No.

62
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.020
Or so a lot of the wacky theories that he has, like I wonder, you know,

63
00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.730
it's real weird like that a smart man can make such really

64
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:49.240
bizarre conclusions. Very weird.

65
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.000
Almost like someone wants him to do those.

66
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.371
<v 1>Sure. I mean, look,</v>

67
00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:56.820
it's so exciting that that we're seeing something and the government saying,

68
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:59.520
okay, these are UFO's. We have not identified them.

69
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.300
They have propulsion techniques that we don't have. And we're not,

70
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.980
we're just talking about the video. Let's.

71
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.150
<v 0>Talk about the debunking. Okay.</v>

72
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.450
Talk about the debunking and what his claims are in the debunking.

73
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.120
<v 1>Okay. So one that I recently like, you know, attacked,</v>

74
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.200
cause it was so ridiculous is he was saying that the go fast video,

75
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:20.610
which is this, you know, object that goes along, uh, in a straight line,

76
00:04:20.611 --> 00:04:24.000
one of the three videos that was released, he said w was probably a bird.

77
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.050
That was his first theory. Pull up the go fast video. Yeah. I mean,

78
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:32.910
I recently went deep into talking with, uh,

79
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.870
Boeing experts who, who work on these FLIR putts.

80
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.690
They're telling me how they work, what they can capture.

81
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.950
Why would a FLIR pod is, uh, for, uh, for looking infrared.

82
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.180
So basically on fighter planes, you have a camera.

83
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.100
<v 2>So here's the video, we're pulling it up. We're sure.</v>

84
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.150
<v 1>That it's mounted.</v>

85
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.700
And it's essentially recording in thermal imagery. These things are,

86
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.260
this is not Instagram.

87
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.180
These things are weapons systems that are highly trained to be able to

88
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.560
accurately represent a spatial awareness and to be able to

89
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.860
target, you know, enemy combatants. That's this is not an,

90
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.020
an iPhone and Instagram. These are weapons for us. So out of the three videos,

91
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.880
if we just look at this one,

92
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.580
although I like the tic TAC one with commander Fravor,

93
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:22.170
and I liked the gimbal one, those are awesome.

94
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:24.330
This one gives us very little information,

95
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.170
but the idea that this would be a bird.

96
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.140
If you talk to anybody that uses these pods, you don't,

97
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.270
you can't pinpoint on a bird.

98
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:37.140
You can't lock a weapon system on a fricking bird.

99
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.450
Well look how fast it's going to. Well, here's,

100
00:05:39.451 --> 00:05:41.790
what's so interesting is everybody can debate.

101
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.550
<v 0>So this is where it's locked in on it. Right?</v>

102
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.910
So the weapon system is locked in on this thing and it's tracking it now.

103
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.180
<v 1>Right. And they got real excited when they locked it. Cause it's,</v>

104
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.200
they said boxed a moving target. Right? So here's the deal though,

105
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.380
at anything I could say about video.

106
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.180
Cause there's not a lot of information in there.

107
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.190
What I can say is that object you're seeing is colder than the surface of the

108
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:05.024
ocean.

109
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.330
Now I looked up the surface of the ocean temperature at that location at that

110
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:11.900
time, because we had the information, it was like 65 degrees,

111
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.530
what propulsion system. So, okay. So a bird,

112
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.560
a bird is about a hundred and let's say five degrees like a seagull,

113
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.800
a seagull is, can go maybe 15 miles an hour. I don't know how fast they can go,

114
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.730
but they're they wouldn't, they wouldn't be colder than the ocean.

115
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:30.050
They'd be hypothermic and dead. It cannot be a bird because this,

116
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.700
what we're seeing is a colder object. Then the surface of the water,

117
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.280
that's why you're seeing it white. And how fast is it going?

118
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.300
That's under debate there there's different, um, interpretation. Yeah.

119
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.920
So I'm, I'll give you one interpretation about, you know, 240 miles an hour.

120
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:48.530
Some people say, and then they can argue, well,

121
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.130
the fastest bird in a nosedive could go that fast backup.

122
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.680
We have an object that is colder than the surface of the ocean that

123
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.600
immediately gets rid of the bird theory because a bird would be hypothermic and

124
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:06.110
drop like a paperweight into the water. It cannot fly at that.

125
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.560
So that's the piece of information I would attack that debunking.

126
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.990
<v 0>With this video when you're watching that, if it is going 200 miles an hour,</v>

127
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.050
that's not outside of what's possible with,

128
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.290
with spacecraft or aircraft or, or just planes. Right, right.

129
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.250
But it's cold. I understand that. That's pretty cool. But it is.

130
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.020
It's very interesting, but it's not moving anywhere near as fast as the tic-tac.

131
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.760
<v 1>No, no, no, no. This is just something,</v>

132
00:07:30.761 --> 00:07:32.380
because this is part and George can tell you,

133
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:35.230
this was part of a much bigger series of events.

134
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.340
So like the gimbal craft itself, that's another debunking thing. They said,

135
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:43.480
it's a plane banking away and you're seeing it through thermal. First of all,

136
00:07:43.481 --> 00:07:45.550
talk with the pilot. Not, so.

137
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.460
<v 0>Yeah, this is the gimbal. The gimbal is pulling it up right now.</v>

138
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.490
And how fast is this thing supposed to be going? You.

139
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.810
<v 1>Know, the speed from what I recall, wasn't registered on the, um,</v>

140
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.870
on the radio. It's not that it's going fast. If you talk with the pilots,

141
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.340
it was rotating.

142
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:05.260
It was spinning like a top end for like 11 hours without refueling. I mean,

143
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.300
the thing was just sitting out there. This was not, uh,

144
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.770
this is an occurrence that happened over a course of many, many weeks.

145
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.020
Now when it rotates like that,

146
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.040
the debunking theory is that you're seeing a plane bank.

147
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.940
So as if our military doesn't know what another plane is,

148
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:25.690
other planes look very different when you see them through thermal,

149
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.140
this thing was self rotating. And I just did an interview.

150
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.980
<v 0>And how fast is this? Or rather, how warm is this thing supposed to be?</v>

151
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.080
Is this supposed to actually be hot?

152
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.340
<v 1>I, I am unaware because you're looking at it through thermal, right? Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:42.640
I'm unaware of the specifics of that one when it comes to heat.

154
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.950
All I know is that it is self-actualizing,

155
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.390
it is not something that is a glare or flare of a heat signature,

156
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.950
making it look like it's turning the actual craft is self-actualizing.

157
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.820
And what is.

158
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.580
<v 0>That halo around it?</v>

159
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.570
<v 1>That's just an artifact of the, of the FLIR Thermo. It's not.</v>

160
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:05.430
<v 3>The premise that, uh, the U S government would tell you, all right, look,</v>

161
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:07.410
we're going to release these videos. Reluctantly,

162
00:09:07.411 --> 00:09:09.270
Lou Elizondo is the guy that got them released.

163
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:12.870
And then the U S government formally released them a couple of months ago.

164
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.970
The idea that the us government would release it.

165
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:19.260
The Pentagon says these are unidentified. The, and you know,

166
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:23.460
if it was a bird or a, uh, a jet engine, uh,

167
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.460
the pilots would not have the kind of reaction that they had that you can hear

168
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.270
on the audio. Our government does not tell, uh, members of Congress,

169
00:09:30.271 --> 00:09:32.790
the Pentagon doesn't go to the Senate intelligence committee,

170
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:36.780
show them those videos and say, um, yeah, it's unidentified, if it isn't.

171
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.760
And you know, the reaction of the pilots, uh, that the fact that they would,

172
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.080
were forced to release it,

173
00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:45.870
to begin with suggests that it really is unidentified.

174
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.910
<v 0>Why, and they've addressed it. Why do you think that they have, uh,</v>

175
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.680
addressed the fact that they're studying these things?

176
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:52.850
Why not just continue to not.

177
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.410
<v 3>I think they were forced to, uh, and, uh, some props to Tom DeLonge.</v>

178
00:09:57.411 --> 00:10:00.920
I know you guys had a pretty spirited conversation when he was here,

179
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.480
but he created an organization. Um, Lou Elizondo,

180
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.050
who ran that program came forward and brought with him. Those videos.

181
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.360
I saw them two days after, uh,

182
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.780
Lou Elizondo stepped on a stage with Tom and said I was in charge of the

183
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:15.560
program.

184
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.300
He and Chris Mellon have been sort of the engineers of getting that story into

185
00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:23.690
the New York times. That changed everything. As I said,

186
00:10:23.691 --> 00:10:27.800
the last two and a half years, um, everything has turned on its head.

187
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.000
The New York times covers the story. The result is other media covered as well.

188
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.070
They've been ignoring it forever. And,

189
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:36.740
and th and that allowed people who keep these secrets,

190
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.600
that pressure meant that people in Congress started asking questions. Uh,

191
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.540
two days after the story came out, I interviewed Senator Harry Reid,

192
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.410
who was the one who got the money to create that program. That became a tip.

193
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.320
And he said his phone had been ringing off the hook from other members of

194
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:53.390
Congress who are now suddenly interested.

195
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.490
I didn't know those a program they're telling him,

196
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.230
how do we learn more about this?

197
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:01.520
It started a series of closed door briefings on Capitol hill that continued to

198
00:11:01.521 --> 00:11:05.300
this day, the pilots like Dave Fravor were hauled before Congress,

199
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.170
first in front of the staff of the Senate intelligence and then Senate armed

200
00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:11.360
services. And then the elected members, these,

201
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.550
these senators who get briefed on it,

202
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.920
and they were impressed and they wanted more pilots to come in.

203
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.840
So it's been going on for two and a half years and two weeks ago, no, excuse me.

204
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.830
About a month ago. Now, the culmination of it, Senator Marco Rubio.

205
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.150
Who's now the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee drops this bill and

206
00:11:29.151 --> 00:11:31.790
it's the budget for the intelligence budget for next year.

207
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.550
And he includes a UFO provision in there. We want,

208
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.620
Congress wants to have a mechanism set up or where we get regular briefings from

209
00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:43.460
the Pentagon on UFO's, that's an astonishing change of events.

210
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:47.720
It's because of the media pressure and then congressional interest. It made it,

211
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.920
um, more acceptable for everybody to pursue the subject matter.

212
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.930
It's kind of out of the shadows and the Pentagon has reacted in fits and starts.

213
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:59.590
So sometimes as they said to the New York times, that program ended,

214
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.610
had nothing to do with UFO's. Uh, at first they said it did,

215
00:12:03.611 --> 00:12:06.970
then they said it didn't they've admitted. Lou Elizondo worked on the program.

216
00:12:06.971 --> 00:12:10.660
Then they said he didn't. Um, they said that the OSS app,

217
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:14.740
which is the other program, the mother program, uh, that became a tip that,

218
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:17.320
that had nothing to do with UFO's what it did.

219
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.430
So they continue to sort of lie and abuse, gait, and muddy the waters.

220
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.630
But the fact is that there's too much momentum from media and Congress and the

221
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:27.520
public, uh, to hide this anymore.
