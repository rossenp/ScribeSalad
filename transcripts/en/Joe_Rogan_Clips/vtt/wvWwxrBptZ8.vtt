1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah, that was a, an.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.900
<v 1>Interesting take because, um, that guy was a,</v>

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.250
he was a young guy and he had never been the star of a movie before and they

4
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:15.510
were making this movie and because they, they, you know,

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.290
they'd put money into this. The executives were giving him a line readings.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.400
There was a guy who was wearing cuff links and an expensive watch and this

7
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.530
really nice tailored suit. And he was saying,

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.970
he was telling him how to be funny.

9
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.010
<v 2>Bob Simons. That was probably the producer. I don't know. Cause I worked,</v>

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.480
I did a movie with him, see spot run. And this was after that,

11
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:39.740
that's how it was being an. They was just being.

12
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.070
<v 3>A guy with money and it gets mad or something like that.</v>

13
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.600
Is there any situations.

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.700
<v 4>You don't do that? You know.</v>

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.430
<v 1>The guy wanted to do the movie, what it was.</v>

16
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.520
He was happy to be the star of the movie and he just took it. Remember.

17
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.590
<v 4>When they Dominic Alon reading, he flipped. I mean,</v>

18
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.380
Dominic's the most calm Dominic kinase. He played uncle junior,

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.870
the most calm guy, just sweetheart.

20
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:03.020
And somebody gave him line readings and he flipped out.

21
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.270
<v 2>It was a, I was in the car, we were in a,</v>

22
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.590
the camera car and I was driving on the New Jersey turnpike. You know,

23
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.700
they were towing the carpet, you know, the camera was there and uh,

24
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.920
I was stuck. I couldn't get out.

25
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:20.690
And the director came over and Dominick was gone. Don't tell me how to do it.

26
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.880
Just tell me what you want. And this is the nicest man in the history.

27
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:30.110
Right. And he was gone. Don't tell me how to do it. Just tell me what Joanne.

28
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.040
<v 1>What is the thing about actors with liners? Because.</v>

29
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.580
<v 4>Then you get your, now you're not discovering it. You're not,</v>

30
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.280
you're not creating the moment. You're just imitating it.

31
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.560
So it's not organic and it's not,

32
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.680
might not be as interesting as what you're going to come up with as an actor.

33
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.870
<v 2>But it does, it doesn't bother me so much. A lot.</v>

34
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.860
<v 4>Of directors don't know how to deal with actors.</v>

35
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.270
So they think that that's helpful, but it's, it's actually the opposite.

36
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.490
It's not helpful because when, like when they give.

37
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.420
<v 1>You a line reading, they would actually say the line the way they want.</v>

38
00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:00.770
Sometimes they will. And.

39
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.400
<v 2>You know what? That doesn't bother me. I flip out it hasn't happened.</v>

40
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.410
<v 4>Much. I've gone off on directors to that.</v>

41
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.740
<v 2>And listen, especially with a sit-com, which I find very difficult.</v>

42
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.050
I find one hour dramas. I, I,

43
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.140
I liked that so much more sitcoms, a different rhythm, a different beat.

44
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.580
I don't think I'm very good at it. And I've done quite a bit of him. Uh,

45
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.060
you know, the guys giving me a note to give me, I said this, tell me,

46
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.880
tell me what you want me, how do you say, tell me how to say it.

47
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.720
I'll do what you want because obviously I'm not getting what you want.

48
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.540
I want to make the director happy. I want to do a good job.

49
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.520
Tell me it doesn't bother me that much. You know, I have had directors,

50
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.550
uh, I did a movie with a young kid. It was a really good role, a younger kid.

51
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.290
After every take, he came over to talk to me. Finally, I went like,

52
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.910
just let me do my thing. I'll figure it out. Just stay away. Appreciative.

53
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.970
<v 1>Of the fact that you've got to think about what you're doing.</v>

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.820
And if they're yapping at you,

55
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:04.060
then you thinking about them and it interrupts this whole process.

56
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.800
You freak out though, Michael.

57
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.240
<v 4>Yeah. Because as an actor, you have to, you're playing the scene,</v>

58
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.830
the reality of the scene, whatever it is,

59
00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:12.690
this guy saying something and it you off.

60
00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.510
So that's what you're trying to create. That's what you're trying to do.

61
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.050
Someone tells you say the line like this, well then I'm not in the moment.

62
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:21.810
I'm not dealing with this. I'm just thinking about imitating this,

63
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.100
who just told me to say something a certain way. You know what I mean?

64
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.180
I had a director who said to me, uh, make a comical face.

65
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.570
And I said, I don't know what that means. Do you want me to be happy?

66
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:37.800
Do you want me to be ecstatic over the top? Really excited, make a funny face.

67
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.410
And then I said, ah, I don't know what that means. I.

68
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.630
<v 2>Think he should be more cartoonish. And then he.</v>

69
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.310
<v 4>Said, uh, he said, well, I'm not really good at, uh, I swear to God. He said,</v>

70
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:49.410
I'm not really good at giving directions. I said, that's.

71
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.243
<v 3>Your job.</v>

72
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.450
That's actually the title of the job is direction.

73
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.240
<v 1>Do you feel like as an actor, it's a,</v>

74
00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:59.850
it's a strange thing to do because you're creating something,

75
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:02.940
but it's also this collaborative effort you're working with the other actors,

76
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.510
but you're also working with the director either is the script that you're

77
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:09.900
supposed to be following. And maybe there's some changes to the script.

78
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:14.700
And there's so much going on to try to create your version

79
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:17.880
of it. That the more that people are with you,

80
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.850
the more that's going to just throw you off the rails.

81
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.020
<v 4>It does. And I've what I found is the best people, the best director,</v>

82
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.050
best actors and writers make it.

83
00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:32.610
So you feel very comfortable and that you are free to create and that you're not

84
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:35.940
being dominated or dictated to and stuff like that. Like for instance,

85
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:40.080
the best example is Martin Scorsese, who I only worked with once in a movie,

86
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.930
I felt like I could do no wrong.

87
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.760
He creates that environment where you feel completely creative and free and

88
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.350
that it doesn't get better than him. Yeah.

89
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.360
<v 1>You know, it doesn't get better. I would imagine that that's a,</v>

90
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.590
that's a real skill that you hone to be able to look at it from the artist's

91
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:58.680
perspective, from the actor's perspective. And just to, to,

92
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.630
just to figure out how to be the least annoying, the most supportive,

93
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.730
and then just sort of convey what you're trying to get done.

94
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.450
<v 4>A hundred percent. I mean, both ways, you know, as an actor too,</v>

95
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:10.740
you got to learn, you know,

96
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:14.100
you learn how to deal with different types of directors and give,

97
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.280
give them what they want and give and satisfy yourself at the same time.

98
00:05:17.281 --> 00:05:20.700
When you're not as skill, when you're learning, it's harder to do that.

99
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.290
You know, I got fired from my very first professional job. I was 21.

100
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.500
I'd been studying for a long time. I've been auditioning, never got anything.

101
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:33.270
I get a play and I was a lead in a play off-Broadway but it got a lot of

102
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:35.940
attention because it was based on a true story. And, uh,

103
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.830
I got fired after the opening weekend because I didn't respect the

104
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:41.790
director. I thought he,

105
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.410
I didn't think he knew what he was doing and I didn't know how to give him what

106
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:50.370
he needed and still do my own thing. I wasn't skilled enough yet.

107
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.310
So they fired me. It was devastating.

108
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.160
<v 2>But a lot of like,</v>

109
00:05:56.161 --> 00:06:00.710
I work with Clint Eastwood a few times and it's with the

110
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.660
casting, he's relying on you. That's why he cast you. So a lot of, a lot of,

111
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.550
a lot of directors, even big ones,

112
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.830
they don't even give you any direction they hired you, did you? Yeah,

113
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.940
absolutely. You did your thing. And now go ahead and take it away. I mean,

114
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:21.110
you know, and, and it's a lot with like, he believes it's a lot with it.
