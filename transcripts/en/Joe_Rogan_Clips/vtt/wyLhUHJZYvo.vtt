00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You need another one of those.</v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.970
What is the reason why you need so much water to do this?

3
00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:10.550
Is it so that the frog has a place to be?

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.490
<v 1>So the frog is safe, you know, I've never injured a frog or anything.</v>

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.710
<v 0>I'm sure he feels very comfortable knowing that here he goes,</v>

6
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.940
oh, Jesus, you hop right out. He's like,

7
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:34.460
I know what the is happening here. Hey buddy.

8
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.420
<v 1>Hold on. Let me just, okay.</v>

9
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.920
So I just usually like to get a little bath.

10
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.080
<v 2>Yeah, good.</v>

11
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.570
<v 1>Okay. This is basically the technique and I've put up to 10 frogs inside.</v>

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.330
So he come. Hmm.

13
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.230
And now we can hang and talk for, you know, as long.

14
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.320
<v 0>As he stay in there. Um,</v>

15
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.600
what's the longest you've kept them in there and they live.

16
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.580
<v 1>Like three hours or so.</v>

17
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.130
<v 0>And none of them have ever died. Nope. Wow.</v>

18
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.880
That's pretty mean how bad do you have to pee right now? I don't want to 10,

19
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.950
anytime. Anybody complains about needing to pay,

20
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.480
I'm going to show them this video,

21
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.300
huh? 10th, 10th water. And what are they? Eight ounces.

22
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.973
16.

23
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.460
<v 1>It's my water broke. It's more than a gallon of water. Yeah.</v>

24
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.890
Now here's the magic of our site guy.

25
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.770
Not FMT. And after like,

26
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.660
get him to swim up to the, how do you do that?

27
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.693
I don't know.

28
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.050
I just like data it and had fluoroscopies and looked where they were and then

29
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:24.020
saw that. Then I figured out how to soar. I did sword swamp.

30
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.470
Do you feel him moving around inside of you when there's a lot? When there's 10

31
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.520
Jamie, your face? No. No.

32
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.860
I got no first to like to get a little bit of.

33
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.250
<v 0>You forcing them out now can't talk</v>

34
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.910
some more water.

35
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.130
<v 1>What was the first time he did this one?</v>

36
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.860
Um, I, I worked on it.

37
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.870
I started like three or four years ago and it's been, uh,

38
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.590
you know, it's.

39
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.140
<v 0>The first time he put the frog in your mind got swollen.</v>

40
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.470
<v 1>And I didn't swallow the first time. I just wanted to get comfortable with the.</v>

41
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.780
<v 0>Farm. Yeah. And then I got it again.</v>

42
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.800
<v 1>After I tried it the second time. And then I built up a resistance to salmon.</v>

43
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.880
Now let me, let's get a few likes sushi,

44
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.820
mouth empty right

45
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.193
here. He comes.

46
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.390
This is so bizarre.

47
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.290
<v 2>Here it comes. Okay.</v>

48
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.450
<v 1>It's because I drank so much. So it's like, after like locate them,</v>

49
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.980
you have to locate.

50
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.903
Okay.

51
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.420
<v 0>To sound. What would you call this? Jamie ASM. R</v>

52
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.250
this is so strange.

53
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.330
So for people that are just listening,

54
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.290
I highly recommend you go to the video because it's going to have to.

55
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.710
<v 1>Condense. No, no, no.</v>

56
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.060
<v 0>No, no, no. We're going to keep this up exactly the way it is.</v>

57
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.270
People need to say, oh, okay.

58
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.020
Take out like a liter of water.

59
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.270
God. That's so strange.

60
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.230
<v 1>I spit on biggie.</v>

61
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.720
That's called the water spout. That's how I usually put out the fire. Oh my God.

62
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.233
Hold on.

63
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.890
<v 0>It's probably like, what the did I do deserve this?</v>

64
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.490
I bet that fraud was just like an person in another life.

65
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.830
The water. Do we need another bucket? Maybe.

66
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.530
Can we get that plastic bucket in the back?

67
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.830
The, the F the amount? I don't know if that's good enough, but for now,

68
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.950
we'll just use that for now. It is a,

69
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.780
quite to wash the amount of water that's coming out of you.

70
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.060
<v 2>Oh, let me see this better.</v>

71
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.040
Where's he at right now?

72
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.583
<v 0>Boy,</v>

73
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.140
you got them in there. Put them in my hands. Okay.

74
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.780
<v 2>There he is. Boy here. Little fella,</v>

75
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.190
this watch little fella. You've had a rough life in that a road.

76
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:45.540
You've had a road petty.

77
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:51.090
<v 1>So that's the frog trick. He's alive and perfect kid.</v>

78
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.130
Yeah, he's going to be fine. Oh, don't lose him.

79
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.400
[inaudible].
