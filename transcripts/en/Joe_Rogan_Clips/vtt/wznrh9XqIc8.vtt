00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience Buster Douglas in that fight. You know,</v>

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.980
the whole story behind it, his mom died and he was devastated.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.050
And so he was always a really,

4
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.050
really talented guy that just didn't work hard enough. But that fight,

5
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.370
he trained like a. He trained like a real champion because he.

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.070
<v 1>Didn't come out. Yeah. It didn't want to face didn't want to think about it.</v>

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.960
I'd probably just focused on was.

8
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.830
<v 0>That maybe also he was like doing it. He was dedicating it to his mom, but he,</v>

9
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.050
yeah, the human element, but I just remove.

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.380
<v 2>Just, yeah.</v>

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.330
<v 1>I am, uh, I am I am, is this.</v>

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.500
<v 0>What you're finding out from this pandemic being locked up and having so much</v>

13
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.334
alone time.

14
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.810
<v 1>Like that? I understand my anger now. I don't know how to fix it,</v>

15
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:48.680
but I understand what is it? W what is your anger? It's failing.

16
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.490
Like I'm not going to be heard and things are going to go in a way.

17
00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:54.200
I don't want them to be, so the second is,

18
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.600
there's a suggestion different than mine.

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.860
I catastrophize in my head and I don't want to be like, well, you know what,

20
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.110
actually, I can't do that because I'm doing Joe's podcast.

21
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.340
Maybe I could do that tomorrow.

22
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.510
I just hear the information and feel like I have no power. And then I go, oh,

23
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:10.850
what the? Then my wife's like,

24
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.110
I just asked a question and then I am so up here.

25
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.500
I have to, like, it takes, it only takes me like two minutes.

26
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.790
And then I come in, I put my head to the side of her head and I just go,

27
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.090
I'm sorry. I don't want to tell you, you married a up.

28
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.280
You blew it. You're not going to, you're not good at reading people.

29
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.220
You have no one to blame, but yourself like that. And I apologize, like an. Now,

30
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.600
my I, and there's another thing too, is I've I also, in this,

31
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:46.250
I've never loved my wife more, you know, gave me a son. And it's just like,

32
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.840
it's one of those things where, you know, you just sit, that's a beautiful,

33
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:55.100
really sit there going, like, I am really like, I am way,

34
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.160
way more of a than I thought I was. I knew I was,

35
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.890
but I didn't think I was that bad. So.

36
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.980
<v 0>You realize you've got issues, but you don't know how to solve them.</v>

37
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:04.814
That's what it is.

38
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.420
<v 1>I, I realized that I had issues that I thought I was past.</v>

39
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.490
That's what me up. But you feel like, like, all right,

40
00:02:13.491 --> 00:02:16.850
so I've taken care of that. Now I can focus on this. And it's like, nah,

41
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.020
this is still in this pile. You thought it was six feet high. It's 12 feet high.

42
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:25.520
And it's, it was, uh, um, yeah,

43
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.450
it was demoralizing. Do anything? No one is part of the way to fix it though.

44
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.890
Yeah. But then you have to go through the torture of it of,

45
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.640
because it's not like, it's not like, you know, like the Dr. Phil episode,

46
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.320
you need to understand yoke, yell at people, whatever the. Oh,

47
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:45.320
okay. Thanks Phil. And like, you're just going to go do that.

48
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.010
It's it's like nanny. Then you have to do the work.

49
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.440
And it's so easy to just go back into your,

50
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:55.550
your it's a deep groove worn into your personality,

51
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.780
and you're trying to get out of the rut.

52
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:01.150
And it's just easy to go back into it and just be on autopilot.

53
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.960
<v 0>Pilot.</v>

54
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.290
That's why people like psychedelics because it separates you so much from who

55
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:09.180
you are. You get a chance to look at yourself.

56
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.370
It's one of the things that comes out of it.

57
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.240
I should have done that when I was younger. Can't do it now. Like right now.

58
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.350
<v 1>On this podcast, I don't get to, I think they're a little bit more professional.</v>

59
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.780
I'm supposed to be promoting one of these features. We've already done.

60
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.180
<v 0>It. We promoted it. It looks great. I'm excited.</v>

61
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.380
We started to see what a mustache.

62
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.620
<v 1>Oh, so you say I'm done in the NAC. Now do this. You can do a little drugs.</v>

63
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.180
Sorta mushrooms. Be good for you. Listen, Joe, I know you're an influencer,

64
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.940
but you ain't gonna win on this one. Well, it's a

65
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.760
dirty word. I will be, uh,

66
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.810
kids get out of the house and they're great people.

67
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.580
Hopefully if I did the job then.

68
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.940
<v 0>Yeah. So when they're 18, okay, we'll go. When they're 18,</v>

69
00:03:53.941 --> 00:03:54.810
I'm gonna take you somewhere.

70
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.390
<v 1>All right. When I'm 70 and you're 71. Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.700
<v 0>We'll get blasted together. I'm not sure. This is.</v>

72
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.060
<v 1>What I learned about myself and why I didn't miss stand up.</v>

73
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.900
Cause it was freaking me out is because what I experienced as a kid

74
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.860
straight across the board, uh,

75
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.880
made me go to this mental place of like, I don't care.

76
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.730
it. I don't care. I don't need it. I don't give a.

77
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.030
And that caused that caused that's what caused everything to get walled off.

78
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.620
And that actually feeds into rehabbing injuries

79
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.180
because I was a big moment for me where I got this

80
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.010
console thing that I'm trying to put in my podcast studio.

81
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.800
And I was supposed to deliver it and bring it in there. Right.

82
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.490
So the day they were going to deliver it, my wife went into labor.

83
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.020
So I went to the hospital and then they showed up and I didn't want them going

84
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:47.640
out in my garage. I got all my memorabilia and.

85
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.550
I just didn't want people in there unless I was there. So I said,

86
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:51.660
I just have them drop it off.

87
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.010
I thought it was going to be a box and it was already assembled and it was big.

88
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.120
Right. And it was also the weight load of it. I was just, I was like, ah, it.

89
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:00.901
If I keep my arms in,

90
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.750
like this it's mostly biceps and I was going to do this and I was going to do

91
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:07.140
this stupid German, Irish. it.

92
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.060
And what it was going to do was going to set me back once again,

93
00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:17.040
like I had a big setback in February, I had an acting gig and they said,

94
00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:21.060
Hey, it was just a stupid little action thing as a wall, put your hands on it,

95
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.640
hop over. Can you do that? I'm like, yeah, my shoulder feels pretty good.

96
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:26.020
And the second went like that, I felt like lightning go down my shoulder.

97
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.930
And I was like, ah, right back to the tuna canning and all that. So I actually

98
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.180
had a friend come over. We were going to do it. I said, you know what, dude.

99
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.850
<v 3>I, I, I owe you.</v>

100
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.100
<v 1>A dinner or something. I, I'm not doing this.</v>

101
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.280
And I called up this guy that I knew who has a construction company.

102
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:47.340
I know you got a couple of strong young guys that can just move this thing in

103
00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:51.390
there. And I just had them do it. And, and like,

104
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.630
and that's like something that I'm pushing through where, um,

105
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.940
it helps me as a comic and also me deal with highly emotional.

106
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.860
Cause I can just shut off and just do what I have to do,

107
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.070
which works like back in the day, when you're going to do Letterman,

108
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.880
which was terrifying, it's freezing cold. And you just have to be like,

109
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.140
this just, it's just people. This is just a different shiny floor.

110
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.660
That's freaking me out. And as an icon sitting at that desk,

111
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.280
I had the tools to shut that off, which is great for that moment.

112
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.680
But it's terrible for the rest of your life. Like this. That's like,

113
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.730
I just realized there's just in me that I needed,

114
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.010
that I have not dealt with death of friends.

115
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.830
All of that is just sitting in here.

116
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.280
And I think that's also like, when

117
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.660
people then go like, oh, Hey, can you do this? Oh, I thought hell.

118
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.930
Like it's not all just that. I'm not going to get what I want.

119
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:51.770
A lot of that is like, you got all of this that you sit in on.

120
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.230
So you're sitting on all that and you haven't addressed it. So then it just, it,

121
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.420
it,

122
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.400
the only way for the steam to come out is like for you to snap or whatever.

123
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:05.480
So, which is really not fair to the people around you,

124
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.580
to be honest with you. So I don't know if you go to therapy.

125
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.490
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

126
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.350
<v 0>What about meditating? You ever medicine.</v>

127
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.080
<v 1>Yeah, but I find the guy's voice is annoying. You don't have to listen.</v>

128
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.143
Won't shut up.

129
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.780
Yeah. Every time I'm getting there, he starts talking again.

130
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.260
And then he's using this really soothing,

131
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.300
caring voice that makes me face all of that

132
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.930
that I didn't get growing up, which makes me angry at this person.

133
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.130
That's trying to help me.

134
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.140
<v 3>Wow. Yeah.</v>

135
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.440
<v 1>Quarantine is not a bad thing.</v>

136
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.180
<v 0>For what it's worth. You're always fun to hang around with.</v>

137
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.360
I always enjoy your company. I don't have any issues with any of your crazy,

138
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.130
cause I have a crushing need to be.

139
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.070
So I toned down my continuous when I'm around.

140
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.640
<v 1>Listen, my wife knows me. Hang out with her one time.</v>

141
00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:11.920
She'll tell you some stories. I'm sure.

142
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.840
<v 3>Yeah. Well, the you that I get, I like,</v>

143
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.940
if that helps you. Yeah.

144
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.880
<v 1>You know the deal, you don't know anybody until you live with them. All right.</v>

145
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.163
You know,

146
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.290
I will not accept your compliments. That's another part of my personality.

147
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.440
<v 0>The guy that's running the meditation app. That's annoying.</v>

148
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:37.180
You do you know whose app you're using?

149
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.450
<v 1>I don't want to put the guy on blast, but yeah, I do. Okay.</v>

150
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.980
Let me know when he's great. He's great. He's doing, he's trying to help people.

151
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.560
I understand. Yeah. You should do it without an app. Do I go? I,

152
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:54.040
I was still, I can't say I can't say what I said nowadays.

153
00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:58.260
I can't say what I said. I remember I was playing pickup hockey and I suck.

154
00:08:58.261 --> 00:09:00.330
Right. But I'm having a good time out there. I'm just, you know,

155
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.810
I'm out there trying to get a sweat going. Right. And you know,

156
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.420
I'm having my head down. I'm going to play no contact. And because I had,

157
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.070
it was really my fault. I had my head down on this guy,

158
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.610
knocked me down on the other team. And he goes, you are right.

159
00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.550
When I said to that guy, I still regret.

160
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.210
I was so mad at him that he was caring in that moment. Like,

161
00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:26.780
and that's one of those things. It was like, what is wrong with me?

162
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.663
<v 3>Wow.</v>

163
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.050
<v 0>So you you're really trying to come to grips with all this right now.</v>

164
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.970
<v 1>Yeah. Because I don't want to pass this on my kids. That's what happens.</v>

165
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.290
It's just like, when, when people are like, uh,

166
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.420
if people say my kids are not like me, like, I'm like good.

167
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:52.730
That's weird. But I do think that a lot, if they allow, yeah. He's, you know,

168
00:09:52.731 --> 00:09:54.800
she's like, you know, happy go. Like my great,

169
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.960
like I forget what somebody said one time about my daughter. Cause she's like,

170
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.100
she's this angel. Right. And they made some sort of, you know,

171
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.010
comic made the comment, you know, thinking it was going to hurt me.

172
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.100
And I was like, yeah, dude, that's music to my ears. I don't want to,

173
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.510
I don't want it to be like me.

174
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.293
<v 3>But don't.</v>

175
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.040
<v 0>You think they were trying to hurt you? And they said it?</v>

176
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.490
<v 1>No, it was one of those comic things where they don't have kids. So,</v>

177
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.800
and it was a guy and they don't know what to say.

178
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:26.930
So then they got to like make a joke. Like I had a buddy of mine,

179
00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:29.660
a comedian on my birthday. He goes, Hey,

180
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:32.270
happy destroying your mother's uterus day.

181
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.460
And I just remember laughing, going like, oh,

182
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.910
there's a guy has to do a little more work than I have to. Or I can say,

183
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.650
I can say ha I know, but I mean, I know what it is. It was a Boston comic.

184
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.060
And he couldn't just say happy birthday, because that would be gay.

185
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.430
So he has to go. So overcorrect,

186
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:58.910
that has to go to that level. It's so stupid.

187
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.800
It's probably why guys die before women,

188
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:06.290
you hang on to and there's all that stuff, you know, can't say,

189
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.940
enjoy sunset, Joe. You can't do that.

190
00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.210
<v 2>Why can't you shut up? But I know why.</v>

191
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.100
<v 1>I know you do. I know.</v>

192
00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:17.460
But the thing about you is you can also beat the out of most people in a room.

193
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:20.670
So you got that. So people can be like, oh wow. You know,

194
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.350
they actually want to hear that from you. When they see you spinning he'll kick,

195
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.800
they want to know that you enjoy a sunset. Cause like, I don't want,

196
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.120
if this guy's as angry as I am and can do all of that,

197
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.490
what am I odds are getting out of here.

198
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.680
So you want to see that out of a guy like you.

199
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.180
<v 0>Big guy. You didn't want to see it. Don't want to see you in. Join us on set,</v>

200
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.710
Joe. I don't read, I don't.

201
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.720
<v 2>Up. I don't know what it is.</v>

202
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.120
<v 1>I am too. I am too in here to understand me.</v>

203
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.350
This is interesting to have a very S I've. I have a very weird thing.

204
00:11:53.351 --> 00:11:56.380
I have an alley of my personality that works,

205
00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:58.030
that I somehow turned into a living,

206
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.350
but the rest of it looks like Fred Sanford's yard,

207
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:09.150
old radiators and bed frames and. It's a meth.
