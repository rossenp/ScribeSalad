00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.750
<v 4>The thing about redheads, I read this thing where it said that red heads have a,</v>

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.380
like,

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.910
there's something about the pain that they have a higher tolerance for pain that

5
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:16.350
I think it might actually be a genetic thing. Irish. Yeah. They would feel it.

6
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:19.140
See if we can find that there was something about red heads and pain.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.170
<v 1>Study.</v>

8
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.060
<v 0>Link between red hair and pain threshold. Wow.</v>

9
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.760
<v 2>The chosen one rule.</v>

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.650
<v 1>Like a redheaded stepchild. Find.</v>

11
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.340
<v 0>Out let's find Louie and start punching him. Oh, he can take it. He can.</v>

12
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.080
So it says people with red hair.

13
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.650
<v 2>A normal man would have killed himself a long time ago. He's got pain threshold.</v>

14
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.400
<v 0>Yeah. It's special. It's amazing. I heard the same.</v>

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.320
I heard it's amazing in that sign behind them. That just says,

16
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.550
sorry you were there for it.

17
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.850
<v 2>With them. I was on the road with him last.</v>

18
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.340
I did get him to do an Instagram. I was like,

19
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.740
you got to get back in. And then I think he already deleted it.

20
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.690
As soon as I left the Tori.

21
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.370
<v 0>Well, you know, he got a hard time, you know,</v>

22
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:09.000
he was the beloved guy and then all of a sudden they turned on him. Oh yeah.

23
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:10.770
I heard his new set is amazing. That's what I heard.

24
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.980
<v 2>I'll tell you a cool story. He's [inaudible] I don't want to disrespect trouble.</v>

25
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.610
No, it was just a funny thing. I got to the hotel and he was like,

26
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.280
what are you doing? I was like, I'm going to, I forgot my sunglasses.

27
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.960
I'm going to go buy a pair of sunglasses. And he was like, all right,

28
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.260
I want you to come to my hotel room before you leave. And I was like, dope.

29
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.970
And then of course he knew he was with me when the doors were closed.

30
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:34.290
He was like, I'm not going to check off.

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.910
I probably shouldn't have said that on here. That's all right. He's the king.

32
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.170
And uh, what he wanted to show me was that some of that,

33
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.700
that he filmed. And then I saw the hour and it's like, I heard my friend went,

34
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.090
cannot wait. He already filmed it. Yeah. Yesterday.

35
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.080
<v 0>The Hulu, right? Yeah. When is it coming out? I'm not sure.</v>

36
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.830
<v 1>That's a little awkward though. That he showed you that I.</v>

37
00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:59.663
<v 2>Got.</v>

38
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.250
<v 0>That story. I know. I get it. Yeah. Um,</v>

39
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.110
he and I talked about doing the podcast twice.

40
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.350
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

41
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.080
<v 0>Favorite guy in the world. He's a great guy. What's wrong with that story?</v>

42
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.980
That wasn't bad. You didn't say anything bad about him. I got a bad.

43
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.840
<v 1>Louise story. So I used to open for him before he was a trailer. And,</v>

44
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.750
uh, you know, he was like the king of comedy for a while.

45
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:26.670
He was the funniest guy ever, you know, whatever.

46
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:28.890
So I used to open for him and it was the highlight of my life.

47
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.930
And then we were hanging out in his hotel room,

48
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.520
watching a movie and we were talking and I was sitting on his bed and he was

49
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.150
sitting at the chair in the hotel room and I go, Hey, Louie.

50
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:42.000
And I farted on his bed on his bed.

51
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.570
Like, you're like the filthy comedy guy. I thought you would love a fart.

52
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:52.290
And he was like, dude, what are you doing? I was crushed. I like.

53
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.070
<v 0>We get actually angry. Or just like that, dude, what are you doing?</v>

54
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.470
<v 1>Because it was like, I'm disappointed in you. Like I thought we were a.</v>

55
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 3>Relationship and you tell her, I could see that a hundred percent.</v>

56
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.870
He strikes me as a guy that would, yeah. I could see him going both ways.

57
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.270
I could see him going, like that was hilarious. Or like, Hey dude.

58
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.310
And it was a great fart too. I really thought he wouldn't be like, oh,
