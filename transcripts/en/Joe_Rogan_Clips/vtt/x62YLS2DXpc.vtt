00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience pretty it's hard because people have other</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.360
motives like emotion, tribalism, things like that.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.260
<v 1>Well, people find great comfort in these belief systems.</v>

4
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:16.980
It gives them sort of a I've often said that it gives them some sort of like a

5
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:21.540
scaffolding for their, just their structure of the world,

6
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.800
their ethics, their morals.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.900
They can use religion as some sort of a mechanism to help them get by

8
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:30.450
something that they can climb on to

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.730
ease some of the confusion of the unknown.

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.680
<v 0>I'm sure that's true.</v>

11
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:42.030
But I don't understand why anybody therefore thinks that therefore the religion

12
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.864
is true.

13
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.200
Why would you think that because it provides you with a scaffold you can climb

14
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:48.180
on that makes it true.

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.120
I could understand you erecting a scaffold that was say gymnastics or, or,

16
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:58.110
or a certain diet or something like that, but a belief about the universe.

17
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.690
That's either going to be true or not,

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.500
and it doesn't make it true just because it's comforting or provides you with a

19
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:05.580
scaffold to climb on.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.170
<v 1>Well, it's almost like it's a spiritual system,</v>

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.550
like a placebo effect, like a spiritual placebo effect.

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.830
And by believing that this is true,

23
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.010
it gives you this comfort and allows you to condense your thoughts into a,

24
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:23.250
a better path.

25
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.480
<v 0>The placebo effect of course, is very real and doctors know about it,</v>

26
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.000
but did you know that the placebo effect works?

27
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.740
Even if the patient is told it's a placebo? Yes. That I don't get. I mean,

28
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.060
that's incredible.

29
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.830
<v 1>Yeah. It's very strange. Well,</v>

30
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:41.700
it's sometimes people doing things and knowing that they're doing things,

31
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.950
gives them this sort of feeling of, uh, of momentum, of accomplishment,

32
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:49.290
of, of progress. And I think, uh,

33
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.330
so many people are just so adrift and don't have focus that even

34
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:55.830
just telling them, Hey, we're going to,

35
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.250
you're going to be a part of this program and this program to treat X,

36
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.220
Y disease, whatever it is. And here's this thing, like, just,

37
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:03.390
just focusing on it.

38
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.900
<v 0>I think the main reason why so many people believe in homeopathy,</v>

39
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.220
which not only doesn't work,

40
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:12.960
but cannot work is the placebo effect that they, um,

41
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.750
they w it's part of they're going to get better. Anyway, of course,

42
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:18.570
but it's also the placebo effect that at the homeopathic,

43
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.850
I wouldn't say doctor homeopathic practitioner gives them a

44
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.840
nonsensical piece of medicine and they believe it's going to work.

45
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.310
And so it does. And so the placebo effect is important. Um,

46
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.690
the CFI center for inquiry has actually got a lawsuit going on at the moment

47
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.720
against pharmaceutical, um, shops,

48
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.000
selling homeopathic remedies, alongside, uh,

49
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.200
genuine ones. We can't stop them, actually selling homeopathic remedies.

50
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.670
What we can try and do is stop them,

51
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.950
putting them on the same shelf as though there's no difference between them.

52
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.280
<v 1>I didn't even notice he got up. Sorry.</v>

53
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 2>He's my best friend. How dare you,</v>

54
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.280
Marshall? Um, yeah, that, that, I forgot where we were.

55
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.780
<v 1>Well, sorry. You were, you were talking about inter sectional.</v>

56
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.450
<v 2>Hi Marshall, come here. I don't want them to get no, I know he wants to flag.</v>

57
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.380
<v 1>Yeah. I just don't want him to get in the way. Um, so you,</v>

58
00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:29.770
you were saying that you realize that everybody has their problems.

59
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.200
It doesn't matter if you're black or white.

60
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.170
<v 2>Yeah. I really learned a lot. Those women, it was run by lesbians. They,</v>

61
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.050
they like taught me some that stuck with me my whole life,

62
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.520
like cluttered room cluttered mind. I loved that one. It was basically like,

63
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.960
they were very strict,

64
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.790
but what happened was I learned how to be a really crafty drug addict.

65
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.750
So I was like, well, as long as my room is clean, I don't have a problem.

66
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.650
Cause I came, I came to LA at 19 or 20, I guess.

67
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.870
And this was like 2000 and I started, um, uh,

68
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.600
internee at this website called buddy head.

69
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.760
It was like this old music website and they were all punk and they had the

70
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.330
number one gossip site for music in town at the time.

71
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.430
And everybody was obsessed with this, um, with this website.

72
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:19.264
And then.

73
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.580
<v 1>It's a distraction here. He seems like a little bit restless, buddy. Come here,</v>

74
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.250
come here, pal. Come here.

75
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.520
<v 2>He's so cute though. I can't bear to kick him out.</v>

76
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.810
<v 1>Come on, come on, come on. Say hi to people,</v>

77
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.460
ladies and gentlemen is the sweetest dog in the world. Seriously.

78
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.550
You've been asking for him to be on the show forever. He just gonna,

79
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.160
he'll do the rounds. He'll go to you. What are you doing in here?

80
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.190
He'll go to you. Who get pat and Jamie he'll get pat,

81
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.250
but I just don't want them to interrupt the conversation.

82
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.100
It's a little bit of a distraction. That's fine. I'm all over that.

83
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.290
I don't want him to yank any wires out either. Hey,

84
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.970
it's going to Jamie now told you. That's what he does.

85
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.600
There's.

86
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.550
<v 2>Such like love sleds and some.</v>

87
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.740
<v 1>Amazing Goldens or love sponges.</v>

88
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.020
<v 2>Or she'll go sleep from one bed to another to another. She gets all the love.</v>

89
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.730
<v 1>He's not allowed to sleep in beds. Yeah, but he's, uh,</v>

90
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.060
he's very loved. It's just that I've never had a dog like that before.

91
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.900
They're just so different than any other dog I've ever had. Cause it's just,

92
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.980
he's just a constant friendly lover. You know, he never gets annoyed with you.

93
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.800
He never wants to go lie down, but he's always happy when you say hi to him,

94
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.173
you just start talking is.

95
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.240
<v 2>Unconditional. Yeah. I mean.</v>

96
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.890
<v 1>It's crazy that those used to be wolves. Turn them into this thing.</v>

97
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.783
I know.

98
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.990
<v 3>For average people, right? Uh, this saccadic, uh,</v>

99
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.270
that's not your primary threat.

100
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.140
Your primary threats are these bulk collection programs.

101
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:54.700
Your primary threat is the fact that your phone is constantly squawking to these

102
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:55.534
cell phone towers.

103
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.940
It's doing all of these things because we leave our phones in a state that is

104
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:03.830
constantly on you're constantly connected, right? Uh, airplane mode, uh,

105
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.910
doesn't even turn off wifi really anymore. It just turns off the cellular modem.

106
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.400
Um, but the whole idea is we need to identify the problem.

107
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.470
And the central problem with smartphone use today is you have no idea what the

108
00:06:18.471 --> 00:06:21.800
hell it's doing at any given time. Like the phone has the screen off.

109
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.360
You don't know what it's connected to.

110
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.310
You don't know how frequently it's doing it. Uh,

111
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.270
apple and iOS unfortunately makes it impossible to see, uh,

112
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.600
what kind of network connections are constantly made on the device and to

113
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:36.410
intermediate them going. I don't want Facebook to be able to talk right now.

114
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.130
You know, I want Google to be able to talk right now. I just want my, uh,

115
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.410
secure messenger app to be able to talk.

116
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.020
I just want my weather app to be able to talk,

117
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:48.080
but I just checked my weather and now I'm done with it.

118
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:49.790
So I don't want that to be able to talk anymore.

119
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.920
And we need to be able to make these intelligent decisions on not just an app by

120
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:58.640
app basis, but a connection by connection basis, right? You want,

121
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.150
let's say you use Facebook because you know,

122
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.420
for whatever judgment we have, a lot of people might do it.

123
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.310
You want it to be able to connect to Facebook's content servers.

124
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.550
You want to be able to message a friend.

125
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.840
You want to be able to download a photograph or whatever,

126
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.180
but you don't want it to be able to talk to an ad server.

127
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.640
You don't want it to talk to an analytics server.

128
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.290
That's monitoring your behavior, right?

129
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:24.140
You don't want to talk to all these third party things because Facebook cramps

130
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.370
their garbage and almost every app that you download and you don't even know

131
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.010
what's happening because you can't see. Right.

132
00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:35.630
And this is the problem with the data collection used today is there is an

133
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:39.020
industry that is built on keeping this invisible. Uh,

134
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:43.730
at what we need to do is we need to make the activities of our

135
00:07:43.731 --> 00:07:47.180
devices, whether it's a phone, whether it's computer, whatever, uh,

136
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.980
more visible and understandable to the average person and then give them control

137
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:52.730
over it. So like,

138
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.540
if you could see your phone right now and at the very center of is a little

139
00:07:56.541 --> 00:08:00.980
green icon, that's your handset or it's a picture of your face, whatever.

140
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:04.400
And then you see all these little spokes coming off of it.

141
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.970
That's every app that your phone is talking to right now,

142
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.560
or every app that is active on your phone right now and all the hosts that it's

143
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:16.880
connecting to. And you can see right now once every three seconds,

144
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.320
your phone is checking into Facebook and you could just poke that app. And then,

145
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.880
boom, it's not talking to Facebook anymore.

146
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:26.480
Facebook's not allowed Facebook speaking privileges have been revoked. Right?

147
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.590
<v 1>We'll do that. Uh, I think I have, um,</v>

148
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:35.510
a very peculiar biology that demands a certain amount of exertion. Yeah,

149
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.650
me personally.

150
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.190
<v 4>And I have friends like that. I mean, I, you know, I have lots of friends like,</v>

151
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:42.560
man, I, if I don't run every day, I feel like.

152
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.610
<v 1>I'm like running is very addictive though. I feel fine. Yeah. You get,</v>

153
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:48.830
you get used to that. There's a high that you get from running.

154
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:53.150
That's really interesting. And any, um, long-term cardiovascular exercise,

155
00:08:53.151 --> 00:08:56.490
you get this it's like we did. W last, last October,

156
00:08:56.491 --> 00:08:59.550
we did the sober October thing. We had this crazy fitness challenge.

157
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.940
So all of us were doing cardio, like five hours a day,

158
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.830
like really crazy amounts of cardio.

159
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.880
And one of the things that Tom's a girl and I both agreed on is like the,

160
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.100
the amount of internal chatter dissipates to zero.

161
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.590
Like you have no anxiety. It goes,

162
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.630
I didn't realize I had any anxiety until that happened. And then I was like,

163
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.040
God, it goes to zero.

164
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:28.020
It goes to nothing like when you do like five hours on a treadmill

165
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:31.470
or you just running, just run. When you, when it's done, man,

166
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.330
there's this like peace of mind that comes with that, this,

167
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.830
uh, release of endorphins. That's incredibly addictive.

168
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.580
Cause that feeling is so pleasing. So it's not that it doesn't,

169
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.590
it doesn't feel good to get out of bed and then to just push when you don't

170
00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:53.250
want to, but the end result feels amazing. It does.

171
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.360
<v 4>So I wonder if there's any research, uh,</v>

172
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.580
looking into whether that effect happens universally,

173
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.840
because I've worked out, I've run. There were times in my life.

174
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.690
I never, I've never gotten a runner's high. Never I get my teeth hurt.

175
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.650
My knees hurt my back hurts. I feel my brain, you know,

176
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.150
bouncing around in my skull, you know, I'm half a mile into it and I'm like,

177
00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.000
this, this doesn't feel right.

178
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.140
<v 1>You have to get in shape first. That's a big part of it. It's not,</v>

179
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.360
it's not that simple. It's like for me, uh,

180
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.380
I never really got into running. Um,

181
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.730
but I like the first time I really did any serious running. I, my,

182
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.170
my friend cam Haynes had a 5k, which is what is that three miles,

183
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:48.060
something like that. Um, and I didn't run at all in preparation for it.

184
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.200
And when I ran the 5k, I was like, Jesus Christ, this is hard.

185
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.890
Like I didn't have, there was no good feeling at all. You know,

186
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:59.130
it's running on concrete and in Vegas. It's gross,

187
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:04.230
Vegas smell and sin in the air. And, uh, but when it was over, I was like,

188
00:11:04.231 --> 00:11:08.130
okay, obviously, uh, I'm not, I'm in good shape,

189
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.200
but not in good running shape at all.

190
00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:11.520
So I should probably get in shape for this.

191
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.090
And then I started running and then when I got into running and particularly

192
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:15.924
running Hills,

193
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.220
then I started feeling it once I kind of got in that kind of shape.

194
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.300
And then when the, you know, when the, the workouts are over,

195
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.230
like I w I run all the time now and when it's over, I just have this.

196
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.100
<v 4>Yeah. You and Marshall are doing your thing. That's great. Yeah.</v>

197
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.450
<v 1>LA. And he loves it too. There's no crazy bonding experience with that dog.</v>

198
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.610
You know, when, cause he loves it.

199
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.920
<v 5>Now, many things happened after that, that I was able to use that.</v>

200
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:45.930
Like I became, uh,

201
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.190
when I was stuck on a beautiful mind because it wasn't cinematic.

202
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.130
I thought, well, how can I make it cinematic?

203
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.610
I thought Veronica Denegri she lived in an alternate reality. Well,

204
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:02.290
that's exactly in voluntarily what a schizophrenia has to do.

205
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:05.260
They live in alternate realities. So in the movie,

206
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:08.020
a beautiful mind to make it really compelling.

207
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.360
We started in an alternate reality and made it a thriller and realized,

208
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.280
oh my God, there's this apifany. And you realize that was not even reality.

209
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.370
Right. And, and that's what blew people's minds.

210
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:23.980
And that's why the movie kind of worked because it was,

211
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.290
it drew you in so deeply into this character that it became like this

212
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.450
subjective experience that every audience,

213
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:35.740
every audience member could feel like the pain of that and the insanity of what

214
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:36.640
that must feel like.

215
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.020
<v 1>That was another brilliant movie. I love that movie. When you say,</v>

216
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.950
make it cinematic, what, what do you mean by that? Exactly.

217
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:51.310
<v 5>Well, Ron and I realized that Ron Howard who directed it and won an Oscar,</v>

218
00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.280
um, and he,

219
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.020
we realized that in order to make it really interesting,

220
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:03.520
you have to see, you have to understand the mind of a schizophrenia.

221
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.770
So therefore you have to see somebody's mind.

222
00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.020
How do you see somebody's mind other than just graphically, you know, or,

223
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:14.110
you know, like through graphic design. And, um,

224
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.120
and we thought that's not very interesting, you know,

225
00:13:16.121 --> 00:13:19.360
like the insertion of graphic designer, voiceover narration,

226
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.400
that makes it kind of a documentary. So, but we thought like, but if you could,

227
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.110
if you could have an entire story kind of with the military and

228
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:30.370
paranoia and all that,

229
00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:35.290
that's exactly one of the dimensions or realities of a schizophrenia it's

230
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.330
mind. So you get to film it with other actors and other people. And that's,

231
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.390
that was, that's why, I mean, when I say cinematic,

232
00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:49.120
so basically when you're seeing the twenty-five minutes of living in this

233
00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:52.360
alternate reality with ed Harris and all that stuff, craziness,

234
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.340
it blows your mind as an audience. And then you reflect later like, wow,

235
00:13:57.341 --> 00:13:59.830
that wasn't even real. And wow,

236
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:02.740
that guy is that guy really going to come back and, you know,

237
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.420
you make it seamlessly cinematic with the rest of the

238
00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:11.050
narrative, him, him trained to cope with schizophrenia itself.

239
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.240
So it becomes the merging of an alternate reality and actual

240
00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:17.074
reality.

241
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.910
And the actual reality is when he's you watch him in that level of pain and just

242
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:26.590
trying to survive, you know, like cope with meds and the wife.

243
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:30.520
And, and then, then we, we, we, we found the way to bake it,

244
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.680
you know, kind of work triumphantly because it was love.

245
00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:37.360
That was the most powerful force.

246
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.950
It was that one person decided to stay with this other one person, the wife,

247
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.260
Alicia, stay with John Nash.
