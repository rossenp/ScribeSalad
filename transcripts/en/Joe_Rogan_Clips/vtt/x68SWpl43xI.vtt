00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.290
Your position on Syria is one that I think people have misconstrued.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.750
Why, why don't you tell me that's putting it nicely,

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.210
trying to put as nicely as possible.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.020
They've actually said that you are an Assad supporter.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.420
I know this is not correct,

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.590
but is that one of those things where people just say that in order to sort of d

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.980
iffuse you to categorize you as a ridiculous person right off the bat where no

9
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:27.550
one can take anything else you say seriously?

10
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.540
<v 1>Yeah. It's the usual tactic of, uh,</v>

11
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.260
trying to smear or vilify me and my campaign and,

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.200
and what I'm advocating for, uh,

13
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.460
because they don't want to engage on the actual issue itself that I'm pointing

14
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:45.600
out about how devastating and costly their policies are

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.880
of continuing to wage these wasteful regime change wars of

16
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260
choosing to support terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda in Syria,

17
00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.210
directly in Syria, because they are the most powerful force on the ground.

18
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.750
Who's fighting to take out the regime Assad's government.

19
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
So they're so focused on toppling this government in Syria,

20
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:12.540
that they're willing to actually use taxpayer dollars to provide direct and

21
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.360
indirect support to Al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria.

22
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.970
When you think about how crazy this is, uh, it, it, it,

23
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.730
it makes me angry. I think it makes most people angry.

24
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.780
It's why I introduced legislation called the stop arming terrorists act.

25
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.440
Why we would need to have such legislation is beyond me,

26
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:36.030
but it clearly we do to make it so that we don't have any taxpayer dollars going

27
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:40.560
directly to provide any kind of arms or support or anything to terrorist groups

28
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:41.251
like Al-Qaeda,

29
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.240
but also to make it so that we're not providing support indirectly through

30
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:49.530
countries like Saudi Arabia, who are providing that support, uh,

31
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.700
to terrorist groups.

32
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.170
<v 0>So what,</v>

33
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:56.850
what has been said of you about Assad and you are your position on the

34
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.430
side. That's just been an outright lie.

35
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.390
<v 1>Uh, virtually everything. I mean, I'll just tell you what happened.</v>

36
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:07.740
I went to Syria, uh, to, to meet with Syrian people,

37
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:12.720
to hear for myself from them about what was happening there. Uh,

38
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.830
while there I was offered the invitation to meet with the president of Syria,

39
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.940
and I took it because I think it's important for us to have the courage to meet

40
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.010
with leaders,

41
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:26.310
whether they be friends or adversaries or potential adversaries,

42
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.470
if our focus is on national security and on peace.

43
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.780
So I went and I had that meeting and I asked some tough questions and,

44
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.530
uh,

45
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.510
heard from him his perspective on what was happening and what he was doing in

46
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:47.070
his country and took the opportunity while there to meet with religious leaders,

47
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:51.990
college students, members of the political opposition, small business owners,

48
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.300
um, you know, women who were working to, to start their own business,

49
00:02:57.301 --> 00:03:00.880
to empower other women. She assumed Muslims, Christians, Catholics,

50
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.510
people of all different religions. Uh,

51
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.250
it is because of that and that meeting and my staunch

52
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.870
opposition to regime change wars in Syria and in other countries

53
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.030
that political opponents and others have chosen to try to smear me my

54
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:23.770
reputation and my campaign, uh, and to label me, as you said,

55
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:26.770
you know, she's a supporter of this dictator. Well, if that's true,

56
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.990
then anyone who opposed the Iraq war is a

57
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.340
Saddam Hussein.

58
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.080
Lover is a lover of dictators and loves Saddam Hussein.

59
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.340
So if you challenge their logic, you see how shallow it is.

60
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:47.080
And there's really none there. And, and what's exposed is, um,

61
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.210
their refusal to engage on the facts and to stand behind why they continue to

62
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:56.680
put the American people through these costly regime change wars

63
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.550
and why they continue to wage these wars that are causing incredible suffering

64
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:02.050
for people in different parts of the world.

65
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.970
<v 0>It also, when you're having these conversations, which are incredibly,</v>

66
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.710
incredibly important globally,

67
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.920
when you choose to distort people's positions like this,

68
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:15.610
you're not helping anybody. No, you're making the whole thing more confusing.

69
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.030
Yeah. So for someone like me, who's on the outside, excuse me.

70
00:04:19.031 --> 00:04:22.000
And that has to watch all this go down. I have to go, well, why,

71
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.290
why w why do you have reasonable people that make inaccurate statements about

72
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:30.070
someone? Because they feel like if you do not,

73
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.420
if you don't refuse a meeting with a sod, there's something wrong with you,

74
00:04:34.421 --> 00:04:39.280
right. Like to not want to be in the presence of this person.

75
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:39.970
Yeah.

76
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.590
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, the, the, um, there's so much hypocrisy around this, you know,</v>

77
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:47.860
a lot of these people are the same people who applauded president Obama when he

78
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:52.810
first ran for president in 2008. Uh, when he, I mean, he did,

79
00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:54.910
he caused some controversy at that time saying, yes,

80
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.740
he would meet with the leader of Iran without preconditions that he

81
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:03.760
would meet with leaders of other countries in that pursuit of national security

82
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.923
and peace.

83
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.670
So why the double standard here that, okay.

84
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:13.060
So in order to keep our country safe, in order to achieve peace,

85
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.150
we're only going to meet with our friends and people who we agree with.

86
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.390
That's not how you accomplish that mission.

87
00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:22.440
That's not how you accomplish security and peace. It doesn't make sense.

88
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.370
<v 0>The social media version of running the world, sadly, sadly. Now,</v>

89
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.680
had you ever met anyone like Assad before?

90
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.050
<v 1>Um, no. No. Uh, he was eager to meet,</v>

91
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.080
he was eager to be heard, frankly, does he speak.

92
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.130
<v 0>English very well?</v>

93
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.020
<v 1>Really? Yeah. I think he was educated in Europe. Um, a dentist,</v>

94
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.030
if I'm not mistaken, uh,

95
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.290
is in the ma maybe he's an eye doctor is not in the medical field. Um,

96
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.120
and he was, you know,

97
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:57.110
he was open to any and all questions that I had both about what was

98
00:05:57.111 --> 00:06:00.260
happening, uh, in Syria, uh, you know,

99
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.650
serious relationship or the lack thereof with Israel.

100
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.170
A lot of the turmoil that we're seeing in different parts of

101
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:14.060
the middle east of, of Sunni versus Shia, um, you know,

102
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.660
chemical weapons being used, uh, you know,

103
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.430
criminal acts being conducted a whole host of these issues. How did, how, how,

104
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.370
uh, the Syrian government is dealing with the Kurdish population,

105
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.870
the Northern part of the country, uh, what's going on in Turkey? There's,

106
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.010
there's a number of things that, uh, you know, I, I asked him,

107
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.480
he answered and he shared his view and perspective and, and really what,

108
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:40.010
what came out of that was he's, um,

109
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.410
he's very narrowly focused on his country and doesn't want other

110
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.570
countries or other people coming in and, and, uh, meddling in their country.

111
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.180
And what's what, what they're trying to accomplish,

112
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.510
which is actually the same thing that I heard from his political opposition.

113
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.780
When I met with them. These are some of the leaders who,

114
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.720
who led the protest that, um,

115
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.230
that kind of began this whole conflict in 2011,

116
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:10.820
people who are deeply opposed to the Syrian government,

117
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:14.840
some of whom have been held in captivity by the Syrian government.

118
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.520
And they said there are constitutional changes we want to make. Yes.

119
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:23.750
We would like to see Assad removed from government that they don't want to see

120
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:28.460
it done through military means or through other countries coming in and

121
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:29.960
toppling their government.

122
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:34.370
What they want to see is that change coming from the people of Syria

123
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.390
saying, Hey, this is the kind of leadership that we want for our future.

124
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.850
<v 0>I can imagine there's not a single country on earth that wants us to invade and</v>

125
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:45.260
take over. I mean, just seems like a bad idea for everybody.

126
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.200
<v 1>Right? Nor nor would we want that to happen to us. I think that's really,</v>

127
00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:51.990
what's missing here is, you know, for so long,

128
00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:55.770
we've seen this imperialistic mentality, um,

129
00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.570
that still exists in our government where some feel like, Hey, well,

130
00:08:00.571 --> 00:08:05.280
we should go and tell this country who should lead their government and tell

131
00:08:05.281 --> 00:08:07.170
them what kind of policies they should have,

132
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.160
but no other countries should dare even attempt to do that to ours.

133
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.220
<v 0>Yeah. Well, our position is that we're the best and we're,</v>

134
00:08:14.221 --> 00:08:15.900
we're running this country the best way,

135
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.280
and this is the best country that's ever existed. Ever has the most freedoms.

136
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.400
It's got the most chaos. It's got a lot of things going on. It's not,

137
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:26.370
they're not good, but overall,

138
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.070
we feel like we're the shining light of the world. Yeah.

139
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.910
Maybe that's not accurate, you know, maybe it's accurate in a lot of ways.

140
00:08:32.911 --> 00:08:33.690
And yeah.

141
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.351
<v 1>I think the problem,</v>

142
00:08:34.351 --> 00:08:39.150
the problems begin when we go into other countries and try to create little

143
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.040
mini Americas and impose it on the people there, whether they like it or not,

144
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:46.500
whether they're ready for it or not. Uh, and,

145
00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:50.520
and we end up seeing what we're seeing across the middle east. Yeah.

146
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.170
<v 0>I think we just look at the rest of the world and go, well,</v>

147
00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:55.690
I wouldn't tolerate that. Why are they tolerating that? Who is that? Why,

148
00:08:55.691 --> 00:08:57.390
why does he get the rough things? They should kick his.

149
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.020
That's literally the American perspective, but, you know,

150
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:05.340
we don't want to send our sons and daughters over there to go do that for

151
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.990
now. If I put my tinfoil hat on.

152
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:12.540
<v 1>We don't, we, the American people don't, but this is the problem. And this is,</v>

153
00:09:12.541 --> 00:09:15.780
this is something that I realized very quickly during my first deployment to

154
00:09:15.781 --> 00:09:16.614
Iraq,

155
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.490
where I was seeing firsthand the cost of war serving in that medical unit every

156
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:22.350
single day. And I,

157
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.000
I wondered how many politicians in Washington who voted for

158
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:31.500
advocated for champion that war in Iraq were laying away at night

159
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.760
awake at night,

160
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.310
thinking about my brothers and sisters who were getting killed in combat,

161
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:42.660
who were getting severely wounded, were getting blown up by IPDs. And I, I,

162
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.280
I learned very quickly that they were not,

163
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.730
they weren't thinking about the real cost and the ramifications and the

164
