00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.160
<v 1>Experience. Now, when you say civilizations fragile,</v>

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.520
do you mean because of this COVID 19 that's going on right now?

4
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.440
What what's that? I never heard of it. It's this thing. Yeah know, it's like,

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.600
uh, some people just get a car don't idea what you're talking about.

6
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.080
Other people, it gets much worse.

7
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.113
<v 0>Uh, sure.</v>

8
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.343
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.590
<v 0>Well, yeah.</v>

10
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.151
I mean,

11
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:31.070
this certainly has taken over the mind space of the world to a degree that

12
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:32.470
is quite shocking. Yeah.

13
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.230
<v 1>Well, outta nowhere, that's what's crazy.</v>

14
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.030
It's like you go back to November nothing. Now here we are December, January,

15
00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.420
February, March, April, may six months. Totally different world.

16
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.660
So from nothing to everything's locked down, there's so much, uh,

17
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.380
conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed.

18
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.420
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; what, what has happened? You know,

19
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:59.900
you find things where there was a, a meat packing plant.

20
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.810
I believe in Missouri where 300 plus people

21
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.650
were asymptomatic tested positive or asymptomatic. And then in other places,

22
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.290
it just ravages entire communities and kills people. And it's, it's so weird.

23
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.170
It, it almost appears on the, like, if you didn't know anybody, you'd be like,

24
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:18.371
what,

25
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:21.690
it seems like there's a bunch of different viruses doesn't seem like it's the

26
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:26.400
same thing or has a bunch of different reactions to the

27
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:28.760
biological variety of, of people.

28
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.080
<v 0>Yeah. Um, I mean, I,</v>

29
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.960
I kind of saw this whole thing play out in China, uh, before it,

30
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.360
it played out in the us. So, um,

31
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.550
it's kinda like watching the same movie again. Um, but in English.

32
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.430
Uh &lt;laugh&gt; um, so

33
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.270
yeah, um,

34
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.480
I might, I think the, the, the, the, the mortality rate is,

35
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.800
is much less than what is

36
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.030
then what say the world health organization said it was,

37
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.470
it's very much marginalized.

38
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.310
It's like probably at least order of magnitude less.

39
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.510
<v 1>Well, it seems to be very deadly,</v>

40
00:02:13.511 --> 00:02:17.030
to very specific kinds of people and people with specific problems.

41
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:17.864
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

42
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.390
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, if, if you're,</v>

43
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.620
you can look at the mortality statistics know by age and whether they have

44
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.060
comorbidities, like, do they have like, basically existing conditions and, um,

45
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.180
by age, um, and the, you know, if,

46
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:39.460
if you're below 60 and,

47
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.380
and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low.

48
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.050
It's not zero, but is extremely low.

49
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.370
<v 1>They didn't think that this was the case, though,</v>

50
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.170
when they first started to lock down the country. Do you think that it's a,

51
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.410
a situation where once they've proceeded in a certain way,

52
00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.360
it's very difficult to correct. Course.

53
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.140
<v 0>It's almost like people really wanted a panic that, you know,</v>

54
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.540
was quite quite crazy.

55
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.860
<v 1>Um, but in some places, a panic is deserved. Right? Look,</v>

56
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.820
if you're in the ICU in Manhattan and people are dying left and right,

57
00:03:17.821 --> 00:03:21.570
and everyone's on debaters and it's, it,

58
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.610
it seems like when you see all these people on ventilators and so many of 'em

59
00:03:26.611 --> 00:03:30.930
are dying and you see these nurses are dying and doctors are getting sick in

60
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:35.570
some places that fear is justified. But then in other places,

61
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.291
you're,

62
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:41.400
you're reading these stories about hospitals that are essentially half empty.

63
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.240
They're, they're having to furlough doctors and nurses,

64
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.480
because there's no work for them.

65
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.880
<v 0>Most of the hospitals in the United States right now are half empty.</v>

66
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.800
In some cases, there are 30% capacity.

67
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.480
<v 1>And is this because they've decided to forego elective procedures and,</v>

68
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.830
and, and normal thing that people would have to go to the hospital for.

69
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:04.323
<v 0>Yes. I mean,</v>

70
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.630
and we're not talking about just some of these elective procedures are quite

71
00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:10.550
important. Yes. Like it's like, you have a bad.

72
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.590
<v 1>Heart, fall, lot of disease. Yeah, sure. And you need.</v>

73
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.870
<v 0>A, you know, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; triple bypass. It's like sort of elective,</v>

74
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.950
but if you don't get it done in time, it's, you're gonna die. Yeah.

75
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:21.060
<v 1>It's.</v>

76
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.940
<v 0>Electives a weird word. Yeah. Elective. It's not like, Hey, I,</v>

77
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.820
I wanna isn't like plastic surgery or &lt;laugh&gt; right, right, right. It's um,

78
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.820
it's more like, like my, my hip is I'm in extreme pain cuz my,

79
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.300
my hip's blown out or my knee and I don't want to go to the hospital.

80
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.260
I can't go to the hospital to, you know, people in extreme pain,

81
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.130
people that need new, you know, like, like people that,

82
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.690
that have like quite serious issues that are choosing not to go out of fear. Um,

83
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.850
so I think it's, it's a problem. It's not good.

84
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.970
<v 1>It seems like the state of public perception is shifting.</v>

85
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.810
It is like people are taking some deep breaths and relaxing and,

86
00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:59.770
and because of the statistics of, I mean, and,

87
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.880
and essentially across the board,

88
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.720
it's being recognized that it's not as fatal as we thought it was

89
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.840
still danger, still worse than the flu, but not as bad as we thought or,

90
00:05:11.841 --> 00:05:13.480
or we feared. It could be.

91
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.930
<v 0>Um, objectively the mortality is, is much lower. Like</v>

92
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.040
at least the, of 10, maybe a factor of 50 lower than initially thought.

93
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.470
<v 1>Do you think that the current way we're handling this,</v>

94
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.710
the social distancing, the masks, the locking down, is it, does this make sense?

95
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.030
Is it adequate or, or do you think that we should move back to

96
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.940
closer to where we used to be?

97
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.220
<v 0>Well, I think proper hygiene is a good thing. No matter what, yes. You know,</v>

98
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:54.340
wash your hands and you know, and if you're, if you're coughing,

99
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.360
stay home or wear a mask, yes. This is not good. You know? Um,

100
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.200
in fact they do that in Japan. That's like normal. Yeah. If you're,

101
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.360
if you're ill, you, you wear a face mask and you don't cough on people. Uh,

102
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.640
I think that that would be a great thing to, to adopt in general,

103
00:06:08.641 --> 00:06:11.400
throughout the world. Um, uh,

104
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.040
washing your hands is also good.

105
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.990
<v 1>Well, that's a speculation. Why men get it more than women?</v>

106
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.910
Cuz men are disgusting. We don't wash hands.

107
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.430
<v 0>Disgusting. It's true. It's true.</v>

108
00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.590
<v 1>I admit it. We're all men in this room.</v>

109
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.270
<v 0>We're all gross. Yeah. Let's go to the restroom. You can see it. Yes. Yes.</v>

110
00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:25.470
We're.

111
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.430
<v 1>Gross. My daughter, my nine year old daughter yells at me, she goes,</v>

112
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:31.630
did you wash your hands? She makes me go back and wash my hands. Hmm.

113
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.790
She's right. Nine years old. If I had a nine year old boy,

114
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.660
you think you would care? No, I wouldn't give a if I want my hands.

115
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.860
<v 0>True. Um, so yeah, I think there there's,</v>

116
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.860
there's definitely some civil linings here, uh, that in improved, uh, you know,

117
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:48.340
uh, hygiene and.

118
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.540
<v 1>And awareness of potential. Yes.</v>

119
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.780
<v 0>And I, I think this has, uh, shaken up the, the system, uh,</v>

120
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.370
system is like somewhat Mar with Lalas layers of bureaucracy.

121
00:06:58.371 --> 00:07:01.890
And I think that we've, you cut through some of that bureaucracy. Uh,

122
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.770
and if we, you know, at some point there probably will be a, uh,

123
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.170
pandemic with, with a, with a, with a high mortality rate, uh, you know,

124
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.210
debate about like what's high,

125
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:16.930
but I mean like someone that's killing a lot of 20 year olds,

126
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:21.560
let's say like it's, if you had like Ebola type of mortality,

127
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.300
Spanish.

128
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.040
<v 1>Flu something, taxi immune systems of healthy people.</v>

129
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.480
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Um, but it's a, yeah,</v>

130
00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:33.520
like killing large numbers of young, healthy people that that's,

131
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.720
you know, define that as like, uh, uh,

132
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:43.550
high mortality then that this is at least practice for something like that. Um,

133
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.150
and I think there this, you know, given just a matter,

134
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.110
a matter of time that there, there will be eventually some, some such pandemic.

135
00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.550
<v 1>Do you think that in a sense,</v>

136
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.510
the one good thing that we might get out of this is the realization that this is

137
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.540
a potential reality that we, we got lucky in the sense, I mean,

138
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.620
and people that didn't get lucky and died,

139
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:06.220
of course I'm not disrespecting their death and their loss,

140
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.260
but I'm saying overall as a, as a culture, as a commun, as a human race,

141
00:08:10.261 --> 00:08:13.260
as a community, this is not as bad as it could have been.

142
00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:14.940
This is a good dry run for us to,

143
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.420
to appreciate that we need far more resources

144
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.490
dedicated towards the understanding these diseases,

145
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.810
what to do in the case of pandemic and much more money that goes to

146
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:34.090
funding treatments and, and some preventative measures.

147
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.850
<v 0>Yeah, absolutely. Um, and I think, I think there's a, a good chance.</v>

148
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.480
So it's highly likely, I think coming out of this that, uh, we will develop, uh,

149
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.720
vaccines that we didn't have before, uh, for, uh,

150
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.400
coronavirus and other other viruses, um, and, and possibly cures,

151
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.800
uh, for, for these, um, and our understanding of, uh,

152
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.120
viruses of this nature has improved dramatically because of the attention that

153
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.080
it it's received. So there's definitely some, you know,

154
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:08.680
a lot of silver linings here. Um.

155
00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.280
<v 1>And, uh, potentially if we act correctly.</v>

156
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:18.030
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's, uh, I think there will be some amount of lining here,</v>

157
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:22.510
no matter what, um, hopefully it could be more of lining than less. Yeah.

158
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.110
Um, so yeah, this, this is, uh,

159
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:32.150
this like kinda like a practice run for something to have that had a potential

160
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:33.830
that might in the future have a serious,

161
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.500
like a really high mortality rate that's and we kind of

162
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:41.460
got to go through this with, with, without,

163
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.300
without it being something that kills, you know, vast numbers of young,

164
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:46.660
healthy people. Yeah.

165
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.500
<v 1>When you made a series of tweets recently, uh, you know, uh,</v>

166
00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.780
I don't remember the exact wording,

167
00:09:52.781 --> 00:09:55.460
but essentially you were saying free America now. Like let's, uh.

168
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.170
<v 0>That is it. Thank.</v>

169
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.290
<v 1>You.</v>
