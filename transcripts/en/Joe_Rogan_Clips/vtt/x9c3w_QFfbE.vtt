00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 2>Just, just, uh, uh, the a month ago or whenever it was that, uh,</v>

3
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:08.680
Texas opened up, Fauci said, cases are gonna are gonna spike.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.240
Now the cases are down.

5
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.680
<v 1>And you hear what Fauci said? Which one? Which hilarious. What'd he say,</v>

6
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.920
Jamie and I were talking about yesterday F &lt;laugh&gt;. They asked Fauci, like,

7
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.110
why do you think that the cases haven't spiked Texas? He said, well,

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.910
obviously the people in Texas are, what, how was, how did he phrase it? He said,

9
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:30.230
they're behaving themselves. Yeah. Behaving better. And they're behaving better.

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.830
And Jamie's like, have you been to Texas?

11
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.310
<v 0>Yeah. But isn't this also like, uh, like just completely circular logic. Yes.</v>

12
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:41.300
Where you're like, okay. So if I say this is gonna have happen,

13
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.180
and then the opposite happens. It's because of what I said, that was,

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.940
you know what I mean? That's what Cuomo was throwing.

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.700
<v 1>And everybody was face in New York. Yeah. Cuomo was saying, if you, you know,</v>

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.700
we gotta lock down because you didn't wear your masks, you ate the cheesecake,

17
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:59.140
you're going get fat. Remember that he was using these down home analogies,

18
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.043
like, oh.

19
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.770
<v 0>Jesus card. I'll tell you what I can't stand.</v>

20
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.570
Which just like makes my blood boil is when they use

21
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.530
your basic freedoms as a negotiating tool. Like,

22
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.490
they're like, well, if you do X, Y, and Z,

23
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.130
then maybe we'll let you have restaurants. Exactly. Maybe we'll let you do this.

24
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.130
Like, what the.

25
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.370
<v 1>Are you? You get back some of.</v>

26
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.240
<v 0>Your freedoms, like you now, you're you using my freedom as a carrot,</v>

27
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.880
on a stick. Yeah. To get me to do what I want to do.

28
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.800
Like what type of sick is that?

29
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.560
<v 1>Yeah. And this is one of the reasons why I called you one,</v>

30
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.560
one of the reasons why I wanted you to come here to do the podcast,

31
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.240
because I I've heard you talking about, uh, COVID passports about,

32
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.870
uh, vaccine passports. And, uh, I share your, uh, uh,

33
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.910
your deep concern about this idea,

34
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.510
because this is not something that you're just gonna keep with. COVID vaccines.

35
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.590
If there's a way that they can get you to show your papers and to

36
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.950
show whether you have an app on your phone, whether you're, you know,

37
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.380
whatever it is that you have to have in order to be able to freely travel around

38
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.300
the United States, they're gonna keep that.

39
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.260
<v 0>Thing. Yeah. Well, and I said, just like I, I said before,</v>

40
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:11.220
if you're just looking at the bigger picture of it, you're like, look, this is,

41
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.980
and I think objectively, the country went totalitarian for about a year now.

42
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.900
Not every single part of it was as totalitarian as the rest.

43
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.770
But according to governors out of the, their own words, they suspend it,

44
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:25.290
the bill of rights. Yeah. And we've been,

45
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.890
we've been in a year living under that.

46
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:31.890
Like how long do you think we can go in living in a totalitarian

47
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:34.490
society before? That's just what our society is. Yeah.

48
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:36.290
And there's not really a memory of the old normal,

49
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.810
or at least that seems like the old times, that's not who we are anymore. Right.

50
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:42.130
We're already dangerously close to that position.

51
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.440
And then now we have this opportu where it's like, Hey,

52
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.600
Joe Biden says that everyone who wants to take the vaccine will be able to take

53
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:53.880
it. I think by June, he said, uh, everyone who wants it'll be able to take it.

54
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.400
And that's a perfect little opportunity point to go, okay.

55
00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:59.880
So we break out of it. Now, now we break out of it.

56
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.520
Now you can make a sound argument that if the vaccine's available for everybody,

57
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.360
the people who want it can take it.

58
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000
And the people who don't are choosing to take the risk.

59
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.200
And now we go back to normal life. And at the same time,

60
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.640
they're proposing this vaccine passport, which really,

61
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.070
if you look at the proposals, isn't a passport, it's an app, right? With your,

62
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:23.030
your medical history, with that, can, you know, your data can be tracked.

63
00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:25.110
Your location can be traced all of these things.

64
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.630
But what they're talking about doing now, when we have this fork in the road,

65
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.110
we could go back to being a free country, not as free as some of us would like,

66
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.310
but at least the way we used to have it right,

67
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.140
or we can go to what is being proposed and talked about,

68
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.300
which is a national cast system where there's one group of people

69
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.140
who have basic freedoms and rights. And one group of people who do not,

70
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.620
they don't have the freedom to travel.

71
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.660
They don't have the freedom to go to events. Maybe not to work.

72
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.380
Ideas have been floated out about grocery stores,

73
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.490
that that's a national cast system. And also just, uh,

74
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:03.450
you know,

75
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.770
throwing away the idea that you have any type of medical privacy from the

76
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:08.250
government. This is being, uh,

77
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.770
it's being done in collusion between big businesses and governments.

78
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.730
And this is already happening. It's being done in New York city.

79
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.370
It's being done in other countries.

80
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.410
And there were reports in the Washington post, in CNN,

81
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.200
out the Biden administration meeting with these big businesses to say, oh,

82
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:24.521
you know what?

83
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:27.200
It's not really good enough to do a local level or a state level thing.

84
00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.000
We need to have one national standard.

85
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.600
So you're talking about a national cast system.

86
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.840
And if we embrace that, man, I, I,

87
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.190
I don't mean to be hyperbolic, but like, I think this whole thing is. Like,

88
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.990
I really think this whole country, we are not gonna come out of this.

89
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.270
If we embrace the idea of now,

90
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.190
this is an idea straight out of the Chinese social credit system.

91
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.030
This is what they're proposing. We do. By the way,

92
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:56.070
China already has the COVID passport. This is what China does. That's it?

93
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.390
No sense of like, you have a right to do this,

94
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.190
or you have a right to not do that. And come on,

95
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:01.420
you think they're gonna take power.

96
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.380
And then this will only ever be used for the COVID vaccine. Why would.

97
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.700
<v 1>It be? It's also logically,</v>

98
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.660
it doesn't seem to make sense if the vaccine is available to everybody who wants

99
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:15.020
it and everybody who wants it gets vaccinated. Who are we protecting? Yeah.

100
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.620
If these folks are out there that aren't vaccinated that are supposedly these

101
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.300
super spreaders and that's what we're supposed to stop, right?

102
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.170
Idea is that these people aren't vaccinated, they're dangerous. And we have to,

103
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.410
you, you are not being a good citizen because you have been vaccinated.

104
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.690
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna keep you from doing all the things that

105
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:32.390
you want to do,

106
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.450
and we're gonna allow those other people that have been vaccinated to have those

107
00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:35.990
freedoms,

108
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.930
but aren't those people who have been vaccinated have those freedoms aren't

109
00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:42.800
they, they're not vulnerable. Right. Isn't that the idea idea. Yeah. So,

110
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.840
so it doesn't.

111
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.680
<v 0>Matter. It logically it makes no sense. Um, morally it makes no sense,</v>

112
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:54.320
but it is an unbelievable opportunity for the government to really keep

113
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.560
a, a, a serious, you know, level more of control.

114
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.760
But I think's.

115
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.160
<v 1>The Biden administration has rejected this so far. Like there was a,</v>

116
00:06:03.161 --> 00:06:06.560
there was a discussion where they were asked and I think what's her name,

117
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.960
Jen sake. She was saying that they have no plans whatsoever.

118
00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.440
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to do, uh, vaccine passports.

119
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.560
And that this is not something that the Biden administration believes in. Yeah.

120
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.870
So.

121
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.790
<v 0>What happened was there were these reports that were out that said that the</v>

122
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:21.750
Biden administration was consulting with these,

123
00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:24.990
these big businesses on how to do it. There was a big uproar about it.

124
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.870
And then when she was asked, she was like, no, no, no, we're not gonna do that.

125
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.910
And ultimately, I think that's quite possibly what ends up happening.

126
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.390
Like I think oftentimes they put out these feelers mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; to kind

127
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.790
of see what the people are willing to.

128
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.100
<v 1>Like going to war with Syria.</v>

129
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.820
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. It gets a little bit too much pushback. Ah, we're gonna back off.</v>

130
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.220
Right.

131
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.780
Remember when they tried to regulate the internet during the Obama adminis,

132
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.740
the SOPA bill or whatever, they put it out there. Everyone lost their.

133
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.300
They went not yet. Yeah. Not yet. Okay. Not quite ready. Wow. But it's,

134
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:55.300
so that might be the case. And then there's all these other arguments, you know,

135
00:06:55.301 --> 00:06:58.090
like just the practicality of it mean like, look,

136
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.570
if you say you have to show a driver's license before you vote,

137
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.210
people will lose their minds about how this is racist,

138
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.730
because poor people and black people disproportionately tend to not have

139
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.130
driver's licenses. So what is an app on a smartphone? I mean,

140
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.050
how do you think that's gonna work in practice?

141
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.090
If you're saying you need that to do these basic things. Um,

142
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.040
so there's all type types of these problems of how you would implement it,

143
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.920
but it's still worth noting that they floated this out. Yeah.

144
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:29.920
Like there are these people in our government who would go Chinese

145
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.720
fascist on us if they could, if they could.

146
