00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 2>Jamie, I'm gonna send you something is me reacting to him,</v>

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.360
knocking out Volkov. &lt;laugh&gt;. This is one of my favorite,

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.440
one of my favorite clips, because that knockout was so crazy.

5
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.760
We were in the middle. Here it is right here. I'm gonna set it to you right now.

6
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.030
Jamie here. I just, uh, airdropped it to you.

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.790
Wait a minute. How's it not working?

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.550
All right. Is it going through, I've got two. Jamie Vernons here.

9
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.950
You got my computer and phone calls. Okay. I'll try both of them.

10
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.800
You got it. Okay.

11
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.230
So that fight to me was, uh,

12
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.870
a perfect example of one of the reasons why people love you is because at any

13
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:48.990
moment in the fight, yeah. You get end that.

14
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.390
And that was a fight where you were, you were behind on the judge's scorecards.

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.790
And we were just saying, it doesn't matter. Like at any moment,

16
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.790
Derek could knock him out. Like, that's the thing that's exciting about you,

17
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.740
but a UFC, because we go so crazy. The UFC's decided to put these cameras on us.

18
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.020
Gimme some volume on this.

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.650
Look, everybody going crazy. We, I had to get up.

20
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.850
I had to stand up. I couldn't take it.

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.730
<v 0>That was so nuts. My coach, um, my manager,</v>

22
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.010
my manager at home, he fainted &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;

23
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.690
Lou, Lou say fainted. Like he couldn't take it either no more.

24
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.010
So everyone was just so, so pumped about that. And I heard,

25
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.480
or that some police was called because my neighbors, our fans was, um,

26
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.520
just going crazy after the fight. Oh man. Oh, that was.

27
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.600
<v 1>That was wild. That was one of the best come from behind knockouts ever.</v>

28
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.800
But it was, it was wild too, because we just got done saying like,

29
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.000
don't count 'em out. And any moment he could knock 'em out and then boom,

30
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.230
you catch 'em with a big punch and then drop 'em and then boom, put 'em away.

31
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.030
We went.

32
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.030
<v 0>Nuts. I like one of them, my coach said, okay, we got a minute left,</v>

33
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.190
30 seconds left. Then I'm like, okay. Try to gain.

34
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.190
So I got, I have to let everything out. Um,

35
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.310
a lot of my fights, I finished in the last few seconds of the fight.

36
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.620
So I like to wait the last minute or last two minute and it's left to

37
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:28.740
really show what I got left in my tank. So.

38
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.141
<v 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:31.780
that shows your hard work mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; but that you can keep that power

40
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.340
in, in like deep into the fight. That means you did the work in the gym.

41
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.500
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, you still have the, the gas. Yeah. Yeah.

42
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.460
Was that your most satisfying knockout?

43
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.730
<v 0>That was, yeah, the crowd made it real ex satisfying,</v>

44
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.810
cuz the way they reacted, you know, then seeing that one guy that played in,

45
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.690
um, the one movie, um, gro uh,

46
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.600
group BR what movie is that? Gardens gardens outta the galaxy. Oh.

47
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.560
<v 1>Chris Pratt. Yeah.</v>

48
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.840
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. He's a big fan. Seen, seen his reaction.</v>

49
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.000
It was like &lt;laugh&gt; made it all work well.

50
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.040
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. No, that was a big one. That was a big one.</v>

51
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.200
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I wish the fans was here for the Curtis fight.</v>

52
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.880
I'm pretty sure they would've won crazy for that one too. A.

53
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.630
<v 1>Hundred percent. I screamed at my house &lt;laugh&gt; I screamed at my house,</v>

54
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.430
my wife every now and then in a fight, like, you know,

55
00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:25.830
when I'm watching fights at home, I scream. And then my,

56
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:28.990
my wife has to realize I'm watching fights &lt;laugh&gt; cause I'm by myself in the

57
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:33.990
theater go. Wow. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah, that was, that was one that, um, for sure,

58
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:37.590
would've got a giant reaction from the crowd. Yeah. Is it? Yeah.

59
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.580
Is so what is like, do you have a,

60
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.660
a favorite moment as a fighter or do you have, you, you have so many knockouts.

61
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.500
Yeah. You have the most knockouts ever in the heavyweight division. Yeah.

62
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.100
<v 0>It's crazy because I wasn't even really going for that. Um,</v>

63
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.740
my favorite one, it,

64
00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.810
it has to be VO off VO off cuz I was telling my coaches and

65
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.890
my camp before that fights, like I'm fighting a Russian guy.

66
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.570
It'd be cool if I could, um,

67
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.610
get one of those rocket type fights &lt;laugh&gt; and showing up it was a rocket type

68
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:13.570
fight and like so crazy. So crazy.

69
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.250
It ended just like a Rocky movie.

70
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.360
<v 1>Yeah, there it is. Boom, my goodness. That crazy.</v>

71
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.400
<v 0>Then like a few minutes before that he's I hit him and he's saying that his</v>

72
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:28.760
mouthpiece was my mouthpiece. I said, nah, that's not my mouthpiece.

73
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.880
I said he boo. Okay. I guess.

74
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.000
<v 1>Yeah, that, that was pic. That, that K back up to the, the right hand again.</v>

75
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.720
That drops him. That was picture perfect.

76
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.690
There it is. Boom. I mean timing, distance, everything.

77
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:49.050
It was picture. Perfect. And the fact that you did this deep into the fight,

78
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.913
look at this.

79
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.673
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.930
<v 1>Does this feel, does it feel surreal watching yourself?</v>

81
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.290
<v 0>Oh yeah. All the time. All the time.</v>

82
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.640
<v 1>When you watch yourself on television, like what goes through your head?</v>

83
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.560
When you see something like this? I'm like.

84
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.840
<v 0>Man, I don't look that Fanm person &lt;laugh&gt; I don't look fat whenever I watch my</v>

85
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.120
highlight. Like then you see me in person. Like you lost some weight. No,

86
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.960
I ain't losing no weight. That's the TV. It probably was the Fox sports,

87
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.080
Fox sports ESPN. I think I look a little smaller now.

88
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.190
Fox sports cameras make me look fat.

89
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.950
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; I think everybody thinks they look fat when they see themselves on</v>

90
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:30.390
television. I think I look fat when I walk by a mirror &lt;laugh&gt; I'm like,

91
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:34.830
come on really? There's all this. Yeah. But you know,

92
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.070
if you do drop down to, you know, whatever you want to get to to two 40 or two,

93
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.070
maybe, maybe then you can see a little.

94
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.220
<v 0>Six pack. Yeah. Then you know, I would walk around. I walk around with no shirt,</v>

95
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.500
but now I don't like walking around with a shirt,

96
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.260
with no shirt in front of my sons, my boys, they always call me fat.

97
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.060
&lt;laugh&gt; still cause they got six packs.

98
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:57.960
So then like I make it seem like they don't bother me,

99
00:05:57.961 --> 00:06:00.840
but I gonna cry in a room. &lt;laugh&gt;.
