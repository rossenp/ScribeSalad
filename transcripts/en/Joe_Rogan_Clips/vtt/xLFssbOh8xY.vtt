1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>Did this and everybody else is wearing suits and ties.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 1>And I'm.</v>

3
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 0>Like, did they give you grief for dressing like that?</v>

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.150
<v 1>But not to my face, but maybe later it's.</v>

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.650
<v 0>Oregon hillbilly.</v>

6
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.200
<v 1>And, uh, so yeah. I don't know. I don't know why I'm on there. I don't who.</v>

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.480
<v 0>Contacted you? Um.</v>

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.690
<v 1>Sec or the interior department.</v>

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.620
<v 0>So like you're in the middle of a run running up Mount Pisgah. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.780
<v 1>Well, no, no. I got to call Washington DC. I swear to God. And I'm like,</v>

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.793
oh my God.

12
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.630
<v 0>This.</v>

13
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.540
<v 1>Can't be good. Cause it was after. Okay.</v>

14
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:39.150
So Trump put out the tweet and he said something like,

15
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.160
he doesn't see how hunting for elephants is conservation

16
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.930
or, or helps wildlife. It's a, it's a horror show. Doesn't, you know,

17
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.570
elephants or any other animals, something like that. And I was like,

18
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.180
what in the hell is that? What are we talking about?

19
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.560
No elephants talk about elephants. That's fine. Whatever. But he said,

20
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.380
or any other animal. So I took that tweet.

21
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.990
I posted it and addressed it.

22
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.560
And I don't know if he saw it. I don't really know.

23
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:11.160
But soon after that I got a call for this thing. And so,

24
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.380
cause I was, you know,

25
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:17.610
I know just from Huntington in Africa and how it works and um,

26
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.830
the hunting is necessary over there. If the animals are going to survive, if.

27
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.030
<v 0>Complicated story, complicated situation, but people, uh,</v>

28
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.860
people don't want to hear that now.

29
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.240
<v 1>So here's an example of in Tanzania, there was a,</v>

30
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.920
the largest hunting concession. And I'm trying to think how big it was.

31
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.860
I can't put the number on how big it was,

32
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.830
but they'd been in business for 40 years. So a hunting concession is,

33
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.030
is they have, you know,

34
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.500
hunters from usually America go over there.

35
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.120
They pay for the,

36
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.480
for the access to the land and they pay for the right to hunt these animals.

37
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.290
So this place had been in business for 40 years. Um,

38
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.910
they went out of business because of this import ban Obama put an import ban

39
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.400
on, uh, the ivory of elephants coming back as trophies.

40
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.563
But also like.

41
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.360
<v 0>Yeah, the lion thing was right after Cecil,</v>

42
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.120
the lion and it was done as a political measure.

43
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.130
<v 1>Right? So he put a ban on,</v>

44
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.030
you can go over there and hunt them still because you know, we're from America.

45
00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:25.920
We can't say what's legal in Africa, but he can say what he did was say,

46
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.590
well, you can hunt them, whatever. Cause they can't control that,

47
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:29.640
but you can't bring them home.

48
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.590
So nobody's going to go and spend 75,000 kill an elephant or 50,000 to kill a

49
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:39.300
lion if they can't bring it home. Right. So that basically shut down hunting.

50
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.400
And um, um,

51
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.960
this outfit in Tanzania that had business business for 40 years,

52
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.080
they closed, they went out of business about,

53
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.810
I think it was about two months ago now.

54
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.560
And what happens is when they don't have a concession,

55
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:57.210
they can't pay for that land.

56
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.260
It is given back the people and for us here, there'll be like, oh,

57
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.810
that's great. You gave the land back to the people. No,

58
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.810
it's not good to give the land back to the people there because people can't do

59
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.210
anything. They don't have any money. They don't just like,

60
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.750
so what happens is a poachers. As soon as the hunting concession moves out,

61
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.750
poachers, move in and kill every animal.

62
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.370
The only reason the animals that were being protected in that hunting concession

63
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.450
was because there was hunting in there. These, this outfit would spin.

64
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.520
I think in the last three years they spent over $2 million

65
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.890
on anti-poaching efforts. So $2 million to protect basically their investment,

66
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:39.490
which is those animals that were in there. Yeah. They'd kill a couple because,

67
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.700
because um, elephants were haunted and they ran the HODs and,

68
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.130
and probably lions, but by and large,

69
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:47.650
they're protecting the majority of the herd.

70
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.690
<v 0>Well, give me the, give me those numbers again, because you were,</v>

71
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.450
you were giving me the numbers on elephants legally and illegally killed.

72
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.560
<v 1>Right? So, so,</v>

73
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.130
and I asked this back at our first international wildlife conservation council

74
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.660
meeting and this, you know,

75
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.100
Peter was there and all these animal rights activists, um,

76
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.760
I don't want to say psychos, that could be disrespectful, but anyway,

77
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.650
these extremists were there.

78
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.100
And so it was kind of heated in some point some cases.

79
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.810
But I did ask this question,

80
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:17.500
how many elephants are killed legally in Africa each year?

81
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.090
And the number is about 400, 400 to kill legally.

82
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.310
<v 0>The entire continent of Africa.</v>

83
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.290
So big that you can get America, the United States of America.

84
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.980
You can also get all the European countries. You could fit a lot of in Africa.

85
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.830
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And so there's some,</v>

86
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.040
there's some areas where you're not going to hunt elephants because there's not,

87
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.730
there's not enough. Or, um, they don't live there,

88
00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.250
but there's some areas where there's too many elephants. It's just, yeah.

89
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.540
<v 0>Yeah. That's, what's confusing to people.</v>

90
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:50.560
People hear elephants are going extinct. Well, yeah, they are in some places.

91
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:54.310
Yeah. And then another places. But the problem is with local farmers,

92
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.390
they have these plots of land and the elephants come in and eat everything and

93
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.790
destroy their land and they can't do anything about it.

94
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.950
And what are you going to do this? How the, how big is an elephant?

95
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.470
How many thousands of pounds, 10,000 pounds or some. I.

96
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:06.550
<v 1>Don't know. They're huge.</v>

97
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.170
<v 0>A huge, they don't do a thing.</v>

98
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.900
<v 1>I care about elephants. They are people that they're like,</v>

99
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:14.140
the elephant is ruining my crop. Yeah. That's what I need to eat.

100
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.390
I'm going to kill the elephant's gonna lay there and rot.

101
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.680
<v 0>These, these people are starving. I mean, they it's,</v>

102
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.930
there's a food chain going on there.

103
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:27.820
And humans here where we are we're we're so far above the food chain that

104
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:32.050
we're like sitting in a platform, looking down, watching it. They're there.

105
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.650
<v 1>They're ground level. They'll in there. It's it's the whole,</v>

106
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.310
it's a whole analogy of you. Can't have first-world world.

107
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.040
People solving third world problems, you know? And it's just, we, we,

108
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.550
people here have all the answers. It's like, you have everything you want.

109
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.200
You have, you live in excess. You're fat. You have, you throw food away.

110
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.650
What are you talking about? You have no idea what it's like in Africa.

111
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.660
So there 400 elephants are killed.

112
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.500
Legally 30,000 are poached a year 30,000.

113
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.670
And the reason that's happening is because the hunting had to move out.

114
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:12.260
The hunting closed down or hunting is what pays for the anti-poaching efforts.

115
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.990
But when hunting money, isn't there,

116
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.580
the poachers run rampant 30,000 elephants. That's why they are devastated.

117
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:20.990
<v 0>Such a, not hunting.</v>

118
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.930
It's such a hard thing for people to swallow because what I,

119
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.930
this is from the point of view of someone who loves wildlife.

120
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.280
I think this is what people want.

121
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.200
What they want is the humans to leave the animals alone and the animals to

122
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:35.270
live in this state of bliss,

123
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.490
where they exist perfectly in the balance of nature of predator and prey

124
00:06:40.491 --> 00:06:44.960
all plays out in a natural way without people going over there and shooting

125
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:48.020
elephants than sticking their tusks on their wall. Yeah. I mean,

126
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.400
we've all seen those pictures of these giant fat, holding a rifle,

127
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:55.970
standing over a lion and you're like, this just looks wrong.

128
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.350
It looks like American gluttony makes its way over to Africa.

129
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.020
And some guy shoots a line with a rifle.

130
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.920
Now he's standing on its head and he's going to put it on his wall in his fat

131
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.650
house somewhere. That bothers people. I.

132
00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:13.460
<v 1>Get it too. I mean, I'm not arguing that.</v>

133
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.330
<v 0>You got to fix Africa first and you, you're not trying.</v>

134
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.500
So this idea that if you just leave all those animals alone and stop hunting

135
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:23.900
them, everything's going to be fine. No, they're going to be wiped out.

136
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.680
You got to,

137
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.940
people have to look at it pragmatically first and then idealistically,

138
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.350
because pragmatically,

139
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.730
you have to understand that these animals 20 years ago were on the verge of

140
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:37.730
extinction. So many different antelopes, so many different, uh,

141
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.670
what we would call game animals, animals that people eat.

142
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.230
We're on the verge of extinction until they started instituting these big

143
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.190
hunting concessions.

144
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:50.660
And having people come in from Europe and America and hunting in Africa,

145
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.430
then the community started to prosper because if someone's paying, you know,

146
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:59.780
I don't know how much is it to shoot like a Neil guy or something like that. Um,

147
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.470
maybe 1500. So think of how many of those things get shot.

148
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:05.690
And some of that money goes to the ranch.

149
00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:08.060
Some of that money goes to the professional hunting guys.

150
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:09.890
Anti-poaching conservation efforts.

151
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.070
And then you have unprecedented numbers.

152
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.070
There's more of those animals today than there have been in decades.

153
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.770
And it's all because people put value.

154
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.510
<v 1>Yeah. It's all about the animals have to have value and people say, no, well,</v>

155
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.210
the animal has value being alive. It's like, okay.

156
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.880
<v 0>It does to you, it does to you. If you don't live over there,</v>

157
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:30.920
if you're not pouring your children, aren't starving to death.

158
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:36.320
<v 1>A picture of an, of a line is amazing. Okay. And that animal is beautiful.</v>

159
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:38.090
There's value in it being alive,

160
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.920
but he got to understand those people need to eat. They need to work.

161
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:45.680
So if they're not, we're working for the hunting concession.

162
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.450
If the hunting concession goes out of business,

163
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:51.620
like the largest one in Tanzania did after 40 years, what are they going to do?

164
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.530
They can't go get a job at the mill. You know what I mean? There's no,

165
00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.150
there's nothing. There's not industry over there. So what happens is,

166
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.440
as they w some of those people, and I don't know for a fact, but I would,

167
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.650
I'm going to make an educated guess if they would go from working as

168
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.290
anti-poaching officers or, or,

169
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.130
or helping keep the animals alive is as part of the anti-poaching program,

170
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.870
straight to poaching.

171
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.560
<v 0>Yeah. Well, that that's happened back and forth both ways, right?</v>

172
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.580
Former poachers became anti-poaching officers when the opportunity to practice.

173
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.490
<v 1>And they were great ones because they knew how, how it worked.</v>

174
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:26.580
And they knew where the weaknesses were and that saved animals.

175
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:31.950
But it's just like, it's, it's sad because that, you know,

176
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.570
that last two months,

177
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:37.830
without that hunting concession there without the anti-poaching, um,

178
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.220
program in place, I guarantee it's been a slaughter.

179
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:45.600
The animals that were being protected are now just being slaughtered by police.

180
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.390
<v 0>And again, the difference between looking at things,</v>

181
00:09:48.391 --> 00:09:51.390
pragmatically and looking at things, idealistically, idealistically,

182
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:55.590
we would like all those people in Africa to have plenty of food and plenty of

183
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:58.650
opportunity for employment and plenty of things to do with their life.

184
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.460
But they don't, you know, and the,

185
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:05.880
the situation that had emerged with these hunting concessions is

186
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:08.370
superior to the situation that's in place now.

187
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.430
And it's also superior for the animals themselves,

188
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:16.140
including the lions in Zimbabwe, they had to kill, look this up, Jamie,

189
00:10:16.141 --> 00:10:18.720
see if you could, because they had to call,

190
00:10:18.721 --> 00:10:22.590
I think it was something along the lines of 200 lions recently,

191
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.880
because they had decimated the undulate population because they weren't kept in

192
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:30.030
check. Right? Because the Angela, the way these,

193
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.770
the balance of nature works out is you have to have a balance between predator

194
00:10:34.771 --> 00:10:38.940
and prey. The only way to keep the balance of predator as humans. That's it?

195
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.760
The only thing that exists unless they keep it. Yeah. Symbolic way.

196
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.900
Wild drive reserve will call 200 lines to control a population.

197
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:49.500
Explosion claiming hunters have been scared off by the outcry over Cecil.

198
00:10:49.501 --> 00:10:50.280
The lion.

199
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:54.540
The whole thing is so weird because what people just jump on it.

200
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:58.440
You know that you watched the lion king. Oh, Simba. No, don't kill Simba. And,

201
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.650
oh, see, so he's got a name and all this craziness,

202
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.570
it got to such a weird point where there was this discussion about

203
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:11.370
Cecil's brother that Cecil's brother got killed Jericho. And they're like,

204
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.020
oh my God, they killed Jericho.

205
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:16.110
And then people were relieved because they found it.

206
00:11:16.111 --> 00:11:20.100
It was a different line and it wasn't Cecil's brother Jericho. So this is like,

207
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:21.840
they're watching a reality show.

208
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:25.380
It's like keeping up with the Kardashians in Africa. Like when you give a,

209
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.420
what the name of the Al the African lion is,

210
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.470
you're crazy. It's not Jericho. Oh, it's it's, it's Michael, the lion.

211
00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:37.320
So it's okay. That's crazy. He's still a lion,

212
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.010
but this shows you this first world view of,

213
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.530
of this wildlife situation,

214
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:46.530
that is not ideal by any stretch of the imagination. Right?

215
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:49.020
<v 1>I think part of it, like with that, the whole Cecil Lyon thing,</v>

216
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:52.320
it gave people a purpose. It's like, oh, I have something to stand for.

217
00:11:52.321 --> 00:11:53.770
I have a now.

218
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.940
And that's where I know people are struggling out there finding what's my

219
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:01.510
purpose. What am I doing? You know, and they're spinning their wheels.

220
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:03.340
They don't, I don't know what they do,

221
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.880
but that gave them something to fight for. And it wasn't right.

222
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.650
It didn't help anything. It hurt.

223
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.720
Those 200 lions could have been $50,000 each to a hunter,

224
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:17.950
$10 million went to Zimbabwe,

225
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.160
stayed there, or, or at least employed people. Um, but no, they,

226
00:12:23.161 --> 00:12:25.510
they were killed in. There was no game.

227
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.220
<v 0>It still sucks all across the board. It sucks. The whole situation sucks.</v>

228
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:35.020
These weird high fence operations, where they let lions loose,

229
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:36.610
and then they let them out of the cage.

230
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:39.910
And then people show up that day and the lines on, know what the go on.

231
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:43.210
And they shoot this line and then stand up. That sucks too. Yeah.

232
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:48.310
It's like that. The whole thing is weird. It's it's not look wildlife in Africa.

233
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.630
And the high fence wildlife is not ideal by any stretch of the imagination and

234
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.060
these animals that were going extinct.

235
00:12:55.061 --> 00:12:59.620
And now aren't because people were hunting them. It's strange.

236
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:01.810
That's a strange balance like that.

237
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.780
The only reason they exist is so people can come over there and shoot them.

238
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.530
Like, I don't, I don't want that. I mean, I would like them to just exist.

239
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.210
<v 1>Well, the thing. Yeah.</v>

240
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.710
But people aren't going to contribute that money to pay for the anti-poaching

241
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.950
just to go take a picture. It's like, if you just.

242
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.720
<v 0>Can happen, if you go to the Missouri breaks or something like that,</v>

243
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:24.670
and you go hunting mule deer, like those, that's what I like.

244
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.480
I like animals that exist because they they're, they're they're,

245
00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:30.130
this is their spot. This is where they are. Like,

246
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:34.270
if you go to the Missouri breaks and you go up into those,

247
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.940
those Hills and look for, for mule deer,

248
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.760
those have been there for thousands of years. I mean,

249
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:44.590
they have found skulls of deer of white tail deer in

250
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:47.200
Florida that are 2 million years old.

251
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.790
They're the exact same animal 2 million years ago. So for millions of years,

252
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.940
longer than there have been human beings,

253
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.730
those things have been in that form,

254
00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.330
running around north America and wherever the they can. That's what I like.

255
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.590
<v 1>I like that too.</v>

256
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:06.160
But don't forget that hunting has played a part in keeping those numbers

257
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:09.340
healthy, the deer and the there's more deer.

258
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.140
There's no big game animal in north,

259
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.890
the big game animals and north American now than there were a hundred years ago.

260
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.680
And that's through hunting and conservation.

261
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:23.050
<v 0>That is true. But it's also because 150 years ago, people went ham,</v>

262
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.880
wiped out. Most of them,

263
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.780
it was real bad when they were doing market hunting before refrigeration.

264
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:29.650
Exactly.

265
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.080
<v 1>But, but we've learned from that, we learned, okay, this is how,</v>

266
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.440
this is how we need to do it. This is how hunting fits in this equation.

267
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.510
And that's where, you know,

268
00:14:37.511 --> 00:14:40.300
we talked about the inner national wildlife conservation council.

269
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.980
That's given me a way in to talk about a bunch of other things too.

270
00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.960
So one of those, and we talk about animals in north America is, uh, Ryan Zinky,

271
00:14:49.961 --> 00:14:54.860
who's the secretary of interior. He created this new, I guess it's a bill.

272
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:58.280
I'm not like this political expert. I'm a bow hunter, right.

273
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.320
I wear a flannel shirt and baseball hat, but he did create this,

274
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.000
uh, um, I'm going to call it a bill, but that protects the,

275
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.620
the winter that we call them wildlife corridor.

276
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:16.460
So it's where the animals can go from the summer summer range to the winter

277
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:19.130
range, where there's not going to be development there.

278
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.220
So he created that because that's how those animals like in Montana,

279
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:27.140
make it through the winter. If, if they're up in the summer, um,

280
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.920
they make it through, um, getting into fall.

281
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.330
And then all of a sudden winter hits,

282
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:36.620
they have to have a way down into the low country to where they can,

283
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:41.210
their winter migration to where they can survive the snow and where they can

284
00:15:41.211 --> 00:15:44.330
make down. And there's good feed down there. If there's gas,

285
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.430
rigs are middle mineral extraction efforts going on that impede

286
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:52.730
that then they might get hung up up there and get stuck in the snow and die.

287
00:15:52.731 --> 00:15:57.110
So he realizes that he realized the need for that. And he created this,

288
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.250
this new program.

289
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.860
That's going to make sure that there's no development in there.

290
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:02.990
It keeps those corridors open. And that's,

291
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.890
that's why our numbers do so well is because there's people like that with the

292
00:16:06.891 --> 00:16:09.200
vision on keeping our animals healthy.
