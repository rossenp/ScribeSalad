1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>Comfort oriented and will take you away from your responsibilities and that's</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.620
what it will become. But if you decide like Terence McKenna did that,

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.910
it's an intellectual catalyst that it will facilitate your ability to read and

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.060
learn and think and write, then it will become that as well.

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.940
<v 1>Yeah, it's, it's a weird one, right?</v>

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.590
Because people that are people that take it that are prone to

7
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:23.490
paranoia,

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.240
or that are dealing with like some difficult issues in their life right now that

9
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:31.320
they're perhaps trying to avoid, it becomes an uncomfortable experience,

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.510
whereas people that are happy and having a good time and in a good

11
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:40.290
place, the marijuana will sort of enhance that. I'll give you this loving,

12
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:42.240
warm feeling of,

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.950
of comfort and of like sort of acceptance of your existence and it's going to be

14
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:47.784
okay.

15
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.840
<v 0>Right. But I think even the paranoia is like a sort of</v>

16
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.800
a sort of, um, meme.

17
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:59.970
You could say a sort of vestige of this propaganda that makes people afraid in

18
00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:02.160
the same idea. Vein is the bad trip.

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.630
I think the concept of a bad trip is a very damaging concept because,

20
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.950
and I know from personal experience,

21
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:11.880
I never really used psychedelics in high school with the exception of salvia.

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.930
Um, because I was terrified of a bad trip. I talked to friends,

23
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:20.070
who'd describe bad trips and they'd say, oh, it's a, it's a bad, it's bad trip.

24
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.120
It's really bad. It's scary. And I would think, oh, that's terrible. I could,

25
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.650
I would never want a bad trip.

26
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.950
I'm never going to touch these things because a bad trip would be too much for

27
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.784
me to tolerate.

28
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.020
And then I started using psychedelics and I realized there's no such thing as a

29
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:38.370
bad trip, any more than there's a bad meal or a bad relationship or a bad day.

30
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.580
I mean, having an occasional bad thing in life,

31
00:01:41.581 --> 00:01:45.060
doesn't stop you from doing things like eating or having relationships or living

32
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.190
typically. So what do you mean.

33
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.860
<v 1>Are you saying there's no such thing as a bad trip.</v>

34
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.750
You're saying there's no such thing as a bad meal.

35
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.540
<v 0>I'm saying that there is such thing as a bad meal, but okay.</v>

36
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.490
But it wouldn't prevent you from tripping. And I think that even the bad,

37
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.370
or wouldn't bring you from eating rather, sorry about that. But, uh,

38
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.050
but I think even these bad trips,

39
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.590
although they can be difficult are beneficial and our learning experience in the

40
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:11.230
same way that a bad meal could be. You learn not to go to that restaurant,

41
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:13.810
or maybe you learn something about what makes you sick or what to be careful of

42
00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:14.920
in the future. You know,

43
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:19.450
if you are approaching life from a non fearful perspective where your intention

44
00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:20.284
is to learn,

45
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.300
then you can extract benefit from almost any experience and these

46
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.450
difficult psychedelic experiences I genuinely believe.

47
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:31.900
And this is what is maybe the hardest thing to communicate about psychedelics is

48
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.270
that it's the difficult ones that are often the best.

49
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.840
Those are the ones that really teach you something.

50
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:41.050
And when you're trying to talk about psychedelics with people,

51
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:44.020
who've never used them. It's not a great selling point to say, oh, you know,

52
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:46.540
the best thing that can happen is you're going to think you're going to die.

53
00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.270
But that is arguably the best thing that can happen is to think that you're

54
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:56.650
going to die because that's a confrontation with the overarching fear,

55
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:59.980
the fear that generates all other fears. And if you that fear,

56
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.280
then your life will almost certainly improve.

57
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.040
<v 1>What is one thing that's sort of genuine,</v>

58
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.960
genuinely universally accepted as a beneficial experience is a near

59
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.920
death experience,

60
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.120
sort of universally accepted as a transformative moment in people's lives.

61
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.170
I had this near death experience and I realized, wow, I got to get my together.

62
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.470
After that heart attack, I realized that life is a gift.

63
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.360
And I changed the way I think about things.

64
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.180
And I started calling people that I loved and telling them that I loved them.

65
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.480
This is the same. You can get a near death experience from cannabis.

66
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:35.620
You just don't ever die, but you really do. I mean,

67
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:39.010
it's the death of so many perceptions and so many things about your life,

68
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.350
especially from edible cannabis,

69
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:45.880
which I think is probably one of the least understood and most

70
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.090
potent things that people are consuming on a daily basis. I,

71
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.980
I can't tell you how many times I've given someone edible marijuana and they're

72
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.180
convinced that it's been laced with something awful and that they're going to

73
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.180
die, but then afterwards they come out of it and they're like,

74
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:03.730
I got some work to do.

75
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.240
The only way I would disagree with you is people that are prone to psychotic

76
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:14.110
breaks. Yeah. Yeah, because that, there, there is an absolute,

77
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:18.580
genuine connection between people who have a slippery hold on

78
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:23.560
reality and some experiences with psychedelics that lead them down a

79
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.160
bad road.

80
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.750
<v 0>That's true. Um, it can, it's a stressor and like all stressors,</v>

81
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.110
it can precipitate a psychotic break. Uh,

82
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:36.730
they've done pretty large scale epidemiological analysis of psychedelic drug

83
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.900
users versus the non psychedelic drug using population and the incidence of

84
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.580
mental illness isn't any higher.

85
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.540
So I don't think that you can argue that psychedelics cause mental illness,

86
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:49.600
but you can, and in some measures,

87
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:52.330
it seems to actually reduce it in terms of things like alcoholism,

88
00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.670
substance abuse disorders. But, um,

89
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.310
but it can be a stressor that would precipitate such an episode in a susceptible

90
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:00.731
individual.

91
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:05.590
And I had a very traumatic and formative experience myself for my best friend

92
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.620
had a psychotic break while I was with him tripping.

93
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:12.100
So I've seen this firsthand. I know exactly what it looks like. Yeah.

94
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.460
<v 1>I've had friends have real bad experiences too,</v>

95
00:05:15.461 --> 00:05:18.910
where they're screaming and yelling and then disassociative,

96
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:23.500
and then afterwards become very strange and have a really hard time with reality

97
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:24.520
for a bit. Yeah.

98
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.490
I've never seen someone have a complete psychotic break from it.

99
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.340
<v 0>That he never recovered. Never, he never recovered.</v>

100
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:32.320
He was my best friend at the time and he never.

101
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.310
<v 1>So he was fine before the psychedelics. Yes, Jesus Christ.</v>

102
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.230
<v 0>But again, you know, it's and that happened.</v>

103
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.940
<v 1>Early. So now he's still.</v>

104
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.140
<v 0>Yes, Dan, but again, you know,</v>

105
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.310
I typically don't tell that story in public because it's,

106
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.540
it could be misinterpreted as a scare story. You know, I don't,

107
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.030
it's impossible to prove the counterfactual,

108
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.010
would it have happened without psychedelics? Almost certainly.

109
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.760
I can't say all I know is that he took a very high dose of, uh,

110
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.150
a Silicon Ester and, um, had this episode,

111
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.480
he was hospitalized and he was not the same afterwards.

112
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.440
So I'm aware that this is, uh, uh, something that happens,

113
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:19.010
but it also typically happens in the early twenties, late teens,

114
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:22.880
the same time that people typically have psychotic breaks and develop

115
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.780
schizophrenia.

116
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.120
<v 1>Yeah. The instances of schizophrenia in people who use cannabis are</v>

117
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.210
cannabis in particular, but I don't know about other psychedelics,

118
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:33.650
but I would imagine they're very similar.

119
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.180
They're exactly the same as the incidences of schizophrenia and

120
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.730
non-music populations. It's like 1%,

121
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.570
1% across the board seem to have issues with schizophrenia.

122
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.220
And the real question is how many of those people could,

123
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.070
I mean, is it avoidable?

124
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:56.660
Like if your friend had never done that and instead had, you know,

125
00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:59.720
become a marathon runner or something and, you know,

126
00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:02.210
found some other outlets for his energy,

127
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.660
would he have never gone down that road? We don't know. It's impossible.

128
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.380
It's impossible. So I think it's very important to talk about that though.

129
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.630
And with further research, perhaps we could isolate genes, you know,

130
00:07:14.631 --> 00:07:17.750
like they have four CTE now they have, um,

131
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.370
they can do an analysis of your genes and then determine whether or not

132
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:26.120
something like football would be a dangerous path for you because you have, uh,

133
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:28.940
a higher probability of developing CTE.

134
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.770
It would be wonderful if they figured out a way to do that with psilocybin or

135
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.570
with cannabis or with anything else and be able to recognize the potential

136
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.890
links to psychotic breaks and to, you know,

137
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.400
a host of different mental disorders that could possibly be triggered by high

138
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:47.234
doses.

139
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:52.340
<v 0>Yes. I mean, this is one of so many things that needs to be done and that's,</v>

140
00:07:52.341 --> 00:07:53.120
you know,

141
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.180
everyone's very excited about all of this clinical research that's happening

142
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:57.920
right now. I'm excited about it as well,

143
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:02.870
but on one level it is very politically oriented research. You know,

144
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.141
the,

145
00:08:03.141 --> 00:08:06.980
the things that they're looking at have actually typically been done before,

146
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:07.814
not all of it,

147
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.410
but the aim is to firmly establish these things that have been known for a long

148
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.750
time siliciden occasions,

149
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:19.250
mystical type experience or MDM is useful for treating

150
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:22.340
PTSD or psilocybin has an anti addictive effect.

151
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.000
These are things that people have known for a little while,

152
00:08:26.001 --> 00:08:27.350
but now it's about proving it,

153
00:08:27.351 --> 00:08:32.300
but I'm really looking forward to getting deeper into these serious questions

154
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.640
about, you know,

155
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:39.410
exactly how these drugs interact with various subtypes of serotonin receptors.

156
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:42.650
Because I think that they're going to be very important tools for understanding

157
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:44.630
consciousness as a whole.

158
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.550
<v 1>Yeah. It would also be interesting knowing how they react to different diets.</v>

159
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:54.140
You know, when people are, uh, you know,

160
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:57.780
when you're eating certain types of foods that are bad for your body,

161
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.500
I would really be curious to see what kind of effect that has. I mean, when,

162
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.090
when you have real large-scale research that goes over

163
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.990
really important variables in terms of acumen health.

164
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.100
And then you add in these different substances,
