00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Did you hear about, um,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.950
I read an article about how somebody was like,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.870
I know I'm supposed to have a hand here, but it feels so foreign that,

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.410
and there's been multiple recorded cases of this where they will shove their

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.370
hand in dry ice so that they can get an amputated so that afterwards they can

6
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:22.800
say, look, I'm free. I finally feel normal. It's like you just,

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.750
and they say that to them.

8
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:27.720
It feels like if I had a third hand just growing out of here,

9
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.030
I'd feel like that doesn't belong. Right.

10
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.360
There are some people where they feel like their hand doesn't belong.

11
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.460
And what that shows is like the variation in human psychology is so

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.240
broad. That it's scary because when you really digest that, that exists,

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.040
you also can understand how well there's monsters out there to want to massacre

14
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:50.160
people. And they dream about that. And that's, that's how they get their rocks.

15
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600
<v 1>Off a human, the human mind, very, so much.</v>

16
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.120
There's so many different paths that thoughts can go down.

17
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.990
And there's so many different, weird pathologies that,

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.690
that the mind is capable of.

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.740
But the idea that you would think that you're supposed to be handicapped and

20
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:10.160
you're not handicapped. So you want to chop off a foot or something like that.

21
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.830
It's really, I mean, it's not common. I shouldn't say it's common, but it's,

22
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:16.850
it's, it's definitely documented.

23
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.370
<v 0>So let me ask you, what's your take on, um,</v>

24
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.490
if somebody is transgender and they want the surgery

25
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.830
and let's say they're either in the military or they're in prison or something

26
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:31.664
like that.

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.870
Is that something that you think should be provided for them or no?

28
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.103
<v 2>Um, Hmm.</v>

29
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.570
<v 1>That's a good question. I haven't really thought about it too much.</v>

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.633
I don't think so.

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.900
I don't think that that's an elective surgery and people would say, no,

32
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:49.010
it's not elective surgery,

33
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.150
but you think that other people should pay for that boy? I don't know.

34
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.170
I don't know what it is. I don't have it. Okay.

35
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:00.920
So if I was going to say, I know why people are transgender,

36
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.560
they're transgender because of body dysmorphia,

37
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.970
they're transgender because of gender dysmorphia. They're,

38
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:08.690
they're transgender because of this, because of that, because of abuse,

39
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.790
because of, you know, they're, they're, uh, easily susceptible to suggestion.

40
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.030
I would just be talking about in my. I don't really know.

41
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.440
I would imagine though,

42
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:22.910
that there is a broad spectrum of reasons why someone becomes transgender.

43
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.680
Some of them being that they literally have the wrong programming in their

44
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:30.490
brain. Some of them being that they, I mean,

45
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:34.040
they could have thought that they were wood elf. I mean, or they that's,

46
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:38.660
the furry is the weird. Oh, that's weird. But ferry. Two's like,

47
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.400
I've talked to some furries cause we were kind of.

48
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.100
<v 0>I'm sorry. I'm thinking of other kids. That's the. Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.870
<v 1>The other kid's is nuts,</v>

50
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.200
but there's also people that identify with being a six year old girl. I mean,

51
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.770
there's been cases where people identify as being much younger than they are and

52
00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.080
they think they should be able to have sex with young kids. So.

53
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.980
<v 0>I feel like so on the transgender one, I feel like for a very long time,</v>

54
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.890
I don't think I it at all.

55
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.170
And then I think I finally got it when it was explained to

56
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:09.460
me like, okay, imagine that you, as a straight, you know,

57
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:12.680
cis-gender male, don't use that term. Whatever it is.

58
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.720
<v 1>Give it power. Don't do it. Okay. As a child.</v>

59
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.000
<v 0>Let's say I walk outside and I'm forced.</v>

60
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:22.140
Every time I go outside to wear a wig and lipstick and high heels and a dress,

61
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.220
and I'd be mortified because this is not who the I am and why am I wearing this?

62
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.660
Right. So if you think the first point you made, which is, Hey,

63
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:33.360
maybe they were just born with the wrong programming that they're born,

64
00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:36.360
biologically male, but they're really feel like they're a woman or vice versa.

65
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.340
So if that's the case and it's basically like torture for them to not be the

66
00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:43.740
other thing. Well, then I kind of understand that.

67
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.820
And I'm in favor of them being able to get that surgery where they lose me,

68
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.080
not transgender people, but where I'm I get lost in this whole conversation is,

69
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.560
uh, like the gender fluidity one, like I was a male.

70
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.870
Now I'm a woman and now I'm a man again. And then I'm a woman again.

71
00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:00.390
And then I'm a man again, I'm just idiot. Yeah.

72
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.150
That's the thing is like a person at a certain point,

73
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.550
there are things that are real and there are things that are not real.

74
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.620
And I feel like it delegitimizes the ones that are real when you go too

75
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:13.890
goofy and too far, and you try to pretend like gender fluidity is a thing. Well,

76
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:14.230
isn't it.

77
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.240
<v 1>And what we were talking about earlier,</v>

78
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:19.510
when we're talking about left-wing people versus right-wing people that you in,

79
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.120
in the term, left-wing people,

80
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:24.330
anybody can join and you're going to get people like the green haired people

81
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.550
that were disrupting their hiring speech, because she was saying,

82
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.900
there's a difference between men and women. You're going to get those nutty.

83
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.290
And then you're going to get people that are just reasonable people that have

84
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:37.590
happened to be progressive. You're going to get that with gender fluidity.

85
00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:39.780
You're going to get that with people that are transgender.

86
00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.180
You're going to get that with people that are, you know,

87
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.360
you're just going to get a wide variety.

88
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.420
It's very difficult to nail things down, decide.

89
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.190
<v 0>But for like,</v>

90
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.100
for everybody who looks at that and then gets turned off to that and says,

91
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:53.730
you know what,

92
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.220
I'm aligned more with the right wing because of that culture stuff.

93
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.850
Like I get that feeling over the, the culture issues. But again,

94
00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:01.650
the point that I would make to them is just,

95
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:05.820
don't forget that when I talk about politics and when I talk about where I fall

96
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.250
on the political spectrum, to me, I break it down toward,

97
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.900
on policy and where I fall on the policy issues and what we should implement in

98
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:15.690
order to fix the country. And on those issues,

99
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.500
like we were talking about earlier, um, pretty reliably left wing,

100
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.560
and the poll showed that the American people actually lean in that direction.

101
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.180
Right. So if you focus on those issues, the economic issues,

102
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:31.320
the substantive issues, that change people's lives, then, um, you know,

103
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.850
I think that one can look at the culture issues as almost like a diversion,

104
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:40.830
because it really is a gateway to other ideas that I

105
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:41.730
think are terrible.

106
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.530
So I think the idea of people on the left calling out that

107
00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:50.670
goofiness is a good thing so that you can redirect them and be like, well,

108
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:52.770
this is what I actually stand for.

109
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:56.160
This is what people who are on the left and want to improve people's lives

110
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.130
really want to fight for.

111
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>Yeah. W w I was talking to Douglas Murray about this yesterday,</v>

112
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.590
and there's just this thing where everyone was forced to say that Caitlyn Jenner

113
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.290
is beautiful. Like you couldn't just accept that she was a woman.

114
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.930
You were forced to say that she was beautiful and then she's a hero.

115
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.920
<v 0>And that's where you get the gateway to the right, because people go,</v>

116
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:16.600
if you're going to get, that's what you're going to tell me,

117
00:06:16.601 --> 00:06:20.140
represents the left, then go yourself. Because you're just not being,

118
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.860
you're not telling the truth. You're not. So, and it's, I don't,

119
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.060
I hate the thing where it's like,

120
00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:29.770
we have to care more about feelings than what's accurate, right?

121
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.930
So I don't know why there needs to be a giant wave on the

122
00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:38.590
left of the take no approach to stuff.

123
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.730
<v 1>When it comes to the transgender thing too, they're there,</v>

124
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.800
you need to be open to all avenues of this

125
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.400
discussion. And one thing that I think we need to be open to,

126
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:56.020
we need to think very carefully about why it is that

127
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:57.940
someone needs surgery to be themselves.

128
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.300
Why it is that someone needs exogenous hormones, that,

129
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.630
that aren't native to their biology to be themselves.

130
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.840
Like someone who wants to take estrogen is born a male. Someone who,

131
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.700
if you feel that you're a woman or you feel that you're in the wrong body,

132
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.900
does it make sense that nature wants you to get

133
00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:20.530
surgery?

134
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.520
Does it make sense that nature wants you to take hormones that don't exist in

135
00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:26.230
your body? I mean, sh is, this is a,

136
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.460
this is a rational area of contention and discussion.

137
00:07:30.461 --> 00:07:33.280
This is something that people should talk about. Like when you say,

138
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.260
if someone is forced to wear lipstick and high heels and makeup and walking down

139
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:41.050
the street, but that's not who you are. Wouldn't that frustrate you. Yes,

140
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:41.740
it would.

141
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.570
But it doesn't necessarily conversely work where you are walking down the

142
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:48.550
street without lipstick and high heels and makeup.

143
00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:50.410
And you saying that's what I'm supposed to have. Well, no,

144
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:52.000
because that's not real.

145
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.600
Like lipstick is something you choose to apply high heels or something you

146
00:07:55.601 --> 00:08:00.100
choose to wear. It's not, no one's forcing you to not have those things on.

147
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.790
So you saying that those things are what you really are. Well, no,

148
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:08.410
you're adding those things to you. What you really are is you no makeup naked,

149
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.590
wake up in the morning, take off your clothes. That's where the you really are.

150
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.550
If you say that you should have the right to wear makeup and the right to wear

151
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.250
lip, of course, she had the right to get your face tattooed.

152
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:21.010
Like a Maori should have the right to do whatever the you want,

153
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.870
but that that's who you really are. That that's somehow your true self.

154
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.950
There might be an underlying psychological issue there that's relevant.

155
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.390
And to discuss that puts you in this category of being transphobic or

156
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:36.910
insensitive or, or right wing.

157
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.470
I don't think that's accurate or fair because I think this is a real weird

158
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.090
issue. It's very weird.

159
00:08:43.091 --> 00:08:45.790
And I think the only people that truly understand it are the people that are

160
00:08:45.791 --> 00:08:50.020
going through it themselves, the people that actually haven't, and, you know,

161
00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:51.940
we can call upon those people to explain it to us,

162
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:55.150
but you get a broad spectrum of answers from those people as well.

163
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.550
<v 0>What if, um,</v>

164
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.860
so what if it is kind of like depression in a

165
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.790
way? So if some,

166
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:05.640
if you give chemical assistance to somebody who's going through depression,

167
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.320
everybody goes right. Good.

168
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.570
Because you want that person to feel like they're happy and.

169
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.360
<v 1>Homeless even think that that's good.</v>

170
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.820
I think exhaust all the possibilities first,

171
00:09:13.821 --> 00:09:16.370
including exercise and diet and that's sure.

172
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.430
<v 0>But there, but there are examples of people who, um,</v>

173
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.230
do have that genuine chemical imbalance.

174
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.830
<v 1>They do, but why do they have that genuine chemical imbalance? Um,</v>

175
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.980
I had Johann Hari on the podcast who I saw that I saw that. Yeah.

176
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.350
And he makes a lot of really good points about like,

177
00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:34.130
what is it that's happening in your life? What is it your, your,

178
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.180
your situation with your relationship, your career, your life, your health,

179
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.910
all these different things need to be taken into consideration instead of just

180
00:09:40.911 --> 00:09:42.710
putting some duct tape over it.

181
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.150
And the term of these SSRS and all these different psych medications that

182
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:50.210
they're handing out, just as easy as they're handing out Oxycontins,

183
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.150
they're passing these things around radically,

184
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.070
radically affect your consciousness.

185
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.360
<v 0>So let's say everybody has all their ducks in a row and they're exercising.</v>

186
00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:02.420
They're eating healthy. They're doing everything by the book. And, uh,

187
00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.310
if you look at it on paper, you're supposed to go, yes,

188
00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:07.310
that person should be healthy. And what's, uh, uh, what the is her name? Oh,

189
00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:09.860
Cara Santa Maria, who you've had on the podcast before.

190
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:11.540
And she talks about how listen I was depressed.

191
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.970
And they tried a whole bunch of different antidepressants.

192
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.390
They finally got me on one that worked. And then she says like, listen,

193
00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:20.810
I want people to understand. You need to look at this like treatment,

194
00:10:20.811 --> 00:10:23.270
look at it like, you know, Hey, I've got a disease.

195
00:10:23.271 --> 00:10:25.100
And they got to give me antibiotics in order to feel better.

196
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:28.610
<v 1>Did the problem with that as is real scientists and doctors would disagree with</v>

197
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:32.030
that. And I don't know if she exhausted every other possibility. And Kara,

198
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.500
she worships at the throne of science and she thinks that this is the way to

199
00:10:36.501 --> 00:10:37.700
handle it. And she might be right.

200
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.900
It also might be possible that if she had rigorous exercise on a daily basis,

201
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.710
cleaned up her diet and did a bunch of other things that maybe that would be

202
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:48.710
just as effective. If not more. I don't know. I don't know.

203
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:53.690
I don't know what she's done, but I think that automatically assuming that this,

204
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:57.020
this blanket statement called depression, which could be,

205
00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.450
what does that even mean? You're not happy with your station in life.

206
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.820
What does that mean? You're not happy with your body. What does that mean?

207
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.180
I don't know what it means. I mean, will you tell me that you have it?

208
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.320
You know what it is when you have it,

209
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:09.560
but how do you know that what you have is the same as what that guy has or with

210
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:12.410
what she has or what other people play? We don't know,

211
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.300
but we do know is the human body reacts in very

212
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:20.510
different ways when it's well fed with nutrients.

213
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.790
And when you exercise on a daily basis,

214
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.180
you flood your body with a natural endorphins that come from that exercise.

215
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.910
When you surround yourself with a loving community,

216
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.790
when you engage in things that are rewarding to you,

217
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.090
all these things have a very positive effect on the way your mind works,

218
00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:38.930
as well as the way your body feels the way your body feels has a positive result

219
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.710
on the way your mind works to think of either one of being independent of each

220
00:11:42.711 --> 00:11:45.620
other, I think is ignorance. It's the same thing. Your body's all this.

221
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.260
And there's radical. Look, I'm not a depressed person,

222
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.960
but I feel way better after I exercise. I mean.

223
00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.060
<v 0>There's science on that, that when you exercise, when you eat, right, of course,</v>

224
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:56.980
you're going to get it, definitely get a boost in your mood,

225
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.843
but it's hard to do.

226
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.660
<v 1>And that's why people like to take a pill and that's totally true.</v>

227
00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.410
And they also like to justify their actions when people take a pill and that

228
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.780
pill is effective, and then they go, well, this is my thing.

229
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.360
This is what did it for me worked for me. They're like, okay,

230
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.900
but at what cost can you orgasm anymore? Like,

231
00:12:12.901 --> 00:12:16.050
there's a lot of that happens to people that when they take those things,

232
00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:17.130
it really them up. Sure.

233
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.580
<v 0>So if you're making the point that they're overprescribed and people rely on</v>

234
00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:23.000
them too much, and it's part of the culture in a negative way.

235
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.140
Totally agree with you. Yes. If,

236
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.840
if we look at the example of say paranoid schizophrenia,

237
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.230
where it's somebody who literally sees, that's not there,

238
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.680
and it's a genuine psychological disorder where they needed very powerful drug,

239
00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:39.090
like Seroquel or something like that. So in the case of transgenderism,

240
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.290
what if it's more analogous to a mental state that's as real as that,

241
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.850
where it's, you know what I mean? Like, okay.

242
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.720
<v 1>That is a solution surgery, sexual reassignment surgery.</v>

243
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:49.410
And how do we even know?

244
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:50.250
<v 0>No, I don't know.</v>

245
00:12:50.251 --> 00:12:53.250
But then this gets back to the point you made about the personal freedom angle

246
00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:54.840
of it, where they say, you know what, I'm going to do this.

247
00:12:54.841 --> 00:12:56.370
And this is what I mean. I definitely.

248
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.840
<v 1>Think they should have personal freedom to do it.</v>

249
00:12:57.841 --> 00:13:01.590
Just like they think they should have personal freedom to get their nose pierced

250
00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:04.770
and do whatever you want to do, but should you have to pay for it?

251
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:05.880
<v 0>Well,</v>

252
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.180
that's then that gets into the broader conversation about who should pay for

253
00:13:09.181 --> 00:13:10.260
medical coverage period.

254
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.170
<v 1>But is this, is this an elective thing?</v>

255
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.600
Like how about girls that identify with a girl who has big?

256
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.720
I identify as a girl have big and I have little.

257
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.190
And so you're saying the line is blurry. Well, it's certainly the same thing.

258
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.940
It's the same thing in terms of you don't like your physical state and you want

259
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:30.870
someone to change it. And if you say you would be happy if you had D cups,

260
00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:34.800
but you have a cups and you're convinced this is the key to your happiness.

261
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.660
How is that any different than a person?

262
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.490
And you could get mad at me all you want,

263
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:42.450
but we're talking about the physical state. Sure. The physical state of someone,

264
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.530
like how, how can you,

265
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.700
how can you say that the only way to fix this?

266
00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:51.870
Or how could you not offer that up as a possible avenue that these people that

267
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:53.520
can pursue it, if you,

268
00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:58.080
if there's any surgery that can help you and you want other people to pay for

269
00:13:58.081 --> 00:13:59.190
that surgery, I don't care.

270
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.810
Just because it pertains to gender doesn't mean we have to automatically ask.

271
00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:05.850
I don't think that's, I don't think that's rational.

272
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:11.520
And when it comes to breasts or other, other various elective surgeries,

273
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.300
I strongly feel that people should pay for those themselves. Sure. I will.

274
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:18.600
Absolutely. When it comes to the example you give.

275
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.880
<v 0>About, uh, breasts. Totally agree.</v>

276
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.060
<v 1>Well, why is that different than sex change? I'm not saying it is.</v>

277
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.080
I'm not saying it is either.

278
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.240
<v 0>I'm just saying, um, if that is the case where, and by the way,</v>

279
00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:33.360
I haven't read the science on this, but I'm sure there has been science on this.

280
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.590
And they've answered the question as to whether or not doing that surgery is

281
00:14:37.591 --> 00:14:38.970
effective. Well, it's not.

282
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.020
<v 1>Here's the problem. There's a massive, massive suicide rate. It's over 40%.</v>

283
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.360
So even, even post-operation.

284
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.171
<v 0>I was going to say,</v>

285
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:49.650
am I wrong in my assumption that pre operation that's when more of the suicides

286
00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:50.484
are versus.

287
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.540
<v 1>Post-op, I don't it's changes. I'm pretty sure. See if let's,</v>

288
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:56.750
let's be accurate about this, um, um, suicide rates,

289
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.200
pre post transgender sexual reassignment operations.

290
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.740
I am pretty sure that it's very similar, that it doesn't change.

291
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.070
And then there's also causation versus correlation, right?

292
00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:09.740
Is it because they're depressed because they were in the wrong body that led

293
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:13.160
them down this road, and now here they are. And they just can't get past it.

294
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.990
Even after they have the surgery, they're still bummed out.

295
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.980
They're not accepted by society as a woman, even if they become a trans woman,

296
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:20.420
they're still not accepted by society.

297
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.610
And could that be changed by us being more open-minded and loving? Is.

298
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.970
<v 0>It nature? Is it nurture? Is it the environment? Is it in the person?</v>

299
00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.650
<v 1>But if, if it is legitimate mental health disorder, which used to be called,</v>

300
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.270
it used to be called gender dysphoria.

301
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:37.030
And now if you use the term gender dysphoria, it's hate speech.

302
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.150
And he turns a bus talking about this might get this podcast.

303
00:15:40.151 --> 00:15:42.820
Demonetized probably will. If.

304
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.950
<v 0>It, if it is gender dysphoria,</v>

305
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.420
then wouldn't it actually be a medical condition where the treatment should be

306
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.283
paid for.

307
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.770
<v 1>Good question. Yeah. Is that the correct treatment for gender dysphoria?</v>

308
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.410
Is that the correct treatment for someone who thinks that they should have no

309
00:15:56.411 --> 00:15:59.890
hand? Should you chop that hand off? What do you think? I don't know.

310
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.270
Should you chop a penis off?

311
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.290
<v 0>I don't know. That's what Caitlin Jenner did it. Yeah. Wait, did she get,</v>

312
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:05.800
did eventually.

313
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.200
<v 1>Okay. Well the most hilarious statement after she did that,</v>

314
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:12.610
she said that she is no more of a woman now that she was before.

315
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.660
Well then, Hey, definitely keep your Dick. Yeah, that's a good point.

316
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.820
If you were still a woman before.

317
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.890
<v 0>And he might say something the same now,</v>

318
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.170
which is why I did this really radical thing. It's like, no. Well,

319
00:16:23.171 --> 00:16:26.680
you did admit that you did that for a reason that you really wanted to do it

320
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:27.610
different. I.

321
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:28.450
<v 1>Mean, I don't know,</v>

322
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:32.410
maybe street cred led her to have the operation to just fully get, I mean,

323
00:16:32.411 --> 00:16:36.100
she's fully accepted by that community and become a spokesperson by the year.

324
00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:36.730
No way. It's.

325
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.750
<v 0>Funny because she's, she's super right-wing on other issues.</v>

326
00:16:40.751 --> 00:16:41.584
Remember when she went on.

327
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.210
<v 1>She was like, I'm a very traditional, like traditional I'm. Sure. Yeah.</v>

328
00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:51.070
<v 0>So a lot of people in the trans community were like, you know what, her.</v>

329
00:16:51.071 --> 00:16:53.320
Because she was out there arguing. I forget it was gay.

330
00:16:53.321 --> 00:16:54.430
Marriage was one of marriage,

331
00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.620
but then there was another one where she was talking about economics and she

332
00:16:56.621 --> 00:16:58.570
was, you know, like pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

333
00:16:58.571 --> 00:17:02.590
It's like privileged prick without how much money do you have for just sitting

334
00:17:02.591 --> 00:17:04.420
around all day and getting paid from the Kardashians.

335
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.460
<v 1>Female Kardashians. The show is,</v>

336
00:17:06.461 --> 00:17:10.960
was especially always what she's on that frivolous, ridiculous show.

337
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.100
And she became a really bizarre side note in pop culture.

338
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.260
And that's what's going on. I mean, when you listen to her talk,

339
00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:19.780
she's like one of the worst spokespeople ever for the trans community.

340
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.340
<v 0>And a lot of trans people say that, and they're like,</v>

341
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.590
we don't want her as cause there, you know,

342
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:26.380
if you trans people are individuals.

343
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:29.380
So you left the look at people like they're individuals. And when they,

344
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:33.640
when somebody is put out as this is a leader of this movement, then it's like.

345
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.650
<v 1>Does that make sense? Examples. The one,</v>

346
00:17:35.651 --> 00:17:37.660
the woman who created Sirius satellite radio,

347
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.740
she also created a satellite navigation system. She used to be a man in fact,

348
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.720
very, very brilliant person.

349
00:17:43.721 --> 00:17:47.860
I interviewed her for Saifai for that Joe Rogan questions, everything show,

350
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.770
she created model of her wife, who they actually had babies together.

351
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:56.340
And then she became a woman and they stayed together and she,

352
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.760
she created a robot of her, her wife,

353
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:04.290
and she's like constantly programming it and changing it and adding, you know,

354
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.010
new language and new vocabulary to it.

355
00:18:08.011 --> 00:18:10.920
And she thinks eventually as technology improves,

356
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:13.110
she's going to be able to recreate her wife in a robot, right.

357
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.570
<v 0>By the way, another great example, Brianna Westbrook is.</v>

358
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.850
<v 1>The uncomfortable truth that many surveys,</v>

359
00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:24.500
including the 2011 Swedish study indicate that suicide rates remain high after

360
00:18:24.501 --> 00:18:25.790
sex reassignment surgery.

361
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:29.810
The Swedish study reports that people have had sex reassignment surgery are 19

362
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:33.440
times more likely to die by suicide than is the general population.

363
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.070
<v 0>To be fair, to be fair. I see the sources life site news, which is a very, very.</v>

364
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.731
<v 1>Right. That's true.</v>

365
00:18:37.731 --> 00:18:41.270
But the national center for transgender equality reported in 2014,

366
00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:44.480
that 40% of the people identify as transgender have attempted suicide.

367
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.130
Very well may be true.

368
00:18:46.131 --> 00:18:49.130
I'm just saying that's the national center for transgender equality.

369
00:18:49.131 --> 00:18:49.820
They were just breaking.

370
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.010
<v 3>Up this article here, which is the study.</v>

371
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.980
<v 0>PLO one is legit. That's true.</v>

372
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:59.780
<v 1>That's legit. So, um, but they're, they're reporting facts from studies. And,</v>

373
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:00.770
uh, I mean, this is,

374
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.940
this is pretty well established that there's a high suicide rate amongst

375
00:19:04.941 --> 00:19:07.780
transgender people pre and post reassignment surgery.

376
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:10.760
And then we go back to the same thing.

377
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.670
It doesn't necessarily mean that they couldn't be happy if they weren't just

378
00:19:13.671 --> 00:19:16.310
fully accepted by society. I mean, I don't know if it's,

379
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.580
I think Caitlyn Jenner is probably happier cause she gets a load of attention

380
00:19:19.581 --> 00:19:21.890
now. And she was in the shadow Bahara well, I'm over here.

381
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.960
I'm over here by the way. Now she's, you know, front and center Vogue magazine.

382
00:19:26.961 --> 00:19:27.440
Yeah.

383
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.440
<v 0>A lot of attention. Speaking of, uh, people who would be a better example and,</v>

384
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.640
and a better, you know, face of the transgender movement, uh,

385
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.310
Brianna Westbrook is a candidate who's running for office and there's actually a

386
00:19:37.311 --> 00:19:41.150
special election today and she's running for Congress and she's really

387
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:45.680
inspirational. Uh, I, I, uh know about her because I found a justice Democrats,

388
00:19:45.681 --> 00:19:48.860
which was a group that it was going to primary corporate Democrats and run

389
00:19:48.861 --> 00:19:51.170
candidates who take no corporate PAC money. And, uh,

390
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.220
she's one of the candidates. And what you find is it,

391
00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.600
the people who are really respectful are the people who they like,

392
00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:03.620
she happens to be transgender, but she's not putting that front and center.

393
00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.380
Right. You know what I'm saying? Like, she's a person, she's a person. Exactly.

394
00:20:06.381 --> 00:20:08.300
And she's going here are the things I believe in.

395
00:20:08.301 --> 00:20:10.640
And I think this will improve everybody's lives and I'm gonna run on these

396
00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:13.940
issues and it's not like, Hey, I'm transgender. If you don't vote for me,

397
00:20:13.941 --> 00:20:14.660
then you're a bigot.

398
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.730
<v 1>Right, right, right. That's a very good point. And I think open-mindedness is,</v>

399
00:20:18.731 --> 00:20:22.850
is incredibly critical in our wide diverse society.

400
00:20:22.851 --> 00:20:25.880
And when people, when people push back against that,

401
00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:30.140
it creates all sorts of giant problems. And I just think it doesn't matter,

402
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:32.810
you should be able to do whatever you want to do. And if it doesn't affect you,

403
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.070
why do you care? I think we should re be really, really, really careful,

404
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:39.230
but what we do to children now. Yeah.

405
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:39.561
<v 0>I saw,</v>

406
00:20:39.561 --> 00:20:41.840
I saw your conversation on that recently and I think you made a bunch of good

407
00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:45.920
points. Like when is it okay to, to say, you know what, okay,

408
00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:48.010
if you want to do the surgery, you can do the surgery.

409
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:52.030
<v 1>Well, there's a, there's a guilt going back to Heather highing and, um, uh,</v>

410
00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.740
Eric Weinstein, there was a, um, an article that I believe Eric,

411
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.810
not Eric, I'm sorry, Brett, Brett Weinstein put up on his Twitter yesterday,

412
00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.920
or maybe it was Heather, what they were discussing. Um,

413
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:07.030
this,

414
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.350
this real problem with kids who are really young,

415
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:15.280
where it becomes a trendy thing to, to think that they're in the wrong gender.

416
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:19.150
And then they get reinforcement from their very progressive friends who also get

417
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.950
excited about this idea and then to intervene surgically

418
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.280
or chemically when your body's still in development,

419
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:30.880
you're 13 or whatever the you are. You don't know what you are yet.

420
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.570
And you should be able to give yourself a chance to grow and develop.

421
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.520
But there's a lot of people that disagree,

422
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:40.150
including people that are already transgender that in my mind,

423
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.390
they're probably more supportive of it because they want more people to do it.

424
00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.020
Like Steven Crowder had this weird thing where he and Jared,

425
00:21:47.021 --> 00:21:48.220
that guy that he does his show with,

426
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.930
went to this meeting and they were talking about [inaudible] undercover film

427
00:21:52.931 --> 00:21:54.970
thing where they're talking about their six-year-old like,

428
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:57.700
is that too young to transition them? And they're like, no,

429
00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.430
a matter of fact studies show that it that's the good time.

430
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.450
It's a good time to do it.

431
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.200
And that you could transition back if he changes his mind. And he was like,

432
00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:07.180
what the are you talking about? No, you can't,

433
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.130
you're using hormone blockers in a kid.

434
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:11.890
You're going to radically affect the way that kid develops as a grown adult.

435
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:12.400
Yeah.

436
00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.000
<v 0>I don't know what line is the proper line?</v>

437
00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.410
Adulthood adult. Is it 16? No, it's 18. Is it 21?

438
00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.860
<v 1>I think it's probably 25. I think it was five fully developed frontal cortex.</v>

439
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.120
Nope.
