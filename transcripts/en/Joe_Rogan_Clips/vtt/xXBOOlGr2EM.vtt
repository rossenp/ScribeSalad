00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.940
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You've got what I call whiskey philosopher wisdom.</v>

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.380
Like if you and I were having a couple of drinks at the bar,

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.150
I have a feeling you would say some cool that I would remember,

4
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.000
and I would take home and I'd go, Hmm. I'd be like lying in bed,

5
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.450
going that like, so I'm going to remember that. That makes a lot of sense.

6
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.530
Where'd you get that from? Uh.

7
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.220
<v 1>I think, I mean, I grew up, uh, found this storytellers. I love,</v>

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.190
I love bumper stickers. I love slogans.

9
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.780
I love to deconstruct a big conversation down to what's a one-liner,

10
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.100
what's the title of that song. We just sang. What's the title of this, you know,

11
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:43.160
this hour or whatever you and I talk. Um,

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.890
what's the title of a relationship I have. What's the,

13
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.430
and you get enough of those things like, Ooh, what's the album title. Um,

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.910
I think of things lyrically. And I think that may be where it comes from. As I,

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040
as I think in a musical in a musical way.

16
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.890
<v 0>Is this something you've acquired?</v>

17
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:01.310
Is this something you always had or you just sort of slowly developed it?

18
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.320
<v 1>I think I'm guessing it was slowly developed. I mean, again, I come from a,</v>

19
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:08.990
from a family of storytellers. Well, we sat around the table and told stories.

20
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:10.340
And if you didn't tell your story, good,

21
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.410
somebody else at the table took it over and you better be telling a good story

22
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:17.930
and not dragging on or losing your train of thought because somebody else will

23
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:22.460
step in and roll over you. So when you wanted to get a word in,

24
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.770
you better be a good storyteller. What.

25
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.140
<v 0>Is that? How you got into acting like this?</v>

26
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.620
The ability to entertain because the storyteller is essentially an entertainer.

27
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.000
<v 1>Sure. Well,</v>

28
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.900
I went to film school first and because when I looked back at the diaries,

29
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.780
I really couldn't admit that I wanted to be in front of the camera as an actor,

30
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.510
but that's what I really wanted to do. Um,

31
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.530
but I went to film school because I felt like being the storyteller behind the

32
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:50.030
camera was something that my dad one could digest as a

33
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:52.490
possible route forward for his son.

34
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.700
And it was all that I could digest at the time. Um,

35
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.440
so when I made the leap to film school,

36
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.450
I immediately would direct actors by performing myself in front of the

37
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:06.650
camera. So I really liked the, the, the first person subjective performance.

38
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.820
And then I got that job in that summer of 92 on days confused,

39
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.700
or I ended up three lines, turned into three weeks work,

40
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.570
I'm getting paid 320 bucks a day. People would tell me I'm good at it.

41
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:20.900
I keep getting invited back to set. I'm like, is this one can legal?

42
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.120
And so I went back, graduated, picked up,

43
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.200
I packed up my U-Haul and drove west young man, you know, two weeks out of, uh,

44
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.770
out of graduating college. And, um, you know,

45
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.720
I didn't have that story of rough in it. When I first got out there,

46
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.280
first two auditions, I went on, I got the job. That's pretty amazing.

47
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.593
Yeah.

48
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.670
<v 0>Did you, when you, when you say that you,</v>

49
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.870
you didn't want to admit that you wanted to be in front of the camera, like,

50
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.570
what do you think was holding you back? I.

51
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.780
<v 1>Think it was the look I was raised in a blue collar family, where you get a job,</v>

52
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.810
you work your way up the ladder company ladder to be in the arts to be in front

53
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:06.730
of camera. The actors sounded so vain sounded so avant garde sounded so European

54
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.720
sounded so, so nothing stable about it.

55
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:15.120
And so to bring that up to my dad, even bring it up, like I said, I could,

56
00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:18.940
it was not even in the vernacular of my dreams. I did not even dream about it.

57
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:21.730
The only place that I admitted it was in my diaries.

58
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.130
And I found those where I wrote to myself before I even consciously

59
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:31.390
admitted that I did want to be an actor all the way back since

60
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.710
1988, but I never admitted it until I started doing it.

61
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.600
And it turned into about 1993 that I was like, okay, I think I can do this.

62
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:43.030
I'm giving it a shot. And I love this. Um.

63
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.110
<v 0>It's totally understandable that it would fall into some form of self-sabotage</v>

64
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.130
if it came that easy, if all of a sudden you're on days and confused,

65
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:56.340
all of a sudden you do your first two auditions, you get the gig,

66
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.680
everything's rolling. You're young or handsome. Woo. Come on Dre night.

67
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.810
I mean, how did you self correct?

68
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.390
<v 1>Tell you what I did. I, uh, I got,</v>

69
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.680
it really happened around 96 after I did a film with time to kill.

70
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.860
I remember the Friday before time to kill open. That's the movie that, that,

71
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.490
that I was the lead in a big budget. John Grisham movie.

72
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.340
That was the one that made me famous. All right.

73
00:04:25.341 --> 00:04:30.170
So the Friday before that movie opened, I,

74
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.940
you know, there's a hundred scripts I wanted to do.

75
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.190
I would have done anything to do any of these scripts. 99. No, you can't one.

76
00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:40.610
Yes, you can. I'm walking down the third street promenade in Santa Monica,

77
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.690
400 people in the prominent 396, mind their own business.

78
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.510
Four of them checking me out. Two girls that thought I was cute.

79
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:51.320
And a couple other people, maybe like my shoes, the Monday,

80
00:04:51.321 --> 00:04:53.870
following that weekend, trying to get opens that night,

81
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.970
the Monday following all of a sudden out of those a hundred scripts,

82
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.990
99 yeses, you can do any of these Matthew one. No,

83
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.740
all of a sudden that same problem. And I'd walk. I took 400 people.

84
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.090
Now 396 were staring at me and four people weren't. One of them was blind.

85
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.410
All right. They inverted the world became a mirror. I noticed, oh,

86
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.710
I don't meet any strangers anymore. People are coming up to me going like,

87
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:22.160
I'm so sorry about Ms. HUD. And I'm a guy going, wait a minute. Number one,

88
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:23.960
what's your name? I've never met you. How'd you know,

89
00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:26.960
I had a dog whose name is Ms. Hudson has cancer.

90
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.950
You just skipped five filters of Audi. You know what I mean?

91
00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.320
And I remember feeling unbalanced about it.

92
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.660
All of a sudden I'm 23. At that time, I'm being told,

93
00:05:38.661 --> 00:05:41.330
I love you. I love you. And in my mind, I'm going, man.

94
00:05:41.331 --> 00:05:45.800
We don't throw that word around. I've said that to four people in my life. Uh,

95
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.710
so I want to know what the heck was real, what really mattered.

96
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.390
And I was looking for a place to go.

97
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.930
I need to get out. I needed to go those demarcations. We talked about,

98
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.910
I needed to go break a long sweat.

99
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:01.880
I needed to go out and let memory catch up and see what the hell was real.

100
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:05.180
What was not. So I packed up my stuff. Um,

101
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.610
I went to a monastery for about a week and then I got back and I went off.

102
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.030
I had this certain dream. I repeat repeating dream that came to me.

103
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.420
And I went to Peru and flooded the Amazon for 22 days.

104
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.890
And it was a forced solitude. Nobody there knew my name.

105
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:23.450
They didn't speak English.

106
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.080
I was forced to be with myself and my thoughts and my own company,

107
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:28.580
which I was not enjoying.

108
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.790
So after about 12 days of shaking the monkeys off my back,

109
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.760
figuring out what the hell I was going to forgive myself for and what I was

110
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.570
going to lay down the hammer and say, enough's enough about, um,

111
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.880
I came out of it, woke up one morning,

112
00:06:40.881 --> 00:06:43.370
light as a feather and shook hands with myself and said,

113
00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:44.720
we're going to be all right, man. Uh,

114
00:06:44.721 --> 00:06:46.640
you're the one person that can't get rid of McConaughey.

115
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.100
So we might as well get along and reentered.

116
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.780
And that recalibration helped a lot to disseminate through all the and all the

117
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:56.510
excess of affluence that was coming at me at the time.

118
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.380
And I found some discernment and I found some discrimination in my choices

119
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.820
again, um, and moved on from there. But I've had to do that.

120
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:09.310
I've had to take off on my own many times to go recalibrate. That.

121
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.720
<v 0>Sounds like a story of a man running and the rocks fall right behind him.</v>

122
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.250
Like you just missed it. Like also 23 years old,

123
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.210
you weren't a child star, but it was close.

124
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.850
Like we all know what happens when your personality develops

125
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.600
in the spotlight and you're famous almost no one gets out alive.

126
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.210
<v 1>Uh, I mean, and I understand it.</v>

127
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.080
I wasn't ready to go out to Hollywood before I did.

128
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.270
Hollywood's not a place to go find yourself.

129
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.580
Hollywood's a place where you can be anything you want.

130
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.410
It's infinite yeses all in the infinite. Yes. Is as you know,

131
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.920
the old, the infinite options can make a tyrant of any of us.

132
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.530
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
