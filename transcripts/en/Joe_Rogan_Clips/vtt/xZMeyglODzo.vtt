00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Well, like back to where did music come from?</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.720
You know, sometimes I wonder if like the people that came up with these things.

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.480
I mean, obviously you can go to school and learn a trade or, you know, um,

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.680
become a master of your craft or engineering. But like,

5
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.790
sometimes I wonder if it's just like some weird, um,

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.670
other dimensional source that comes outta nowhere. That's what I think.

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.670
<v 1>Ideas are. Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.510
<v 0>That's what I'm saying. Ideas.</v>

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.750
<v 1>I think all 100 percent, I I've been saying this for a long time.</v>

10
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.070
I think we should think of ideas as a life form.

11
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.270
That's trying to propagate itself.

12
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:38.990
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because everything that you see came from an idea,

13
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:43.220
everything. Yeah. Every and Vention, every, everything,

14
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.060
every song that you've ever written and sang every book that's ever been,

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.460
all that stuff. Yeah. Every book ever written came from an idea and then, boom,

16
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.180
it's a real thing. Like imagine if ideas,

17
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.420
cause we don't know where they're coming from.

18
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.180
<v 0>I feel like that when I write sometimes I'm like, what the.</v>

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.130
<v 1>Do you ever feel like that was almost like a gift? Like something's given you a.</v>

20
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.770
<v 0>Gift. Yes. Like a Chan, like it was a channel of sorts, like, but weird.</v>

21
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.050
<v 1>Cause it it's weird to, I, I, I, I, I don't want this to be misinterpreted.</v>

22
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:17.050
Like I a hundred percent give you credit for creating it.

23
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.770
It's not what I'm saying. &lt;laugh&gt; we can cut that.

24
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.200
But I'm just saying that to people that, that might get weird about this,

25
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.080
that not don't get where I'm coming from, what I'm,

26
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:31.560
what I'm coming from is everybody that I know that creates things

27
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.160
has a very similar narrative that like it's coming outta nowhere.

28
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.120
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; like, I just have to be there to get it.

29
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.920
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, you know? Yeah. There's a thing where you, in the,

30
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.440
in a particularly, if you spend a lot of time,

31
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.990
I'm on it and you you're working at it and you're passionate about it. Yeah.

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.390
And you're focused on it. It's it's almost like

33
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.700
ause, even if it's not real. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, it's still real.

34
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.300
Cuz it's it's there's an accuracy to like, if you pretended that the,

35
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.620
there was some God that was be bestowing upon you,

36
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.530
these amazing ideas, if you focused on it, mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and if you,

37
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.250
you led the correct life and lived the right path,

38
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.050
then it would give you these gifts. If you focused on your art form. And that,

39
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.090
that would be like, if you, if someone told you that there was a God doing that,

40
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:20.570
you're like, oh God, that's so ridiculous. Well, what do you give a?

41
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.520
Who's doing it. It's the same thing. It's like a God doing it for you.

42
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.280
It really does work. Like if you focus on what you're trying to do,

43
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.480
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; these weird moments do come out.

44
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.280
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; where creativity like pops up and you don't know where it

45
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:36.920
came from. Right. You have an idea will come to you. Yeah.

46
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.880
<v 0>I think it's equal, not equal parts, but it's, you know,</v>

47
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.400
when you put in the effort to like keep the muscle flex,

48
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.150
like the one where you're writing regularly or you're practicing regularly,

49
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.190
and then you also kind of let it, you know, sort of come in.

50
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.710
Yeah. It's, you know,

51
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.790
I saw Dan Harmon speak once at one of Duncan Trussel's live podcast and

52
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:03.640
he had this, he said he had, he called it the gingerbread man theory.

53
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.520
And he said it was almost like he was, uh, a giant,

54
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.120
I don't know why this was what he said, but he was a gingerbread man.

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.880
And there was a, a big hole in the top of his head.

56
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.720
And there was all this falling into this hole from somewhere.

57
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.440
And every once in a while, about 10,

58
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.310
10% of it would lightly dust the rim inside of the gingerbreaded jar.

59
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.270
And that was him and the rest was other stuff.

60
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.520
<v 1>Jesus Christ &lt;laugh&gt; I thought that was.</v>

61
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.120
<v 0>Really interesting. I know. Right.</v>

62
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.440
I love Rick and Morty &lt;laugh&gt; I love Rick and Morty so much. Oh my God.

63
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.920
But you know, think about that and then watch Rick and Mor if you do,

64
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.070
you'll be like, oh, I get it. I totally get it. I.

65
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.910
<v 1>Do get it. Yeah. I do get it. Wow.</v>

66
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.671
<v 0>Yeah, that' hilarious. But,</v>

67
00:03:43.671 --> 00:03:46.550
but you also have to like put in an effort to inspire yourself,

68
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.910
inform yourself mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; read and learn, grow, live,

69
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.470
and then you put all that together and you know, have.

70
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.270
<v 1>You, have we ever talked about the war of art? Stephen Presfield book? Yeah.</v>

71
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.140
For anybody that's into, it's not just, uh, like writing,

72
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.780
but it's kind of about writing. Mm. But it's also about like,

73
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.540
I think everything, there's a weird thing that we call that, you know,

74
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.780
we call procrastination and, and he calls it resistance in the book.

75
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.580
It's really interesting because you realize like what it is,

76
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:18.580
there's this weird thing that tries to keep people from being their best at

77
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:19.980
stuff. Mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; try to,

78
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.210
there's like a weird confusion and stress about it that keeps you from focusing

79
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.050
on what you really need to do to be a true professional.

80
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.930
And he sort of lays it out in the book in a way that makes you go, oh yeah.

81
00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:34.410
I never thought because he figured it out. Like when he was like 40 years old.

82
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.450
Yeah. Figured out what he had been doing wrong,

83
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.560
changed his direction and then became like super successful as a writer. Yeah.

84
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.000
And, and is like really respected as a writer. Yeah.

85
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.760
And this book is one of the most interesting things because you know,

86
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.080
like his history that he kind of figured out how to get out of his own way.

87
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.960
He simplifies it. Yep. And puts in the work mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; well, cuz.

88
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.920
<v 0>I think a lot of it's subconscious too. It's like,</v>

89
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:01.790
you want to succeed and you want to, you know, grow and evolve,

90
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.310
but then there's these obstacles of like, yeah, but I, you know what,

91
00:05:04.311 --> 00:05:06.430
today I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna, you know, you know what I gotta,

92
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.670
I gotta call, you know,

93
00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:10.350
you just kind of procrastinate mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; in this, it's,

94
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:15.310
it's a powerful force, you know? And, and that can grow into so many things,

95
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.430
you know, your self-doubt then, oh, I'm not ready. I can't do that.

96
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.860
I'm not ready. I can't play that show or whatever, you know, I'm no, not,

97
00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:23.780
that's not a good example, but, but it seems like.

98
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.660
<v 1>There's a wrestling match in creative people's heads,</v>

99
00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:28.660
particularly like performance artists.

100
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.220
Like you guys are like comedians or singers or any anybody where there's a

101
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:37.340
wrestling match between like creating stuff and, and,

102
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.740
and being disciplined, putting in a lot of,

103
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.090
a lot of work mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; or slack off and feeling like, oh my God,

104
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:45.410
I gotta get back to work again.

105
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.130
And then being really excited to work hard and get going again.

106
00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:52.410
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and some people fall too far into one way or the other.

107
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.970
And there's like a weird balance in there.

108
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.920
Like you almost like have to be scared. Yeah.

109
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.320
<v 0>Yeah. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I think that because that's,</v>

110
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.720
that's your vulnerability is a big part of,

111
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.560
of ex you know,

112
00:06:07.561 --> 00:06:12.240
giving an honest thing to a crowd when you're playing music or, or comedy.

113
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.360
Yeah. You know, I think that, um,

114
00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.550
uh, sorry. I feel like I'm talking too much, Gary &lt;laugh&gt; no, no, no, no, no,

115
00:06:20.551 --> 00:06:20.750
no.

116
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.350
<v 1>No, no, no. Don't worry about it. We we're all gonna talk for a long time. Yeah,</v>

117
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.670
we.

118
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.710
<v 0>Are. Yeah. We usually do.</v>

119
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.510
<v 1>You could just express yourself. It's okay.</v>

120
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.470
<v 0>Um, I, I I've played music with folks and, and I don't wanna like say,</v>

121
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.430
say this in a, in a knock against, uh,

122
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.300
conservatory of students and things like that.

123
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.940
But I've found that people that are really, really smart in the,

124
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.660
um, musical education element and, and you know,

125
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.420
again, I got a lot of friends and I hope I'm not stepping on any tails,

126
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.620
but I it's almost like harder for them to vibe out because they're so smart

127
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.250
and they're, they are almost mathematical with their playing. Whereas like Gary,

128
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.890
like let's just rock.

129
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.170
Like let's hang out and like find the thing where I think sometimes

130
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.410
I've felt like when I've played with people that I know I'm gonna get so much

131
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.410
for this I'm. So I'm like kind of embarrassed to say, listen, you're you are,

132
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.530
you am gonna get so. You're a nice person.

133
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.520
<v 1>You the, this way.</v>

134
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.960
<v 0>I'm trying to, I'm trying to find the middle ground. That's like, you know,</v>

135
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.080
I'm not gonna off too many people. It's not always the case. Right. Right.

136
00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:28.280
There are some brilliant, but like the vibe is where it's at.

137
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.200
So what I'm trying to say is yes,

138
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.680
you can go to school and be the smartest and know the map,

139
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.360
frontwards and backwards. But if you can't feel it,

140
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.470
when you're playing live and playing with a other people, mm.

141
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:42.790
Then there's a huge missing element. That's what I wanna say. I I'm not,

142
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:43.410
I don't wanna,

143
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.150
but I think that you almost have more of an obstacle when you are,

144
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:52.550
you have that kind of intelligence with music. Mm. Because it's upstairs. Gary,

145
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:52.910
do you agree.

146
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.350
<v 1>With that? Or is this, are we fighting? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

147
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.660
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt; are you guys fighting? No, no. We'.</v>

148
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.493
<v 0>Not fighting.</v>

149
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.380
<v 2>Now, but I, I think, I think I understand exactly.</v>

150
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.140
I understand exactly what you saying, but I, I kind of simplify it like this.

151
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.460
I think of it like a radio, like, like a, you know, back in the day,

152
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:14.820
when you would tune a, a radio, um,

153
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.220
you try and dial in whatever station and you get that clear channel.

154
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:21.890
Sometimes you'd have to move yourself. Sometimes you'd have to just like,

155
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.690
you know, get yourself into that place. And I think that as a musician, for me,

156
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:29.050
what I'm trying to do is gather information around me,

157
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.010
gather little things and not consume myself with this.

158
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:36.810
So when I'm in that place to receive that inspiration or that, that thought,

159
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.930
or, or that melody, whatever that is,

160
00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:44.080
I'm not cloud of with doubt or this isn't what this person's doing or whatever.

161
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.960
I'm just, I'm here in this with everybody, but I'm like, all right,

162
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.480
I'm gonna dial this in. So the noise goes away a little.

163
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.560
<v 0>Bit less. You're a good listener. You know, you know what I mean, as.</v>

164
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.360
<v 2>A play, I don't know if this makes sense, but that's no, it makes it like,</v>

165
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.800
how can I as an artist,

166
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:02.920
how can I dial into that channel that how can I be the receiver and

167
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.440
get that clearest mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; thing and,

168
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.160
and whatever you were talking about with the ginger, you know,

169
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.480
I'm saying like that little, that little piece of, yeah.

170
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.230
Of you at the top is like, you're holding on to, to that thing. Yeah. And,

171
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:20.660
you know, putting that all out there as a, as a force, it,

172
00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:23.300
it makes sense to me, but that it't sounds stupid saying, no, it't sound stupid,

173
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.333
but it's like,

174
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.740
some people are so consumed with giving what they know. Right, right, right.

175
00:09:30.741 --> 00:09:31.520
And,

176
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.980
and pushing everything out there that they're not taking the time to sit back

177
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.210
can listen. Yeah. And like, just shut the up for a minute. Yeah.

178
00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:42.090
And listen to this beautiful inspiration that comes outta nowhere, you know,

179
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:45.050
just like, listen to yourself, your inner mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; boss at being,

180
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.770
you know, that's um, so when you show up to a place and,

181
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.450
and you know, you jam, and of course you're going to,

182
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.570
it's gonna be somebody who just comes in and go,

183
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:59.560
just gives you everything that they know. Right. &lt;laugh&gt; and be like,

184
00:09:59.561 --> 00:10:03.200
yo, I just crushed this thing without, without accepting the fact that like,

185
00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.400
there's, we're a collective here. Yeah. There's other people playing. Yeah.

186
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.720
We're trying to all tune into the same station.

187
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.800
And that's when that magic happens. That's when the jam,

188
00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:12.240
when you kinda let yourself go and,

189
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.350
and be that it's riding or jamming or playing, whatever recording, can.

190
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.110
<v 1>I ask you, does this approach, um,</v>

191
00:10:18.111 --> 00:10:22.990
something that you've evolved or something you knew intuitively from the

192
00:10:22.991 --> 00:10:26.870
jump that this is how you need to like tune out and like, look at things from,

193
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.833
don't get too,

194
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.110
like the way you're describing your ability to shut the up and look at the world

195
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:37.260
and draw inspiration from the world. Is that something that came to you in time?

196
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.380
Or, or is it something that you always kind of intuitively knew?

197
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.053
<v 2>I just,</v>

198
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.760
I think it goes back to like sitting around smoking weed with my

199
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:50.840
friends and just like, &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, not getting caught up with the,

200
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.880
you know, not getting caught, caught up with the,

201
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.000
not putting so much pressure on myself to be yeah.

202
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.790
What it is that you know was happening. Yeah. That's such a gift be,

203
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.550
be this type of an artist to be this it's like, just who listen to myself,

204
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:09.990
who am I? And listen to myself, I feel like is listening to the,

205
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.990
you know, this is gonna sound tuning in that channel. This is gonna sound goofy.

206
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.630
<v 1>But that's what comes out in your music.</v>

207
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:26.580
<v 3>So.</v>
