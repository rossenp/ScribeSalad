<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 1>Experience. Okay. From 2009, um,</v>

3
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.500
I would say 2009 was maybe when they had started having this one.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.080
I have to remember where I was in life. I just moved to New York.

5
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.440
People were wearing, I don't know.

6
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.570
I had lived in Santa Fe and I was drinking a lot. So I definitely,

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.020
I quit drinking in 2009. I still never been start comedy.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.760
<v 0>Then Santa Fe was supposed to be a weird.</v>

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.700
<v 1>Place. That's where I met Tate Fletcher, hollow, caveman.</v>

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.533
<v 0>Coffee.</v>

11
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.500
<v 1>I met Tate and, uh, in Santa Fe,</v>

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.230
he used to come in with a bunch of sober dudes after meeting.

13
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:39.750
I don't know if I'm supposed to say this, but whatever, he's pretty open,

14
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.690
but he, I mean, it was the truth. They were so annoying. I was like a drunk.

15
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:47.310
I was wasted at this cowboy bar to wear a cowboy outfit. You have to,

16
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.030
you have to do that's your uniform being a wagers is not humiliating enough.

17
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:51.630
You also have to.

18
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.430
<v 0>Dress, just have a John Deere hat on.</v>

19
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.600
<v 1>No, you have to wear it.</v>

20
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:58.080
You had to wear a cowboy hat and you had to have a shirt that had yolks on it.

21
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.530
If you worked there, if you worked there, not when you went in. Yeah,

22
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.610
that would be crazy.

23
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.060
But so table come in with a bunch of people and they just wouldn't order

24
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.150
alcohol. I mean, it was just like low sales high-maintenance I was like,

25
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.190
who is this guy? So big and ridiculous. And then I was talking to him.

26
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.350
I hadn't quit drinking. I didn't quit drinking till I moved out to Santa Fe,

27
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.610
but I told him I want to do comedy.

28
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.750
And he made them turn the karaoke night into a comedy show for me.

29
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.740
<v 0>Yeah. And I guess that's the first time you ever went up. Wow.</v>

30
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.550
Did you have things prepared? Yeah.

31
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.640
<v 1>Yeah. And then, yeah. And then,</v>

32
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.670
and then I moved to New York to do comedy and I was,

33
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.910
I crashed my Mo I had a little scooter, a Yamaha Zuma,

34
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.390
and I crashed because I would drive drunk all the time. I was my happy place.

35
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.051
Like to this day,

36
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:47.850
I really was honestly that feeling of like driving wasted on a scooter

37
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:49.770
was the wind blowing through air because you're not wearing a helmet.

38
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.520
<v 0>The thing about them there's is you don't really think you can kill anybody</v>

39
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:56.400
else. So it's not that bad. A drive drunk.

40
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.180
<v 1>You can, you can get in the way of someone else. You can do anything.</v>

41
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:04.080
I myself up so bad. I woke up, just had blacked out completely.

42
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:08.100
My face was split open. I had road rash all over my. This was father's day,

43
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:12.300
2008. You don't remember falling. I didn't all I remembered.

44
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.570
I just remembered like little pieces. I remembered that someone helped me.

45
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:18.390
I woke up, I was living at my friend's house. I woke up at the house.

46
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.370
He was staying at his girlfriend's house. So I was there alone,

47
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:24.900
but my chin was split open. I've been wearing a dress and it looked like I,

48
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.920
my throat had been slit.

49
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.800
Like there was just blood all the way down it road rash all over my,

50
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.960
all over this side of my arms, my knees, like, I just was up face planted,

51
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.290
just face split open. I just, I went,

52
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.410
I peeled out and like just went chin first and everything.

53
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:44.460
And then I remember that someone who didn't a girl that didn't like me had

54
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:48.000
helped me. That's all I could remember. It was someone who usually hated me,

55
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.240
helped me. Wow. And then, so I went out, I went to the hospital.

56
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:54.960
I called my roommate. He came back. Um, I went to the hospital,

57
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.560
they gave, I got nine stitches and I was still wasted. I,

58
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.330
I was still so hammered and the doctor kept going, were you drinking?

59
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.930
And I kept going just between us. And he's like, yeah, I went, Nope,

60
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.590
literally I'm gonna go to jail. Your. I was like, no, I just crashed my scooter.

61
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.730
It's crazy. He didn't know that I didn't wake up to drink through the pain. So,

62
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.170
um, so then I got the stitches and I was friends with all the cops in Santa Fe

63
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.200
because I was an alcoholic. So that's a really good plan.

64
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.890
You got to befriend them. So they don't arrest you. And, uh,

65
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.660
they had told me if they had caught me because I ended up finding my scooter on

66
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.070
the side of the road. My friend drove me around.

67
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.690
So I found out where I had peeled out.

68
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.810
And there was like a bunch of loose gravel. So I just peeled out on the gravel.

69
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.700
And the cops said that they would have arrested me for an accurate aggravated

70
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:42.550
DUI because I hurt myself. I had injured myself.

71
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.040
<v 0>That's what an aggravated.</v>

72
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.790
<v 1>DUI. That's what they said back then. I mean, I was still wasted when they said.</v>

73
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.290
<v 0>That that's worse. Have you hurt yourself?</v>

74
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.560
<v 1>Yeah. Cause I had to go to the hospital and stuff. You would think.</v>

75
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.600
<v 0>You got a little punishment in there? Yeah.</v>

76
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.970
<v 1>Wow. So then I didn't learn the lesson.</v>

77
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.510
I went out drinking that night with the stitches in my face and I had my line

78
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:04.540
was I would carry Neosporin around and ask guys if they wanted to rub Neosporin

79
00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:08.800
on my. Like I almost lost a nipple. I mean, it got so close. Yeah.

80
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:11.710
I looked crazy, but I was a drunk. So I was like, whew, fun, girly.

81
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.480
And they used to call me fun girl, Andy, behind my back.

82
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.850
And I thought they were, I thought it was like a cool,

83
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.750
I didn't realize they're making fun of all cheese. So anyway, uh,

84
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.630
so then I went out that night and I saw this guy with a puppy and I started

85
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.990
playing with the puppy and I was like, oh, your puppy is so cute. And he goes,

86
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:29.230
do you not remember me? And I'm like, I've never met you before he goes,

87
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.640
last night, I helped you. You crashed your scooter. And I was like, oh.

88
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.050
And he's like, I ride a motorcycle.

89
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.370
So I didn't want to call the cops or anything.

90
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.970
Cause I know you would've gotten in trouble. And I was like, who helped me?

91
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.520
And he's like some girl. So then my friend called me. He's like,

92
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:43.271
my boss told me.

93
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.480
So it was my friend's boss from this hotel that I used to get wasted at.

94
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:47.710
He was the bartender.

95
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:51.280
So she hated me because I would just go get hammered at their nice

96
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:52.114
establishment.

97
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.620
<v 0>Do you look back on those days with any fondness because you're sober now?</v>

98
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.663
You're all.

99
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.960
<v 1>Um, yeah, I mean, I think I have a wealth of stories.</v>

100
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:06.040
I was a juvenile delinquent and I had so many childhood traumas and abuses and

101
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:06.940
weird things that happen.

102
00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:09.790
I was running for my life in Jersey city when I was 15,

103
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:13.750
from like a fake modeling agent who was like a six foot eight drag queen named

104
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:17.030
mahogany running for my life, trying to hot a.

105
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.950
<v 0>Long, I.</v>

106
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.850
<v 1>Just have a lot of stories.</v>

107
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.340
<v 0>That's not a story. You can brush what happened. You were 15. So.</v>

108
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.090
<v 1>I had gone to mahogany. Yeah. So I had gone to John Robert Powers,</v>

109
00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:30.850
modeling school, one of those like fake modeling schools.

110
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.110
<v 0>And where you pay like 200 bucks and then make like a compilation headshots.</v>

111
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.750
<v 1>Yeah. You like go, they give you classes and modeling. Like,</v>

112
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:41.050
that's a thing it's like you either like are weirdly weird looking alien,

113
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.270
hot and tall and skinny or not. Yeah. Or you're not, I mean,

114
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:49.040
I maybe could have done commercials or something. I was cute, but I, I,

115
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.370
I also had very low self. It was just such a weird,

116
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:55.150
it was such a weird thing to be doing. So, um,

117
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.340
and I'd been a tomboy up until that point. So we go,

118
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:03.260
I go to this modeling thing and then we went to paid more money to

119
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.380
go to like a modeling convention.

120
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.640
And then they had actual modeling agencies and then they had just random people

121
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:11.630
that I guess paid to be there.

122
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.660
So mahogany was one of them and my mom's like super liberal.

123
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:16.370
And so she likes anything.

124
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:20.450
That's like a little on the fringe that she could brag about it or book club or

125
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:23.870
whatever. If that sounds like I'm angry, I'm not angry. I've forgiven my mother.

126
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.780
But, um, so they ended up, they were like,

127
00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:34.190
we want to take your daughter for two weeks and we'll send her out on auditions

128
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:39.020
and stuff over spring break. And we have this nice place in Jersey. Teen.

129
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.430
Yeah. Your mom,

130
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.420
let mahogany take you for so many more stories, Joe.

131
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.270
Jesus Christ. Yeah, no, there was,

132
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:50.150
my mother did not have anything bad happened to her when she was growing up,

133
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:52.280
she was adopted by a very nice family.

134
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:56.150
And she went to a nice boarding school and stuff and nothing happened to her.

135
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.750
She read the newspaper, she didn't read the newspaper. I don't think much.

136
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:03.290
So she, it just, she didn't, she wasn't aware.

137
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.520
So anyway, so then, okay. So I was,

138
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.050
I went to this place in Jersey city and Jersey city. I don't know how it is now,

139
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:16.490
but it was crazy back then. It's still. It was crazy.

140
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:18.080
So we were in this one,

141
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.520
a little condo and it was mahogany.

142
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:24.590
And then there was like some other people that were there.

143
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.770
None of us were really that. I mean, I probably was like the hottest,

144
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.440
but I was pretty raw. I mean, I don't know. I think I was cute.

145
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:35.270
I don't think I was like, uh, I don't think I was a model. And uh,

146
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.530
I don't think that was my future. Maybe I could have done something, but, um,

147
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.690
the only person that I had really bonded with was this 23 year old guy, Chris,

148
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.630
who was this black guy from, I dunno where he was from, but he was really cool.

149
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:50.540
He was really nice. And he was a little creepy.

150
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:52.310
Like he would say things like if I was your age,

151
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:56.840
but he never was trying to me or anything, but he kind of was protecting me.

152
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.870
And at some point mahogany got mad and there was, it was fake. Like I just,

153
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.180
he would make me go buy him weed on the corner and stuff.

154
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.590
And it's just a fake thing.

155
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:07.370
My parents paid like $1,500 to send me to this thing. And he would,

156
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.110
I think he sent me out to be a,

157
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.640
I had to go into New York by myself on the train at 15,

158
00:08:13.641 --> 00:08:18.230
wearing the sluttiest clothes ever to this thing to, and then he would tell me,

159
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.420
pretend you're lying.

160
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.600
Say you're 21 to be an extra on like sex in the city and stuff.

161
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:26.300
It just wasn't real. There was nothing real about, it was a total scam.

162
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.070
So I was starting to catch on to that.

163
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:31.160
And I was supposed to be there for maybe 10 days, I think. And they,

164
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:34.900
these next door, neighbors, shorty, this little Puerto Rican lady, I don't,

165
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:39.110
she was a girl. I smoked blunts with her. But um, so this guy,

166
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:41.240
Chris was kind of protecting me and he would go into the city with me.

167
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:44.150
And then all of a sudden mahogany didn't like how close we were.

168
00:08:44.151 --> 00:08:46.700
So he separated us and he said, you can't see each other anymore.

169
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.070
And I was like, well, I don't feel safe if I can't talk to this guy,

170
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.780
I just would rather go home. I want to call my parents.

171
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:54.920
I don't think this is real. This seems like and a scam. And he was like,

172
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:59.400
you talk to your parents and he locked the door and took the phone away from me.

173
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.290
So I packed all my up and I throw it out the window and I yelled down to shorty.

174
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:08.220
I was like, yo, I'm going to run. So grabbed my. And then the guy,

175
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.000
one of the other kids that was staying at the modeling place knew the situation.

176
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.650
So he went down and bumped into the door,

177
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:15.960
unlocked it without him noticing and distracted him.

178
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.740
And I just jetted out of the house. And he started chasing me.

179
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:22.350
I was like screaming. I was like, call the cops, help me, help me.

180
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:24.600
And I was wearing a tube top, my like 15 year old.

181
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.840
I had nipple rings were like hanging out. I mean, I looked like a prostitute.

182
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:30.720
The cops ended up coming and they thought it was a prostitute. Mahogany got me.

183
00:09:30.721 --> 00:09:32.610
At one point I was hiding under cars for my life.

184
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.670
Like I thought I was going to get killed. I was like screaming.

185
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:39.660
People were just watering their plants. Like what the? And the Lakers? Yeah.

186
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.260
Cause he was chasing me. So I was trying to hide. And he finally got me.

187
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.020
He was like, get in the hat. Like you're ruining my scam pretty much.

188
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.060
And then he scratched my arm, but that's all.

189
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:49.290
And then the cops came and arrested.

190
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:52.110
Both of us thought he was my pimp thought I was a prostitute.

191
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.600
I come from like a whew, like, uh, when he came home, um,

192
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.900
well they came to the cops and then the cops told them that they should arrest

193
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.300
my parents. Yeah. They're like we should.

194
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:06.510
And I think they just were in denial about it or whatever.

195
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.790
<v 0>For a day, at least. Yeah.</v>

196
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.720
<v 1>They didn't. And then more stuff happened after that. They'd made.</v>

197
00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.553
<v 0>More mistakes.</v>

198
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.600
<v 1>Yeah. But it's okay. We all make mistakes. I love my family. They're good now.</v>

199
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.630
But I also look at all these things. No,

200
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:25.710
I really like have had to do a lot of work on it because to forgive them. Yeah.

201
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:28.260
Because, well, I blame myself for all of it, for most of it,

202
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:30.300
which was my defense mechanism. Like the stuff I had,

203
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:32.100
some stuff happen with a teacher in high school,

204
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.200
Tim right after that actually was about six months after that happened. And uh,

205
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.950
you know, what was a therapy session? I don't want to do a therapy session.

206
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.280
I don't want to do that. But anyway, you had asked me about,

207
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.640
am I happy about these things? And so the point that I'm coming to,

208
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.310
but the point that I'm coming to is I am happy with them.

209
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:53.490
I'm so happy with like where my life is now that I can't be mad about any of

210
00:10:53.491 --> 00:10:56.670
these other things. Do you know what I mean? Like they're,

211
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.910
they're like exciting and now they're funny. Cause I didn't get heard.

212
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:00.510
That's what.

213
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.070
<v 0>I'm saying. Like looking back on the.</v>

214
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.360
<v 1>Whole.</v>

215
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.200
<v 0>Yes. Yeah. There's some crazy to some romance to it. If you're saying.</v>

216
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.880
<v 1>I flashed a chain gang one, so my motor scooter, and then it didn't start.</v>

217
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:14.520
And I had to like put my shirt down and keep walking. Like it's hilarious.

218
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.140
It did crazy. And I came out like genuinely, I feel good. You know,

219
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:19.890
I'm happy with my.
