00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.270
<v 0>3, 2 1. Yes. Hello, Boyan.</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.690
Hi there. Welcome. Thank you. Thanks for doing this. I really appreciate it.

3
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:12.480
And I love what you're doing. I've seen your Ted talk.

4
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:17.100
I've seen many in numerous conferences that you've appeared at and discussions

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.660
you've given on this and for people to jump into this right now,

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.460
what you've done is think long and hard and devise a method

7
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:31.170
to try to clean up some of the plastic that we have floating around in the

8
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:35.490
ocean famously the Pacific garbage patch is it's enormous patch of garbage

9
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.920
that's between California and Hawaii.

10
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.480
How did you get involved in this and what, what, what, you're a young guy.

11
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:47.250
How old are you? Uh, 23 already. 23 already. You sound like, oh my God.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.590
I'm sweating. How old were you when you started?

13
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.790
<v 1>Um, I think I started thinking about this when I was 16 and, uh,</v>

14
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.310
founded this organization when I was 18. That's.

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.450
<v 0>Crazy. All you lazy out there that are 16 years old,</v>

16
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:04.230
that aren't doing with your life. Just think about this kid. That's amazing.

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.440
I'm so happy that people like you in the world. No, thank you. Yeah.

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.800
So you started thinking about it when you were 16 and you know,

19
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.970
this is something that is extremely disturbing to anybody that's paid attention,

20
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:18.690
especially when you see the birds that have died with all these plastic bottle

21
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.760
caps inside their bodies. And, you know,

22
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:24.720
you see their carcasses with these multicolored caps in them and they thought

23
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:29.670
these things were food. It was just one of the many, many,

24
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:34.440
many problems that occur when you have plastic floating around and

25
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.650
just enormous numbers in the ocean. Sure.

26
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.710
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, there's really three problems with this plastic. First of all,</v>

27
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.750
obviously the ecosystem damage,

28
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.130
I think there are roundabout 800 species that actually could go extinct because

29
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:51.150
of this plastic pollution. Um, then there's the economic threat, uh,

30
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.070
in terms of, um, you know, uh,

31
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.430
damage to fisheries damage to tourism and things like that.

32
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.520
I think it's around $13 billion a year,

33
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:01.830
according to the UN and then thirdly,

34
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.580
there's the health impact or the potential health impact because these tiny

35
00:02:05.581 --> 00:02:09.600
plastic pieces, they are actually also end up in the fish we eat, uh,

36
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.810
that take chemicals with it. And, uh, yeah,

37
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.820
that ends up on our dinner plate as well.

38
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.090
<v 0>So what was it that prompted you to,</v>

39
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.210
to dedicate essentially dedicate your young life to this?

40
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.220
<v 1>Sure. Yeah. So, uh, I've always been very passionate about technology and just,</v>

41
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.870
uh, building things,

42
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.940
I think sort of having an idea in your mind and then seeing that become reality

43
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:34.590
and be able to touch it and things like that. I think, uh,

44
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:37.230
there's literally no better feeling in the world than that.

45
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.970
So I've been building my own things since it was two years old, I think, um,

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.670
first starting with things like tree houses and zip lines,

47
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.680
but then going into sort of computers and explosives and rockets and things like

48
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:54.300
that, which was a lot of fun, but it wasn't very, uh, useful, I would say. Um,

49
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.260
so it's kind of looking for something sort of, uh, something that real to, to,

50
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.400
to work on a real problem. Um,

51
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.670
and that's what I then came across when I was 16 years old,

52
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:08.020
it was scuba diving in Greece and I came across small plastic bags of fish and I

53
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.840
wondered, why can we just clean this up? And, uh,

54
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:15.670
that question sort of kept circling around in my head and, um,

55
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.460
yeah, sort of thought about how could we do this? The ocean is pretty big. Uh,

56
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.600
and then eventually came up with this idea do to use these natural ocean

57
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:25.540
currents, uh, to basically let us collect the plastic.

58
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.650
<v 0>And so how do you have many different</v>

59
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.120
prototypes that you started with and you eventually wound up with what you have

60
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:35.770
now and have you started implementing them yet?

61
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.540
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, so the, um, the,</v>

62
00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:42.160
the concept that was presented back in 2012 with my,

63
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.020
my first TEDx stoke, um, and if you compare that to where we are right now,

64
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:51.580
it's sort of day and night of, of a difference. Um, so, um, yeah,

65
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.750
through testing and through, uh, all these prototypings, um, yeah,

66
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.360
obviously there has been a lot of development there,

67
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:02.830
but the key idea has stayed the same that instead of going after the plastic

68
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:04.060
with boats and nets,

69
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.800
which will take roundabout 79,000 years to clean up just as great Pacific

70
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:13.150
garbage patch, instead of doing that, we let the plastic come to us. So use, uh,

71
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.600
basically a network, a fleet of very long floating barriers,

72
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.920
which are oriented in a U shape and they float around and they kind of act like

73
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.490
a massive Pac-Man. So, um, it's like a,

74
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.160
like a funnel brings the plastic towards it. Uh,

75
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.880
the natural ocean currents push it against it moves towards the center,

76
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.760
becomes very concentrated and once it's concentrated, well,

77
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:36.910
then it's easy to get it out and ship it to land for recycling.

78
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.830
And it has this started yet. Um, so the past, uh, so we were founded, um, yeah,

79
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.450
four years ago. Um, in that time, on one side we did the reconnaissance.

80
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:47.330
So we,

81
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.520
we mapped the patch with 30 boats and an airplane at the same time to really

82
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.930
understand how much is out there,

83
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:56.860
which turns out to be 1.8 trillion pieces of floating in this great Pacific

84
00:04:56.861 --> 00:05:00.550
garbage patch. Uh, and on the other hand, we've done all the testing.

85
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.220
So we've done hundreds of scale model tests.

86
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.960
We've done prototypes back in Europe, uh, on the north sea. Uh,

87
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.320
and actually right now we're, we're manufacturing the,

88
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.870
the first real cleanup system, which, uh, is scheduled to be launched, uh,

89
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.850
from San Francisco, uh,

90
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.730
to the great Pacific garbage patch in around two or three months, 10.

91
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.670
<v 0>So has anything been used, like,</v>

92
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:26.650
is there a proof of concept of have you've done like real large scale

93
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:28.990
testing where you've shown that you can actually do this?

94
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.840
<v 1>Well, I mean, we've done a lot of subsystem testing. So the,</v>

95
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.940
the prototypes in the north sea for example,

96
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:37.790
were sort of these 12 meter sections. And we, we managed to,

97
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:40.390
to keep that in one piece. So, um,

98
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.470
but then also the plastic capturing that worked very well in the lab. Um,

99
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.600
but yeah, the real,

100
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.340
the real proof of course has to come from this one real system in the great

101
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:53.260
Pacific garbage patch, collecting plastic.

102
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.480
And that's what we really hope to achieve.

103
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.320
<v 0>This year. So this is the big, right.</v>

104
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:59.720
The great Pacific garbage patch is the largest. Yes.

105
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.420
Because between California and Hawaii, Hawaii.

106
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.950
<v 1>Yeah. So there are five areas in the world where plastic, uh, concentrates, uh,</v>

107
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.780
this is by far the largest one there for others. Uh, but they are, uh,

108
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.130
they combined only, uh, contain less plastic than this one in the,

109
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.053
in the north Pacific.

110
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.920
<v 0>Do we know why that is? Uh, probably.</v>

111
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.810
<v 1>Because of Asia. Uh, so Asia has a, quite a big problem in terms of that.</v>

112
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.840
They, they use a lot of plastic, but they don't have a good infrastructure.

113
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.790
So by far the largest source of plastic flowing into the ocean is also this,

114
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.870
uh, there's one continent and what's being released there naturally by,

115
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.970
because of the current ends up in this north Pacific.

116
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.530
<v 0>The patch is such a strange problem because it wasn't something that was</v>

117
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.680
discussed in the eighties, the nineties, it was nothing.

118
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:48.140
And then all of a sudden, somewhere in the year, 2000,

119
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.860
I remember hearing about the massive amount of plastic we have in the ocean.

120
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:54.560
And it just, it just made sense. I was like, oh, well, of course,

121
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.790
of course it's going to wind up there, but the sheer size of it is staggering.

122
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.850
<v 1>Yeah. And I think that, to me, the worrying thing is that it's a,</v>

123
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.450
it's a persistent problem. So with many other kinds of pollutions,

124
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:09.500
when you sort of turn off the tap it's will be solved by itself. Think about,

125
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.480
for example, the ozone hall with the CFCs. Uh, but with this,

126
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:15.440
like if you turn off the tap,

127
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.470
but the problem is still there and in a hundred years, it will still be there.

128
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.970
Um, so I think to really solve it, you need to do two things. One side,

129
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.850
we have to close the tap. On the other hand, we also need to clean it up.

130
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.560
<v 0>Jamie just pulled up a, uh,</v>

131
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.990
a size comparison where it shows 1.6 million

132
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:37.790
square kilometers in area twice the size of Texas or three times the size of

133
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:38.600
France.

134
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.870
<v 1>Yeah. So this was a study. We published a few, a few weeks ago.</v>

135
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.770
So this was the result of the recognizance effort. Um,

136
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.910
and it's kind of funny,

137
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.660
like every other news outlet used a different size comparison.

138
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:55.630
So I think it was CNN that says it was the size of Mongolia. Um, um,

139
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.990
we always use tennis.

140
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:59.750
<v 0>Yeah. Texas is America. We use Texas for everything.</v>

141
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.270
<v 1>Tons of California as well. Um, so yeah, it's pretty.</v>

142
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.740
<v 0>It's insane. And it's getting bigger. I'm sure.</v>

143
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.400
<v 1>Yeah. So the, I mean the, the area doesn't really change. It's more the,</v>

144
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.050
the concentration and concentration.

145
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.460
<v 0>When did we realize that this was an issue like collectively scientists?</v>

146
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.073
<v 1>Yeah. Um,</v>

147
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:22.130
so there hasn't been that have been sort of small sampling efforts since the

148
00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:23.930
seventies. So back then,

149
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.200
it was the first time plastic was described as being something that floats in

150
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:30.710
the ocean. Uh, but it really only entered the public consciousness.

151
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:35.000
I think in the late nineties, there was this, uh, this captain, Charles Moore,

152
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.710
uh, who, um,

153
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.280
were sort of sailing through it and he saw this plastic and he was like, well,

154
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.680
um, we need to describe this. And then he did a scientific paper on it. And, um,

155
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.060
yeah. And actually, I think he was the one that termed the,

156
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.180
the term great Pacific garbage patch.

157
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.500
<v 0>He was riding his boat through it for a long period of time, I guess. Yeah.</v>

158
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.130
<v 1>I think it was, um, it was participating in some sailing race and, um,</v>

159
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.100
he went through it and then yeah, he just saw all that stuff.

160
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.900
<v 0>So he was the, sort of the Canary in the coal mine, I guess. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:07.980
So what,

162
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.900
what is it one of those things where it's hard to get different

163
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:15.810
governments to act on this because you know,

164
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.460
like who's responsible for the ocean.

165
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.360
<v 1>Yeah. I think it's a, it's sort of this tragic tragedy of the commons, right.</v>

166
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.200
Where it's international water sort of everyone's problem, but at the same time,

167
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:28.800
legally it's no one's problem. Um, so, um, yeah,

168
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.430
and besides that, uh, what,

169
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:35.520
what I really felt when I started the ocean cleanup was that think everyone

170
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.820
wanted this problem to be solved, but at the same time,

171
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.410
we didn't really have a way to do it.

172
00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:43.470
There was somebody wasn't any technology to do that. And, um,

173
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.430
that's why I thought, well,

174
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.260
perhaps this is an opportunity to combine my interests of a solving this

175
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:52.630
problem, but B also developing technology, which is that.
