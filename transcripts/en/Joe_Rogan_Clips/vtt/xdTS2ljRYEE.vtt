WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 1>Yeah, I wanted to state for the record though, the,</v>

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.710
the violence that happened after I was beat up was involving the men's rights

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.850
activist group and Antifa proud boys was holding. Uh,

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.850
they held this upward event in a different part of the city. Uh,

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.780
as far as I know, they did not. There was no, uh, conflict.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.150
<v 0>This, in this particular, right in the social club,</v>

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.590
who was the men's rights guy.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.870
<v 1>It was actually a woman, a woman.</v>

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.220
<v 0>Who's a men's rights person. Yes. That's hilarious. She must love Dick. Right.</v>

11
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.413
If you had a guess.

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.163
<v 1>No comment.</v>

13
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.580
<v 0>Sorry, I'm a comedian. Can't help. But, um, you don't even have to say her name,</v>

14
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.780
so she's she, she organized this thing. Yeah.

15
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.160
<v 1>I would say, um, here's the other thing, you know,</v>

16
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:54.990
like I might, what needs to be stated as well about, I guess,

17
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.390
the right wing movements that, um,

18
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.850
are in Portland or come to Portland to do these events.

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.850
There's an element of being provocative too as well,

20
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.570
but that should never ever justify the violence. Cause I mean.

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.020
<v 0>W w explain what you mean by being a provocateur?</v>

22
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.050
<v 1>Well, for example, holding, uh, an event in the middle of downtown titling it,</v>

23
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.480
um, like an event justice for victims of domestic terrorism,

24
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:25.620
and then having a picture of Antifa like that is an, you know,

25
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:28.500
it's an unflattering. Yes, it's an influx, you know,

26
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.790
it causes a reaction. Um, so there's a,

27
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.463
you know, there's a,

28
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.480
there's an element of coming in and seeing let's enrage,

29
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.350
these Luna takes on the far left or whatever. Um,

30
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.540
but at the same time,

31
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:50.070
I want to make sure I state that just because somebody is quote unquote

32
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:51.090
provocative too,

33
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.980
is a walk in the woods with a writing that it's unfortunate that people

34
00:01:55.981 --> 00:02:00.480
now find that that's justification for you to react.

35
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.200
<v 0>Well, I think, again, it's a small percentage of people that find it,</v>

36
00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.710
this justification. And you look at the number of people that were there.

37
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.720
What is it? Thousands, thousands of people,

38
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.790
how many people actually engage in violence.

39
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.290
<v 1>Small number.</v>

40
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.090
<v 0>But small number. That's the problem.</v>

41
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.890
<v 1>It's important to note that they caught morale from the crowd who would shoot.</v>

42
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.630
<v 0>Wearing them on the cowards, the cowards who don't disavow this horrific action.</v>

43
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.310
<v 1>They cheered them on laughed and clapped as I was getting beaten.</v>

44
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.820
And then the other thing about the people showing up in numbers,

45
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:34.420
who don't engage in the violence, the state,

46
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.890
they are like literal human shields. They dress the same.

47
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:42.360
So they make it easy for the few violent militants to dock into the crowd.

48
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.230
Exactly.

49
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.040
And these people also watched the cops and they keep an eye out on potential

50
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.210
outsiders as well.

51
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.490
<v 0>I'm a game, it's become a game. It's become a gigantic team war.</v>

52
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.740
There's our team versus their team. It's like,

53
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.700
it's literally like playing a child hood game. It's really disturbing,

54
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.560
man. And so since this has anyone from

55
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.150
Antifa apologized about what happened to you or disavow the

56
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.850
actions of these few extreme, violent people.

57
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.470
<v 1>Of course not. Um,</v>

58
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:19.060
Antifa has an iron fist on the people who support its

59
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:22.570
movements. They don't allow any type of design actually in there,

60
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.380
like press releases. You can call, call them. Um,

61
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.490
they explicitly state that even basically,

62
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:33.310
even if you disagree with our tactics, you will not publicly state it.

63
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.570
It's to create, I guess, as in image of unity. Right. For.

64
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.450
<v 0>And even if you disagree inside the organization. Yes.</v>

65
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.830
So how organized are they?

66
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.740
<v 1>They are able to leader their interest of Antifa.</v>

67
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:51.640
As we understand it today, really crystallize only after 2016,

68
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:56.140
there's been very little academic research until how they actually organized,

69
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.550
but basically as a movement,

70
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:01.900
they have essentially cells across the country that are semi

71
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.300
autonomous, United by an ideology of anarchy, an Arco,

72
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:10.690
communism, and their support for violence.

73
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.010
So it's not so much a group itself.

74
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.520
It's the people who are part of that movement are drawn from other actual

75
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:23.020
groups. They draw from the DSA, they draw from various workers, unions,

76
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.280
other anarchist groups,

77
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.350
and like other terrorist entities.

78
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.360
They have processes to radicalize, um,

79
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.230
sympathizers, essentially. They have their own literature as well.

80
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.720
And so it's much more organized than people give them credit for.

81
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.740
They think of them as just, you know, people showing up to fight on the street.

82
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:50.110
It's, there's, there's meaning to that,

83
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.880
to that violence and there's literature to back it up. And they have, you know,

84
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:59.350
they actively recruit people to join the movement. So,

85
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.530
um, I've been asked like, do you think the federal authorities should stop in,

86
00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:04.720
in my, my responses?

87
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:09.550
I think it's come to the point that they do because with Antifa, um, it's not,

88
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.200
it's beyond what local authorities can do because a lot has these people,

89
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.950
a lot of them are in Portland from Portland, but a lot of them come from,

90
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:20.110
for example, from Eugene, from Seattle,

91
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.430
from neighboring areas that have other Antifa people come in to

92
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.160
participate in the violence for that day or to help out.

93
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.790
And then they go back to where they're from. So they're,

94
00:05:29.791 --> 00:05:34.390
they're coming in and out of jurisdictions makes it hard for one local body of,

95
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.720
of authorities to address it. I think, um,

96
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.250
the DOJ needs to stop in, I think it's gotten to that point, but,

97
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.570
and with 2020 coming up soon, um,

98
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.860
there could be potential for a lot more political violence.

99
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.360
If the results don't, if the elections results don't go, as they wish.

100
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:56.440
<v 0>Well, that's a,</v>

101
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.920
an obvious considering the fact that this all became a thing after Trump was

102
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.690
elected. Yes. Um, with the, if the DOJ did step in,

103
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.800
what do you think they could do?

104
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.210
<v 1>So that's well.</v>

105
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.831
<v 0>I mean,</v>

106
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:17.660
do you believe in the ability to meet up and

107
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.520
express yourself publicly and the ability to protest and the ability

108
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:27.050
to just, uh, get together and have groups and,

109
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.390
and, you know, express yourself.

110
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.760
<v 1>Yes. However, that's not just what Antifa does.</v>

111
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.640
Like I said, the violence is a feature of their movement.

112
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.530
So what federal authorities.

113
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.040
<v 0>Can I stop you there? When you say the violence is a feature of their movement,</v>

114
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:43.874
is there, is it,

115
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.180
did they have anything written like the tenants of their movement where they say

116
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.560
that violence is acceptable?

117
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.150
<v 1>There's a book called the antifascist handbook is written by</v>

118
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.830
Mark Bray. He's an academic out doc myth. He is,

119
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.790
I would call him one of Antifa chief ideologues.

120
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:09.740
So not only does he explain what Antifa does and in his

121
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.320
writing scenes makes it very clear that the, um,

122
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.220
the quote unquote self-defense is what justifies the offense of violence.

123
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.450
He actually argues why that's ethical. So,

124
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.160
because he's an academic well-spoken, um,

125
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.720
he's invited onto mainstream media to explain to basically, like I said earlier,

126
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.850
mainstream, Antifa, what can.

127
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.380
<v 0>You explain what he says?</v>

128
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.990
<v 1>Yes. I highly recommend that people take a look at his book. Um,</v>

129
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.930
the attorney general in Minnesota, um,

130
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.690
Keith Ellison was photographed a year ago, holding,

131
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.860
holding up that book of Antifa book. And that kind of went, um,

132
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.410
he's been criticized a bit for that. And he deleted that in the chapter.

133
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.040
My beading.

134
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.540
<v 0>Was holding it up in support.</v>

135
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.640
<v 1>Yeah. He said this. He said, uh,</v>

136
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.920
something about like this book or Antifa strikes,

137
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:01.010
fear into the heart of Donald Trump. Yeah.

138
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.260
So there's people in government who has sympathetic to anti-Facebook.

139
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.470
<v 0>But this professor can explain what he says.</v>

140
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:15.260
<v 1>He outlines and explains</v>

141
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.690
essentially why auntie's FAS violence is

142
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:21.524
ethical.

143
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.900
That it's because they're opposing fascism and fascism

144
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.880
is a violent movement. This is sort of a preemptive move. Like we have to.

145
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.330
<v 0>Fascism. Yeah. It is a problem, right? Yes.</v>

146
00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.480
Cause it seems like that's definitely something you should oppose,

147
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.290
but what is the, what's the actual definition of fascism.

148
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.000
<v 1>Fascism as a far-right political ideology?</v>

149
00:08:47.001 --> 00:08:48.530
From what I understand is.

150
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.780
<v 0>I love the definition, Jamie. So we could just read what fascism,</v>

151
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.040
the actual word fascism means here,

152
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.550
form of radical right wing authoritarian, authoritarian,

153
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.170
ultra nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power,

154
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.850
forcible suppression of opposition and strong regimentation of society and of

155
00:09:08.851 --> 00:09:12.810
the economy, which came to prominence in early 20th century, Europe,

156
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.280
um, forcible suppression of put the back up,

157
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:22.080
please forcible suppression of opposition is what they're doing. Yes.

158
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.530
Strong regimentation of society. I mean, they're,

159
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:30.240
they're literally telling people how to behave and what they will

160
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:32.520
tolerate. I know it's not right wing ideology,

161
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.740
but it's almost like fascism and I'm sure there's other definitions of fascism.

162
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:42.780
The idea of supporting someone who opposes fascism sounds wonderful.

163
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:44.790
It sounds great. Let's let's stop fascism,

164
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.630
but are we really experiencing authoritarian,

165
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:53.310
ultra nationalism characterized by dictatorial power in this country? I mean,

166
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:57.630
is that, is that a fair thing to say? I know people don't like Donald Trump.

167
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.720
I know people don't like right-wing ideologies running this country.

168
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.490
I understand that, but this is not, this is not what's happening.

169
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:07.410
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:12.300
They issue like fascism as defined by political theorists who

171
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:14.880
have been researching this for decades.

172
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.960
It has a particular definition in meaning and that's, um,

173
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.760
I think that summarizes it pretty well.

174
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.710
I'm very concerned that people use it so flippantly to just refer to the right

175
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.260
or to even authoritarianism,

176
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:31.170
like there's much more to it than just being authoritarian.

177
00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:35.040
There's all those other components. And I need it.

178
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.180
It's important to state that Antifa is not just supposed to fall, right.

179
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.060
Or the right. They're also against liberal democracy.

180
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:46.560
There's a reason why they hate the police so much hate

181
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.350
border enforcement and hate the rule of law.

182
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.460
It's against died the concept of the nation state,

183
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:57.270
as we understand it. And they're working to dismantle that to de legitimize it.

184
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.080
So, um, this is what I mean when I say it's a,

185
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.030
it's a dangerous ideology that for now, you know, enemy of my enemy is your, um,

186
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.190
is your friend. But at some point,

187
00:11:08.191 --> 00:11:11.220
if this movement becomes bigger,

188
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.070
more mainstream and more people are sympathetic. At some point,

189
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:18.240
it's going to come back against the moderate left

190
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.470
because these people, um,

191
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.440
they want to see the destruction of the nation.

192
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.950
<v 0>Did want to see the destruction of the nation state for what purpose they want</v>

193
00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:34.180
anarchy. Yes. So they're political NRS, anarchist,

194
00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:37.810
social anarchists. They don't want borders. They don't want nations.

195
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.840
They don't want police. Correct. What do they want

196
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.820
be? I mean, what do they expect? What's the ultimate goal. They.

197
00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.660
<v 1>To believe in a</v>

198
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.920
utopian mocks, this ideas, right.

199
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.240
Of this restrict redistribution of wealth,

200
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:02.530
where we can be,

201
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.150
we can only be truly equal in egalitarian when we dismantle

202
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.620
everything about the country. So not just, you know, its institutions,

203
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.330
the rule of law, but the state itself,

204
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.260
like everything just has to be broken down and start over because it's

205
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.970
irredeemable. I'm not quite sure. I, if, I mean, they've, um,

206
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.390
you know, Antifa, um,

207
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.730
I can't think of like where they have had,

208
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.570
if there's any somewhat comparable examples around the world of what it looks

209
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:34.990
like for them to, um, do state building. Right.

210
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.200
So we don't know what it would actually look like, but I mean,

211
00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:41.410
the examples we see from these smaller anecdotes is it's,

212
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:45.700
it's chaos and anarchy like absolute chaos and,

213
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.860
um, violent suppression of opposing views, um,

214
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.490
indiscriminate violence at times. Um,

215
00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.990
I wonder,

216
00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:03.460
and what I've been asking over and over is how many more people have to be

217
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:04.720
drawn into,

218
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.730
have to be victims of this violence before something changes.

219
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.110
And I put in Portland now we've had three years with us and

220
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.980
literally no policy changes have happened.

221
00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.000
No even proposals have even been accepted by the mayor. The previous.

222
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.560
<v 0>This mayor was what was his political persuasion or her,</v>

223
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.663
I don't even know.

224
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.510
<v 1>Well, the people who've become elected mayor and Portland's are typically</v>

225
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.340
establishment Democrats, right?

226
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.810
So they themselves are moderate very much, uh, you know,

227
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:41.380
in the vein of, um, uh, Hillary Clinton type of thing.

228
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.330
But there's a constituency in Portland that they have to play

229
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:49.000
to four votes, which is the

230
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.820
radical people who are sympathetic to very,

231
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:57.280
very progressive causes.

232
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.550
And so there's a reason why to date.

233
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.050
The mayor has never named Antifa one time in any of his press conferences.

234
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.940
He has no problem blaming proud boys or Patriot pair the right for issues,

235
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:10.780
Patriot prayer.

236
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:12.340
<v 0>The another group.</v>

237
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.970
<v 1>Patriot prayer is one of the other right wing movements in, uh,</v>

238
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.740
in and around Portland that have held pro-Trump events in town that

239
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:23.350
Antifa comes to, to fight and oppose.

240
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.720
<v 0>And how those turnout.</v>

241
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.600
<v 1>They devolve into riots.</v>

242
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.360
<v 0>And the police allowed us.</v>

243
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:34.870
<v 1>They allow it through their inaction.</v>

244
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:37.803
<v 0>Wow.</v>

245
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.230
<v 2>Okay.</v>
