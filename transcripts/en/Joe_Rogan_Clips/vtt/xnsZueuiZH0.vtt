00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.670
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.570
but there was a guy that we've made fun of a bunch on the show who was, uh,

3
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.890
a pastor to a lot of famous people. He was like the hip young pastor.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.730
We just got busted, just got busted, banging some chick. Yeah.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.550
And we made fun of him because I'm like, look, there's this guys.

6
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.760
There's no way this guy's religious. This is what I was saying,

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
because he was wearing these shorts that showed what I called his Dick root.

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.410
Like he wears these shorts that go way low,

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.900
which you just don't wear your shorts like that.

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.600
Unless you want someone to think about your penis, right? Like that's,

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.640
that's why you wear your shorts like that maybe in the seventies. But I mean,

12
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:37.881
I'm not,

13
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:42.200
there's no reason to gotcha guys who wear their shorts that low right there.

14
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.270
They're being overtly sexual to people, but they don't even necessarily know.

15
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.250
Right. You're trying to, and you want everyone to look at your chiseled body,

16
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.320
you know, like this is none of the,

17
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.150
there's a reason why monks dress in these like very modest clothes that

18
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:02.930
cover everything. They don't even want to think about their body. Right. And,

19
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.970
um, that is a part of the religion of both celebrity

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.760
and social media, right.

21
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.680
That this guy has got these traditional Christian ideas

22
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.660
fused in with the religion of celebrity in with the religion of

23
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:24.290
social media. And then you're seeing that it doesn't really work because,

24
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:28.280
you know, like what, what's the reward for those, those behaviors,

25
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.360
the reward is he wants to like that guy wants people to,

26
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.370
that guy wants people to lust after him. And, uh, it,

27
00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:37.850
it wound up sabotaging him.

28
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.990
<v 1>Absolutely. Ultimately, absolutely. Um, I think, yeah, it's a,</v>

29
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:46.700
it's an Allah morality story of some kind of rural sale. You know, this is a,

30
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.200
uh, kind of, um,

31
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.710
celebrity fame kind of pursuing the trick goes wrong.

32
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.300
<v 0>It's a trap because if you achieve, like, what do you, what if you're,</v>

33
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:01.370
you're lusting after this, uh,

34
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:06.080
this attention and this sexual praise and he want people to

35
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.250
last after you,

36
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:11.630
you also want them to think of you as being someone who is more enlightened than

37
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:12.201
everyone else,

38
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:15.950
which is why you're willing to stand in front of them and give these

39
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.270
emotional,

40
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.650
profound sermons in the first place that resonates with all these lost young

41
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:22.484
people.

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.660
<v 1>Well, right. And historically there's, um,</v>

43
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.490
a lot of overlap between sort of celebrity and, um,

44
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.500
religious preaching people like Billy Sunday, or sure. You know, others that,

45
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.160
you know, th that that's the,

46
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.650
the religious leader becomes a celebrity and those lines get blurred.

47
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:45.770
And it all becomes entertainment, which yup.

48
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.270
<v 0>For celebrities,</v>

49
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.680
there's a need for that because they feel very lost and disconnected because

50
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:55.580
they've achieved the thing that they've always desired and they still feel lost.

51
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.730
Like everyone's looks at certain celebrities and then go, Oh, my you've made it.

52
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.990
Your life must be heaven and they're depressed and all up.

53
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.030
And we don't have any sympathy for them. Right.

54
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.570
There's no one that's going to be sympathy sympathetic to Justin Bieber with no

55
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.470
$300 million in the bank and having sex with anybody who wants to like,

56
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.840
you for being depressed. He's a little piece of.

57
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.570
You've been famous your whole life. But for him,

58
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.770
it's probably very confusing because first of all,

59
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.570
particularly like the really young people who became famous while they were

60
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:33.430
young, like I had Miley Cyrus on who I think is incredibly talented,

61
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.140
brilliant, brilliantly, talented. Her voice is fantastic. I mean, so soulful,

62
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.830
but she got famous when she was 12. I have a 12 year old man.

63
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.030
I can't even imagine.

64
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.220
I can't imagine being the boss and filling arenas when you're

65
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.210
12 it's madness. Right. And no one survives it. Right. They don't, I mean,

66
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.520
maybe a few have gotten through it and they're saying right,

67
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.200
but most of them don't, and that's where celebrity preachers come in,

68
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.550
where someone can harness your,

69
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.320
your celebrity and it boosts them up. And they can also provide you.

70
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.410
Maybe even maybe if it's disingenuous,

71
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:16.330
but some sort of a structure that makes you feel like there's more

72
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.220
that you, that you can,

73
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.880
you can cling to something that's going to make sense of this all.

74
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.560
And that's something is Jesus, right. Or Muhammad or whatever it is,

75
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:30.760
whatever it is that you, you cling to whatever structure that you cling to.

76
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.650
Right. Buddha, whatever it is. Right.

77
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.990
<v 1>And that can be exploited, especially in those situations.</v>

78
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:41.850
I think because of what you were saying, a gap or absence, you know,

79
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.050
Oh God, I got here and you know, is this all there is.

80
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.470
<v 0>With the children in particular because there's not, Oh God, I got there. It's,</v>

81
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:50.450
I've never been normal.

82
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.500
<v 1>Well, that, especially, it's like.</v>

83
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.640
<v 0>Having cement, but you've never added water. Right. Like it's never,</v>

84
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.450
there's something missing. Yeah. Well, you didn't grow up. Right.

85
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.180
<v 1>And on many of them don't, they don't survive, survive. And, and, uh,</v>

86
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.690
yeah. Obviously drugs can be a one way to,

87
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.520
it's the most common way to, to deal. Yeah. You know, try to try to deal.

88
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.060
Yeah.

89
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.380
<v 0>I'm, I'm, I'm well aware of a lot of people, uh, in,</v>

90
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:23.220
in the whole Hollywood show business world that grew up famous and

91
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.390
almost none of them survive. Yeah. Yeah. Rob Lowe did though,

92
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.030
Rob Lowe got famous, real young. He's super normal.

93
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.330
He might be like one of the only ones I've ever met and I've hung out with him.

94
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.660
Right. And I've hung out also more importantly with him and his son.

95
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.750
Who's also really normal and really well adjusted,

96
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.330
but he also got clean and sober. Right.

97
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.590
<v 1>Right, right, right. Yeah. So yeah. I mean, he made it, he made it,</v>

98
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.360
but very few.

99
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.680
<v 0>It's also very beautiful. Yeah. It's probably easy to be Rob Lowe. Right.</v>

100
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.060
Imagine he's gotta be what, he's 40, 30. No, he's older.

101
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.910
That he's older than me. I'm 53. I believe Rob is 45. Yeah. Okay.

102
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.470
Well anyway, there you go.

103
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:08.240
He's one of the few that got famous very young and has navigated it

104
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:10.500
through with grace. But, uh,

105
00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:14.840
I think the ones that are children that grow up child stars, the,

106
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.160
you know, the ones on Mickey mouse show and that kind of. Good luck.

107
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.870
<v 1>No, I mean that's.</v>

108
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.130
<v 0>So they find the celebrity preachers. This is often what happens.</v>

109
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.330
They find gurus, they find celebrity preachers. Right, right. Yeah.

110
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.830
Someone who tries to make sense of things for them.

111
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.970
<v 1>What do we look forward to, to put our faith in? You know, and,</v>

112
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:38.200
and that's that they're there too is a pretty common universal, um, uh,

113
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.350
aspect of human life is in the product. I have something to believe in.

114
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.860
<v 0>Poor gurus. They fall into the trap too,</v>

115
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.770
because now they can leech off the success of these famous people and become

116
00:06:47.771 --> 00:06:51.610
famous themselves. Right. And maybe they haven't really

117
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.790
immunized themselves and not related themselves to the power

118
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.780
of celebrity. Sure. It's a very intoxicating drug.

119
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.230
Like you got to understand how to, how to avoid it. Right.

120
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.600
And avoid the pitfalls of it. It's not easy. Yeah.

121
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.400
<v 1>Yeah. Well, again, that's,</v>

122
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.600
that's the life that everyone wants. I mean, that's,

123
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.980
that's part of the pressure I assume. Um, for a lot of people is just, you know,

124
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.510
the, the American public,

125
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:24.160
the global audiences are going to be transfixed on, on, on,

126
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:27.640
you know, and also, you know, want what you have, but.

127
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.070
<v 0>We can really learn from those, those preachers,</v>

128
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.360
those preachers that only go after the like, really like, not,

129
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:38.650
not only go after, but, uh, attract celebrities.

130
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.850
Like there's something to that weird sort of parasitic genre

131
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.600
of, you know, of preacher.

132
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.610
<v 1>Right? No, I agree. I think it's right for study. There's been any kinds of,</v>

133
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.500
um, well certainly, I mean, we've seen that, well, I'm sticking to drugs, man,

134
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.400
for now. I don't want to go, well, everybody's a drug intoxication.

135
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.320
Now this is sort of what we're after it takes some form.

136
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.480
<v 0>Celebrity. I think there's a drug and soul.</v>

137
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.440
There there's several drugs that are mixed together and sort of a concoction.

138
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.730
There's a drug of celebrity, which, uh, you know, for sure is a drug.

139
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.610
And then there's also a drug at being the person who has the answers.

140
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.631
Definitely.

141
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:23.950
And there's something that people do when they convince other people that they

142
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:28.450
have the answers that it elevates their mood and their

143
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:32.260
perspective. That's like some weird guru drug. Yeah.

144
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.350
So there's the guru drug. And then there's the celebrity drug.

145
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.320
<v 1>We're Nate, we're identifying a whole nexus of.</v>

146
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.800
<v 0>And would that guy was the sex drug? Cause he's a beautiful man.</v>

147
00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:45.490
He's a handsome, tall ripped shredded.

148
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.730
<v 1>Right, right, right. A lot of drugs going on there. Well,</v>

149
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:53.860
and I wonder how extensive it all was extensive. Well, in terms of his,

150
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.080
you know, whatever of activities he was engaged in the God-man. Yeah.

151
00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.390
<v 0>And I think with people like, then this is where it's,</v>

152
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:07.160
I'm going to give a simplistic perspective. I think he could have, uh,

153
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.380
benefited from real drugs.

154
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.840
So I think a person who's involved in those three weird drugs could have been

155
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.190
they've really, really good.

156
00:09:16.191 --> 00:09:19.100
Have benefited from psychedelics because psychedelics would have let you say,

157
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.530
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, do you see what you're doing?

158
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.410
Because I see what you're doing. Right. Like a dog. So it's an,

159
00:09:24.411 --> 00:09:28.940
I know what you're doing. You're pretending you're pretending to be profound.

160
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.420
You're pretending to be pious. You're pretending to be enlightened.

161
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:35.450
You're pretending to be above it all, but you're not, no,

162
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.360
you're just one of us. Right.

163
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.820
<v 1>It can be, uh, pretty, pretty destabilizing, you know, for someone like that,</v>

164
00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:46.070
but also transformative.

165
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.930
<v 0>That's where the real benefit in those de-stabilizing I think so too well,</v>

166
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.270
I've tell people I like getting paranoid from pot.

167
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.630
It's one of my favorite parts because when it's over, I feel good.

168
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.850
It's like a near death experience that you always survive.

169
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.770
<v 1>It didn't happen. You're okay.</v>

170
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:06.020
<v 0>The lesson in it, that that fear comes with a lesson and that,</v>

171
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.940
that insecurity comes with the lesson.

172
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:12.560
And I think part of the lesson is appreciate the moment of life,

173
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.800
appreciate life, appreciate this. Right. You know,

174
00:10:15.801 --> 00:10:20.240
and when you're all up on, on pot, you know, everything's crazy.

175
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.430
Like when it's over, you can like right.

176
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.450
You relax and you can appreciate things in a different way. Right.

177
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.910
Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.

178
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.060
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

179
00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:37.490
they're going to be available everywhere. But after December 1st,

180
00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:41.180
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

181
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.200
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

182
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.000
That's all we're asking. Go download Spotify, Bubba.

183
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>
