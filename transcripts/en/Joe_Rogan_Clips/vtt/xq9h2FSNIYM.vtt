00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.840
<v 3>Hey, I was supposed to do this the other day, but we didn't the candles.</v>

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.120
I had a party, uh, party. I had a podcast, it was kind of a party. Uh,

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.200
Shane Gillis, Mark Norman, listen this morning at the gym. And, uh.

5
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.080
<v 1>Careful, once you open that bag, it's not gets an gly. Oh, geez.</v>

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.960
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.830
<v 1>Smelling salts. You're supposed to open your eyes and waft.</v>

8
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.670
<v 0>It. Don't sniff it, bro. Just the, just that or that's why.</v>

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.670
<v 1>I've be kept it. I took it.</v>

10
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.790
<v 0>Off my house and that's fully sealed. Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.510
Well smelling salts. Can I try one? Well, you don't try one.

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.670
It's like just open up the be this is the idea. Okay. Uh,

13
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.740
there's a gentleman on the podcast. The other day is a power lifter.

14
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.180
Rob Cooney and Rob, uh, told us we were talking about smelling salts,

15
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.820
the gay power lifter guy. Yeah. His world strongest gay is his Instagram. Right.

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.740
And he was telling us about God

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.020
it's nasty. Um, he was telling us about smelling salts.

18
00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:59.380
We're talking about smelling salts and about like, it's a big deal.

19
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.810
And he has actually a smelling salt spell answer.

20
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.770
So Jamie went out and got some smelling salts. All right.

21
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.450
And just open that bag. Don't even bottle by the way,

22
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:11.730
the bottle is completely sealed. Okay. But if you just open up the bag,

23
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.730
you'll smell how ranked that is. It.

24
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.450
<v 2>Also has the emblem from the Saul movies on it, which is way dicey. Get.</v>

25
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.650
<v 0>A with. Wow. Wow. Oh,</v>

26
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.240
and that's a sealed bottle. We're live.

27
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.433
<v 2>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

28
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.720
<v 0>It's fully plastic sealed. I feel like we should open it, but if we open it,</v>

29
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.520
is it bad to open it in this room? Nah, but we can handle some.

30
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.440
<v 1>The warning says like, don't, don't smell it more than a couple times a day.</v>

31
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.470
So like.

32
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.760
<v 0>Look, but listen. This smell like folks,</v>

33
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.870
I just want you to know we're freaking out about the smell and the plastic is

34
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.510
hear that that's Theo taking the plastic off the bottle so that was sealed up.

35
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.110
Oh my God. Oh, I'll do.

36
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.990
<v 2>A couple of these on I'm through.</v>

37
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.790
<v 0>Some things. Okay. Get a whiff, bro. It is in rock. Don't spill.</v>

38
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.350
<v 1>It. You're not you're supposed, I think you're supposed to leave it in there.</v>

39
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:01.670
I don't think you're supposed to take it out. Okay.

40
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.670
<v 2>Okay. You have.</v>

41
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.540
<v 0>To shake. I think you just take a, wh.</v>

42
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.493
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;.</v>

43
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.500
<v 0>They do that right before they lift. Are you okay? Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

44
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.100
<v 2>Before.</v>

45
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.900
<v 0>They lift what bro, before they lift weights, you're not.</v>

46
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.900
<v 2>Supposed to, before they lift the universe before they lift their future,</v>

47
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.930
take a Gander on that with your friends. Something face hit,

48
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.610
take a Gander on that. With that face hitter, Joe.

49
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.330
<v 0>There's something about just holding it over here as rough.</v>

50
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.930
But there's something about this stuff that like when you take a whiff of it

51
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.410
right before you lift, it's supposed to like jolt your,

52
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.050
your nervous system. Right? Is that.

53
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.490
<v 1>The idea? I think it's so you forget about everything else. Except for that.</v>

54
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.890
I have.

55
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.200
<v 2>No take a ride on that hitter. Boom.</v>

56
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.120
<v 0>Oh my God. Oh, there goes down. Holy.</v>

57
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.560
Is that shocking? Oh my God. Oh my God. That's stunning.

58
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.600
I would've never imagined take that to the.

59
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.320
<v 2>Fights this week. That's something you buy at a Nelly concert.</v>

60
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.600
<v 0>Fights case. Anybody needs it. You could use it that lid. Oh Jesus.</v>

61
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.200
Give that plastic bag too. Oh, that's so unnecessary. You wanna try? I'm great.

62
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.800
No, I believe you. No, it's not that bad. Well it's it's not, it's painful.

63
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.030
<v 1>It the worst than that rice. That drink.</v>

64
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.750
<v 2>Yeah. It's get a hit. Jamie. You're gonna be fine. You're.</v>

65
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.030
<v 0>An adult. My friend Megan gave me this drink from Mexico.</v>

66
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.390
It was like turpentine. Yeah. It lights on fire.

67
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.950
Whoa. Right? Like whoa, Nellie.

68
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.910
I'm tearing up. I got.

69
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.020
<v 2>One of my eyes. Tiered. What is the, is.</v>

70
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.500
<v 0>That ammonia? Right? I don't know what the it is. And it's Rob,</v>

71
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.580
Rob takes a sniff of that for power lift. I feel like.

72
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.180
<v 1>I've smelled that one. That kid pukes in elementary school.</v>

73
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:53.420
That's what they used to like clean.

74
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.300
<v 0>It up or spray. Oh, I think that's different. That's in rock form.</v>

75
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.210
I think that's much more potent. You okay? Yeah. I'm good.

76
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.210
Just one put as the bag. Oh, that.

77
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.850
<v 2>Ack. Huh? Oh boy. And y'all can't handle that smoke baby.</v>

78
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.130
<v 0>So Rob like will take a sniff of those before he like lifts a four 50 pound</v>

79
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.690
log over his head. I could.

80
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.090
<v 2>See that. I definitely feel more clear.</v>

81
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.130
I feel like it's a whole bag of native American right there, baby. &lt;laugh&gt;.

82
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.890
<v 0>Do you think you should take a sniff in that before you go on stage maybe?</v>

83
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.920
<v 2>Oh, I don't know. He almost gets you too separate from your thoughts.</v>

84
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.800
<v 0>Right? It's so wild. Yeah. It's so jolting.</v>

85
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.840
<v 2>It's good, man. Thank you for that. I think all.</v>

86
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.400
<v 0>Those power lifters use it though. Don't I think all of them do, right? Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.230
Most, mostly. Yeah. It's a big deal. I've seen those guys. They do.

88
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.230
And sometimes they get smacked in the face. Like their,

89
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.830
their girlfriend will smack 'em they there's a bunch of these videos of this

90
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:47.430
one, dude.

91
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.230
<v 2>To toughen their cheeks up. Wake you up from being knocked.</v>

92
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.990
<v 1>Out. Right. Smell the same. Like when they break the little thing and.</v>

93
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.830
<v 0>They like, yeah. I think that's exactly the same thing. Yes. Yeah. Oh.</v>

94
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.590
<v 2>That would wake me up. I'd be dead.</v>

95
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:59.510
That'd break me back at least for a few minutes. Wow.

96
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.460
<v 0>Jesus Christ. And we are back man. And we're back. Whoa.</v>

97
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.940
My nose is still infected with it. Like when I take a deep breath,

98
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.860
I still smell it.

99
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.260
Imagine how small those particles are and they're just inside your nose. Well.

100
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.660
<v 2>Also we didn't even get any of the dust out. Like that's in a rock.</v>

101
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.700
People don't understand. I think also do you see it's in a it's in a, yeah.

102
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.930
<v 0>I didn't even look in there like a crystal something.</v>

103
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:22.763
<v 2>I just trust you.</v>

104
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.810
<v 0>Oh it is.</v>

105
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:24.643
<v 2>I didn't look in there.</v>

106
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.010
<v 0>But I just went like that. I just, I didn't even,</v>

107
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.170
I didn't have it more than like five inches from my nose.

108
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.890
It sounds like it's still in wide open in the room. Exactly. I like it.

109
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:35.850
It's in your nose. Yeah.

110
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.570
<v 2>Oh God I'm ready. I mean, I,</v>

111
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.680
I like that a little I'll hit a mark or sometime I'll hit a, uh, I like markers.

112
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.560
I'll go three hits on dust or dude, not enough to damage myself,

113
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.240
but I will take a risk with it. You know?

114
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.240
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;, there's something about magic markers. Delicious.</v>

115
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.280
<v 2>Oh, I think even hot. Those hop. Oh.</v>

116
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 0>That's.</v>

117
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.080
<v 2>A nice smell. And then smile at somebody after that was my favorite thing to do.</v>

118
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.233
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;.

119
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.800
<v 0>Do you like gasoline when you pump your gas.</v>

120
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.640
<v 2>Dude, we had a guy drank gasoline on Halloween one time, this kid Todd, and got,</v>
