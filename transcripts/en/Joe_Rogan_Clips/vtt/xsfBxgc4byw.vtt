00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 1>Experience, you know, so I'm in there and the doctor says it,</v>

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:07.500
no one can come see you. So I'm going,

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.720
if these are the last two days of my life,

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.510
I'm going to die alone in this hospital.

6
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.420
And it just broke me up so bad that,

7
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.710
you know, I've taken care of myself, I've done everything I can, you know,

8
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.340
to take care of myself. And why am I lying in this bed right now? You know?

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.580
And it was a thing where,

10
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.580
when I did think about my wife, it was,

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.570
I will never see my wife and two kids again, you know,

12
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:38.700
that that's all that went through. My mind is like I.

13
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.270
<v 2>Did they put you on a ventilator? No.</v>

14
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.410
<v 1>My doctor saved my life. My doctor said, if we put you on a ventilator,</v>

15
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.840
he said that he says, cause a nurse brought her up.

16
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.390
Should we put them on a ventilator? And he goes, no way.

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.800
If we put them on a ventilator,

18
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:56.550
he's going to die because his body is going to say, okay,

19
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.430
this machine is breathing for us. We don't need to work anymore.

20
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.640
And your body shuts down. If you've heard in New York,

21
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.160
80% of the people put on ventilators die.

22
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.140
<v 2>And that's why you think.</v>

23
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.920
<v 1>I think that's why I five. I've heard.</v>

24
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.400
<v 2>That. I've, I've heard that being speculated by other doctors as well.</v>

25
00:01:12.401 --> 00:01:16.330
And it's very controversial because so many doctors put people on ventilators.

26
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.030
And the last thing they want to hear is another doctor saying,

27
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.280
you've put someone on a ventilator. They will die. But that.

28
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.790
<v 1>My doctor said that straight up in the room in front of me to the nurses,</v>

29
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.360
like if we put them on it, he's going to die. Because his thing was,

30
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.190
it just makes sense why he would,

31
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.170
because now this machine is going to breathe for him. So his body's not gonna,

32
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.050
it's like working out, you don't work out a muscle. It gets weak, right.

33
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.120
This machine is doing all your lifting.

34
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.590
So why would we want to put them on that? Unless it's, it's just,

35
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:46.630
we have to put them on it, you know?

36
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.130
But you've heard doctors we're putting on people so fast because their oxygen

37
00:01:51.131 --> 00:01:55.990
levels were so low. Right? They're like this isn't, this is not normal.

38
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.510
So we need to do something to get their oxygen level up.

39
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.080
<v 2>I think doctors are like everything else. Right? There's really good ones.</v>

40
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.070
Then there's ones that aren't as good. No, it's true with everything else,

41
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:09.430
with everything. Carpenters, plumbers, everything, every everything.

42
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.390
<v 1>And it's really, I look back, I'm still, now I've become very close to him.</v>

43
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.520
And the dude saved my life. Cause if I went on a ventilator, bro, I don't,

44
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.070
I may not be here because I was on.

45
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.740
<v 2>A ventilator. They kind of knock you out.</v>

46
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.560
<v 1>You're unconscious. Literally that machine is doing all your breathing. Right.</v>

47
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.390
<v 2>I don't understand how we could take three more months off.</v>

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.970
<v 0>Um, well it depends what they mean by, I mean, you know, when you talk,</v>

49
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.370
when you hear the governor talk, it's, you know,

50
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:43.150
he's moving it along and he's in these phases and we're getting and pushing it

51
00:02:43.151 --> 00:02:45.640
through and it says it doesn't, I don't,

52
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.290
I don't think it's going to be as I'm stammering because the realization I don't

53
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:54.910
w I don't think it's going to be like what it was in

54
00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:58.750
April in may. Why not July? Because,

55
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.730
because I want.

56
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.810
<v 2>To go outside. I think so, too. Ellie county breaches, uh,</v>

57
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.300
beaches reopen May 13th.

58
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.200
<v 0>Yes, but you can't hang out on your lounge. You can't hang out on your towel.</v>

59
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.034
You gotta go in.

60
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.460
<v 2>Make that larger. Please go back to where it was. You can do water sports,</v>

61
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.930
More sitting on the sand canopies coolers or picnicking.

62
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.720
<v 0>Right? You can, uh, you can be active. You can.</v>

63
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.930
<v 2>Go swim and lots are closed. So where they expect you to park.</v>

64
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.960
<v 0>They don't want you to go individual.</v>

65
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.210
<v 2>Family activities and exercise only.</v>

66
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.060
<v 0>Hmm. Yeah. So you can go down, you can swim.</v>

67
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:37.240
You could ride the waves and then get out of the ocean and get back in your car.

68
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.770
No.

69
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.120
<v 2>Thinking you can't pick Nick.</v>

70
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.980
<v 0>No biking, no biking. No. Why.</v>

71
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.813
<v 2>Can't you bike?</v>

72
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.800
<v 0>I have to say no volleyball that you see that brown circle with a slash through</v>

73
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:51.760
it with the giant canopies. Those should be banned all year.

74
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.350
Have you ever been next to one of those?

75
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.190
<v 2>Oh, these are disgusting. Oh my why? Why are you allowed to set up camp?</v>

76
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.810
Building a house? You're basically saying this is my area of the sandwich.

77
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.400
Like blocking.

78
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.233
<v 0>Everyone's view.</v>

79
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.400
<v 2>Yeah. You can get a towel. That's what you can get.</v>

80
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.560
You get a towel and that's it. It's how it's always been.

81
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.570
<v 0>No, these people come down there.</v>

82
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.600
They've got coolers and tables higher than the.

83
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.620
<v 2>They seem to have fences. Now people are setting up beach fences. Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:19.510
They're selling beach fences. You set it up,

85
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.240
you stick it in the sand and you mark off your area. Oh.

86
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.073
<v 0>My gosh.</v>

87
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.050
<v 2>We're creating dorks. Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.150
<v 0>This is all before social distance.</v>

89
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:33.130
These are just people making camps there and bring 25 people. A Hazel.

90
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.830
<v 2>Reopens. Tomorrow's what they're saying. Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.663
<v 0>Baby. Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.430
<v 2>Well, that's good. That's a, that's a start.</v>

93
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.190
I think we need to move in the other direction.

94
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:44.290
I think we need to quarantine people that are at risk.

95
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.040
That's what I think really. And then let people make their own choices.

96
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.150
You know, this, the,

97
00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:54.040
the idea that these hospitals are going to be overwhelmed is not true.

98
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.250
It's not correct. Luckily we're very fortunate. Yeah.

99
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.220
And the idea that we're going to run out of ventilators, that's not true either.

100
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.120
Right? So,

101
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.840
and then also if that doctor that worked with Michael yo was telling you this

102
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:08.140
before we started, the doctor said that if you put him on a ventilator,

103
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:09.940
he would die. Um,

104
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.720
cause his body would stop trying to breathe and it would just sort of give up.

105
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.550
And this is what Michael Yos doctors told him. And he, he survived.

106
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.970
And then we're finding out that a lot of people they put on ventilators don't

107
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:26.350
make it. And I wonder if what he's saying applies to those people.

108
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:27.251
<v 3>The main,</v>

109
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:30.610
one of the main things besides age that regulates the immune system is like

110
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.000
previous exposure to viruses. Like,

111
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.990
so I thought that was really interesting. And in particular, one, one virus,

112
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.500
the psychometric megla virus CMV did, you know,

113
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:45.160
like between 50 to 80% of the us population, has it like,

114
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.750
at least by the time they're like an adult.

115
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.220
<v 2>How's it permanently? Or.</v>

116
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.070
<v 3>It's a, it's a herpes virus. So it's,</v>

117
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.760
it's a lifelong thing and this is why it basically. So it, it,

118
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.380
it changes your immune system. What.

119
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.740
<v 2>Are the symptoms? It, most.</v>

120
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.410
<v 3>People that are healthy don't ever know they have it. Cause there's no symptoms.</v>

121
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.370
Oh yeah. Unless you're immunocompromised, but most people that are healthy,

122
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.560
they don't know, you know, that they're infected.

123
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.600
<v 2>With it. Say it again. What is the cyto.</v>

124
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.640
<v 3>Mega virus? It's CMV.</v>

125
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.100
<v 2>Sounds like something Godzilla fights. There.</v>

126
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.890
<v 3>It is. So what's so interesting,</v>

127
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:19.700
but here's the interesting thing about this virus is that it,

128
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.180
so this is one of the major things multiple studies have, have been looking at,

129
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:27.770
like just immune variability and it's like CMV has been identified in multiple

130
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.620
studies. And the thing that, the reason it got me interested,

131
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.030
cause I was like 80, almost 80%. I mean, I could have it. Right, right.

132
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.240
Totally habit. Um, and uh, it changes the immune function.

133
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:40.340
It's totally different between young and old. So,

134
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.460
so when you're younger and if you have it, uh,

135
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.580
it actually enhances immune function. So there they've done studies where like,

136
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:49.520
they, they, they have, um, given people, influenza vaccine,

137
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.960
and oftentimes these vaccine studies are used to kind of test the immune

138
00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:58.400
response and like how your, how robust your immune responses, because you're,

139
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.340
you're given a vaccine and there's all different types of vaccines, you know,

140
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:05.570
pieces of an antigen or all different types of, you know, ways that you can,

141
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.250
you can expose someone to a bacteria or virus, but, uh,

142
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.610
you have a response to it. And the response is, uh, you know,

143
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.080
involves your adaptive immunity.

144
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:17.780
You make what's called neutralizing antibodies that, you know,

145
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.930
basically eventually bind to the virus and neutralize,

146
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:22.850
it prevented proponent from entering the cell.

147
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.460
So people that have CMB that are young,

148
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:29.660
have a really robust response to the vaccine, much better. Um,

149
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.380
but older people have the complete opposite where it's like, you know,

150
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:34.214
deleterious.

151
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.810
And the reason for that scientists think is because basically

152
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.270
this virus it's,

153
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:46.130
it's stuck with you lifelong and kind of reactivates every few years.

154
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.090
And like every time it reactivates, it kind of trains your T cells,

155
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:54.800
which are part of your immune system to, to become focused on that CMV.

156
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.100
And so as you get older, your,

157
00:07:57.101 --> 00:08:01.820
your T cell population becomes more focused on fighting that virus and less so

158
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:04.460
on other viruses that you're exposed to, but.

159
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.460
<v 2>This virus doesn't have any symptoms. Most healthy.</v>

160
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.250
<v 3>People don't have any symptoms with it. I know it's really like,</v>

161
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:11.090
it's really weird.

162
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.250
<v 2>And so they're just, I went to a restaurant Pritchet sat down and had a steak,</v>

163
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.540
had a glass of wine, my friend, Eddie Bravo, we sat down,

164
00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.640
ate together like gentlemen, does it look weird when you see it?

165
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.080
And it was strange at the restaurant because it was like us. And then, uh,

166
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.350
this other older couple walked in, there was maybe one other couple, uh,

167
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.740
towards the front and a couple of young people at the bar, fairly sparse,

168
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.300
all the waiters had face masks on and we ate, we ate dinner finale,

169
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.830
conspiracy theorist, semi is like,

170
00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.080
now they're going to see how far they can push it.

171
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.540
I think that's a conspiracy theory.

172
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.100
I think that is just like your cult friend that was calling you a scumbag and

173
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:52.760
trying to break you down. When you're in a position of power, there's like,

174
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.153
there's,

175
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.800
there's an archetype of a person in a position of power.

176
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.490
And then all the potential things that can go wrong.

177
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.560
When a person's in a position of power, all the abuses of that power. I mean,

178
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.630
they're, they're documented right throughout history,

179
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.300
but this is one of them control. I'm telling you what to do.

180
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.660
If you want more rights, you want to get your rights back. Well, daddy says,

181
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.390
you got to put your mask on, even though it doesn't make any sense.

182
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.800
<v 4>We're all.</v>

183
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:25.440
<v 2>Grounded. But here's the thing. It's, it's not like things are getting worse,</v>

184
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.330
but their grip is getting tighter. Right?

185
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.610
<v 4>Yeah. That's what it is. Deeply.</v>

186
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.050
G rights are generally not given back once they're taken.

187
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.270
<v 2>Exactly. And that's what the problem is. And this is what the problem. When,</v>

188
00:09:37.271 --> 00:09:41.100
when people want to talk about like Marxism and all the positive benefits of

189
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:43.410
socialism, it'd be great. If everybody liked,

190
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.830
helped all the people that weren't doing so well and chipped on in,

191
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:51.000
and it would be great. But the problem with the big state,

192
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.430
the big government is what you're seeing now.

193
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.610
Regular people making decisions,

194
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.690
regular people like Gavin Newsome is a person. He's not a genius.

195
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.240
He's not a wizard. He's not from another planet.

196
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.510
He's a human being who grew up in the United States of America.

197
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:10.380
And he has this incredible amount of power over 40 million people in this state.

198
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.040
And he's deciding we're going to go stage step one and where you're going to

199
00:10:14.041 --> 00:10:17.370
allow to be going outside and look at the sunset. You can do yoga.

200
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.700
Don't go near anybody. You can, you can golf, no cart.

201
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.080
And he's got masks and they put this list of that you can do and you can't do.

202
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.490
And then they get to tap people. They get to tell me not yet. Not yet.

203
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.250
We're going to open up a little bit on May 15th. Okay. A little bit,

204
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:34.500
a little bit. What can we do? You can go to the beach now,

205
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:37.440
but don't sit down now. You can't freaking sit down.

206
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.290
You can't tell people what to do like that. You can't, it doesn't make sense.

207
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.390
This is what you tell people. Please be cautious. Please use social distancing.

208
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.870
Let's be smart. Let's take care of our vulnerable, vulnerable,

209
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.510
vulnerable people. And let's take care of our health.

210
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.300
Let's take care of our bodies to eat. Correct.

211
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.930
This is a good opportunity for you to cut all the out of your diet.

212
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:01.830
Stop eating so much sugar, stop drinking so much. Stop smoking cigarettes.

213
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:03.840
This is a good time to work on your health.
