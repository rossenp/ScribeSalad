00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.570
We are already almost three hours into this,

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.340
so we haven't talked about Hitler.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
<v 1>Oh my goodness. Well, we kind of have kind of have,</v>

5
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:14.400
but let me just, uh,

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.310
do you want to lay out your argument about Hitler and then I'll respond to it?

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.383
And, uh.

8
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.000
<v 2>Um, I don't know if I do want to, I mean,</v>

9
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.850
I think I actually think that I should stop because I'm kind of at the limits of

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.300
I'm at the point where the probability that I will say something stupid is

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.010
starting to increase.

12
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.250
And I would rather not because just saying the things that I'm trying to say,

13
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.084
that aren't stupid.

14
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.510
<v 1>Yes. This isn't the topic where you want to make that kind of air.</v>

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.140
<v 0>Say maybe is there a more charged subject?</v>

16
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.040
<v 1>It's funny that it's charged because as you point out,</v>

17
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.350
we're pretty much all in agreement about it, right?

18
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.630
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, you find someone who's not,</v>

19
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.810
and they're instantly ostracized from society, right? I mean,

20
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:58.260
anybody who has an argument about Gingiss con I mean,

21
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:02.700
there's a really fascinating take on this by Dan Carlin from hardcore history

22
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.090
where he's talking about the amount of time that has passed since a horrible

23
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:09.990
atrocity and that there are people that will argue that Gingiss Khan who killed

24
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.180
10% of the world's population changed things so badly that it literally lowered

25
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:18.570
the carbon footprint of the human race while he was alive,

26
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.340
killed some untold number of millions of people and was responsible for their

27
00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:23.910
deaths.

28
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.380
People look up to him and they find all sorts of positive things to attribute to

29
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:32.630
his reign, uh, opening up trade with China, opening up trade routes, all the,

30
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:35.580
all these different things that people have attributed to him.

31
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.590
And that some day someone may do the same thing about

32
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:44.370
Adolf Hitler right now. Well is impossible. He.

33
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.290
<v 1>Yeah, he's certainly made, um,</v>

34
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.970
that job very difficult with all of the documentation, especially the films.

35
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.740
But, um, but let's just say, uh, the argument that I want to love,

36
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:59.670
I want to be really careful to do this so that it can't be misinterpreted by.

37
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.610
<v 2>Anybody there I'm going to, I'm going to enjoy watching this. Okay.</v>

38
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.010
<v 1>If I'm cornered we'll.</v>

39
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.373
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

40
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.490
<v 1>Okay. So my argument from all those years ago in my, uh,</v>

41
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.410
my paper that I was did for Bob Trevor's that I mentioned at the beginning was

42
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.370
that Hitler was a monster, as we all know,

43
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.290
but he was a rational monster that the program that he deployed

44
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.380
was not what he said, mind you,

45
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.580
what he said was wrong in many places, especially where it gets near Darwinism.

46
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.530
It's just all tangled and broken.

47
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.990
But what he did was a rational from the point of

48
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.330
view of, uh,

49
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.370
increasing the amount of resource that was, um,

50
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.870
dedicated to producing members of his population.

51
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.560
And so my point is, this is the danger that we in.

52
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.030
If we allow ourselves to imagine, um,

53
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.410
that genocidal impulses are, uh,

54
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.230
more or less gone from the world, because we've all assumed,

55
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.240
we've all agreed that they're a bad thing.

56
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.750
And the point is that they exist in a, in a latent program.

57
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.450
And at a point when you have, um,

58
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.730
austerity as a result of, uh, usually a, uh,

59
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:28.810
an opportunity that has run its course and has resulted in the population

60
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:30.220
growing to fill that opportunity.

61
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.040
And suddenly there's nowhere to go because the opportunity has all been

62
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:37.150
absorbed. The tendency of people is to figure out who,

63
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.650
what other population is weak. And if that population is across a border,

64
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.670
then there's some excuse for war. And if the population is within the border,

65
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:50.530
then it's a genocide. But the point is that is an ever present danger for us.

66
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.990
<v 2>Clarify one thing. I mean,</v>

67
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.950
cause this argument was sort of phrased as we have a disagreement about Hitler.

68
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.610
And I would like to point out that I don't actually disagree with anything that

69
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:04.480
you just said, because if I remain relatively silent,

70
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:05.950
I don't want to be seen,

71
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.940
I don't want it to be seen that the fact that I'm disagreeing with you means,

72
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
or that there is a disagreement means that it's a disagreement about any of

73
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:16.390
that. I think the disagreement was something, like I said,

74
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:20.320
that Hitler was even more evil than we thought he was. And you, I think,

75
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.000
correct me if I'm wrong,

76
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.310
you're pointing out the danger of assuming that you can put Hitler in a,

77
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.150
he was just a monster box and don't think about it anymore. And I would say,

78
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.980
I agree, absolutely with that. I mean,

79
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.840
I've studied Hitler a lot and there's a bunch of things that you can't say about

80
00:04:37.841 --> 00:04:40.930
him. You can't say he was stupid, right?

81
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:43.300
You can't say he was without artistic talent.

82
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.270
You can't say that he was a poor organizer.

83
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.670
You can't say that he wasn't charismatic.

84
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.620
You can't say that he did wonders for eco Germany's economy in the first part of

85
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:55.810
his reign. And, and,

86
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.380
and so it's very necessary when you're,

87
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.340
if you're dealing intelligently with a true monster that you give the devil his

88
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.174
due.

89
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.680
<v 1>Yeah. Uh,</v>

90
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.570
so I think the thing that I saw in your video was your argument was that

91
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:13.690
as he was losing, instead of, um,

92
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.980
putting the genocide on pause and, uh.

93
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.820
<v 2>Winning.</v>

94
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.690
<v 1>And winning the warning that he H he ratcheted it up the Genesis.</v>

95
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.190
<v 2>Yeah. I don't know if it would really be,</v>

96
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.610
I don't think it's necessarily fair to say that it was him that did that.

97
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:31.030
Although I think he had a hand and it does appear to me that that's what

98
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:31.780
happened.

99
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.230
<v 1>Right. And my, my point would simply be, and again, there,</v>

100
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.140
I couldn't possibly be less sympathetic with the individual.

101
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.020
My point is simply that from an evolutionary point of view,

102
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.310
if your objective is coldly to increase the number of genomes that are spelled

103
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:52.120
the same way that yours are on earth, that a,

104
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.470
he did enslave those Jews who were most fit to work in

105
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.550
service of the German war machine. Right. That's what those camps are.

106
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:05.630
Not all of the camps were work camps, but, you know, Auschwitz for example,

107
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:09.920
was both a work camp and a death camp. And so there was this, uh,

108
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.000
tendency to enslave. And so let me ask you.

109
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.190
<v 2>Question about this because, you know,</v>

110
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.030
I think you have to make a pretty tenuous biological argument to say that

111
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.320
there's evolutionary utility in increasing the number of your kinsmen,

112
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.950
but unless they're very close, but, but here's a slight variation of that.

113
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.360
You tell me what you think about this.

114
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.510
Is it reasonable to presume that a decent survival strategy

115
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.890
is to homogenize your environment with regards to under some conditions to

116
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:40.760
homogenize your,

117
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.630
your environment with regards to racial or ethnic differences to decrease the

118
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:47.270
probability that you and yours are going to be killed?

119
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.280
<v 1>Oh yeah. Again, no defense of this, but you are right. That,</v>

120
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:55.250
to the extent that there's another population that's distinct that,

121
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:56.120
that population,

122
00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.920
even if it is small and has little power now might not be small and have little

123
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:05.360
power later. And so undoubtedly that program is there too. Um,

124
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.860
but I would say that the,

125
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.660
the tendency to believe that evolution only functions at the level of kin when

126
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:15.380
you're talking about very close relatives, I believe is an error.

127
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.550
That is the result of the fact that evolutionists early on wished to

128
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:21.680
operationalize fitness.

129
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.840
And it's very hard to operationalize fitness across population level

130
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.490
differences. And so they built a definition that is about immediate kin,

131
00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:36.470
but there's no logical reason to imagine that that Peters out at

132
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:38.830
the edge. Okay. Okay.

133
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:43.700
So all I'm arguing is that what Hitler did was

134
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.540
go after a population inside his border,

135
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.590
that was more distantly related to the people who were his constituents.

136
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.540
And then he went obviously after Eastern Europe and sought the future of

137
00:07:56.541 --> 00:08:01.100
Germany in Russia. And it took 12 million, uh,

138
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.550
Russians to turnaround the German war machine. I mean,

139
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:08.030
those are military deaths. There were vastly more civilian deaths, but, um,

140
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.980
but the point is he did not succeed in doing what he set out to

141
00:08:12.981 --> 00:08:13.580
do,

142
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.500
but he also didn't fail in the sense that he took a bunch

143
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:23.150
of resources that belong to a population that was more distantly related. And,

144
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.700
um, he got rid of those people.

145
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.350
And by getting rid of them increase the amount of resource that was available to

146
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.750
Ariens. This has nothing to do.

147
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.120
Genes are not interested in figuring out which genes are superior.

148
00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:42.710
All of the language about German superiority is nonsense. However,

149
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:47.480
genes are very interested. I mean, they're obviously genes. They don't think,

150
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:51.370
but they act as if they are interested in replacing alternative spelling.

151
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.840
<v 2>Okay. And so part of the reason that you're walking through this,</v>

152
00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:54.980
just so that this,

153
00:08:55.740 --> 00:09:00.300
the track of this remains self-evident is to caution people

154
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.620
against, to,

155
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.240
to alert people to the fact that the sorts of programs that Hitler,

156
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.920
both ran and elicited from people are lurking in our,

157
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.880
let's say in our genome, in our, in our set of biological possibilities.

158
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.450
And we have to be very awake to that fact on an ongoing basis.

159
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.650
<v 1>Lurking in our genomes,</v>

160
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.880
which does not mean that we as adults have this as a possibility,

161
00:09:23.881 --> 00:09:27.300
many people will not go along with this other people,

162
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.220
have it lurking to be triggered.
