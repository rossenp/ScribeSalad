WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah. Yeah. Do you use Android?</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.470
<v 1>Uh, no. I phone, I have a stripped down. Uh,</v>

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.630
I called cloaked, uh, no SIM card VPN, uh,

4
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.890
pie hole. There's a lot of different parts on it, uh,

5
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:23.190
that I do carry it to iPhone seven. Uh, if I need to,

6
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:27.780
but there's no ignore other apps on it. No extra apps. Just, just blanket.

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.883
Yeah. So.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.640
<v 0>That's that in case.</v>

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.440
<v 1>Of emergency, if I need to do something, yeah.</v>

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.180
We need to do something like I want to use the GPS. Right. And it also has, um,

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.110
an iCloud account. That's not, you know, it's not my main iCloud account,

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:40.944
so that's,

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.580
I'm trying to make that Adam Curry and remove my other digital footprint.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.750
I did it move it over a little bit or something. At least confused it a bit.

15
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.980
Wow.

16
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
<v 0>Whatever happened to wasn't there a blockchain phone that was going to be</v>

17
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.254
released.

18
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.180
<v 1>There's a number of, um, of interesting projects, um,</v>

19
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.680
that are Linux-based. Um, uh,

20
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.470
I'm trying to think of the one that's on the, you know,

21
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.480
a lot of it's crowdfunded this company, actually,

22
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:13.230
they make laptops that are complete. They'd all, all open source hardware.

23
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.560
Should Jamie, can you find what was the name of that company? It's a,

24
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.220
I feel stupid now. Um, it's the weed.

25
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.270
Definitely. They, they crowdfund,

26
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:27.870
but they've had very successful crowdfunding with Linux laptops with open source

27
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:28.471
hardware. Cause that's,

28
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:31.560
that's really what you have to look for the problems because you know,

29
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.980
advertising, it's an insatiable thing that these companies are hooked on.

30
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.120
And so they, and the, the data, they have to keep getting data from us.

31
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.210
That's the system. So, you know, when we start to cut it down,

32
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.070
they moved to the hardware, they moved to different,

33
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.820
different types of ways of getting data. And you know, right now, I mean,

34
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:50.430
you still can't hide from cell phone triangulation. You know,

35
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.200
there's all kinds of ways people can find you.

36
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.500
That's really the biggest problem. If you can track someone's location,

37
00:01:55.501 --> 00:02:00.390
you can build their life, add a credit card to that. Um,

38
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.520
meaning John [inaudible] wife, she does, uh, the company's taxes,

39
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.080
a family business. And, uh, she, uh, kind of,

40
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.890
I think she used to do some kind of auditing in the past and she'll call up and

41
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:17.670
say, oh, here's what I always see you do. And she'll tell me exactly what I do,

42
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:20.250
where I go. Um, when I like to eat out,

43
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.860
she has all these patterns and she just does it for fun.

44
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.060
Do you have GPS on your car? Uh, you can't get rid of it.

45
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.510
I mean there's no, no. Uh,

46
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.000
manufacturer after probably 2015 allows you to completely

47
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.170
turn off tracking. Well.

48
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.110
<v 0>You got an iPhone seven once you get like a 69 Corvette.</v>

49
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.020
<v 1>But 69, that's the appointment. Everything. Everything is built in now.</v>

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.980
It's yeah.

51
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.860
<v 0>I mean, I think that didn't really start until like the two thousands.</v>

52
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.100
<v 1>Right. They sold it to us in a great way with on-call, you know, like boom,</v>

53
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:56.520
I'm upside down on call help is on the way. What is this, Jamie?

54
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.330
<v 0>I.</v>

55
00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.740
<v 1>Typed in Libra. There you go. Thank you.</v>

56
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.530
What did you type in crowdfunding?

57
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.760
<v 2>Lennox slash fantastic Libra. Purism pure.</v>

58
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.270
As any of they make a bunch of products. Yes.

59
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.450
<v 1>Top or phone. They make both. So they make the laptops,</v>

60
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.270
the phone they're coming, but there's other projects as well.

61
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.110
It looks like a real phone, but here's my, here's my problem. Here's my problem.

62
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.500
What, it's still going to bleep bloop. Right? I don't want it. Right.

63
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:23.530
It's going to find you I'll I'll buy it. Of course. I want to have it.

64
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.520
Cause I have control over keeping it off and not using it when I'm on the road.

65
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.170
But as a basic thing, if I'm at home and I just wanted to surf, uh,

66
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.290
I'm sitting down. Yeah. I'd rather use that absolute apple.

67
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.080
I kind of trust apple to a degree. You know,

68
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.150
they they're pretty good about not selling stuff.

69
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:43.930
They noticed that their maps is, would, would be what I use. I trust that. Yeah.

70
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.750
But only as far as I can throw them, you know? I mean,

71
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.610
I'm sure there's a million guys going Curry. You have no idea how they try.

72
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.330
I do. So I just try to make less data.

73
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.620
What do you think happened with Google that they removed? Don't be evil.

74
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.840
I think it was do no evil, do no evil that's right. People get that wrong. Um,

75
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.420
which is, which is, which is evil. No, I mean,

76
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.620
it's one of those things that it's like a, um,

77
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.750
Mandela effect. Okay. Right. Like the Bernstein bear. Yeah, exactly.

78
00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:18.310
So it was like Mandela effect. Um, but for whatever reason, well, that's, uh,

79
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.410
they, okay, so these guys who grew up, you know, under the don't be evil.

80
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.860
Mm. I thought it was, don't do evil, but that was in,

81
00:04:27.861 --> 00:04:31.360
it was in the S one document. And I remember reading it, but okay.

82
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.670
It could be either way. It doesn't mean maybe they,

83
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.680
maybe they changed that halfway and went from,

84
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:39.070
don't be evil to don't don't do [inaudible].

85
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.820
<v 2>They adjusted it from do the right thing or no, it was sort of says now,</v>

86
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:43.654
I guess.

87
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.270
<v 1>I said, oh, either way, anyway, whatever the,</v>

88
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.090
the V where these guys didn't grow up by accident,

89
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:51.310
this is going to be my big Google conspiracy theory.

90
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.540
And just I'll give it to you. It's one way of explaining it. Maybe I'm full of.

91
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.830
Okay. Um,

92
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.220
they had Spears and they had a lot of help I'm rooting on this conspiracy.

93
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:04.960
Their main, their main boost was the acquisition of keyhole. And this was a,

94
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.020
um, you have to know that the company in QTL, which is, um,

95
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.390
a venture capital company, which is the CIA's, it's not a secret to CIS.

96
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.120
They would say our CIA venture capital company,

97
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.480
and they invest in stuff and they help the key hole acquisition.

98
00:05:19.481 --> 00:05:22.180
And keyhole is the mapping. That's really what Google maps was.

99
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.740
The most important thing you can have as a person's identity is where they are.

100
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.020
Um, these guys kind of grew up young, under oppression of Russia.

101
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.180
So they both come from, and, uh, they kind of came into the system.

102
00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:41.110
If you look at the universities and the people involved and how they were almost

103
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.890
given some kind of prizes for things they did. I mean,

104
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.670
there was an alternative story to the general narrative of how

105
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:53.630
Google came to be. Um, so I think there was a lot of intelligence, um,

106
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.380
uh, people involved in this,

107
00:05:56.381 --> 00:06:01.280
involved in setting it up and the psychology of Larry and Sergei,

108
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.930
uh,

109
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.890
some psychologists have analyzed and I've listened to a lot of different people

110
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.210
is that they kind of become what their oppressor was to them.

111
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.240
And it's not really, I don't think they're bad guys,

112
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:18.790
but this is site psychosis that happens if you grow up in some kind of stressed

113
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:23.000
out situation, you know, people who have been abused, often abuse others. Right.

114
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.370
Um, and so I think that's, what's going on.

115
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.430
The problem is I love all the technology.

116
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:31.220
I love what all these companies and everybody's doing.

117
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.960
The business model is just humanity. It is it's us.

118
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.470
<v 0>By giving away data, influencing people.</v>

119
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.570
<v 1>And this is not letting us share in the revenue of the data.</v>

120
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.510
Right. Uh, or having some control over it.

121
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.500
<v 0>That's really what it,</v>

122
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.950
there should be some sort of legislation that recognizes what data is,

123
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.790
and that they'd look at it in terms of like, like it's a commodity and saying,

124
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.290
like selling and buying and selling.

125
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.990
<v 1>And there is, there is some of that.</v>

126
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.830
<v 0>But is there some that really evenly balances it or,</v>

127
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.700
or looks at it for what it really is?

128
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.790
<v 1>Well, what is data? I mean, what is money? Money is data.</v>

129
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.540
Money and money is not, it's not money provides all day providing a service,

130
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.540
all data, it's all data. It is all day. You have to have,

131
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.370
it has to be a trust relationship.

132
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.620
And it's if their business model is what added as it is now,

133
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:22.550
if they don't change it,

134
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.720
no legislation will stop them from getting around the problem. Now.

135
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.710
<v 0>You get free and we get your data. You get a free browser.</v>

136
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.080
<v 1>The interesting thing, here's the interesting thing.</v>

137
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.300
The internet is, although no longer,

138
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.800
quite the same way with up upstream and downstream being equal due to, you know,

139
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:45.860
the cable companies and how they've implemented your personal connection,

140
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.460
we can still do our own servers. You know,

141
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:52.790
it doesn't all have to be on YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter.

142
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.700
There's an entire, I was talking earlier about Mastodon, no agenda.

143
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.490
social.com is our own social network.

144
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:01.190
It's with open source software without algorithms.

145
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.130
And we federate with all these other servers,

146
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:08.780
much the way the worldwide web grew up. And, um, and there's this, uh,

147
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.270
mechanism for communicating with each other.

148
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:14.360
And so it's kind of Twitter meets email only. It's just,

149
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.160
it looks like Twitter just,

150
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.270
but you control a lot more of how it works and your community can be a small

151
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.140
little community and you have no one come in, you can block people or just say,

152
00:08:24.141 --> 00:08:27.940
I only want these cool people to also connect or that server to connect.

153
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.960
It's all good. So you have all these kind of,

154
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.160
almost like an ancestry.com tree that branches to all these different places

155
00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:36.170
called the Federation. Um,

156
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:41.000
if we build upon those kinds of things and don't let other companies or

157
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.730
companies at all, there's no reason for them to get involved.

158
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.620
It's very cheap with a, believe it or not a Linux laptop, you can get started.

159
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:51.290
Any kid can learn how to do it. They should be teaching it at school.

160
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.510
How to set up a server, how to get around.

161
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:57.270
Some of the hurdles understand how an email server works and we will not need

162
00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:57.930
these companies.

163
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.580
We have all the joy and a lot of the downside,

164
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:04.380
but there won't be a Twitter police.

165
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:08.250
There'll be only your own little community say, Hey, we don't like this guy.

166
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.010
We're just going to block you or your whole community,

167
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.780
or we would love to have you guys with us.

168
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:16.470
And we kind of happen to us similarly. And that's how you build these networks.

169
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:19.650
And eventually you connect to each other on the back end somehow. Anyway.

170
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.150
<v 0>How often do you think, I mean,</v>

171
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.660
how long do you think it's going to be before we're implementing augmented

172
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:29.160
reality into our life in that way? In like a social media context?

173
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.050
Um, cause you kinda got augmented reality already with your ear.

174
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.890
<v 1>Yeah. So it would be unfair of me to say that, um, it it's,</v>

175
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.600
it's augmented in that it's enhancing,

176
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:46.560
but I have enhanced it in ways that are particular to me,

177
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:51.330
but it's not some algorithm really determining things that I

178
00:09:51.331 --> 00:09:52.164
should here.

179
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.460
I am in total control of how that works and how it sounds.

180
00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.500
Um, I don't see the, the case for augmented reality. I just don't see it.

181
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.100
I mean.

182
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.650
<v 0>When you think about what the Apple's trying to do with their glasses, well.</v>

183
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.440
<v 1>I think it's trying to get people from doing this, to doing this.</v>

184
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.290
That is probably that's all that it is that's.

185
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.380
<v 0>But it's also probably adding to the experience, right?</v>

186
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.010
If you can have like little animated fairies, everywhere you go,

187
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.010
that you see through your apple glasses, everything else looks the same.

188
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.240
If you ever go to the haunted mansion ride at Disneyland. Yes. You know,

189
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.193
there's a ghost, right?

190
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.070
<v 1>If I see you as one of those glasses on, I'm going to go learn some move, a tie,</v>

191
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:33.150
I'm gonna kick you in your head. Boom, like Dawson.
