00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Roogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 1>What are other Saifai favorites? So heroes, alien.</v>

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.180
<v 0>Alien.</v>

4
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
That's why I was really excited when I heard that you were at least potentially

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.160
at one point in time thinking about doing an alien. Yeah. It would.

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.940
<v 1>Have been cool. What.</v>

7
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.773
<v 0>Happened?</v>

8
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.550
<v 1>It's just, you know, just studio politics and the, um,</v>

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.110
I do,

10
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.550
I do think that the way the chappy was received probably played a role in me not

11
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.810
working on alien. Uh, but you know, it's,

12
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.470
it's Ridley's world that he created and it's like, it,

13
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.100
it should be his to do what he wants with. So it, it it's, it's all good.

14
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.810
<v 0>Yeah, I get that, but it's still a little bit.</v>

15
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.840
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, it would have been fun for me as well. I mean, the,</v>

16
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.960
the thing that I would have really enjoyed about it with Sigourney Weaver was

17
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.730
really down for what I'd written and she, that the main thing to me was,

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.820
even though I like alien three and I love Fincher as a director,

19
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.470
I just wanted a version of,

20
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.660
of the continuation of what happened after aliens and for Newt to be

21
00:01:03.661 --> 00:01:08.190
alive and for, you know, for Ripley to continue that story. Um,

22
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.740
and it was sort of based on that idea is the.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.660
<v 0>Kid who played Newt. How old is she now?</v>

24
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.590
<v 1>Um, I w I mean, in my story, she w she was in her, uh,</v>

25
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.220
kind of mid twenties. Um, I mean, in reality, I mean,

26
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.220
alien just aliens just turned 35. So she must be, you know,

27
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.890
like 44 or something.

28
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.280
<v 0>Isn't that wild. Yeah. It's wild. When you find out that the movie,</v>

29
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:33.870
the original was from the seventies.

30
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.303
<v 1>79, you know.</v>

31
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.560
<v 0>What, yeah, it seems so much more current. Yeah. Then in 1980.</v>

32
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.880
<v 1>I mean, that's one of the things that's amazing about it is,</v>

33
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:47.430
is how timeless it is, you know? And, and also just, I mean, a lot of it,

34
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.320
I saw it in a theater a couple of years ago,

35
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:52.320
and I couldn't believe just the quality of, of everything.

36
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.540
It's really amazing how well it was filmed.

37
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.010
<v 0>I accidentally watched the blue Ray version of aliens,</v>

38
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.850
and it's kind of hilarious because in the blue Ray version,

39
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.600
things that were not meant to be HD are now HD.

40
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.130
So w there's a scene where the spaceships are lined up and there's

41
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.050
clearly a mural of spaceships in the background. It looks so fake.

42
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.740
<v 1>Oh, you mean a map painting. So when they're in the silica, when they're in the,</v>

43
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.160
when they're in the, the military ship, the big one, right.

44
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.790
<v 0>I think I know what you mean. It looks so corny. I'm like, no,</v>

45
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.580
because there's, you know,

46
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.690
there's like this physical ship and then behind it is just some.

47
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.360
It's like, it's so clear that they used, you know, they expected like focus and,

48
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.490
you know, the kind of graininess of film.

49
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.070
<v 1>Yeah. Matte paintings, pre computer graphics were done on pains of gloss.</v>

50
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.890
And so, um, I mean, in a way,

51
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:54.030
aliens is like an using the technology that they had at the time is actually

52
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:57.540
like totally incredible. But I know, I do know what you're saying though.

53
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.690
I mean, for, for audiences now on the stuff that we're, that we have access to,

54
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.560
you know, these techniques are so dated, but it would be a large pane of glass,

55
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.540
like a shower piece of, of gloss.

56
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:12.280
And then they would paint what they want the set to look like and shoot through

57
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:16.270
it, um, with your other real, uh, environments as well.

58
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.730
That's why the shots always locked off. Right. They're always stable.

59
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.550
Obviously you can't move. So yeah.

60
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.750
<v 0>Aliens was interesting by itself.</v>

61
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.700
If alien didn't exist,

62
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.560
the problem with aliens is these creatures are so bumbling and easy to kill,

63
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.780
like in the first movie, that thing was so clever, pure terror. Yeah.

64
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.730
Pure terror. So clever and so good at sneaking up on people.

65
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.121
<v 1>I mean,</v>

66
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:45.940
I think the thing that Cameron did with the second film was pretty amazing

67
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:50.900
though, in the way that he was, he made it, he made it militaristic, you change,

68
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.680
change the context. And so I think because of that,

69
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:58.060
and also there was a kind of Vietnam war, high technology, low technology,

70
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:00.820
sort of parable that at play. Yes. Um,

71
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.850
so it was two forces, you know,

72
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.840
in which case it makes the aliens be more there's, there's an abundance of them.

73
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.160
Right. Um, but I, I, I almost liked both films equally. I think both,

74
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.023
both approaches.
