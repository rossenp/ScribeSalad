1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.520
<v 0>What is, what does Israel want? Like as a state, like,</v>

2
00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:07.040
what do they want from the Palestinians? What do they expect?

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.440
They expect to just keep the status quo, keep business going as usual,

4
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.360
never let those people live a normal life. Like what,

5
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.960
what do they want and why do they have so much hate? And why,

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.320
why haven't the Israeli people like seen the horrors of this and rebel?

7
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.070
<v 1>Well, to be a leftist in Israel, it's, it's difficult.</v>

8
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.190
And to be an anti-zeionist, it's even more difficult.

9
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:28.670
Cause you're rejecting your entire like identity, your.

10
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.350
<v 0>Religion as well as your political.</v>

11
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.110
<v 1>Identity. But look, it's a settler colonial state, just like, um,</v>

12
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.070
a lot of other, uh, things in, in the past,

13
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.430
but this is different because it's ongoing and ever since the inception of

14
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:43.900
Israel to today of colonizers who colonized that land always knew that there was

15
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:48.660
an indigenous Arab population that they wanted to kill or expel. Um,

16
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.460
and that's still the goal like from Ben Garion himself, the, the original,

17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.900
you know, prime minister of Israel. I mean, he said, there's so many Arabs here.

18
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:58.580
We need to expel them and take the, their places.

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.420
So it was never a land without a people and a people without a land.

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.690
It was always overrun with Arabs and they've always just wanted to expel the

21
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:09.290
indigenous population so they can have an ethnosupremacist state.

22
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.970
And that's really what it, what it is. And that's so.

23
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.410
<v 0>Can you be, I'm sorry to interrupt you. Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.130
But can you be a Muslim and live in Israel?

25
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.490
Can you be a Muslim and live in Jerusalem? Yeah.

26
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.410
<v 1>But you, but there's so many discriminatory laws that are,</v>

27
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.200
that basically it's an apartheid state for non-Jews.

28
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.240
<v 0>Like, in what way? Like what are the laws that.</v>

29
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.720
<v 1>Um, I mean, there, there's so many things that, that people can check out, but,</v>

30
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.960
um,

31
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.760
I would really recommend the work of Mico Plet and Ronnie barkkin there two anti

32
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.360
Zionist, Israeli born Jews who, who have extensively talked about this.

33
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.590
Um, but I mean, just, just in the roads,

34
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:47.350
like there's settler only roads compared to palestlo only yeah.

35
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.070
Compared to Palestinian roads, people have different license plates,

36
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.990
you have different ID cards. Um, so if you are a person segregated schools,

37
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.990
like just all.

38
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.070
<v 0>That stuff. So you can't go to a regular school.</v>

39
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.970
<v 1>No, you can. But,</v>

40
00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.190
but it's so segregated in hostile and you're so indoctrinated from an early age

41
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.100
to basically hate these people and think of them as the other. And,

42
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.580
and I encourage everyone to check out interviews that I did with,

43
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.260
with just average Israelis, um,

44
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:15.620
in the streets because the genocital rhetoric is very apparent and it's very

45
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:19.020
open and these people is people a good one that' to play right now. Sure. Yeah.

46
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:23.810
Check out. Abby Martin, uh, Israelis, candid, candid.

47
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.430
<v 0>Interview with the Jewish.</v>

48
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.170
Did you have one opinion of that situation before you went there and then a

49
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:29.450
different one after you came back?

50
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.930
<v 1>Well, I didn't even know what Palestine was until I was 18 years old.</v>

51
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.890
So when people say, oh, you're only telling us one side of the story, look,

52
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.770
I didn't know the Palestine side of the story until I was an adult,

53
00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.450
which really should say something about our education system and our media,

54
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.080
when you,

55
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.880
who completely obscate an entire reality and are only told one side.

56
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.760
Um, but before I went there, I, I, I, you know, I had a,

57
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.040
a conception of what it was, but once you go,

58
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.360
you really see how much worse it is.

59
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.680
<v 0>So does this Israeli party approvesexation plan? Oh, sorry. I lost it. Um.</v>

60
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.440
<v 1>Is this the, uh, yeah. Yeah. So go.</v>

61
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.920
<v 0>To coerce. Palestinian departure.</v>

62
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.240
<v 1>Yeah. Go, go forward. Like a, a minute or two</v>

63
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.120
go forward, like two minutes. Yeah. These.

64
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.953
<v 0>People.</v>

65
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.440
<v 1>After this, keep going, keep going.</v>

66
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.810
<v 0>And what do you ask? Okay. This is good too.</v>

67
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.290
<v 1>Okay. So, so yeah, start playing here. Um, so I, this is the thing,</v>

68
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.090
and also the stand with us, people in the Israeli lobby basically said, oh,

69
00:03:30.091 --> 00:03:31.290
you cherry picked these interviews.

70
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.450
You only picked like genocitle people to talk to.

71
00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:35.290
What the hell are you talking about? I was in Jerusalem.

72
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.290
It was a place called tolerant square. It was a bustling shopping area.

73
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.080
I spoke to people from all back grounds, all walks of life.

74
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.600
And I just ask them very simple questions. What is it like to live here?

75
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.320
How do you deal with the, you know, problems? Um,

76
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.040
and basically they just were very, very readily,

77
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.400
like comfortable to tell me very crazy genocital things on camera.

78
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.240
Like no thinking that that would actually look good for an American audience.

79
00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.320
So keep that in mind and let's check this out.

80
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.070
A lot of people are sympathizing with the Palestinian plight. Um,

81
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.710
can you talk about what it's like to kind of live in this situation?

82
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.550
<v 2>Uh, first of all, it's very hard.</v>

83
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.350
I also am an organization it's called lahava

84
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.470
it's against the Jewish and the Mary Arabs.

85
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.940
<v 1>Did you say the organization was, did what again?</v>

86
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.540
<v 2>We, their, their organization is the,</v>

87
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.980
the thing of it is to that Jews. Shouldn't marry Arabs.

88
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.500
<v 1>Shouldn't marry Arabs. Why do you feel strongly about that?</v>

89
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.780
<v 2>Because Jews is a special nation that God gave it to the Jews and</v>

90
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.060
we don't want Jews to get mixed up together with.

91
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.450
<v 3>I think Israelis have to take over and, uh,</v>

92
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.770
they have to kick them, uh, kick them away. It'll be much better,

93
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.530
not, not to kill them just to, to go back to,

94
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.840
to our countries as if they didn't live there'.

95
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.160
<v 4>With these people. There's no need to try. There's no need to talk to them.</v>

96
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.160
What we can do is when that they, they do enough harm, we retaliate that's war.

97
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.720
And that's the situation that any J lives in Israel has to deal with.

98
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.800
<v 2>How much likeunk.</v>

99
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.760
<v 0>Okay. The Arab name and memory being.</v>

100
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.150
<v 1>Obliterated. It's about to get really crazy.</v>

101
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.670
<v 0>Terroris please be afraid to cause us any more trouble. And I will be fine.</v>

102
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.870
They'll be in their villages and will be here.

103
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.750
We don't have to live together and everything will be just fine. Um.

104
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.380
<v 5>Every Arab that doing a terrorism attack, uh, we are, have to kill him.</v>

105
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.540
And not because he's a Arab because he's a terrorist. I think he should, uh,

106
00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:52.540
also kick out the family because it all begins with the, you know how you.

107
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.540
<v 0>Say he's wearing the sons of anarchy. T-shirt by the way,</v>

108
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.920
which is just what are so strange kids, the kids, the kids.

109
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.000
<v 5>Does, you know, it's families.</v>

110
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.440
<v 6>I miss this. We need to.</v>

111
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.960
<v 0>How do you say kick out the Arabs?</v>

112
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.320
<v 6>Come.</v>

113
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.160
<v 0>On, tell me the words. I don't know. She's like, I don't can't.</v>

114
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.150
<v 1>Translate. 't wanna see I Don' out to TLE.</v>

115
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.830
<v 5>Really well. I, I think we should give them a country.</v>

116
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.150
If youre doing any problem,

117
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.590
you just going there to give them a country and then it's gonna be a war between

118
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:29.424
countries. You know,

119
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.390
if they're gonna throw a rocket were gonna throw one big one and done.

120
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.190
<v 7>I don't think there's any answer. This is insane. Really.</v>

121
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.340
There's only one way to like, I would carpet bomb them.

122
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.460
You would carpet bomb them. It's the only,

123
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:44.660
it's the only way you could deal with them, like, or,

124
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.380
or try to stop them a different way. It, it never worked. You mean.

125
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.340
<v 1>All Arabs are Gaza or.</v>

126
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.740
<v 7>I, I believe that they like,</v>

127
00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.850
I hope to believe they they're not, but I do think they are. Cause

128
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.490
I never, I don't, I don't trust them one more crazy one coming up.

129
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:08.970
And that's the only way I believe that the only,

130
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.610
the only way is just to stop it completely.

131
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.490
<v 6>I think that, uh,</v>

132
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.970
we miserable that the Arab is

133
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.520
make and we need to kill.

134
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
<v 0>Terroris attack, need to Arabs. She's laughing. Okay.</v>

135
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.720
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; friend's like, uh, alright, have a good.</v>

136
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.680
<v 0>Day. We'll talk about this later.</v>

137
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 1>I mean, look, this is reflected in polls. Um, a lot of people, uh,</v>

138
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.510
when you look at Israeli society, you know,

139
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:43.750
it started off as kind of a socialist project with the kabutsis and now it's

140
00:07:43.751 --> 00:07:45.270
just turned into a fascist, uh,

141
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.910
supremacist state where netany Yahu reflects the true face of Israel,

142
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:51.590
just like Trump rep reflects the true face of, of this country.

143
00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:56.350
And when it's getting too toxic for even Natalie Portman, to be a, you know,

144
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:59.270
this ambassador to Israel, you know that the tight is turning,

145
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.460
but unfortunately there's so much going on. Congress hasn't said anything.

146
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:08.140
They just totally support this man. And there's weird, like BDS legislation,

147
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.260
trying to criminalize,

148
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:13.540
basically dissent where you have contractors in Texas having to sign clauses

149
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.060
promised that they won't support boycot of Israel to,

150
00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:20.530
in order to rebuild hurricane homes, what does BDS boycot divest and sanctions?

151
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.930
It's the movement that Palestinians have asked us to help them to, you know,

152
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.730
boycot and, and that's what Stephen hawing was all about. He, he, he boycotted,

153
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.370
um, scientific conferences in Tel Aviv. So this is what we gotta do.

154
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.730
And we have to fight our government to stop endorsing these massacres and

155
00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:36.250
atrocities.

156
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:36.531
<v 0>Well,</v>

157
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:40.130
obviously this attitude that these people have it's coming from a place and they

158
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:43.240
were talking aboutterrorist attacks like how manyterrorist attacks are actually

159
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:45.680
happening in Jerusalem or in, in Israel. Oh.

160
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.160
<v 1>You look at, if you look at the breakdown, ofterrorist attacks,</v>

161
00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.480
how many are against soldiers? And that really gives you an insight. Look,

162
00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:53.240
these people are being occupied, militarily.

163
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.720
The occupation's illegal under international law. Um,

164
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.920
and resistance is, uh,

165
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.720
a lot of times acceptable under international law when you're being illegally

166
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.440
occupied. So.

167
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.800
<v 0>If you look at, so there are terrorist attacks against Israel.</v>

168
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.080
<v 1>There look not, not many. Um,</v>

169
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.320
and when you look at the actual amount of people who,

170
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:15.110
when you look at those terrorist attacks and see how many are against S like how

171
00:09:15.111 --> 00:09:17.110
many stabbing attacks are against soldiers, uh,

172
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:18.630
the numbers become very different.

173
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.030
<v 0>Don't you think it's, uh,</v>

174
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:23.550
it's a bit different in Israel and they're more unified because of the fact that

175
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.870
mandatory military service exists. Totally, totally. So everyone is, if,

176
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.990
if soldiers are attacked, citizens are attacked. They're all the same thing.

177
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:33.190
Everyone is a soldier in Israel. Uh.

178
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.150
<v 1>Essentially, well, no,</v>

179
00:09:34.151 --> 00:09:37.220
a lot of these are like all aren't armed soldiers that are right.

180
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.460
<v 0>Saying everyone identifies thatity because they have to do military time.</v>

181
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:44.220
Totally. Yep, yep, yep. Yep. That's the same thing with South Korea,

182
00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.220
places that have mandatory military service,

183
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.580
they have a totally different idea and concept of nationalism. So they think,

184
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.180
yeah, like if, if a military base got attacked in the United States,

185
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.930
we would think, soldiers got attacked.

186
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.410
We wouldn't necessarily think of it the same way as if say Dallas got attacked.

187
00:10:02.411 --> 00:10:05.490
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; someone, a terrorist attack happened in Dallas.

188
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.050
We would think of it as an attack on American citizens, not just military,

189
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.330
but their military is their citizens.

190
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:14.210
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because mandatory military service.

191
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.120
<v 1>Yeah. And what's really weird is during the last massacre in Gaza in 2014,</v>

192
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:22.000
like half of the Israeli soldiers that died were American because that's what

193
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.280
colonial, that's what the colonial settlers are. They,

194
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.680
they go over there from New Jersey and they just post up and top of an Arab

195
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:30.760
village. And this is what's happening. I mean, it's that half.

196
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.800
<v 0>Of the soldiers that died were American soldiers.</v>

197
00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.480
<v 1>I, a lot of them were, I'm not actually sure about this decision,</v>

198
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.390
but I remember a lot where I was like,

199
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.990
why are so many Americans going over there, 17 year olds and joining the IDF?

200
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:43.790
I mean, how bizarre is that?

201
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.910
What kind of mentality do you have to have to move from like a comfortable

202
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:51.070
suburb, Philadelphia to go like move on top of Anera village and, and ask.

203
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.510
<v 0>These people. Is it Jewish people that are doing this? Yes. No.</v>

204
00:10:53.511 --> 00:10:55.870
That want to go back to the motherland. Yeah. There's a huge,

205
00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.180
there's always just a desire to go to the motherland.

206
00:10:58.181 --> 00:11:02.740
Like it's such a tribal thing. It go to the purest form of the, the conflict,

207
00:11:02.741 --> 00:11:06.060
right? Like that's touch that's the whaling wall and yeah. I mean,

208
00:11:06.061 --> 00:11:07.660
that's the spot, right? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;,

209
00:11:07.661 --> 00:11:10.140
it's the epicenter of conflict too. That's.

210
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.300
<v 1>Why it's so sad that so many Palestinians can't ever go to Jerusalem, which is,</v>

211
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.300
uh, one of theirholiest sites is there and their Bann because,

212
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.450
and they're banned from everything. So.

213
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.210
<v 0>So if you're a Palestinian and you live in Gaza, you're just, you're just stuck.</v>

214
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.650
You're.

215
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.370
<v 1>Stuck forever. And that's why these people are like people from America.</v>

216
00:11:27.371 --> 00:11:29.970
They're like, why? You know, that's why you have this mantra. Like, oh,

217
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:32.490
they wanna die. They raise their kids to be suicide bombers. No,

218
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:37.050
when you're in Gaza, you are born dead. You don't have a life.

219
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.200
So that's why of these people are giving up their lives to send a message to us.

220
00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.320
That's why they're doing this.

221
00:11:43.321 --> 00:11:46.920
That's the only reason they're doing this is to send a message to us, help us.

222
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.680
That's all they can do is use their bodies.

223
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.400
<v 0>So their concern is if they open up Gaza,</v>

224
00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.440
the idea is that if the Palestinians come and they live in Israel with everybody

225
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:03.320
else that they're just gonna cross trouble and kill people and create suicide

226
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:05.200
bombs. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that's, that's what, that's.

227
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.200
<v 1>The idea. That's what they say. Even though when I, and, and,</v>

228
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.560
and the Israeli lobby and the stand with us and all these people have said,

229
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:13.670
you know, you're, you're portraying us as,

230
00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.190
as really different than we really are.

231
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:18.670
Cuz they like to portray themselves as this peaceful, loving democratic nation.

232
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.830
And they were like, Palestinians will say the same thing about us. Not true.

233
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.990
I was driving around in subtler plates,

234
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.110
in a car that looked like I was a colonial settler.

235
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.710
I did not hear one person say anything remotely genocidal about Jewish people

236
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.073
to you look like.

237
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.940
<v 0>You could be Jewish easy. Yeah. You.</v>

238
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.620
<v 1>Could fit right in. Yeah. Fit right in, just move on top of an Arab village.</v>

239
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.900
&lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt; I mean it's nuts.

240
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.420
And thank you for letting me talk about this because it is difficult to talk

241
00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:47.420
about it and I'm sure it wasn't easy to get, you know, hundreds of,

242
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.340
of emails telling you to denounce me and all that other stuff. Well, we we've.

243
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:55.050
<v 0>Been friends for a long time. Yeah. I know you not denouncing. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>
