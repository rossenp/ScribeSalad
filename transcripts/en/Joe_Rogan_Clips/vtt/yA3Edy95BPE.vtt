00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.600
<v 2>What did you think about when they attached in the COVID relief bill?</v>

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.280
180 days for the CIA to release all the information they have about the UFOs.

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.120
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt; that's that? That's one of the things I love about this.</v>

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.040
This is we can go for, yeah. Oh my God. It's.

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.830
<v 0>Can't be taken seriously that way.</v>

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.110
<v 1>Yeah, no, no, but I will say this. I tell people this all the time, they say,</v>

8
00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:25.550
they say, why is it? So what I tell you, I say,

9
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.150
because he's curious about everything,

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.790
he's genuinely curious about everything and that's a, that's a,

11
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.630
it's a good question. Look, I'm happy that, that, uh, when it comes to UFOs,

12
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.790
there's a lot of things that the agency needs to keep, you know, off the radar,

13
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:40.870
right. For sources and methods, right? It's a need to know issue. And Frank,

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.380
again, going back to what's in, in, you know, the us best interest,

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.821
you know, for that day,

16
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:51.740
when China decides to release all of their Intel operations and information,

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.500
then great. Maybe it's time for us to be transparent, but that's not the way.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.420
<v 0>The world works. You think that's what it is. A lot of it is just, uh,</v>

19
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.740
secret programs, defense.

20
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.970
<v 1>Vehicles. Well, no, what I'm saying, what I'm saying is, is, oh,</v>

21
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.650
in terms of the UFO thing. Yeah. Yeah. Great portion of it is yeah.

22
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.930
Great portion of it is, uh, is, uh, 50%. Oh, now the

23
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.170
47% actually. But don't tell anybody said that &lt;laugh&gt;, that's well known,

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.970
um, inside the community. Uh, yeah, no, look, I,

25
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.040
I think it's good because I think the look it's for the same reason that

26
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:28.800
Pentagon released the information about AIP, about the advanced Aon thread, uh,

27
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.200
identification program. I think, I think it's actually good.

28
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.320
There's no reason why we shouldn't,

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.440
unless you are talking about developmental aircraft as an example. Right.

30
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.681
Right.

31
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.790
Which is important because when you're talking about how hypersonic aircraft or,

32
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.830
or missiles or whatever it is, there's some stuff that needs to be kept off the,

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.470
off the radar screen, uh, because there is a,

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.070
a tremendous competition going on right now for,

35
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:55.550
particularly for things like control of space. That's a,

36
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.190
that's gonna be a huge issue, right? Yeah.

37
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.230
About because the weaponization of space for a long time, people are thinking,

38
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.940
oh, space, it's a great exploration and it's good for mankind. And frankly, um,

39
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.860
you know, there is a race to figure out how to weaponize space. And so,

40
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.420
as an example of what we're talking about, the idea of, of just saying, oh,

41
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:17.300
we're gonna open the books as a country and reveal all our information about,

42
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.580
you know, developmental aircraft as an example, that's the wrong move. Right.

43
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:21.580
Because, but.

44
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.250
<v 0>Do you think the, there are any credible stories,</v>

45
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:31.050
whether it's from commander David FRA who saw that tic-tac vehicle

46
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.410
off the coast of San Diego or what, whatever video.

47
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.330
<v 1>Yeah. If I had to point to one, I would say Frager. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.570
I would say without a doubt,

49
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.600
I'd say the one that if I were somebody who's looking for some redemption,

50
00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:47.800
because I've been beating the drum about UFOs and nobody's ever believed me,

51
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:48.760
they always roll their eyes.

52
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.440
I would say the one thing that would give them comfort would be the,

53
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.520
the incident with, uh, commander FRA and, and that, uh,

54
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:58.280
sighting mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt;, that's,

55
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.240
that's one that I have yet to see an explanation for that makes any sense.

56
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.480
<v 0>Well, not only that there's they tracked it. Yeah. Like there's oh yeah, yeah.</v>

57
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.880
And then also it blocked their, uh, radar systems,

58
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.200
which is an act of war and actively jammed radar systems. It's it's,

59
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.950
it's not simple as like they saw something, they didn't know what it was like,

60
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.750
they tracked this thing going from, uh,

61
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.470
I think it was close to 80,000 feet above sea level to one right down. Yeah.

62
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 1>In one second. Yeah. No signs of propulsion. Yeah. Uh, no heat signatures,</v>

63
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:34.350
nothing. Right. And it was just, it was a, yeah. It's,

64
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:36.510
it's one of those things you look at and you go, okay. And, and look,

65
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:40.100
the AIP program made sense in the sense that, you know, if, if, uh,

66
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.140
a nation is out there, if Chinese are out there, the Russians, whomever,

67
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.940
and they're developing a, a propulsion capability that we don't know about,

68
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.220
then yeah. We should have a mechanism, uh, within the Pentagon,

69
00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:55.420
within the Intel community to understand what that is. Let's, let's research,

70
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.740
it's investigate. Right. And so oftentimes, you know,

71
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.410
they come to a logical conclusion, the FRA incident, I have yet to see any,

72
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.650
um, information that explains it. Right. So that to me, and,

73
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.330
and also as you pointed out the way that it was, uh, tracked the,

74
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.570
the verification of it from very credible, uh, you know, individuals, uh,

75
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.400
that to me is, is a, like the, the prime example.

76
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.160
<v 0>And they have video footage of this thing too. And then on top of that.</v>

77
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.120
<v 1>They've got camera footage. It's incredible. Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.400
<v 0>And the Nimit saying that these things are fairly common that they're seeing</v>

79
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:32.160
them every couple of weeks. Yeah. They were seeing em, and you know,

80
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.560
when FRAs like, Hey guys, what the is this? And they're like, yeah, you see it.

81
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.640
Yeah. We've been seeing these.

82
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.400
<v 1>Things and there's no upside for somebody like that. A very well respected,</v>

83
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.190
you know, aviator, uh, with great experience.

84
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:46.150
There's no upside for these guys to come forward. Right. In fact, there's,

85
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.190
there's pressure to not because it's not necessarily good for your career.

86
00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.790
Right. Right. To come in and say, I think I saw UFO. Right.

87
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.110
<v 0>What do you think is going on?</v>

88
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.310
<v 1>Uh, I don't know. We we've talked about that before. I I'm not, you know.</v>

89
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.990
<v 0>I'm trying to get the right answer outta,</v>

90
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.620
keep asking it too for forget what you said before. Yeah. I.

91
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.300
<v 1>Know. Right. You forgot about the bet. I shouldn't have opened my mouth.</v>

92
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.260
&lt;laugh&gt; oh, I know people would go back to that though.

93
00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:11.580
They would've called me out. If Trump comes back and runs, they would've said,

94
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.140
oh, you owe him a thousand bucks. Can't wait.

95
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.700
<v 0>To get that screaming Eagle in here that I'm gonna buy.</v>

96
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.900
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;, you know, I'm gonna put, I'll buy it for you with the money.</v>

97
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.850
And I'll put a little plaque on there to where it came from. Big bronze,

98
00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:26.810
bronze Eagle. I know big, Aw, God, I've got one. I, I, uh,

99
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.730
I gave a speech one time up for a veteran's day event and they, uh,

100
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.690
they gave, it was very kind. They gave me this big Eagle.

101
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:35.690
I keep it in my office now. It's fantastic. I,

102
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.370
I keep in the background when I do news segments from my office and it's,

103
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.520
it's like perched over my shoulder. Nice. And you gotta have one in here. Uh,

104
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.560
anyway, I, you know, I, I don't know. I, you think about it at all. I, yeah,

105
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.440
I do. In the terms of, and, and, and like I said, with black files to classify,

106
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.560
coming up, I just got another plugin. We, um, we're gonna do an episode that's.

107
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.320
<v 0>On the discovery channel.</v>

108
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.040
<v 1>Isn't it? It is on discovery channel and you know, what,</v>

109
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.920
what you can see the entire first season on discovery plus. Uh,

110
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.000
so I, I, I think it's,

111
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.920
it's foolish to discount these things cuz I, I there's so much, we don't know.

112
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.360
Right. So, and the idea of, of, of thinking that somehow we're the only,

113
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.760
you know, credible life forms out there I think is, is ridiculous.

114
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.910
So I think it's a, there's a high possibility that, um,

115
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.580
that, that there's yes. I, I, I do think that, but at the same time,

116
00:06:26.581 --> 00:06:31.500
then I also question, uh, sort of the, the way that that's great.

117
00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:31.900
If,

118
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.820
if some alien life force with amazing technology that we can't even fathom right

119
00:06:35.821 --> 00:06:38.850
now comes to visit us &lt;affirmative&gt; then what the hell are they doing?

120
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:43.250
Are they just sort of like watching us just for the entertainment value or so I

121
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.410
I'm always puzzled by that part. Like, you know, the idea that, you know, I,

122
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.523
I dunno, well, they.

123
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.930
<v 0>Probably wanna observe, but they want don't want to interfere.</v>

124
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.890
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; as probably if they're super advanced,

125
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:57.490
they probably realize there's a process that intelligent life goes through where

126
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.320
they're stages of their evolutionary development in terms of use of technology,

127
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:05.640
understanding of each other mitigation of war and conflict,

128
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.080
and then ultimately entrance into the gala galactic Federation &lt;laugh&gt;
