00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.320
<v 2>This is your book about psychological things, right? Explain your book. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.520
<v 1>It's uh, the quick fix, why fad psychology can't cure social.</v>

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.240
I that's a good sign that I had to look at the book to remember what it's

5
00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:16.920
called. Uh, I was a science editor at New York magazine.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.280
I wrote about psychology, basically.

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.150
Uh &lt;affirmative&gt; and every day we get press releases from Harvard,

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.470
from Yale, from university of Pennsylvania,

9
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.030
that psychologists are figuring out amazing stuff about how to fix the world,

10
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.510
how to fix racism, how to fix the educational system. And a lot of these,

11
00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:38.270
when I looked into the more there's like nothing there there's no actual result

12
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.340
there. And people spend, um, you know,

13
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.500
hundreds of millions of dollars on these ideas that don't really do anything.

14
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.340
Have you ever taken the, um, do you know the implicit association test?

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.980
What that is? No. All right. Do you know implicit bias? Yes. Okay.

16
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.660
So this is a test. You sit at a computer,

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.460
it tells you how unconsciously racist you are.

18
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180
So anyone listening to this who's done a diversity training recently at work has

19
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.810
probably heard of the implicit association test since 1998.

20
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.290
Leading psychologists are like, this test will measure your unconscious racism,

21
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.130
racism. You're not even aware of.

22
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.170
And this leaks into the real world that makes you do racist stuff.

23
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.410
And we end up spending millions of dollars on it. Every school embraces it,

24
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.450
every company embraces it except whoops, there's nothing there.

25
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:20.770
It doesn't actually measure anything.

26
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.720
So I'm really interested in those in where like the most, and maybe this is, uh,

27
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.080
why I should drink with Alex Jones.

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.200
We're the most important experts in the world. Tell us. And it's just,

29
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.040
it's not true. Mm. Yeah.

30
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.200
<v 0>Um, how much has to do with when the,</v>

31
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.440
the spreading of this kind of information,

32
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.400
how much of it has to do with click bait?

33
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.430
One of the things that's disturbed me over the last decade or so,

34
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.270
is that journalism,

35
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.230
even journalism at its highest levels without naming any names,

36
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.150
but like fable institutions are resorting to click bait. You know,

37
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.350
my friend, Kurt Metzker said something about the New York times. Once he said,

38
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.470
it's like a fat girl's Tumblr blog now. And I'm like,

39
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.860
that is such a tough thing to say.

40
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.740
But what he was saying was that there's stories that are written in there

41
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.740
that are, they're not what you associate with the New York times. Yeah.

42
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.300
Of old. I still read the New York times. I still love it. Me too.

43
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.780
I think it's great. I mean, I think people always looking for flaws in any,

44
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.610
any institution. Right. But actually a fable one in times of chaos, like we are.

45
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.770
<v 1>Today. Part of us wants to see them collapse. Exactly.</v>

46
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.130
<v 0>Part. Yeah. People do, but I still think they're the best. And I think it's, um,</v>

47
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.930
there's something about having, uh,

48
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.690
a reputation to uphold that does force people to the higher standards,

49
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.010
but those standards are different.

50
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.360
That's it's of very difficult to find unbiased,

51
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.320
objective news with a clean headline today because

52
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.800
people aren't buying the newspaper like they were, yeah.

53
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.240
It's mostly clicking things online. And you know,

54
00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:03.200
there's a lot of these that have, they rely on subscription services. You know,

55
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:07.080
they rely on someone coming along and, uh, saying, you know what?

56
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.920
I value your journalism so much. I'm gonna give you some money.

57
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.800
And then you have to justify the articles. Like, you know,

58
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:16.240
there's ads on these articles in a lot of times,

59
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.400
and you gotta get people to click on 'em. So you have,

60
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.270
have maybe a title to that article that's not totally accurate or bends the

61
00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:24.750
truth a little bit, or it's well.

62
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.150
<v 1>Never gets more, more desperate cuz they just need to keep feeding the beast.</v>

63
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.950
So I think the key difference is like, I would imagine, you know,

64
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.070
I never got to be a science writer, writer editor in 1990,

65
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.150
but back then journalism was healthy and I bet you could be a writer. You know,

66
00:03:38.151 --> 00:03:42.020
you publish it still hard work, but you publish three articles a week,

67
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.860
four articles a week when I was editing science of us,

68
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.620
that was the sort of behavioral science site at New York magazine.

69
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.580
I forget what it was. I think we had to publish like 15 to 20 things a week.

70
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.940
So when Harvard, yeah, dude, when Harvard sends you a press release,

71
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.660
so like we have this amazing new study, we're like, great. Write it up.

72
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.210
We don't call the researcher. Don't read it closely.

73
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:03.450
Oftentimes we read the press release, but not the study itself. Mm.

74
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.090
And it it's sort of like, um,

75
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.650
the press release is often, they don't quite lie,

76
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.730
but they leave out a lot of details. And,

77
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.090
and so 2010 was sort of the peak when the stuff in my book in psychology,

78
00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:18.810
like the worst psychology was being published,

79
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.280
2010 was all also when things got really, really click baby, I think.

80
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.121
<v 0>Why was what,</v>

81
00:04:23.121 --> 00:04:26.120
what happened in 2010 that like the worst psychology got published.

82
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.120
<v 1>This is where it gets complicated, but like certain areas of research.</v>

83
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.520
So one of them is called social priming. And that's the idea that if I like,

84
00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.040
if I flash an American flag before your eyes for 300 milliseconds,

85
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:37.160
you'll get way more patriotic.

86
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.230
And it sounds like voodoo do magic. But for a while,

87
00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:43.830
people really believe these results.

88
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.950
And the reason they believe them is cuz like there's all these ways you can up

89
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:52.670
statistically and you publish stuff that appears to be true, but isn't false.

90
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.070
So let's say I asked you off the bat, uh,

91
00:04:55.071 --> 00:04:59.830
take the top psychology journals around what percentage of the findings

92
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.540
in them would you, it could be replicated later on if.

93
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.180
<v 0>You run it back. Oh, I have no idea.</v>

94
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.860
<v 1>It's about a 50%.</v>

95
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:09.540
There's a coin flip chance that anything you read in the top psychology

96
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.540
journals, some people think it's high or something is lower.

97
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.180
<v 0>Have you ever read the stuff that Helen pluck rose and James Lindsay and Peter</v>

98
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.380
BOGO and put out, I've read some of their stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where they,

99
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.090
they published these sort SoCal square satirical. Yeah. Uh,

100
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.450
satirical scientific papers that, uh, actually got the dog dog rape. Yeah.

101
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.850
The, yeah. Well what it had the most CRA see if you can find the,

102
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.450
the title of their, their dog, cuz it wasn't, it was,

103
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.890
it had to do with homosexuality and, but it, but meanwhile,

104
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.040
they were getting like lauded for these things.

105
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.040
They were getting applauded for uh, like fat body building. Right?

106
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.800
Like there's a lot of where they were joking around about how bad academia

107
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.800
has gotten. Yeah.

108
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.280
And they made these far circle papers and some of 'em won awards.

109
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.560
<v 1>A lot of the problems they are concerned with,</v>

110
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.480
it's not just sort of like the wacky, whatever Marxist geography.

111
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:10.040
It's like some of the top psychology papers in the country. Right. And I,

112
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.120
I it's tricky cuz like I want people to trust experts.

113
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.560
I want people to trust science,

114
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.990
but a lot of scientists themselves don't know what they're doing. Yeah.

115
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.023
It makes it complicated.

116
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.190
<v 0>A lot of scientists don't know what they're doing. How so?</v>

117
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.830
<v 1>So, um, it's hard to, to explain this without getting into,</v>

118
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.830
into some statistics, I'm not good at statistics,

119
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:29.950
but basically people realize that like the tests,

120
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.870
the statistical tests people do to decide if something is significant,

121
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.630
meaning like we're pretty sure. Uh,

122
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.780
Joe Rogan comes out with the pill to cure the common cold.

123
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.660
We give 50 people that pill. We give 50 people, a placebo,

124
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.660
the people who take the pill do better.

125
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.740
The cold goes away at a certain threshold. You're like, this is a real result.

126
00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:49.540
This isn't just random statistical noise.

127
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.260
And it turns out there's lots of ways to fool yourself into thinking the pill

128
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:54.980
works when it doesn't. Uh,

129
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.450
and that's basically what psychologists realized and that led them to understand

130
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.890
that like arguably, most of what they publish is just, is garbage. Basically.

131
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.450
<v 0>Do you, do you know what a nocebo is? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

132
00:07:06.451 --> 00:07:10.890
That's one of my favorite stories was a guy who was involved in a test, uh,

133
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.250
where they were doing a study or they, uh, gave him, um,

134
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.760
they gave, you know, one group, uh,

135
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.000
an SSRI SSRI. And uh, the other group, they gave a placebo.

136
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.160
This guy for whatever reason,

137
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.880
took a load of pills and ran to the hospital with an elevated pulse,

138
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.760
high blood pressure, holding this pill bottle, freaking out,

139
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:36.280
thinking he's dying, um,

140
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:39.750
telling them that he up and he took the whole bottle auto pills and he's gonna

141
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.470
die. Um, they contact the physician.

142
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.590
The physician comes down and informs him that he was a part of the control group

143
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.590
and he had taken a placebo and within minutes his heart rate drops down to

144
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:53.150
normal. His blood pressure drops down normal and he's fine.

145
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:55.230
So this guy who was convinced he was gonna die,

146
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:59.380
had just completely done into to himself. He had I,

147
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.940
that he had taken some sort of poison or something, you know,

148
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.820
some horrible medication and, and far exceeding the dose.
