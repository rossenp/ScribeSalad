00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.390
<v 1>Experience I want to ask you about, and this may be off topic,</v>

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.410
but the Dante Wilder, uh, excuse he came out with today, what.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.450
<v 0>Are you unfortunate? Do you, do you.</v>

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.260
<v 1>Think, uh, is there any validity to that?</v>

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.570
<v 0>Uh, if there's a look I put a, do you know what a, um,</v>

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.980
um, uh, it's called, uh, what's it called an Atlas pack? Yes.

8
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.540
I put an Atlas pack on my back all the time and I put a 45 pound plate on,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.260
so it's about 55 pounds and I go hiking through the Hills and after I could

10
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.260
still do whatever the I want. And I'm just Joe Rogan.

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.060
I'm not going to be on tape Wilder.

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.380
The idea that Deontay Wilder with a 40 pound outfit on that,

13
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.340
it killed his legs. Walk into the ring. That's crazy talk.

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.510
I don't understand why he would say that. I mean, maybe it's true if it's true.

15
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.160
<v 1>He said he had it on like 20 minutes before 15 minutes before he went out.</v>

16
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.170
<v 0>Yeah. Look, it's possible that, that tire them out. It's possible. Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.810
<v 1>I'm not, I'm not like I'm no fight expert or anything.</v>

18
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:05.970
So I just don't know if there's validity in it.

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.010
<v 0>Well, who the would let him put that on? If that was that heavy?</v>

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.210
That it was 40 pounds.

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.670
It had got to the point where it actually wore his body out.

22
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:15.930
I was just walking to the ring.

23
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.520
<v 1>And on the night before they said, and he liked it. So he's like, I'm aware.</v>

24
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.250
Well, he's he makes the decisions. It was his. Yeah.

25
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.900
<v 0>Yeah. That's a crazy decision. Um, no,</v>

26
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.540
that's not what happened though. I mean, it might've wor I mean,

27
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.240
he just got beat up. It might've wore him out, but the,

28
00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:37.560
the real big thing happened in the third round. When Tyson fury, he,

29
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.430
he put that jab in his face and hit him with that beautiful overhand. Right,

30
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.350
right on the ear and dropped him.

31
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.670
<v 1>Equilibrium went off after that.</v>

32
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.600
<v 0>Oh yeah. A hundred percent. Cause he was, he was bleeding out of his ear.</v>

33
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.580
So that's a significant injury.

34
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:57.030
It could be a ruptured eardrum when you get hit on the ear like that,

35
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.300
like a lot of times your eardrum ruptures happens all the time.

36
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.200
And when that happens, you don't know how to stand up. Right. You're your,

37
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.360
body's all wacky. It's not moving correctly.

38
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.000
And that's what it looked like with him. And that's what I was saying.

39
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.420
When I was watching it, I was like, his equilibrium's off. I'll go.

40
00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:15.240
This is what's going on. And then eventually the commentator said it as well,

41
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.280
but his, um, his legs weren't under him. Um, but also he was getting bombed on.

42
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.690
He was getting bombed and Tyson fury was, uh, hanging on him.

43
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.670
He would wrap his arm around his head and lean on him with that 270 pounds.

44
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.740
So he's carrying all that too. Like,

45
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.010
and Tyson fury did something that had never been done before.

46
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.810
And then he bullied Deontay Wilder.

47
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.840
He got on it and he came in heavy and a lot of people thought he came in too

48
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.630
heavy. But I think one of the reasons why he came in heavy as this,

49
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.760
as part of the strategy he went to what's up,

50
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.520
you got some did not have a broken eardrum,

51
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:50.340
apparently a minor laceration to his ear.

52
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.830
A Wilder did not have a broken jaw.

53
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.080
Someone speculate nor did he have a broken eardrum.

54
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.920
He had a two centimeter cut on his ear that took seven stitches to close defeat.

55
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.760
The fewer was the first a Wallace professional career. That's interesting. So,

56
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.780
uh, even though he didn't have a ruptured eardrum,

57
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.630
he still took a significant shot to the ear,

58
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.370
which oftentimes up your equilibrium and, uh, any shot to the temple,

59
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.030
to the ear. A lot of times it up your bounce. Um,

60
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.960
but like he got bombed on. Oh yeah. And he and Tyson,

61
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:27.040
fury figured something out in the first fight that in the 12th round, uh,

62
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.190
Deontay did not like it. When he came after him, he said he doesn't fight well,

63
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.140
backing up. He said, he's awkward on his feet.

64
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.250
And so instead of letting Deontay come to him and he was boxing,

65
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:40.960
like he did for most of the first fight, he fought the second fight,

66
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.700
the way he fought him in the second in the 12th round,

67
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.840
he came in to just get glued to his face run right after him hit him on the

68
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:51.190
right hand. And, uh, he, he bullied the bully, you know?

69
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.750
And you know, I don't mean Deontay is a bully, like in a bad way. I mean,

70
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:58.270
he's like his style is he's very aggressive.

71
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.530
He's at one of the most ruthless punching knockout artists in the history of the

72
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:04.120
sport. If not the number one,

73
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.100
I mean the guy has 42 knockouts, which is insane.

74
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.720
Like his, or maybe he has 41 40,

75
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.580
I think he's got 41 knockouts, 42 wins,

76
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.580
one by decision and one draw. And now he has one loss.

77
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.330
Tyson had less Tyson went to decision with a lot of people.

78
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.650
And I went to the decision with Mitch blood green. He went to decision with, uh,

79
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.840
I mean, you can go down the list. There was a lot of people,

80
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.380
Tyson's obviously one of the greats and obviously a brutal knockout artists.

81
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:39.100
But Deontay Wilder has that touch at death. It's crazy. I mean,

82
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:42.850
he dropped Tyson fury twice in their first fight and the 12th round,

83
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:43.684
it looked like he was.

84
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.250
<v 1>But do you think they should've stopped it at the seventh.</v>

85
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.240
<v 0>Or earlier?</v>

86
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.390
I think it's better for his life and his career that they stopped it.

87
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:54.490
He wasn't going to come back. I don't think he was gonna come back.

88
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.713
He's getting up.

89
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.660
And Tyson fury was not gonna stop punching him in the head either.

90
00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.880
He was going to keep doing it.

91
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.540
Tyson was pure and clean and literally unharmed

92
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.370
and looked fantastic. I mean, he'd been hit a couple of times, but no problems.

93
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.340
There was nothing that rocked him. Nothing that hurt him, you know,

94
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:16.270
a few punches bounced off of him, but he was putting it on Deontay Wilder, Amy.

95
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:17.440
He was putting it on him. Yeah.

96
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.490
If that is true that he had it on for 20 minutes and then it really wore him

97
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:21.730
out.

98
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.650
That's that's exceptionally silly on the part of his management to allow

99
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:28.480
that, to happen. That someone didn't see that,

100
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:31.790
that his trainer didn't see that they didn't recognize that that was going to be

101
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.240
a big problem because maybe he didn't calculate it.

102
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.710
<v 1>Well, I think he just threw it on the night before and goes, oh, it feels good.</v>

103
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.350
Didn't really think I'm going to be in this thing for close to 35 minutes before

104
00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:44.230
I get on, you know, he has to be back there 20 minutes.

105
00:05:44.231 --> 00:05:46.180
Then the walk-up is like three or four minutes.

106
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:48.640
And then you walking into the ring, you gotta carry it around.

107
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.910
<v 0>Well, you lock it in the ring. Yeah. You know, it's a good point.</v>

108
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.560
It had an effect, a guarantee you would have an effect, but the question is,

109
00:05:56.561 --> 00:06:00.710
would it have enough of an effect that it would his legs up to the point where

110
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:05.270
he couldn't recover? Maybe David's valid. The only.

111
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.420
<v 1>The only comparison I haven't, like I said, I know nothing about boxing,</v>

112
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:12.740
but if I hope my son is 35 pounds. If I hold him for like 10 minutes, I'm tired,

113
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.900
but I'm not a professional boxer.

114
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.950
<v 0>Your arms are tired. Would you like to be tired? Like my kid, my 11 year olds,</v>

115
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:23.240
80 pounds, I walk around Disneyland with her on my shoulders. Yeah. I can,

116
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.390
you know, I could see, but then again, I'm not fighting afterwards.

117
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.010
I could see it having an effect. How much of an effect is the question?

118
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.980
It's just silly that they let them do it. I mean,

119
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.460
if I pick that thing up and I was as his trainer, I'd be, Hey, Hey, Hey,

120
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.420
feel this now. Think about how long are you going to have this song? this.

121
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.020
Let's just go out there. Norm Amit guaranteed. Next time you see him,

122
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:48.440
he's going to be dressed like Tyson trucks. Yeah. Just trunks,

123
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.260
a small towel around his neck. Like Tyson used to do.

124
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.430
<v 1>That was so intimidating. The way that dude just came in, he just talks.</v>

125
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.160
He just came in like, what? Let's do this.

126
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.860
<v 0>He would just storm towards that rain.</v>

127
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.480
You would see death coming down that aisle. You're like, oh my God,

128
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:03.500
what have I signed up for?

129
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:05.960
<v 1>It was.</v>

130
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.480
<v 0>So true. What am I signed up for? And.</v>

131
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.080
<v 1>Read Tyson's book. And I interviewed, he was like, man, I was like, ah,</v>

132
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.870
so he was scared. Yeah. Every time we walked in a ring, he was petrified. Yeah.

133
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.490
<v 0>Look like a man. Well, once he got in there, he, you know,</v>

134
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.850
he put himself into the position that he's been in many, many, many times.

135
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.030
Just the, he was the destroyer, but all the lead up to, I mean,

136
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.850
such anticipation with everybody's head. Yeah.

137
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.120
I think T Deontay will be better than ever for the next fight.

138
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.930
The question is if Tyson fury fights in that same way and stays on him,

139
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.070
can he beat that Tyson fury? Because Tyson Fury's just boxing his face off.

140
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.330
<v 1>If w when this does happen, who, who would you pick out the gate on this one?</v>

141
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.253
You have to pick Tyson.

142
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.120
<v 0>Yeah. Cause I think he won the first fight. Um, Deontay knocked him down twice,</v>

143
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:53.690
but not only he knocked him down in the 12th round,

144
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:56.780
but Tyson fury came back and won the remainder of that round.

145
00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.320
So you could almost give that round a draw. And then the other round,

146
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:02.660
when he knocked him down, you got to give to Deontay Wilder.

147
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.300
The remaining 10 rounds are not in dispute.

148
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.920
The remaining 10 rounds went to Tyson fury. So if you just look at it on paper,

149
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.270
he should won that fight.

150
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.800
Although most people weren't upset with the decision because

151
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.240
Deontay almost had him out and it's like, it's exciting. Let's do a rematch,

152
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.020
no big deal. But then in the rematch, Tyson,

153
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:26.960
fury just took the judges out of the equation and just bombed on them.

154
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:32.360
It's really unfortunate that there is a question of whether or not that big,

155
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:36.530
stupid suit was wearing his legs out. Cause if that really is the case,

156
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:41.330
that bums me out, man. That's what he said. But like, think of it.

157
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.450
I was, I was thinking it was a joke until you told me that it was like,

158
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:48.770
he wore it for 20 minutes. Then I was like, yeah, well that would be different.

159
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.370
That's different. That's real weight. You know, just put it on.

160
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:54.830
You walked out there for 30 seconds. You had this 40 pound thing on.

161
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.990
I wouldn't advise it. No.

162
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.590
<v 1>Good. But he had it on for at least 30 minutes. I would,</v>

163
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.240
if I'm guessing from the walk-in.

164
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.600
And he said he had it on 20 minutes before the fight, he had to do the walk up.

165
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.390
He had to get in the ring in it. And he said, when he took it off,

166
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:11.430
he knew that was the game changer.

167
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.960
<v 0>You gotta think Deontay Wilder coming into the fight has flatlined.</v>

168
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.130
Every single opponent he's faced, except for Tyson fury,

169
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.500
sta Vern. He didn't flatline him in the first fight.

170
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:25.440
He was beaten by decision to beat the out of him. But in the second fight,

171
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:29.550
he murked him. So he was probably thinking he could Merck.

172
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:32.940
Anybody always do is to touch him the way he did with Luis Ortiz.

173
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.390
Same thing in the first fight had a tough first fight with him. Second fight.

174
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.930
Merck's him with one punch. I think he just had this thing in his head.

175
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:42.990
That that's what he does. And he's going to do that to Tyson fury too.

176
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.260
And he never believed at Tyson. Fury was actually going to fight that way.

177
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.970
There's going to jump on them.

178
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.690
<v 1>But Tyson said he was going to do it. I know, but like told them the game plan.</v>

179
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.440
<v 0>Tell us, after you literally said you don't believe a word you're saying,</v>

180
00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.230
that's what he said. He believes it now. He believes it.

181
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:03.330
Now I'm real excited. I'm excited.

182
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.390
I'm excited for the third one while they were talking about him fighting

183
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.800
Anthony, Joshua Tyson, fury financially, Joshua first.

184
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.880
Um, and if that does happen, I think he beats Anthony Joshua.

185
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.670
I think Tyson Fury's the best heavyweight on earth. I do.

186
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.810
And I think the only person that could beat him is probably Wilder.

187
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.890
If Wilder can recreate the success of the first fight and catch him,

188
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.173
did you think.

189
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.430
<v 1>Or, cause I remember like after Tyson stopped boxing or after, you know,</v>

190
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.110
he lost, I kind of lost, uh,

191
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.280
a lot of interest in it because I grew up with like sugar Ray, uh,

192
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.410
Tommy Hearns and marvelous, Marvin Hagler.

193
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.170
And I felt like I don't see fights like that again.

194
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.140
<v 0>Oh, well they're they're possible today. I mean,</v>

195
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.440
[inaudible] was an amazing fight. Anytime. Terence Crawford fights I'm in,

196
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.310
I love that guy, but don't you miss.

197
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:55.561
<v 1>Back then?</v>

198
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:59.760
It seemed like every fight was a great fight or is that just getting old and

199
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.990
reminiscent? Yeah.

200
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.320
<v 0>Okay. Reminiscing. There's some great fighters now. Earl Spence Jr.</v>

201
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.770
Wassily Loma Chenko. I mean, it's a great time for boxing.

202
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.670
It's a really great cause. Now a heavyweight it's a great time for boxing.

203
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:15.930
<v 1>And before you crowd jumps on me, like, I don't know anything about boxing,</v>

204
00:11:15.931 --> 00:11:17.680
so I'm not saying anything. Cause I, I.

205
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.450
<v 0>Well, I'm not a boxing expert. I know, I know some stuff about boxing.</v>

206
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.880
Cause I'm a fan, but I'm just not like MMA.

207
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.070
Like if someone wants to talk to me about MMA,

208
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.760
I can give you very educated opinions on things.

209
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:33.540
And I can dissect things with boxing. I have some opinions, but you know,

210
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.440
there's other people that are better at it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good time though.

211
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.000
I like it. I'll get into.

212
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.080
<v 1>It. Then I'll get into.</v>

213
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.720
<v 0>It, man. I'll let you know when something big is happening.</v>

214
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:47.820
When there's a big one, you know, we do these fight companions for UFC fights.

215
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:50.520
We should do some of them for boxing. We've only done it for glory.

216
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.460
For kickboxing. The song we've done boxing one. I know we should,

217
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:57.280
should have done it for that fight. We went to went crazy.

218
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.890
We went to crazy. That was a watt. We knocked it down.

219
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.140
The third round. I screamed everybody in my house was like,

220
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:08.840
what the is going on? I know it. I,

221
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.350
I think they should've stopped it in their fifth or sixth.

222
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:13.000
They could have done that too. Yeah,

223
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.720
but he's Deontay Wilder manic one punch punch.

224
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.260
He could have one swing and right-hand and next thing you know, Tyson,

225
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:23.800
Fury's got a flashlight in his face and he can't believe it. I was like, what?

226
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.790
Huh? It's over what happened? That's what Deontay does to people.

227
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.560
When he hit Louis Ortiz and the spray of sweat flew off his face in our teeth,

228
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:35.650
crumbled. Any of this look in his eyes, like what just happened?

229
00:12:35.651 --> 00:12:36.670
That is hit by God.

230
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.510
Like lightning bolts as true a lightning bolt come out of the sky.

231
00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.740
Like people can't believe a Hardy hits, but the key to Tyson Fury's victories,

232
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:46.870
he didn't let them hit him. Just jumped on him.

233
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.280
And Tyson fury has a unique style like that. Big.

234
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.920
He's six, nine. He's so big. So big. It's so long.

235
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.140
And he's such a good boxer, man.

236
00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:03.430
No one in the heavyweight division has that kind of head movement. I don't know.

237
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.510
He's such a character.

238
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.570
He says he jerked off seven times a day to build his testosterone.

239
00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.440
Did you see that? No. You say he's going. I'm going to settle gypsy lube.

240
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.670
He's got his own lube, his own brand, a personal lube that he beats off with.

241
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:20.800
He says beaten off seven times a day. Increases his testosterone. I don't know.

242
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.830
I don't know if there's facts behind it. I don't know. That might be conjecture.
