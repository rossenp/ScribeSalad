00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.210
How often do you come across people that will fight you tooth and nail to the

3
00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:08.190
death to hold onto those preconceived?

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.620
<v 1>Rawat exactly a simple.</v>

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.480
<v 0>One. I came across was even involved with this COVID stuff was trying to talk to</v>

6
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.350
people about how the,

7
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:23.070
the ma the mainstream media has had bad narratives from the get, you know,

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
be it, they were given bad information,

9
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.250
but they doubled down on it all the time. Or if it's the who,

10
00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.260
and they're running interference for China, whatever, right?

11
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:35.850
There's all this manipulation going on around something that is not,

12
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.450
that is, it's not subjective viruses. Aren't subjective. You just,

13
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.390
you can't play this game with that kind of thing.

14
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.610
And people would fight me tooth and nail to

15
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.490
defend the mainstream media over it. And I go,

16
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.900
look here's example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, look at how they're all wrong. They're up.

17
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:56.430
They're doing this, they're politicizing.

18
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.320
And they're doing all these different things for different reasons,

19
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.300
but none of it is really for your own betterment of understanding and to be

20
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.750
safer and healthier. And, or even just to say,

21
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.340
we still don't know yet,

22
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.510
because we just don't have the data and people fight tooth and nail over this,

23
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.550
because there's so many people that do use the current media apparatus as their

24
00:01:17.551 --> 00:01:22.440
mainstream sense-making apparatus. And if you tear that away from them,

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.860
now they have to sit back and go, what do I really know? Right.

26
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.690
What is the reality of what I think truth is? What is,

27
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.970
what is the metric upon understanding now that you've just shown me that?

28
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.000
And of course, even at its best, of course,

29
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.060
media is going to be faulty at times because it's just made up of people, right?

30
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.580
We're always going to be imperfect. We're always going to make mistakes,

31
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.200
but there is no admitting of mistakes anymore.

32
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:53.120
There's no saying I was wrong. We were wrong. There's also a problem.

33
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.680
<v 1>With mainstream media. And it's the same problem that we have with the police.</v>

34
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.290
You're giving people an inordinate amount of power.

35
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.570
And when you give people that amount of power,

36
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.730
they don't want to ever let it go.

37
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.760
And they don't ever want to say they're wrong and they don't ever want to admit

38
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:12.620
fault, and they don't ever want to open the door to nuance. Correct.

39
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.090
And that's what you see with whether it's CNN or Fox news or any of these,

40
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.870
they have this idea that they've been selling you,

41
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.120
whether it's this idea about Russia,

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.960
whether it's the idea about COVID was the idea about Trump was the idea about

43
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:31.760
Biden. I mean, they're selling you some and it's,

44
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.590
uh, it's very, very difficult to get an unbiased perspective on the.

45
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 0>World. They came after you for no reason, you know,</v>

46
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:44.630
they would write all this kind of completely disingenuous, uh, uh,

47
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.570
just narrative driven, around you,

48
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.610
a person who brings people on and has conversations and tries to tries to,

49
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.470
um, flourish. That idea of the, the,

50
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.240
what are they gonna be marketplace of ideas,

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.150
like having conversations and trying to earnestly and sincerely explore things

52
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.840
and try to have a better grip on the world and try to better orient themselves

53
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.670
towards just knowing and knowledge,

54
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.960
in addition to even having a good time about it being well, it's a competitive.

55
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.280
<v 1>Thing, too. Of course, if someone reaches a point where they're re they're,</v>

56
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:21.390
they're interacting with too many people and they have this potential to really

57
00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.300
influence things in terms of the political process,

58
00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:28.290
in terms of the way people view things that becomes very dangerous for people

59
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:33.120
that have a different perspective on things or people that are

60
00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:37.080
connected to a traditional machine, true, whether it's, uh,

61
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.600
newspapers or whether it's, you know, and I've,

62
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:43.830
I have friends in both those things. I have friends in media and I have friends.

63
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.980
I've people that have apologized for things that other people have written.

64
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:49.920
I'm like, listen, man, it's part of the game. You're not going to rattle me.

65
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.480
I'm okay. I get it.

66
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.020
<v 0>Except you're not, you're not sitting here saying that it's okay.</v>

67
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.930
But what you're saying is I know what the landscape looks like.

68
00:03:57.931 --> 00:03:59.100
I know what I expect. Yeah.

69
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.210
<v 1>I understand humans. I understand why people would attack me.</v>

70
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:07.560
And I understand why you even look at very small

71
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.700
things that are taken out of context and develop your own perception of me.

72
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:15.180
That's an accurate, I get it. I don't, I'm not angry about it. Correct.

73
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.200
But I don't, I don't want,

74
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.210
I don't want it to be any different.

75
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.720
<v 2>That's up. I.</v>

76
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.180
<v 1>Kinda like, I like the madness. I know what you feel. I,</v>

77
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.050
I, I wouldn't on a personal level. I can relate to that. Yes.

78
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.470
World was logical, a person like me wouldn't have no.

79
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.780
<v 2>Place where someone just.</v>

80
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.010
<v 1>Comes from doing some live stream on a laptop.</v>

81
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:46.920
And then 10 years later has hundreds of millions of downloads.

82
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:47.820
It doesn't make any sense.

83
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.900
<v 0>I don't know. I think you're tapping into something that is universal. Uh,</v>

84
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.540
I think that, you know, when it comes to like, uh,

85
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.740
I love studying history and, and,

86
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.630
and religion because those are some of the oldest insights into the way people

87
00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:08.340
think, and the way people act and within these frameworks are tons of,

88
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.890
uh, windows into human thought process and psychology.

89
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.900
And it's the same as yours. It,

90
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.140
none of it has changed over the oldest religious texts,

91
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.410
the oldest historical things. We can find the stories that exist, the myths,

92
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.520
all these things, they're all this,

93
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.740
this is the same over and over and over again.

94
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:28.560
The first time I ever saw that was reading the Haga Caray and seeing that the

95
00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:33.330
complaints and the issues of criticisms that this monk who is a former samurai

96
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:37.650
had of his current era in the 19th century are the same criticisms and problems

97
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:41.580
and the same issues with people's, uh, actions,

98
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.520
deriving from the same human places of insecurity and

99
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.650
psychological element. It's all the same. And nothing has changed.

100
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:54.280
Like we're not any different than a person in the sixth century, uh, in,

101
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:57.980
in the Roman empire or anything like that. Then, then anybody, this, this era,

102
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.130
we're not different people. We have different technology. We have,

103
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.480
we have different communication in terms of which language you use, but no,

104
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.080
we don't act differently. We're not driven from different impulses. We're not,

105
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.330
you know, we're not Russo, we're not a blank slate. You know? Um, I don't,

106
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.260
I don't buy that concept at all because history would look so much radically

107
00:06:18.261 --> 00:06:18.710
different,

108
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.420
but doesn't and I've written you so many times.

109
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.771
And at times,

110
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.630
whoever has your old number was probably incredibly confused about what the

111
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.730
is this guy talking about, but, uh,

112
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.680
about how I think a person like you is critical

113
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.350
to what towards the interaction of the current, um,

114
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.240
paradigm is you are a necessity because right,

115
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:50.330
wrong, whatever your personal opinion is, is whatever.

116
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.510
It's the fact of creating the ability for people to get out here and speak.

117
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.100
Nobody ever had Tulsi Gabbard and, uh,

118
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.270
Bernie Sanders in a place to feel more open. And I'll say,

119
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.750
as politicians, they probably weren't as open as they could be,

120
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.200
but they're politicians in this current

121
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:15.020
paradigm of the Western politician, who knows are legitimately sincere.

122
00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:16.040
Any of those are,

123
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.870
but this has been probably the only place that you could have had someone like

124
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:23.360
that and allowed it to S to that window, into their,

125
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.940
their least politicians, self. You know, I got to sit here and listen to,

126
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.920
uh, Andrew Yang, talk about UBI and be like, nah, dude, I don't,

127
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.930
I don't buy it, but I like you, you know, I'm like you,

128
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.650
I like you. Uh, or it's just,

129
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:46.450
it's just a matter of not being so pent up on, oh God, well.

130
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.650
<v 1>My narrative, my, my ideology.</v>

131
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.110
<v 0>My, my, I gotta, tribalized all this.</v>

132
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.050
And to such a degree that I have to tear down everything else around me,

133
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.380
so the mind can exist. And that even goes to, with this,

134
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.810
this bourbon or anything I do, like I don't need to,

135
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.910
I don't need to cut other things down from mine to rise to two for other

136
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:07.610
people to enjoy it. You don't have to,

137
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.830
you don't have to tear apart the mainstream media for years to exist.

138
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:17.720
You know, now mind you, the mainstream media tries to destroy you all the time,

139
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.333
but.

140
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.510
<v 2>What is this players in the media? The media.</v>

141
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.260
<v 1>Itself is just a, it's just a pathway for people to express themselves.</v>

142
00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:27.700
It's very limited. I would say.

143
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.360
<v 0>Among a lot of things, like there is a, a good, uh,</v>

144
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.210
for a term that I really liked, it's called managerial elites.

145
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.810
And so most things are big bureaucratic,

146
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:44.050
uh, um, structures that have managers. And it's just all managers everywhere.

147
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.760
<v 1>We're all operating into that human resource paradigm that, and they don't.</v>

148
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.680
<v 0>They don't managers don't usually create anything.</v>

149
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:55.860
And this is not to say that managers aren't an important thing.

150
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:57.330
I think managers are very important,

151
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.520
but how many times has anybody worked in a place where they have

152
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:03.840
management that has,

153
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.530
is so divorced from the creative or from the,

154
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.850
the actuality of creating a product or maintain or, or whatever the,

155
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:12.930
the job role is.

156
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.820
And yet these people are making decisions all the time and bleeding into telling

157
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:21.000
people how to do their job instead of managing people,

158
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.290
to be able to be best at their job. They're invested.

159
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.861
<v 1>In it as well,</v>

160
00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:27.470
because they have mortgages and they have bills and they have all,

161
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.570
they want the money to keep rolling in.

162
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.580
So their idea is to make sure that whatever this thing that they're doing,

163
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.580
whether it's a newspaper, whether it's a television show,

164
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.260
they want to make sure that they stay in the most wide

165
00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:45.770
mainstream of lanes. It's going to bring in the most money.

166
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.690
And that's the weird part about media in general is that it's motivated by

167
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:54.890
people that are trying to seek a profit. That's what they're doing.

168
00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:56.990
And there's a giant machine behind them.

169
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.850
We have two video editors and Jamie that's the whole deal.
