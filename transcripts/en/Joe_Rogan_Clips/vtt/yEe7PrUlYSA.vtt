00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.990
where you were talking about the changes in human diet and eating soft foods and

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:10.880
how it affects the way the jaw develops and the,

4
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:14.430
the size of the jaw. And that there's a way to improve that,

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.690
which I found fascinating.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.720
<v 1>Yeah. And th this was something,</v>

7
00:00:17.721 --> 00:00:19.850
when you set out to write a book about breathing,

8
00:00:19.851 --> 00:00:23.750
the last thing you think you're going to be doing is handing around a bunch of

9
00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:28.100
ancient skulls and looking at teeth. But, but that's where this journey led me.

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.050
I had heard from some biological anthropologist that our faces have

11
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:36.050
changed and that our mouths have gotten too small.

12
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.170
And that was one of the reasons so many of us were breathing so poorly.

13
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.030
And so I thought, well, this sounds interesting. These people are legit.

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.640
I want to check it out. And if you take an ancient skull,

15
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.650
anything older than 500 years old, 5,000 years old, 50,000 years old,

16
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.100
you're going to see by and large, about 99% chance.

17
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.260
These skulls are going to have perfectly straight to you.

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.100
They never had their wisdom, teeth removed. They never had braces,

19
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.200
any orthodonture, anything.

20
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.980
They had straight teeth because they had these very wide and large mouth.

21
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:08.270
And these powerful jaws.

22
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.070
If you start getting into the modern era of industrialized food mouths start

23
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:17.840
shrinking. So why do we have crooked teeth? Not from genetics.

24
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.010
It's because our mouse have grown so small that the teeth have nowhere to go.

25
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.780
So the grow crooked and what else happens when you have a mouth that's too small

26
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:29.210
for its teeth, you have a smaller airway.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.320
So this is one of the reasons why so many people have snoring and sleep apnea

28
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:34.730
and other respiratory problems.

29
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.440
This sounded so bizarre because it's nothing I'd ever learned in school.

30
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.040
But all anyone needs to do is look up some ancient skulls.

31
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:47.450
If you're online and check out their teeth and check out how they have these

32
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:52.100
huge jaws, these big flat wide faces, powerful faces,

33
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.870
and they all had this.

34
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.640
And then you go into the wild 5,400 different mammals and check out and see how

35
00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:02.870
many have crooked teeth. The answer is zero. So some,

36
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.320
some bulldogs do, because they've been bred to have this flat face,

37
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.700
just like humans, but, but animals in the wild have straight teeth.

38
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.310
And, and we did too, as a species, we have straight teeth. But,

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.720
um, but because of industrialization specifically, because of food,

40
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.550
our mouths have grown too small.

41
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.530
<v 0>Yeah. You would never believe that. Like,</v>

42
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:28.550
if someone told me that other than reading your book and kind of understanding

43
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.640
where you're, where you're coming from, I would think that this is nonsense.

44
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:32.474
It's genetics.

45
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.130
He's like why people have small hands or people have big feet or what?

46
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 1>Well, it's become a heritable trait. So,</v>

47
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:43.670
so what's happened now is they've found the researchers who who've,

48
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.660
who've done this rubber core Cine worked on this stuff for 30 years is 250

49
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.250
scientific papers on it.

50
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.030
They found within the first generation of switching to industrialized foods,

51
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.120
about 50% of the population is going to have malocclusion,

52
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.030
which means a crooked jaw crooked teeth after that 60 to 70%

53
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.260
next generation, after that, about 80%, after that look around,

54
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.420
that's us now about 90%. Jesus. So if, if, sorry,

55
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.660
no, I was going to put me off. So, so there, uh,

56
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.980
Dr. Kevin Boyd is now doing studies where he's looking at fetuses in the womb

57
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.280
and is seen their mouth size is too small.

58
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.650
And they have this backward slant to their faces.

59
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.220
Just like I have just like so many people in the population have,

60
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.410
if you were to measure a skull and you were to draw one line from its ear

61
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.410
to its nose and another line perpendicular to that,

62
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.700
almost every single ancient skull would be above that line.

63
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.680
Very powerful jaw. Now 90% of modern skulls are below it.

64
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.970
So they are behind it. So, and this is happening now.

65
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.930
It is becoming a heritable trait. So, so kids are messed up too,

66
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.150
to begin with, which is why so many kids are, have sleep apnea and snore now,

67
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.940
which is so injurious to their, to their health.

68
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.270
<v 0>And this came about because they weren't chewing tougher food.</v>

69
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.940
They didn't need the muscles and w what can be done to sort of reverse that.

70
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.300
<v 1>And adulthood it's harder. And, and for kids,</v>

71
00:04:15.301 --> 00:04:17.280
it's much easier because their muscles are,

72
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.590
and their bones are much more malleable,

73
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.130
but that's exactly what they found is once you introduce,

74
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.500
we used to chew for about four hours a day. Okay.

75
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.270
That that's just how it was from the Dawn of time to, to about 500 years ago.

76
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:34.440
But as wheat started getting processed in a white flour,

77
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.210
as rice became, we started taking the, the German, the brand away from rice.

78
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:40.830
So it's just the Polish seed.

79
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.340
As things began to get canned and bottled.

80
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:48.180
If you think about even what's considered healthy food right now, smoothies,

81
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.280
avocado, oatmeal, all of this stuff has so much power bars,

82
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.750
right? So in adulthood there, you can make some changes.

83
00:04:57.751 --> 00:05:02.730
And that's what I tried to do in my own face as, as a, uh, experiment,

84
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.751
uh, for kids,

85
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:08.640
what they're finding is these problems need to be diagnosed very early and they

86
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:09.540
need to be treated.

87
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:13.650
And what they do is they widen the mouth to the way that they were supposed to

88
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:18.170
be 500 years ago. So we're changing our bodies by,

89
00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:19.230
by force of will,

90
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.040
to the way that the nature had made them before we messed them up.

91
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.431
<v 0>Well, it was,</v>

92
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:26.250
there was a doctor that you were talking about that developed some sort of a

93
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:29.990
retainer that actually changed the volume of your jaw as an adult and changed

94
00:05:29.991 --> 00:05:30.824
the volume of your.

95
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.850
<v 1>That's. Right? So, um, I had crooked teeth growing up. I had braces,</v>

96
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:40.590
I had extractions, I had gear and me and everyone, I knew had the same thing.

97
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.960
It was never, if you were going to get it, it's just,

98
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.850
when are you going to get your braces? Right?

99
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.030
So the point of all those things was to straightened teeth,

100
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.670
but they're not looking at airway health, right? So,

101
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.800
so what happens just as a principal,

102
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.170
you've got a mouth that's too small for its face.

103
00:05:55.171 --> 00:05:58.580
The teeth are growing and crooked. You extract teeth from that,

104
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.660
get some headgear and go, you're creating.

105
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.930
At least there's a significant argument by many people in the field that say

106
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.710
you're making a small mouth smaller, and one leader in the field,

107
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:14.150
Dr. Michael Galvin said 50% of people who have orthodontics are going to, um,

108
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.840
have more breathing problems because of it. Orthodontics,

109
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.900
meaning braces as well. Brit braces are craning in.

110
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.960
So it's combination of braces and especially headgear.

111
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.470
And some of that stuff is being phased out. Braces are still,

112
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:30.540
you're forcing teeth into a smaller space to,

113
00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:32.870
to make them to make them straight.

114
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:37.820
So there's this the very first orthodontics weren't craning teeth

115
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:39.260
in to make them straight.

116
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.670
They would expand the mouth because even back then 120 years ago,

117
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:46.760
they knew our mouths were growing too small. They knew that.

118
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.490
So the first devices, I thought this was fascinating.

119
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.170
They were using this for kids who had cleft.

120
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:53.720
Palates had all of these other problems,

121
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:56.450
where they were having problem with chewing and breathing.

122
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.380
So they would expand their mouths with this device that went to the roof of your

123
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:02.690
mouth. And it had a little dowel screw.

124
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:06.950
And you slowly opened it up to expand the mouth. What does it feel like?

125
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.220
Um, it doesn't feel great. So, uh,

126
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.480
th this is where I think a lot of orthodontics is heading because it allows you

127
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:18.560
to have straighter teeth, but it also opens your airway.

128
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.010
<v 0>How long do you keep it in your, you keep it in your mouth,</v>

129
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.360
like braces all day long?

130
00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:23.451
<v 1>No, no. The,</v>

131
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:27.730
the one that I use was called a homeo block and this guy had been using it for

132
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:30.970
30 years and I used it at night.

133
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.850
So you put it on the pallet, upper palate, and you, you slow, you have this,

134
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.970
this little screw thing,

135
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:40.900
this little handle that every couple of weeks you open it a little more slowly.

136
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.450
There it is. Jamie's got a picture of it. All right.

137
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.220
So if you feel that you used one of those, yeah, I did not. None,

138
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.120
none as gnarly as that. Um, this looks intense, but, uh,

139
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.080
if you feel your head right now, you feel these sutures, right? These,

140
00:07:56.081 --> 00:08:00.610
these cracks in your head, you have one of those on your upper palate,

141
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:05.320
so that can open. Okay. Uh, that's, that's what it's made to do.

142
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.920
It can open and you can widen your mouth and adulthood.

143
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.930
And I showed this through, through cat scans.

144
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.190
And by that you can open your airway and you can breathe better.

145
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.700
And how long did you wear it for? I worked for one year, one year,

146
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.010
two to the week. I took the other cat scan.

147
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.770
<v 0>And you gained how much volume in your mouth?</v>

148
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.900
<v 1>I gained about five pennies worth of bone in my face,</v>

149
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.980
which is crazy.

150
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.253
<v 0>So stack them up.</v>

151
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.390
<v 2>Yeah. Five pennies. Yeah. So it's a lot of bone, man. So.</v>

152
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.370
<v 1>Then we've been told that we can't grow bone past 30, right?</v>

153
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.520
It's just entropy. We're only going to be losing. We can,

154
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.800
we can stop it from disappearing.

155
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.980
We can do some things to help prevent that loss, but we can't build it,

156
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.820
but we can, we can build it in the center of our face, in the.

157
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.730
<v 0>So you can really change the structure of your face from doing that.</v>

158
00:08:58.731 --> 00:09:00.030
You could widen your face.

159
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:04.610
<v 1>You can add more bone, you can model more bone inside of you. Yeah. You.</v>

160
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.750
<v 3>Look better. You think you're going to tell you good looking, man. But I mean,</v>

161
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:09.830
do you think you look.

162
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:14.570
<v 1>Better? I, I will not say better. I won't use those. No worse,</v>

163
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.230
worse people be before warned. Don't build bone in your face.

164
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.280
Now I did notice after, after about six weeks of wearing this thing,

165
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.580
people were like, yeah, what happened? What are you.

166
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.560
<v 0>Doing? They could see a shift.</v>

167
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.130
<v 1>Absolutely. And it's, and it's, it's very apparent. And there's,</v>

168
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:34.370
you can see a bunch of case studies on this and you can see it for yourself.

169
00:09:34.371 --> 00:09:37.040
And the neat thing is it's not subjective. It's not, well,

170
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:41.660
I think I look different. There's cat scans and there's metrics to it. So, yeah.

171
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.920
So, and it also opened my airways. It, it allowed me to expand,

172
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.910
I don't know how much is probably maybe 15%, 20%,

173
00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:53.240
but it was mostly the toning of the airway.

174
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.650
Why did you stop using it after a year? I'm still using it. You are. So I,

175
00:09:57.651 --> 00:09:59.480
for the book, for the research, I said,

176
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.110
I'm going to do this for one year and I'm going to wear it every night. Um,

177
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.710
I'm really going to be dedicated even after having a few, few beers,

178
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:07.071
it was like,

179
00:10:07.071 --> 00:10:10.190
the last thing I want to do is put this thing in my mouth and go to sleep.

180
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.030
But I did it, uh, because I was curious, cause I'd heard these stories.

181
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.610
I'd seen the case. Studies I'd see the data,

182
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.810
but I wanted to see what would happen in my, in my own body. And, um,

183
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.770
I tell you on a subjective level, I breathe more easily now than,

184
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:28.250
than I can ever remember breathing. I haven't had pneumonia and bronchitis,

185
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.450
any of those, but.

186
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.690
<v 0>There's a bunch of factors though, too, right? There's the nose breathing.</v>

187
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.170
There's the breath work. So it's a combination of all these.

188
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.900
<v 1>Things, but nose breathing wouldn't help you build more,</v>

189
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.010
more bone in your course. So a lot of that was due to this device.

190
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.520
Not only spread open that suture in the upper palate,

191
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.980
but also stimulated chewing stress.

192
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.930
So on one side there was this little bump. So every time you closed your mouth,

193
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.350
you got some chewing stress which would stimulate stem cells,

194
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.360
which would go into those sutures and build more bone. The differences. When,

195
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.320
when you clench your jaws right now, just like, you know, you're boxing,

196
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:10.280
you're intense, you're clenching your jaws. That does not stimulate that,

197
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.130
that good, beneficial, chewing stress. Okay?

198
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:18.050
Because our bodies identify that as sympathetic stress of cortisol levels go up,

199
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.150
right? That means growth. Isn't going to happen.

200
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.750
But if you think about eating a big piece of steak or a carrot,

201
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.300
you're not chewing on both sides of your molars,

202
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.390
you're chewing on one side or the other.

203
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.620
So when you stimulate the stress on one side or the other, you're,

204
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.380
if you next time you're chewing on something,

205
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.640
think about that. That's why you salivate and,

206
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.450
and you become more relaxed. And that's when that growth can happen.

207
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:49.610
<v 0>So chewing on one side or the other stimulates stem cells that don't get</v>

208
00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:50.181
stimulated.

209
00:11:50.181 --> 00:11:54.040
If you just like biting down on a mouthpiece because of cortisol and osteopaths.

210
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.970
Yeah. Yeah. Now how often do you have this thing in your mouth? Now?

211
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.300
<v 1>I took a break after a year to see what life was like on the other side of that.</v>

212
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.290
So nice. That's great. But, but I got curious,

213
00:12:07.291 --> 00:12:11.830
I talked to the guy who gave me this device, Dr. Ted Belfour and he's,

214
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:14.940
he's used this thing for 30 years. And in his case,

215
00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:19.650
studies are pretty fascinating. Um, and I talked to him, he's like, oh,

216
00:12:19.651 --> 00:12:21.810
we should do another cat scan. See what happened?

217
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.320
I didn't quite admit to him that I had stopped using it.

218
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:27.750
So I felt a little guilty. And now for the past,

219
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.490
about month and a half of up and back on the back on the train to see what

220
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.550
happens. So we're going to take another one just for, for kicks.

221
00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.100
I'm not going to write about the book's already done, but I just,

222
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:41.100
I'm curious to see what will happen if you keep wearing this.

223
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.540
If you can really keep improving it.

224
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.150
<v 0>Swami, Rama of orthodontics.</v>

225
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.450
If you get to hold that bad boy in your mouth for a few years, I mean,

226
00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:50.430
that'd be really fascinating if you change your face.

227
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:55.140
And all of a sudden you have like this big Clark Kent Superman type jaw,

228
00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:55.590
can you.

229
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.180
<v 1>Let me shack up here for a couple of years?</v>

230
00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.150
And I'm just going to focus on this all day. Just.

231
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:03.450
<v 0>Stay in the it to go do what you gotta do. Okay.</v>
