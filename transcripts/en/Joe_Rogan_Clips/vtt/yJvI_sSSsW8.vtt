00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Happy sober October.</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.570
<v 1>The first podcast ever, where Marshall is in the room.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.850
<v 0>Oh my gosh. I feel so honored.</v>

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.910
<v 1>This is a special one. He's just exhausted.</v>

5
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.920
And I knew he wanted to just lie down next to me.

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.280
<v 0>My dog always comes through the YouTube show and we're always like, oh,</v>

7
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.080
is she going to knock over the lights in the middle?

8
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.850
But you see her come in and out in the edit?

9
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.150
<v 1>Well, when a red Ben and I see the podcast back in the day,</v>

10
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:27.600
we stood in my office at my house when my kids are really little, so adhere,

11
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.320
like screaming and crying in the background, you know, she took my tool,

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.210
something like that, you know? So, um, thanks for doing this. Thanks.

13
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.670
<v 0>How's this how's sober October going. That's great.</v>

14
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.380
I want to thank you for doing that because it creates a

15
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:47.820
community and it's super cool for people to just have that month of clarity.

16
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.140
I just think it's really cool. I'm grateful. Ed's my sober birthday in October.

17
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:53.610
So I, how many.

18
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.810
<v 1>Years? Six years.</v>

19
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.940
<v 0>No, that's it. That's insane.</v>

20
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.310
<v 1>It's the hardest part. Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.293
<v 0>We just.</v>

22
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.450
<v 1>Are you sure you need to be sober from weed? Um, yeah.</v>

23
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.030
<v 0>I've tried because here's the thing, here's the kind of,</v>

24
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.750
you really want to know what kind of addict I am. I will,

25
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.850
I can do it for awhile. I've tried.

26
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.740
So I was in rehab when I was 19 for heroin and I started using

27
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.660
everything when I was 12, 13 years old. Well, not everything, but I mean,

28
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:25.140
I started drinking and smoking weed. I mean, I grew up all over.

29
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:28.380
I moved every year and a half it's long story. Um, my,

30
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.680
my whole thing sounds like an improv and like, I'm making it all up,

31
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.860
but it was just chaotic upbringing, but I'm from the east coast.

32
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.070
And then I graduated from high school in Minnesota. So to give you,

33
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:41.430
we just moved a lot. I went to like 11 schools in 12 years.

34
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.570
So I started drinking really young.

35
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.600
I started smoking weed right around when my parents got divorced.

36
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.650
And then I was pretty much a daily smoker from the day that I found weed.

37
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.480
It was like, ah, oh my God. I was like 14.

38
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.020
I love.

39
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.210
<v 1>Was it a release? Was an escape.</v>

40
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.420
Was it just a perturbance of normal?

41
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.260
<v 0>No, my, my upbringing was kind of chaotic.</v>

42
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.030
And honestly I think that I always had a debt of

43
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.630
gratitude because I don't know that I could have been fully present for what was

44
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:20.310
going on in, in the house. Um, and, and,

45
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.950
and not like killed myself or done something worse.

46
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.210
So it was just too much for like a small developing brain to handle.

47
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:29.310
And we'd put enough of that nice,

48
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:33.620
like fuzzy distance between me and that like chaos. So

49
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.160
I'm going to have, I'm going to start it. It's just going to be me alone crying.

50
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.080
<v 1>I had no idea.</v>

51
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.040
<v 0>It was. And so it was, it was good. Except then, um,</v>

52
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.530
I, it escalated after I was drugged and raped when I was 18. Oh,

53
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.510
Jesus. Sorry that to get heavy. It's part of my story. It's horrible, but bad.

54
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.810
Ha like one of the things that I've had to come to terms with is, you know,

55
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.570
I don't blame myself for that happening, but I,

56
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.190
I do have to take responsibility for the fact that when you're a woman or a girl

57
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:13.690
and you're out getting blacked out and this instance you're around people who

58
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:17.740
are bad, things happen that are not good. It's.

59
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.420
It's it sucks. But you know, if I had daughters, I would be like,

60
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.440
watch your drinks and like, be careful and don't get,

61
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.090
don't try not to black out because you don't know what is gonna go down.

62
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.170
<v 1>So many people that I know that have been drugged.</v>

63
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.760
<v 0>Yeah. I know. I know the, the thing about that, that's so weird to me. Well,</v>

64
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.140
a I don't,

65
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.150
I try and make light of everything because I have to in order to survive

66
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.090
and I'm from the east coast, that's just how I handle.

67
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.410
Like my family's from Rhode Island, my dad's one, my dad's one of 10.

68
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.340
It was a roast battle growing up, you know, like you either,

69
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.610
if you were the sensitive one, they're like, oh, you're going to cry about it.

70
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.930
You can survive. You had to just be like, I'm on top of it.

71
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.060
<v 1>Rhode Island, Boston, Connecticut.</v>

72
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.790
<v 0>You're getting roasted and you either keep up or you're like, you're out,</v>

73
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:14.650
you're out. You're the loser in the family. And you're drinking too,

74
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:19.540
obviously heavily. So, um, he, I unfortunately was like,

75
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:20.830
if you're gonna do that,

76
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:25.810
like use enough to make sure that I don't come to in the middle of it. Like,

77
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.480
don't be an amateur bro. Like get,

78
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.140
cause I have memories of it and kind of came to, so it was like,

79
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.160
I would have preferred just the nothingness of, you know, it being launched,

80
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.650
like stuck in my subconscious, I think what was.

81
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.620
<v 1>The whole Cosby situation like for you then? Oh.</v>

82
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.030
<v 0>I wrote a whole thing about it because I wrote this piece on</v>

83
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:50.020
medium. Um, bill Cosby raped me kind of because when I,

84
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.340
because it's a little click baity, um,

85
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.460
because when all that stuff came out, I was like, oh really ladies,

86
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:01.900
like you're going to come forward now.

87
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.700
And I had to stop and like evaluate my own, my own.

88
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.430
And just response to that. And writing is pretty much how I process everything.

89
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:14.650
It always has been. And so I'm like,

90
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:16.990
I'm just going to write about this and see what comes through.

91
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:21.970
And essentially it was that internalized shame that had I had been holding onto

92
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.290
was I was projecting it onto these women who were, cause if,

93
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.550
if a bunch of girls from Minnesota, I came forward and said this sleazy dude,

94
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.810
you know, dragged us and raped us back in the nineties.

95
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.790
Yeah. I'm 40, I'm 40. So yeah, it was like the nineties. Um,

96
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.510
I would come forward and, and support them and support of that.

97
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:47.170
If it was the person who did it to me, I wouldn't be like, come on ladies,

98
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:51.550
it's a little late for this now, but that was my kind of gut instinct.

99
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.390
So I think that was, I, like I said, I think it's internalized shame.

100
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:59.630
I think I just, I had not forgiven. Um,

101
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.680
the girl in me, the, the, the young girl in me who,

102
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.810
who blamed myself. I didn't tell anyone when it happened. I,

103
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.060
I woke up and, uh, I'm lucky. I'm not dead.

104
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.740
I'm lucky I made it to get sober six years ago when I look at how

105
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.660
my trajectory was. And so I ended up,

106
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.880
um, like kind of coming to,

107
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:25.760
and the weird thing about rupees is that you don't really remember.

108
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.400
So I like thank the guy for having, you know, it was like, oh,

109
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.240
thanks for letting us crash in this place. I didn't even mean to crash at.

110
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.730
And I think, um,

111
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.630
and then things started coming back and one of my friends,

112
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:43.010
I think something happened to her too. And, and, um, it's crazy.

113
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:46.610
I'm telling this story just based on what happened last week. So, um,

114
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.200
I just went, we went to like the apple river,

115
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.820
which was this place in Minnesota and just,

116
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.910
I got blackout drunk for like the next five days. I couldn't,

117
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.900
I couldn't handle it. I felt ashamed because I was drinking under age. I had,

118
00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.680
I was working in a restaurant. I had a lot of, um, older friends.

119
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.620
We were downtown in Minneapolis. I felt super cool.

120
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.950
And my friend and I both have the exact last memory.

121
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.990
And then I have memories of like crawling around on the floor and try and find

122
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.880
fault, like just bad things. And, um, I always hesitate to tell them too,

123
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.590
cause I know they're guys they're like, yeah. Tell me more, just kidding. Um,

124
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.730
defensive mechanisms and um, yeah,

125
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:32.750
so then I just went bananas. I started doing hard drugs that year.

126
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.850
<v 1>And did that as a response.</v>

127
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.300
<v 0>To that Def I mean, I think I just was trying,</v>

128
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.500
I was already running from so much there had already been my.

129
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.570
<v 1>Tipping point. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.820
<v 0>My, my stepdad was a little crazy.</v>

131
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:50.690
I don't really publicly talk about it all that often, but it was, um,

132
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.640
like whatever, uh, like crazy stepdad. Do you like it?

133
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.520
I think you can figure things out. Um,

134
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.880
and it was really chaotic and, and uh,

135
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.080
then that kind of escalated. Um, my drug use,

136
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:10.580
I found hard drugs and like, then I tried, um,

137
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.420
speed and math and I hated it. Cause my brain already races.

138
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:17.090
I don't need any help with that. That's.

139
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.940
<v 1>Rare though that somebody doesn't like speed and meth. I.</v>

140
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.773
<v 0>Hated it.</v>

141
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.850
<v 1>I hated it. No.</v>

142
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.120
<v 0>No, no, I don't. I loved heroin. I didn't get like.</v>

143
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.750
<v 1>Like that maternal womb.</v>

144
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.810
<v 0>Thing. I think it's also, um, I don't,</v>

145
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.200
I don't need stimulation for my brain. I need,

146
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:40.010
I always wanted relief from this. When.

147
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.990
<v 1>You snorting it, what.</v>

148
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:45.050
<v 0>Heroin and smoking it and.</v>

149
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.220
<v 1>Get to the point of shooting. It.</v>

150
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.260
<v 0>It, it w it was right before I quit. So it once,</v>

151
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.350
and then I was like, I'm going to die essentially. Cause you.

152
00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.650
<v 1>Realize like, oh, was going, I was.</v>

153
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.300
<v 0>89 Pounds in 19. I totally had like one of those hallmark movie moments.</v>

154
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:05.040
I had been out here with a boyfriend and he had a movie and we were

155
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.750
just like, it was like a Mo sit in Nancy movie.

156
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:13.740
I was parent, I was doing so much blow. I had delusions of like.

157
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.840
<v 1>I was, he was making a movie.</v>

158
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.250
<v 0>He was in one in a movie and we were out here and it was just chaos.</v>

159
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:25.200
And we were like, it was the that I did.

160
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.000
<v 1>How'd you get into comedy?</v>

161
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.470
<v 0>Um, that was not for awhile. Thank God. Um,</v>

162
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:35.010
I got dared to do that in 2010 basically.

163
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.290
And so somebody dared me to do it.

164
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:40.860
And the comedy store is where I pop my cherry. And, um,

165
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.390
it was on like one of those bringer shows and it was an absolute show,

166
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:49.950
like every stereotype that you ever heard,

167
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:53.370
people were doing blow in the green room. And like everybody, it was like.

168
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.320
<v 1>All in the belly room then no, it was.</v>

169
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.900
<v 0>On the main stage, but it was one of those like me. It was,</v>

170
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.930
it was when it was in like the years before the research.

171
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.430
<v 1>Oh, that's when I was gone from 2007,</v>

172
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.280
you got there in the darkest days,

173
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.350
say the darkest days were like 2007 to like 2012.

174
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.900
<v 0>It was dark. And then my set went okay,</v>

175
00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:18.930
enough that I decided I wanted to like do it again.

176
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:23.460
But that was many years after, after the like trajectory. So I,

177
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.980
long story short, I ended up in rehab, um,

178
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:30.840
at 19 and I was there for seven, seven months.

179
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.160
I was in the halfway. I was.

180
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:33.960
<v 1>Arrested.</v>

181
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.540
<v 0>No, I put myself in a halfway house, but it was like.</v>

182
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.160
<v 1>Can you just, can you put yourself in jail? No, it's not jail. And how can you,</v>

183
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.720
how come you can put yourself in a halfway house.

184
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.470
<v 0>Wait houses like that. In-between jail. It's not mandatory.</v>

185
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.190
<v 1>So they let you put yourself like, Hey, look, I'm up.</v>

186
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.810
You mind if I just hang out here for awhile?

187
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:57.000
<v 0>I couldn't go home because my home stuff. And so I basically,</v>

188
00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.690
after two weeks my insurance was up and they're like, okay,

189
00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.910
you're free to go home. I'm like, nah, I can't go.

190
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.920
I'm going to do drugs in like two minutes. And so no,

191
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:11.610
I took a bus and put myself on general assistance. And Minnesota,

192
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.820
the joke is it's Minnesota land of 10,000 treatment centers.

193
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:16.800
It's like a great place to get sober.

194
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.810
And so I put myself on basically welfare and then I found a

195
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:25.030
place and I'll never forget. I called this place and the woman answered.

196
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:29.160
And she was like, I was like, hi. And I had had some guys try to do stuff to me.

197
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:32.760
So I was looking for an all woman's place. And this woman was like,

198
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.070
you ever heard of? I was like, hi, what's it like here?

199
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:38.520
She's like you ever heard of bootcamp? There's like, sounds perfect.

200
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.520
I needed that structure. I needed something. And so they, I basically,

201
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.310
because I was on welfare, they accepted me and it was like,

202
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:52.200
me and I was the only white girl I was by far the youngest. It was,

203
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.420
it was basically a lot of women just who the judge said,

204
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:59.530
like go to this program for three months and you won't go to jail.

205
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.560
It was nuts. That's an education. Oh yeah. I mean, I realized what a privilege,

206
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.590
little spoiled brat I was that's for sure. And then I never,

207
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.070
but I also hide behind that. So I never wanted to share anything.

208
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.790
And they're like, EV it's all relative. Everyone has their problems.

209
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.030
And I'm like, yeah, but these stories versus mine, they're not,

210
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.270
I feel like I just had too much.

211
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:28.660
And then I started sharing them and they're like, white people are up.

212
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.550
And that was when I learned it was really an early lesson and like all this

213
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:40.780
intersectional, it was very early lesson for me that like,

214
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:45.220
it doesn't matter. It does not matter what color your skin is, what,

215
00:12:45.221 --> 00:12:49.600
like when you're an addict or when you're at rock bottom or we're all humans

216
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:53.560
just at like up trying to get out of our own way.

217
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.500
And so that was, that was an interesting experience.

218
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:58.300
And then I got in my car and moved to LA.
