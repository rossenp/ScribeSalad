00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I wonder where this is going. I really do.</v>

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.530
I wonder because this is,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.550
it seems like this new found ability to broadcast that we have with

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.460
whether you have a YouTube page or whether you have a Twitter or whatever,

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:19.230
you're doing this new found ability to spread

6
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:23.880
whatever you're trying to say to so many people with very little understanding

7
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.620
on the most part from what I.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.930
<v 1>Well, I think it's actually a great thing overall.</v>

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.280
It means that any human can broadcast to any other human on the planet at any

10
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.590
time. So for example, if you know,

11
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:38.070
a totalitarian dictator were to come to power and someone was beating up,

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.580
you know, had fascists beating up on old women like that would get broadcast out

13
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.640
instantly. There would be an instant outrage, human cry, rallying.

14
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:48.690
So in that sense, it helps bring attention to the plight of anybody.

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.040
But right now we're going through the phase where we have this new found power

16
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:57.090
to assemble mobs and people don't know how to deal with that.

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.160
So it becomes very easy to set up a mob and have it attack somebody take all the

18
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.410
context out, like even this conversation,

19
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:06.060
I'm sure people will take out snippets,

20
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.090
put them on social media and try and get somebody outraged. Of course.

21
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.460
And so you have to learn how first of all,

22
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.450
society just has to get over this idea of outrage. Like to me, like outrage,

23
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.870
people are the people that get easily outraged to the stupidest people on social

24
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.450
media. Those are the people I block instantly. Uh,

25
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.970
it's just kind of very low level thinking, right? These are the foot.

26
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.130
These are the foot soldiers in a mob.

27
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.710
Eventually society just has to get over it.

28
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.190
They have to understand that these are all snippets being taken out of context.

29
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.630
These are doctored video clips.

30
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:36.870
These are just someone who trying to get outraged over something.

31
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.970
Eventually there'll also be anti mob tactics. Like for example, if,

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.980
if I go to someone's Twitter feed and all it is it's full of polit political

33
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:51.450
ranting, raving, conspiracy theories. Do I want to work with this person?

34
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.270
Do I want associate with this person? Do I want to be friends with this person?

35
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.440
Their mind is just cluttered with junk. I don't necessarily blame them.

36
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.390
I think that the human brain is not designed to absorb all of the world's

37
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.171
breaking news,

38
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.550
24 7 emergencies injected straight into your skull with clickbait headline news.

39
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.450
If you pay attention to that stuff, even if you're well-meaning,

40
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.140
even if your sound of mind and body, it will eventually drive you insane.

41
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.870
This goes back to clockwork. Orange where he's, you know,

42
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:21.240
has his eyes opened up, was forced to watch the news.

43
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.750
But I think that's what's happening right now because these are addictive,

44
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.800
right? Twitter or Facebook, Instagram. These are weaponized.

45
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.970
You have social statisticians and scientists and researchers on people in lab

46
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.300
coats,

47
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.320
literally best minds of our generation and figuring out how to addict you to the

48
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.530
news. And if you fall for it, if you get addicted,

49
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.610
your brain will get destroyed. And I think this is the modern struggle,

50
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.810
the modern struggle. So the ancient struggle used to be the tribal struggle.

51
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.720
You had your tribe of friends and family. You had your religion,

52
00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:54.390
you had your country, you had your loyalty, you had your nationality.

53
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.130
At least you had meaning and support,

54
00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.070
but now you would struggle against other tribes, modern life. We're so free.

55
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.670
Everything's become atomized. We stand alone. You live in your apartment alone,

56
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.040
you live in your house alone. Your parents don't live nearby.

57
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.450
Your friends don't live nearby.

58
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.900
You don't have any tribal meaning you don't believe in religion anymore.

59
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.720
You don't believe in country anymore. It's fine. You got a lot of freedom.

60
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:14.643
It's fantastic.

61
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.510
But now when they come to attack you you're alone

62
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.940
and you can resist. So how do they attack you? It's all.

63
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.490
Well-meaning I don't fault capitalism. I love capitalism.

64
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.890
But look at how it happens. Social media,

65
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.200
they've massaged all the mechanisms to addict you like a Skinner

66
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.710
pigeon or a rat. Who's just going to click, click, click, click, click.

67
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:37.750
Can't put the phone down the food.

68
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.940
They've taken sugar and they're weaponized it.

69
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.270
They've put it into all these different forms and varieties that you can't

70
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.400
resist eating drugs, right?

71
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.900
They've taken pharmaceuticals and plants and they've synthesized them.

72
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.420
They've grown them in such a way that you can't, you get addicted.

73
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:55.450
You can't put them down porn, right? If you're a young male,

74
00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.570
you wander around the internet. It'll like SAP away, your libido.

75
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.780
And you're not going out in real life society anymore because you've got this

76
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.660
incredibly stimulating stuff coming at you, video games,

77
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.210
another way to addict people. So you have this,

78
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.280
you have entire large factories of people that are working to

79
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.890
addict you to these things and you stand alone.

80
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.610
So the modern struggle as an individual is learning how to resist these things

81
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:20.560
in the first place, drawing your own boundaries.

82
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:21.580
And there's no one there to help you.

83
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.540
<v 0>Ooh, that's terrifying. I mean,</v>

84
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:30.340
it is new road that needs to be navigated by young people that are,

85
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.630
there's no map. There's no guidebook on how to handle this.

86
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.300
<v 1>Our generation is the transition generation.</v>

87
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.510
I think our kids will know how to handle it better.

88
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.523
Cause they'll grow up with it.

89
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.150
<v 0>I hope I hope too,</v>

90
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.780
because you're seeing some ridiculous behavior from people today.

91
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:49.930
That's so common. I mean, I don't know if you've been paying attention to this,

92
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:53.050
but there was a guy who he made a,

93
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.380
a video of it turns out it wasn't even him that made the video.

94
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:57.400
At least that's not what he said,

95
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:02.200
but it was a video where he sort of doctored Nancy Pelosi talking and made it

96
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:06.130
look like she was drunk. And then a bunch of people retweeted it and like,

97
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.900
oh my God, look, she's drunk. And, and so one of the online publications,

98
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.033
uh, uh,

99
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.930
some website tracked him down and doxed

100
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:21.640
him and it turned out he's just a day laborer who is an African-American

101
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:25.360
Trump fan and thought it would be funny to do that.

102
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.330
And it turns out that he didn't even, at least according to him,

103
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.520
he actually just put it up on his Facebook page.

104
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.530
What's even more disturbing is Facebook gave up his information to this

105
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:37.540
website, right? For what?

106
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.750
Cause he made something funny that made people seem drunk.

107
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.470
There's a million of those about me. I mean, you could find them. I mean.

108
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.180
<v 1>I think Facebook and Twitter and a bunch of these other social media platforms</v>

109
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.300
are committing slow motion suicide through these kinds of activities.

110
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.480
<v 0>That was a stunning one, though, that they would give up this guy,</v>

111
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:59.540
who's a laborer because he made a parody video or he made someone look foolish

112
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:00.530
with editing, right?

113
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.520
<v 1>Have basically the media views it as their job to go after individuals.</v>

114
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.354
They don't like.

115
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.270
<v 0>I use media with air quotes in that regard because I don't think this is</v>

116
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:09.720
something that the New York times would have done.

117
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.250
<v 1>But the media is getting more and more desperate. Right?</v>

118
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.320
Cause what happened was before the internet,

119
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.220
you could have two local newspapers in every town and you could have two local

120
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.280
news stations, TV stations in every town.

121
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.170
And then CNN came along and started commoditizing the news 24, 7 broadcast.

122
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.660
And then the internet came along and that was the final nail in the coffin

123
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.180
because what the internet did was it said, actually,

124
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:35.720
if there's a fact that's news, you can distribute that immediately.

125
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.670
It can go on Twitter. It can go on Facebook.

126
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:40.220
It gets reprinted and Google news a thousand times, you know,

127
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:42.560
you go on Google news. You're like, okay, what's the piece of news,

128
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.100
which source and 3000 other articles too many. Right?

129
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.500
So news has become commoditized.

130
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.240
So the entire news media has shifted into pedaling, opinions and entertainment.

131
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:58.490
And so now they've become a variation between like cheerleaders shock, troops,

132
00:06:58.491 --> 00:07:02.990
enforcers, uh, you know, talking heads. So these are now tribal.

133
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.170
These are not propaganda machines signaling for their tribes.

134
00:07:06.171 --> 00:07:08.690
It's a right wing one. There's a left wing one, right? There's the alt-right,

135
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:09.620
there's a control left.

136
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.410
And the two of them are just fighting it out using their various media,

137
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.090
organs and memes. So basically when you see one of these news organizations,

138
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.450
doxing of an individual, that's like a tank running over a soldier.

139
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.200
And if that's what's going on, it's just war. And so there's no,

140
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.700
there's no such thing anymore. As a neutral media commentator, the,

141
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.450
the illusion of objectivity that journalism had is lost.

142
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.900
There's no longer one guy like a Walter Cronkite that everyone's going to listen

143
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.960
to. It's not all just shock troops, fighting wars with each other.

144
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.380
<v 0>How does this play out? Have you thought about it.</v>

145
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.940
<v 1>A little bit? Uh, so what the internet does, a lot of this is internet driven.</v>

146
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.620
What the internet does is the internet creates one giant

147
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:55.520
aggregator or two for everything. One taxi dispatcher,

148
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:59.480
one e-commerce store, one search engine one, uh, you know,

149
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:03.920
one social media site for friends and family, one for business, et cetera.

150
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.570
So the internet is this giant aggregator where it creates a one big hedge Amman

151
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:09.643
for everything.

152
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.750
And it creates an atomized long tail of millions and millions of

153
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:19.130
individuals. What it gets rid of is the medium, medium size ones in the middle.

154
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.730
So for example, you might've had like seven Hollywood studios.

155
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.180
What's all going to be Netflix. You had, uh, you know, like, uh,

156
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.860
10 large e-commerce players had commerce players from Walmart to, uh,

157
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.530
Costco to, you know, K-Mart and whatever.

158
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.280
It's just gonna be Amazon and a ton of small individual brands.

159
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.210
So that's the world that we're headed towards one hegemonic and millions of

160
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:42.044
individuals.

161
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:47.330
So where it ends up longterm is media will be a few gigantic

162
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.120
outlets. You know, it could be the New York times. It could be Facebook,

163
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:50.954
a few like that.

164
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.290
And there's going to be just a really long tail of millions of independent

165
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:57.600
people. So this idea of who's a journalist and who's not, you know,

166
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.270
as a Sondra journalists or not, everyone's a journalist,

167
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.740
that's the world that we're headed towards. I do think that extreme power,

168
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:09.210
the most powerful people in the world today, and this is not well-known,

169
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:12.480
but the most powerful people in the world today are the people who are writing

170
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:15.090
the algorithms for Twitter and Facebook and Instagram,

171
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.610
because they're controlling the spread of information.

172
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.070
They're literally rewriting people's brains.

173
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.180
They're programming the culture and they're doing it very subtly like Google.

174
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.720
I believe that one of their execs got up in front of Congress and the

175
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.680
congressmen asked him, uh, you know, do you manipulate search results?

176
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.000
And he said, no, we do not manipulate search results. Really? That's your job.

177
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.270
That is literally all Google does. Google has one job,

178
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.950
which is to manipulate search results,

179
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:44.040
to pull them out of the noise and rank them properly. And the,

180
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.510
the precise algorithms of how they do that is very hidden, very complex,

181
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:53.310
but influences the hearts and minds of everybody, including all the voters. Now,

182
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.670
if Google, Facebook and Twitter had been smart about this,

183
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.570
they would not have picked sides. They would have said, we're publishers,

184
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.690
whatever it goes through, our pipes goes through our pipes. If it's illegal,

185
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:06.690
we'll take it down, give us a court order. Otherwise we don't touch it.

186
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.770
It's like the phone company.

187
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.100
If I call you up and I say something horrible to you on the phone,

188
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:12.420
the phone company doesn't get in trouble,

189
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.770
but the moment they started taking stuff down that wasn't illegal because

190
00:10:16.771 --> 00:10:21.120
somebody screamed, they basically lost their right to be viewed as a carrier.

191
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.850
And now all of a sudden they're they've taken on liability.

192
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.000
So they're sliding down the slippery slope into ruin slope,

193
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.250
into ruin where the left wants him to take down the right,

194
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:32.400
the right ones to take down the left. And now they have no more friends.

195
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:35.970
They have no allies traditionally in the libertarian leaning Republicans and

196
00:10:35.971 --> 00:10:38.400
Democrats would have stood up in principle for the common carriers,

197
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.120
but now they won't. So my guess is as soon as Congress,

198
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:44.490
and this is the state is coming, if not already here,

199
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.200
it might even have been here today, actually,

200
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.430
because this saw something related in the news, the day is coming.

201
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.420
When the politicians realize that these social media

202
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.450
platforms are picking the next president,

203
00:10:57.451 --> 00:11:01.320
the next Congressman they're literally picking and they have the power to pick.

204
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.360
So they will be controlled by the government.

205
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.810
<v 0>In, in what way? How do you think they're gonna be controlled?</v>

206
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.980
We think they're going to have to adhere to strict principles of freedom.

207
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.560
<v 1>No, no. Unfortunately it's headed the opposite direction, right?</v>

208
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.740
I wish it was freedom of speech. Uh, much more likely.

209
00:11:16.741 --> 00:11:19.150
They're going to be in the short to medium term.

210
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.230
They're going to be holding for hearings. Uh, they're going to be pressured,

211
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:23.820
massively do this. Don't do that.

212
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.390
<v 0>We're concerned about that. As the hearings that I saw with Zuckerberg,</v>

213
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.140
those people were completely incompetent. They don't seem to understand.

214
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.920
<v 1>They don't, but they're just applying pressure.</v>

215
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:32.970
They're just trying to scare him.

216
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:35.820
So he'll do what they want and what do they want them to do?

217
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.590
They want them to basically suppress the other side. So if you're right-wing,

218
00:11:40.591 --> 00:11:42.270
you want to suppress the left-wing. If you're left-wing,

219
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:43.380
you want to suppress the right wing.

220
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.070
And if you just see where these companies are headquartered in Silicon valley,

221
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.680
um, all the sensors and that's really what they are.

222
00:11:49.681 --> 00:11:53.010
There are sensors working inside these companies they're just called they're

223
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.360
called by different names, obviously, right? It's doublespeak,

224
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.790
you call it the department. Defense wants the department of war.

225
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.190
So in this case, the department of safety and trust,

226
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:01.660
when really it's the department of censorship,

227
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.960
the sensors are inside Silicon valley. So it's going to reflect Silicon valley.

228
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.530
<v 0>Which is extremely progressive left ring. Yeah.</v>

229
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.010
And if you're not that you really have no place. There's I mean,

230
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.000
try being a conservative and open conservative at Google.

231
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.620
<v 1>Good luck. Now you get lynched. Yeah.</v>

232
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.960
<v 0>That's crazy. Yeah. I mean,</v>

233
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:24.250
I don't think that there was ever a thing like that

234
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.770
that was so influential.

235
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:30.010
And so politically ideologically one sided.

236
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.770
<v 1>Yeah. There's a, there's a little saying on the internet,</v>

237
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:34.030
I think it's called conquest law.

238
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.180
That any organization that's not explicitly left right wing,

239
00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:41.350
eventually becomes left wing. And I don't know why that's true,

240
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:43.060
but it does seem to me to be true.

241
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.660
<v 0>It's a fascinating battle that's going on right now. I mean, it really is.</v>

242
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.780
And conservatives, and as far as social media is concerned,

243
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.130
they're just getting chopped off at the hams left and right.

244
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.900
<v 1>Yeah. What will eventually happen is that, uh, whenever you suppress speech,</v>

245
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.870
the organism metastasizes,

246
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.770
then it has to start turning towards other means if you're unlucky goes towards

247
00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:09.280
violence, uh, if you're lucky to find other outlets, uh,

248
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.310
I think what will happen is we will start creating decentralized media.

249
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.300
That's not owned by any single entity that can't be suppressed or shut down that

250
00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.920
will then start spreading these various.

251
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.130
<v 0>Things. And that will take the place of Twitter or Facebook or whatever.</v>

252
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.890
<v 1>But it's going to take 10 years, 20 years. It's not overnight.</v>

253
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:24.880
<v 0>Well, uh, you know,</v>

254
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.850
Twitter took 10 years to get to the point where it's at this mess right now,

255
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.330
but it was so interesting to, to have Jack Dorsey and to,

256
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.330
to talk to him about where it's going, where he thinks he's going,

257
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.800
and then his own principles, which he believes that it's a fundamental, right.

258
00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:42.490
And he believes that freedom of speech is something that we all should have.

259
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:47.050
And that these platforms should essentially be

260
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.560
like, like utilities, like the electric company.

261
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.170
<v 1>That's correct. And he has the right vision. It's just,</v>

262
00:13:53.171 --> 00:13:56.470
he's in an organization where the other individuals in the organization feel

263
00:13:56.471 --> 00:14:00.160
differently, very differently. So the organization itself can get hijacked.
