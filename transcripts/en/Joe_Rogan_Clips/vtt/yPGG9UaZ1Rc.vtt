00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.120
When they track racism over the last 100 years,

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.560
it's at a decline, it's at a measurable decline,

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.120
but not enough, what could be done to accelerate that decline.

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.880
What do you think can be done to sort of.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.190
<v 1>Start, start teaching, uh, civic, civics SP you know,</v>

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.510
um, spike up the civics in elementary school, not don't wait to high school.

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.030
<v 0>By civics. What do you mean exactly? You know.</v>

9
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 1>Our country is so diverse.</v>

10
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.710
Now we need to learn about the history of everybody and our country. And,

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.300
and everybody's contribu to making this a great country, white, black,

12
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.500
Hispanic women, whatever our, our country is truly a melting pot. And we,

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.940
and we need to treat it as such and give everybody credibility. So,

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.700
you know, this person, you know, looks different than me,

15
00:00:56.701 --> 00:00:59.460
but he contributed something that I need. I look different than him,

16
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.210
but I contribute something that he needs. Yeah, you that kind of thing.

17
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.770
So we have more mutual respect for one another. You know, the,

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.530
the older generations are gonna die out,

19
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.530
but we have to stop them from proliferating, their,

20
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.530
their BS to these younger generations, you know,

21
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:19.530
mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and we do this in schools. Right. You know, look when,

22
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:23.240
when I was in, in, uh, in junior high school, which they don't have anymore,

23
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:25.080
right. They have middle school now. Um,

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.560
sex education was being introduced. Parents were freaking out,

25
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.920
oh my God, I don't want my kid learning that. Well, guess what?

26
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.320
They didn't want their kid going to school and learning about sex.

27
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.080
But yet these parents were not teaching their kid about sex at home either.

28
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.710
They don't want their kid learning it.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310
How you gonna stop a kid learning about sex.

30
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.830
If you don't let your teachers in school, educate them properly.

31
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.190
And you're not willing to do it at home, your kid's still gonna learn it.

32
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.590
And where, where is he? Or she gonna learn it out in the street?

33
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.230
And then what are you gonna do when your kid comes home pregnant,

34
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.380
you gonna be all freaked out. So if you want to take ed,

35
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.900
when I was in junior high school,

36
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.100
you had to bring a note from your parents saying it was okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

37
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.580
And then you had like a little small class of five or six people taking sex ed

38
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.740
today is part of the regular curriculum. Yeah. And as a result,

39
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.340
kids today are better informed about venal, disease,

40
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.290
STDs, family planning, contraception, and all these kinds of things. They,

41
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:33.050
because they they're no longer ignorant. Mm. They have more information.

42
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.690
All right. Um,

43
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.970
the same thing has the taboo on sex education has been

44
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:44.440
lifted. Right. Okay. We need to lift the taboo on, on,

45
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.000
on racism in schools and talk about it at an early age.

46
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.480
<v 0>How much time are they allocating towards teaching people,</v>

47
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.760
how to accept diverse groups and how to accept, uh, how to,

48
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.360
how to fight against racism. I mean, is that something that's taught?

49
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.600
It seems like that should be a, a core.

50
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.920
<v 1>Curriculum in private schools. Uh, where,</v>

51
00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:07.120
where I see it is mostly in private schools. I don't see it in public schools,

52
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.040
which is very unfortunate. So, you know, you know, parents,

53
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.760
parents seem to seem to, to run the schools. You know, you know, if, if,

54
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:18.870
if your kid, for example, you send your kid to school, uh, um,

55
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.630
and you find out your kid is not learning what you think he or she should learn.

56
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.150
What do you do? You take him out of that school and put him in another school.

57
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.550
Right. If they don't learn it there, you put him in a private school.

58
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.110
If they don't learn it, there you take 'em home and you homeschool 'em.

59
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.070
And so I'm, you know, you know, a lot,

60
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.420
a lot of schools are very loath to, to, to, to step on eggshells with parents.

61
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.100
You know, you know, they don't want to upset the parents, whatever,

62
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.340
but they need to, the parents are not the teachers,

63
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.620
the teachers or the teachers. Well, it.

64
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.540
<v 0>Seems that if you could explain to kids how people get radicalized,</v>

65
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.540
if you could explain to kids how, what happens online,

66
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.210
how they draw you in what's thee evil of being a part of a tribe,

67
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.450
which is a big part of it. Right. A big part of it is being like a gang, right.

68
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.650
Same thing that attracts kids to gangs. Like everybody's in it,

69
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:12.810
we're all together. It's like, it's a tight group, right? Yeah. I mean, that,

70
00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:17.210
that gets people in. And when they draw you in, like, if the kids said, oh,

71
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.960
this is that they talked about in seventh grade. I know what doing, I mean,

72
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.200
just that alone. I mean, they're better.

73
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.920
<v 1>Prepared. Yes. That information. Yes, exactly. Yes. And so schools are,</v>

74
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.880
are one thing, academic at an early age.

75
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.080
The next thing I fault are churches. Well, when I say churches,

76
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.640
I mean religious institutions, which would include synagogues, et cetera. Um,

77
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.750
and you know, I hate to get down on, on the CLER, but I'm telling you, they,

78
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.310
they are, they, they have accountability that they're not accepting. Um,

79
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.870
and don't get me wrong. I'm a Christian, all that kind of stuff. I,

80
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.270
and I was a beacon in my church at one time, but here's the thing,

81
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.070
whether you're Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Mormon, whatever,

82
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.340
you have some form of Sunday school. And so you go down in the basement in,

83
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.660
in your, in your facility, in your, in your church or temple or whatever. Um,

84
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.340
and your, and your Sunday school lesson, when you're four or five years old,

85
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.700
they teach you that, uh, we're all, God's children,

86
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.220
God made a rainbow, right? And we accept that at four or five years old.

87
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.970
And then we grow older, we reach puberty at adolescence,

88
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.850
whatever we move upstairs to the big congregation.

89
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.970
Now we're sitting up there with the adults, um, the, the clergy,

90
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.410
the rabbi, the priest, the minister, the pastor, the Reverend, what? The,

91
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.010
whatever, no longer teaches that Sunday school lesson.

92
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.890
They stop saying upstairs. We're all God's children.

93
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.800
What do you think would happen

94
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.920
if the Reverend of the priests were say to the congregation one Sunday morning,

95
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.960
Hey folks, guess what? It's okay for blacks and whites to marry.

96
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.600
It's okay for Jews to marry Catholics,

97
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.200
half the congregation would get up and leave and they wouldn't be putting their

98
00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:00.640
money in the, in the collection plate.

99
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.400
Cause they're not hearing what they want to hear. Right.

100
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.840
And because it has not been continued that that Sunday school lesson needs to

101
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.240
be continued upstairs. So adults feel, Hey, you know, we're all a rainbow,

102
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.400
we're all a God's children, but the priest does not say that.

103
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.030
Or the Reverend does not say that anymore because he's afraid of walking on

104
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:21.230
eggshells and,

105
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:25.230
and stopping the flow of money coming into ties and offerings in that collection

106
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.750
plate. Mm. People would be changing churches or firing him. Right.

107
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.710
And then your kid is, um, let's say, let's say,

108
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.180
uh, let's say I'm Catholic. And uh, now I'm in 12th grade and,

109
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.780
uh, I'm, I'm going to the senior prom. So my mom says, so,

110
00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.180
so darl, who, who take to the senior prom? I say, I'm gonna take, um,

111
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.860
uh, um, Susan Goldberg.

112
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.540
Oh yeah. You know, Susan's a nice girl, but,

113
00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:00.850
but don't you think you should take a, a nice Catholic girl? Uh, well, yeah,

114
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:03.810
mom, but I mean, but you know, we we're, I thought we were all God's children.

115
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.370
Uh, yeah, we are, but &lt;laugh&gt; exactly,

116
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.810
but is not a God word. Right. But is a man word. Yes. God was perfect.

117
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.890
If, if we, if we are to believe in the concept of God,

118
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.840
then we are to believe that God did not make any exceptions and buts and

119
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.520
mistakes, et cetera. In little loopholes, he was perfect from the word go.

120
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.120
But as a man word is an exception. Yes. God was perfection,

121
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.200
man is exception. Right. So, um,

122
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.360
that's what happened, you know, if so,

123
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.310
so that's why, um,

124
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.750
the clergy does not continue that Sunday school lesson,

125
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.030
they're afraid of losing money. In other words, they put,

126
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.990
they put money above morality

127
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.710
and they should be held accountable.

128
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.620
<v 0>Well, it seems like there's a lot of per problems. It's not, it's not one thing.</v>

129
00:08:01.621 --> 00:08:03.740
It's not just a clergy and it's not just the schools.

130
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.620
It's certainly the parents. And it's certainly what the parents were taught.

131
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.140
So it's the parents' parents, it's the continuing of the ins. Right.

132
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.940
<v 1>But, but the biggest, they inherited one, one of the most, the most, um,</v>

133
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.620
influential, unless you're atheist, of course the most influential, um,

134
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.650
authority in, in your life is your church. Everybody, you know,

135
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.930
goes to church as a kid. Yeah. Unless you're atheist or whatever. So that, that,

136
00:08:27.931 --> 00:08:29.410
that weighs very heavily. Well, how.

137
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:34.170
<v 0>Do you reach the atheist then? Huh? How do you reach the atheists then? Uh, you.</v>

138
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.330
<v 1>Know, the agnostic a lot,</v>

139
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.330
a lot of atheists and a lot and agnostic have excellent morals.

140
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.920
Lot of them do. Um, they're, you know, they have, uh,

141
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.640
churches called ethical societies and I've spoken and many of them before,

142
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.560
you know, they, they don't believe in God.

143
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:53.200
It was just not something that I advocate, but I'm saying that they,

144
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:56.640
they know right from wrong. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and, and, and you find less,

145
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.960
um, uh, controversy and, and, uh,

146
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:03.960
and racism and more acceptance in these places.

147
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.680
Cause it's about ethics and morality, more so than division.

148
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.920
Why do you have a white Baptist church and a black Baptist church?

149
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.870
What's that all about a Baptist should be Baptist.

150
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.510
It's the same king James Bible, you know? Um,

151
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:22.870
and, and why, you know,

152
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.870
why aren't they aren't they preaching the same lesson in Sunday school that they

153
00:09:26.871 --> 00:09:30.670
preach up upstairs. They're not concerned about telling little,

154
00:09:30.671 --> 00:09:33.150
little four and five year olds. They were all God's children,

155
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.790
God made a rainbow. You know why?

156
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.380
Because the little four and five year olds don't have any money, so they're not,

157
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.300
so they're not getting any money in the collection plate there.

158
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.660
It doesn't matter. It matters where the money is. You, you,

159
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.420
you say what you gotta say to get the amount of money that you need. That's.

160
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:52.460
<v 0>You know, I don't go to church. So that's, uh, an alien concept to me,</v>

161
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.130
but it's sad if that's the lesson,

162
00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:01.130
if that's the way they're structuring their lessons in a church or a synagogue

163
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:03.210
or a temple, that that's how they're doing it,

164
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.170
they're structuring their structuring, their lessons to achieve more donations.

165
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.570
<v 1>Look at these megachurches. Yeah.</v>

166
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.570
<v 0>Well look at 'em mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; look.</v>

167
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.970
<v 1>And how many times do do some of these priests and preachers get in true.</v>

168
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.010
<v 0>They,</v>

169
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.440
those megachurches always seem to me to be run by cult leaders that are keeping

170
00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:23.800
it together. They're just keeping it together,

171
00:10:23.801 --> 00:10:25.920
staying within the structure of traditional Christianity.

172
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.040
<v 1>People want to believe in something. Yes. So why not believe in the clan?</v>

173
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.640
Why not believe in right.

174
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.400
<v 0>You know, and whatever. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's tribal it,</v>

175
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.750
we have this, uh, intense desire to stay tribal,

176
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.550
but we've gotta consider ourselves a tribe of the human race. Exactly.

177
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.350
<v 1>The human race that.</v>

178
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:50.870
<v 0>That can be taught to people. It can. Yeah. I, I think what you're done,</v>

179
00:10:50.871 --> 00:10:55.830
what you're proving and what you're doing by your amazing accomplishments is

180
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:59.060
showing that that even in the most radicalized of people,

181
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.980
the KKK and the national socialist movement, you are converting people.
