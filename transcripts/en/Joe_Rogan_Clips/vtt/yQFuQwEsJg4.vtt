00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.800
<v 3>Luckily, I'm staying with my friends out here and they super healthy.</v>

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.200
So that's felt good. But right after this, I'm going on a mentor.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.320
<v 1>Yeah. Who do you.</v>

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 0>Know out here? My friend, Julia and Jake. They're super sweet.</v>

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.120
I it's funny because I met Julia through my Paton. She was like,

7
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.960
you know, followed me on Paton.

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.750
<v 1>And I didn't know you had a Patreon. Yeah, I have a, I have a.</v>

9
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.550
<v 0>Do you? No, Peton the closest I'll get &lt;laugh&gt; Paton is the closest. I'll.</v>

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.230
<v 1>Get how many gals have turned to only fans during the pandemic. So many.</v>

11
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.830
<v 0>Quite a few have show the I've thought about it a couple times. I was like,</v>

12
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.230
do I? How do I saw, how does.

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.910
<v 1>That work though? Because like someone can always, they save those pictures.</v>

14
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.140
<v 0>I know. That's why would never do it? Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.020
If it was like top secret and you know, just between I say, yeah, here you go.

16
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:47.854
Don't tell anyone.

17
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.740
<v 1>Yeah. It's a weird thing. Right? Cause, and.</v>

18
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.620
<v 0>Also I'm, I'm too sensitive if I like posted, oh, I have an only fans now.</v>

19
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.740
And like two people joined. One of 'em being my mom, cuz she's supportive.

20
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.940
I'd be like this hurts.

21
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.490
<v 1>I know this lady that started only fans. I think,</v>

22
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.090
I don't know if she was doing it for money or just desperate or just wanted,

23
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.450
just wanted to do it. I don't know. But uh, she got all this hate.

24
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.570
It was really interesting to see. And uh, even from her own family,

25
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.570
like people furious at her for showing her. That's crazy.

26
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.440
<v 0>Yeah. If you have good TIS and you don't mind showing 'em yeah.</v>

27
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.760
<v 1>It's a weird thing. Like why, why is everybody mad?</v>

28
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.360
It's one thing it's if like your, if your wife starts showing her, you're like,

29
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.140
Hey.

30
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.880
<v 0>That's mine. Yeah. Hey, have.</v>

31
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.713
<v 1>A ring saying.</v>

32
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.760
<v 0>Hey that that's our, our that's our. Cut it.</v>

33
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.440
<v 1>Out. Yeah. But if you're it's your sister or something like that,</v>

34
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.470
like I don't think you're allowed to say anything. Can't get mad at her.

35
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.710
You know? Like I don't understand the getting mad part. What are you mad at?

36
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.310
Yeah.

37
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.790
<v 0>I don't, I think it's a great way for people to make money if they can.</v>

38
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.190
It's saturated. So it's hard. You have to really like hustle.

39
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.710
Like that becomes your business.

40
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.590
<v 1>This girl who works for Brendan chop makes like a hundred thousand dollars a</v>

41
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:04.780
month showing her feet. Yeah.

42
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.540
<v 0>I, I.</v>

43
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.500
<v 1>Need a, really's got a foot porn thing.</v>

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.980
<v 1>No more also Jamie chimes in there's weird. Huh?</v>

46
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.540
<v 2>I was waiting for an end. Jamie you a few. There's no more like, uh, Hey,</v>

<v 1>Playboy anymore. It's.</v>

49
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.660
<v 2>There's not even an option for it. So maybe like.</v>

50
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.381
<v 0>There's Playboy,</v>

51
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:27.730
but they're like mostly doing articles and like nice photo shoots.

52
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.530
There's not really much that used to be a.

53
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.450
<v 2>Big thing. They'd like make a big, huge offer, you know? And then like someone.</v>

54
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.010
<v 1>Right? Like a famous person would show their TIS. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:40.890
I remember that. Like didn't deme more do it. And yeah.

Bunch of like Kim Kardashian. Yeah. Like actress is and famous people.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.553
Ooh. It was a big deal.

<v 1>Younger, she was married to block Brock love. There's.</v>

61
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.120
<v 2>Huge. Like there's a huge deal. Huge. But that was like, you know,</v>

62
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.480
that couldn't be a thing. Now. She just do only fans that make really.

63
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.320
<v 1>Quick. Well, that's the thing is these gals are make like that bad Barbie girl,</v>

64
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.000
bad baby. Whatever it is. Oh, how do you say it? Baha, baby. Is it baby?

65
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:15.480
It's not bad. Barbie. Nope. Bad baby.

66
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.920
<v 0>She spells it with an H.</v>

67
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.390
<v 1>After the, the cash me outside girl. How about that? How about that?</v>

68
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.750
That girl made a million dollars in.

69
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.470
<v 2>Six hours. She claims that's right. I've heard,</v>

70
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.630
she claims she's call her a liar.

71
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.630
<v 1>It sounds like some.</v>

72
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.430
<v 2>People are very cynical about it. Like she's claiming she made that,</v>

73
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.350
but like a lot of other girls who are on there will show their,

74
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.910
their receipts receipt. Yeah. Like here it says on the top 0.0, zero, 1% on.

75
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:37.310
That's.

76
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.580
<v 1>Weird too. Showing your receipts. Like I would feel like if you did that,</v>

77
00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:42.940
people would stop giving you money. I know you have.

78
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.500
<v 0>To be like, I'm not making too much. It's a small, it's a small group.</v>

79
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.853
<v 1>It down. I,</v>

80
00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.780
or maybe they want to contribute to it because it's exciting because your girl

81
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.300
is number one. Right? Like maybe there's a lot of time. It's like.

82
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.300
<v 0>Rooting for a team in the NFL. You're.</v>
