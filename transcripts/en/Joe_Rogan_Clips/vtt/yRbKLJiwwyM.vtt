00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.340
<v 1>Experience. So that's the tricky part. I mean, that's why,</v>

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.430
that's why I like economists because economists are ruthless

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.360
bloodless. They almost don't know what humans are,

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.780
but they're very good at measuring costs and benefits.

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:20.280
And that's what I feel that our kind of political social media

7
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.450
discourse is missing.

8
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.580
People are all for the most part advocates or activists,

9
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:31.260
they pick up Blaine and they stay in it and they want to pave over the rest of

10
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:35.250
everybody's lanes and make it theirs. And it's not a good way to be.

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.460
<v 0>No, it's not. You know,</v>

12
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.020
that's an another episode that I was listening to of yours recently,

13
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.160
about how hard it is to get people, to change their mind on things. And, uh,

14
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.050
I forget who the expert was, who was talking,

15
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:48.900
but it was a really interesting point that he had about the mind.

16
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.720
Like people say, change your mind. You don't really have a mind.

17
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:53.070
You have the mind of the community.

18
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.040
And if you step outside the beliefs of the community,

19
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.610
it can be very bad for you in terms of like your personal connections with

20
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.120
people. And I really enjoyed that episode. It's funny.

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.270
<v 1>Thanks. It's a, it's a paradox though, because the way you just said it,</v>

22
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:08.340
like if you are in your tribe,

23
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.380
then even though it can be healthier for you and for

24
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.720
presumably many other people for you to change your mind,

25
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:18.060
or at least think differently about things, right? You,

26
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.240
you risk losing credibility or whatever. Yeah.

27
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.870
<v 0>I mean some religions. I mean, that's how they keep you. Right?</v>

28
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.200
You get ostracized. There's there's religions that we know for you.

29
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:32.460
If you decide to leave, you don't just get ostracized. You're you literally,

30
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.450
you have a death sentence. Like now you've, you've escaped our group.

31
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.490
You are you're, you're an outsider now.

32
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.503
<v 1>Father,</v>

33
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.190
who can both my parents converted from Judaism to Catholicism before they met

34
00:01:44.191 --> 00:01:48.780
each other. Whoa. Yeah, it was, it was very unusual to happen. Uh,

35
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:51.180
it's a long story. I'll tell you if you really want to know, but anyway, I'll,

36
00:01:51.181 --> 00:01:55.290
I'll, I'll do the short, what I'm getting to, and this was during the,

37
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.640
during the second world war, there were both in New York, both first-generation,

38
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.070
uh, American Jews. That makes sense.

39
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:04.290
They converted for different reasons from each other.

40
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.670
And then they met my father's family was Orthodox. Um,

41
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.580
and his father got named [inaudible], uh,

42
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.580
 who'd come here when he was in his, maybe late twenties from Poland. He still lived 

43
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.580
as everyday

44
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.413
 in Brooklyn as if he were still in Poland. He didn't change at all. When my father converted and his father found out my father was in the war, he was overseas. He was home on leave and his father was cleaning up.

45
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.470
And from my father's pants that he left over a chair,

46
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.870
a rosary beads slipped out and fell on the floor.

47
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.070
That's how his Jewish father chefs will Dube.

48
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.550
Dubliner found out that his son had become a Catholic.

49
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.380
So what he did is he proceeded to, uh,

50
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.870
sit Shivah forum, the Jewish morning ritual,

51
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:52.030
where for seven days you mourn the dead. He,

52
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:55.260
he declared that he would never again speak to his son.

53
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.890
And he forbade everyone in his family from speaking his son.

54
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.780
So I, by the time I was born,

55
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.110
I was the youngest of eight kids in this family because they'd become very

56
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:05.944
Catholic.

57
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.020
I didn't know this whole family of my father's was unknown to me

58
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.490
entirely. So they did exactly what you're saying now. Holy.

59
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.120
Yeah. Yeah. That was what I thought too, when I hold it.

60
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.620
And my mothers did the same thing,

61
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.430
but it was less dramatic because her family was less religious.

62
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.260
So they still didn't like at all that she had converted. Um, but uh,

63
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.010
you got any children? Uh, yeah, I got a couple of Jewish again though.

64
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.450
I it's alongside my first,

65
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.140
the first book I wrote with long before Freakonomics was called turbulent souls.

66
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.930
Although it got then republished under a different title called choosing my

67
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:48.610
religion and it tells us this story of my, uh, my two parents around me. Yeah.

68
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.871
<v 0>So I'd love to hear that,</v>

69
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:53.470
but I just want to put in your head that what I was going to ask you is like,

70
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.970
how could you imagine a scenario where you would be capable of doing that

71
00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.283
to your children?

72
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.460
<v 1>So, uh, no chance, no chance, no chance,</v>

73
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.230
but here's how scary. Yeah, it's scary. It is. But on the other hand,

74
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.900
I mean, this is, um, what Freakonomics is,

75
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.790
what I try to learn through doing Freakonomics is, you know,

76
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.890
to measure the what, and try to figure out the why,

77
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.360
but then not be the judge who says that was terrible.

78
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.290
This is wonderful because you know, different people have, look,

79
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.660
if chefs will do better, we're here. We can ask them,

80
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.640
what's your side of the story.

81
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:37.090
He could tell us a story that might convince us that, you know what,

82
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.620
this son of his did a terrible thing to the family. He did a terrible thing.

83
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.420
You know, he would say,

84
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.590
how could it be that we Jews existed for generations and generations and

85
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:51.850
generations. When every, we relived, there was always someone trying to,

86
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.020
you know, get rid of us. And then we finally come to America, you know,

87
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.570
the land of freedom, religious freedom, economic freedom,

88
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.400
and here after generations and generations of forefathers fought to stay Jewish

89
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.990
here, my son decides to become Catholic. What are you thinking? So, you know,

90
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.850
everybody, everybody's got a perspective,

91
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.330
everybody's got an emotional experience. So I try to respect that. But no,

92
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.860
I would not do that to my children.

93
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.620
<v 0>I understand the outrage. I understand being upset,</v>

94
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.710
but I can't understand choosing that over your son and over the relationship you

95
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:24.544
have with your son. Yeah.

96
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.970
<v 1>That's ridiculous. The,</v>

97
00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:30.010
the saddest end of the stories then when that grandfather and my grandfather who

98
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.670
I never met, this was a long time ago. Uh, my father's father,

99
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.110
my father died when I was very young. So I didn't know this story either.

100
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:38.460
That was why I wrote this first book was to fight it, try to figure out this,

101
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.730
all of the stuff I'm telling you. Now,

102
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.520
none of this I knew until I was in my late twenties when I was writing this

103
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:43.210
book.

104
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.130
But when Shefsel Dubliner was dying of cancer in the maybe late fifties

105
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:53.110
or so, um, uh, a nephew of his, uh,

106
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.230
who my father used to be very close with and who looked a lot like my dad and

107
00:05:57.231 --> 00:06:00.680
this guy was maybe in his early twenties, late teens by now,

108
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.340
he walked into the hospital room and Shep soul, you know,

109
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:08.960
on his deathbed really thought that that was my

110
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.170
father, his son, my, my, my dad's name was Solomon.

111
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:14.150
He called him [inaudible] and he was,

112
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.710
he was calling out to him [inaudible] as if he was, you know, um,

113
00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.120
happy, happy to see him. It wasn't him though.

114
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.710
And my father didn't go visit his own father dying in the hospital because

115
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.360
he'd been forbidden to go anywhere near. Uh, yeah. So it was terrible.

116
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.530
So look,

117
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.270
this is why religion I've been long fascinated by

118
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:41.450
religion. And I think that again, if you think about it,

119
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.040
the way that economists think about things,

120
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.400
there are costs and there are benefits. And.

121
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:48.620
<v 0>I think you're a hundred percent, right?</v>

122
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.520
And then I think that's hard for people to handle. And, you know,

123
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:57.260
people are hardcore atheists where they don't see any value in it

124
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.750
whatsoever, even though people are there,

125
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.740
they're getting some sort of ethical value, moral value.

126
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:05.480
And the way I always put it as like,

127
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:08.210
it's like a scaffolding to live your life by,

128
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.550
you can live within these confines.

129
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:14.840
And it really kind of makes sense if you follow it loosely that we're doing to

130
00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:19.220
try it for the benefit of community. And it's also like a real community, um,

131
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.970
sense that comes from meeting and Sunday with all those other or whatever day it

132
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:24.410
is with your, your religion.

133
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.860
And you meet in a group of other people that are also in the community.

134
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:32.690
And you all basically are saying together that

135
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.580
we should do good things and be good to people and treat each other the way

136
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:41.120
God would want us to like all that has undeniable benefits.

137
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:44.690
And it says differently is like, you're diluting yourself. Like your points,

138
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.940
the atheists who are hardcore,

139
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.150
who make points about the preposterous nature of a lot of religious texts,

140
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.103
there are on the money,

141
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:55.340
but it doesn't mean it doesn't mean that it doesn't give people a benefit and

142
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.081
that I,

143
00:07:56.081 --> 00:08:00.050
I couldn't even disagree with them continuing it because there's a lot of people

144
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:01.490
that benefit greatly from really.

145
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.140
<v 1>Someone wrote to us after that, uh, loneliness episode came out, um,</v>

146
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.300
and said, how did you fail to write about,

147
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.430
uh, this supposed epidemic of loneliness without addressing the huge

148
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:18.290
decline in organized religion in America?

149
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.870
Which I thought was a very good piece of criticism. That would have been a good,

150
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.300
because you're right. It's a community. Yeah.

151
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.830
One other thing I would add to the list that you provided of what it can give is

152
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:29.720
humility, right? Because, you know,

153
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.770
if you have an image of some superior being, God deity,

154
00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:38.090
whatever you want to call it, you kind of understand that one mortal is,

155
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:41.420
you know, the world does not revolve around me. The other thing I would say,

156
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:42.440
and look, I,

157
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.840
it's hard for me to scientifically logically embrace a lot of the arguments that

158
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:50.850
a lot of religions make, especially about things like the afterlife, right?

159
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.930
Yeah. That said even to an atheist,

160
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.980
I would suggest way to think about it is if someone does believe in those

161
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:02.550
rewards are in economic terms, we're talking about them as incentives,

162
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.920
even if it's a placebo effect. In other words, if I, if I'm encouraged to do,

163
