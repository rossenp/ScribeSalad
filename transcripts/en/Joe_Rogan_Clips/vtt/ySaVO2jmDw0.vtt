00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What do you think is going to happen?</v>

2
00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>I agree with you when you said earlier that, Hey, you can't believe the polls,</v>

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.290
right? So I don't believe the polls. I think people are tired of the,

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.120
who are exhausted from just sort of the general drama of having somebody like

5
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:18.110
Trump in the office.

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.090
So I think there's a potential for a lot of people who may like the policies

7
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.550
or some of the policies and prefer them to a hard left agenda or a left agenda.

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.020
I think there's a chance for them to say, I'll it. I just I'm too tired.

9
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.190
And I don't want that. And maybe they'll look at ed Biden and think, eh,

10
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.200
it's a return there. Some normalcy will there'll be debates. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

11
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.960
yeah, yeah. I'll bet there ends up being one.

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.160
<v 2>Well, yeah, there's a debate. That's where it all falls apart.</v>

13
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.310
That's where the wheels come off. Get ready,

14
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.890
get ready to Trump campaign manager.

15
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:57.440
We want more debates against Biden and sooner.

16
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.140
<v 3>The first one, September 29th, maybe.</v>

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.370
<v 2>They're probably pumping Biden up with steroids and alpha brain right now.</v>

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.970
Could you imagine a lab somewhere? They've got a VAT from on it.

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.010
It goes right to the Ivy.

20
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.390
<v 3>I think I heard there's something like 16 states would already technically be</v>

21
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.120
done. Yeah. Done by voting by September 29th.

22
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.190
They want to try to have some before that,

23
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.680
but I think they're only supposed to have three or something.

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.340
<v 1>That's great. Say that one more time. 16 states could be finished and voting.</v>

25
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.310
<v 3>By that time. 16 states have already have voted.</v>

26
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.610
<v 2>Because they're doing it with a mail-in ballot. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:36.140
This is going to be so strange. This is going to be such a contested election,

28
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:36.651
no matter what.

29
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.740
And I'm really worried about the chaos that could ensue after it's over.

30
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.930
<v 1>Well, think about that. And that's, that's, uh, I mean, look,</v>

31
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.710
I'm a big fan of going to the voting booth, you know, actually getting out,

32
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.060
driving or walking, going to pull on the lever. So I.

33
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.050
<v 2>Have to do it outside. Yeah. Should be social justice. And obviously.</v>

34
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.570
<v 1>You know, weather permitting, but you know, fine. You, you know,</v>

35
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.520
I think the problem is.

36
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.063
<v 0>Look.</v>

37
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.720
<v 1>Until Trump talked about, you know, the, the problems with the post office, um,</v>

38
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.770
and you know, uh,

39
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.980
mail delivery and the idea that we're going to have mail in ballots as opposed

40
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:12.500
to absentee ballots, you know, before that,

41
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.360
you know what nine out of 10 people, that's not statistically accurate,

42
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.060
but I'm sure a lot of people would have said to postal system,

43
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.730
they can't deliver the mail. Right. And, but now,

44
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.870
because Trump comes out and says, this.

45
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.880
<v 4>Is going, oh my God, I love the postal system.</v>

46
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.880
And he's trying to destroy the postal system.

47
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.590
And I think it's like what he did with hydroxychloroquine touches.

48
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.520
Right.

49
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.740
<v 1>Look, and I've ordered hydroxychloroquine through the mail.</v>

50
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.070
<v 4>I, it hasn't arrived. Uh, so what am I to think?</v>

51
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.590
But I touch at death. So I.

52
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.770
<v 1>You imagine if we have an election where you do this,</v>

53
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:50.150
and then you don't know the results for five or six or seven days,

54
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:54.920
because they're still counting balanced. Right. And that's yeah.

55
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.840
Can you imagine what that, that reporting is going.

56
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.060
<v 4>To be like and all the paranoia on both the right and the left going up,</v>

57
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.400
you know exactly what the whole thing is.

58
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.510
<v 2>That's crazy. Really. These are really crazy. Oh God.</v>

59
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.380
Right. Wing the really nutty conspiracy folks. How are they going to handle?

60
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.370
Yeah.

61
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.230
<v 1>Well that's yeah, that's it. And you got, you got people on both sides, right?</v>

62
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.000
Crazy's not limited to one part of a spectrum. So you got people on both sides.

63
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:24.840
And if you,

64
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.130
the beauty of the elections in the past have been by the end of the night.

65
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.410
<v 4>You got a winner. Right. And.</v>

66
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.700
<v 1>Now if you don't know, and you can't tell me that, and it's not,</v>

67
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.780
you know, I'm just, I'm just saying the realities are, you gotta be pragmatic.

68
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:40.440
You want to go with.

69
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.770
<v 4>All, you know, mail ballots or whatever. Hey,</v>

70
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.570
just be aware of the fact.

71
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.330
<v 1>That you could have a lot of problems,</v>

72
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.420
a lot of disqualified ballots because of a variety of reasons,

73
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:54.360
a lot of lost ballots, a lot of people. And so if,

74
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.830
if what you want to do is so chaos, right. And,

75
00:03:57.831 --> 00:04:02.100
and descent and furthest divide, then yeah. That's a pretty good way to do it.

76
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.210
Or you can figure out how to get everybody to the ballots. Right.

77
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.100
And to the polling booths and make that happen, just do it.

78
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.640
Right.

79
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.810
And if you want to have ballot poll voting booths where people wear masks and

80
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.710
you know, and hazmat suits, and everything's fine. Right.

81
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.940
But figure out a way to get people to the voting booth because I, I,

82
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.550
and it's not, I don't, you know, it's, I don't think that the mail-in thing is,

83
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:29.760
is, could be wrought with fraud, like the white house, you know, like Trump is,

84
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:31.860
you know, it could be lots of fraud. I,

85
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.080
I think it's just pragmatic says you could have a lot of logistical

86
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:37.650
problems.

87
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.730
<v 2>Yeah. So, well, I don't understand why they can't vote online.</v>

88
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.110
Why can you bank online? But you can't vote online. How's that not?

89
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.750
And the thing is, if you could vote online,

90
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:52.380
if people didn't have to physically go to a place you want many more people

91
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:55.650
would vote, probably be insane because what is the number now?

92
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:57.630
Like what percentage of people now vote? Is it like 40?

93
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.610
<v 1>Yeah. Somewhere in the 40 percentile. I barely get that up to 70. Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.810
I bet.

95
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.190
<v 2>Pretty high. If you could register on your phone and vote on your phone, my God,</v>

96
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.600
why can't you do that?

97
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.010
<v 1>Oh, there's uh, there are security issues related to that. And as we all know,</v>

98
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.950
in terms of the hijacking of the, uh, or the security of the,

99
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:18.600
of the system that would be play.

100
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.040
<v 2>People, click on every link, someone sends them a text message. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.910
<v 0>Sure. Let's let's click area that, ah.</v>

102
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.700
<v 1>Uh, no, I, I, I agree with you in the sense that it would,</v>

103
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.120
theoretically it would, it would improve the turnout for sure.

104
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:36.650
And it would certainly make life easier for a lot of people. I just don't I,

105
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.690
as with, and again, my issue with the mail isn't,

106
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.190
isn't the fraud issue so much as just the logistics of it. Right. And that,

107
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.770
and that, that, that delay,

108
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.110
and also the potential to have a lot of ballots just being disqualified or

109
00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:56.220
being put in question, uh, the same thing with online voting, I'm worried.

110
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.150
<v 2>About the chaos. I'm worried about the civil unrest. Real.</v>

111
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.360
I really think that that could be the, the big one.

112
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.870
<v 1>I think we should. You know, what if I think if Congress did,</v>

113
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.150
it would do its job, they would just say, you know what?

114
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.730
The elections are common. They're going to be right on time.

115
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.940
And you're going to go to your voting polling places.

116
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.020
And we're going to put in place, uh, special times for elderly citizens to vote.

117
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:20.350
If they want to have a super safe environment, they can only vote like this.

118
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:21.790
Just like you do it. Costco,

119
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:26.650
Costco in our area had like seven to 9:00 AM was only for people over

120
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:29.410
60. All right, fine. If Costco.

121
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.780
<v 4>Could do that, I'm pretty sure.</v>

122
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.250
<v 1>We could do that with, with voting booths, how hard would just make it happen.</v>

123
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.290
But, but again, it's, it's temperature.

124
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.490
<v 2>Checks, socially distance, everybody, everybody wears a mask, do it, right.</v>

125
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.980
Give it plenty of time, set up enough booths.

126
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.590
<v 1>And if you want to do it over a two day period, fine.</v>

127
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.200
But at least you're at least you're establishing protocols that are, are, are,

128
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.450
are. Yeah. I dunno. How about.

129
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:56.590
<v 2>I worry about the chaos.</v>

130
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.370
If you're going to let people vote by mail in September,

131
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.880
how about let them show up at the polls that early as well.

132
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.220
So you really could socially distance, everybody.

133
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:09.340
You really could absolutely ensure that everybody's safe.

134
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.180
<v 1>Yeah. Just spread it out, spread it over a designated period of time.</v>

135
00:07:13.181 --> 00:07:14.560
We have five business days.

136
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.220
<v 2>Open scoring like a boxing match. It would be tremendous.</v>

137
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.780
<v 4>As you roll up on the voting booth, you got the numbers right up there.</v>

138
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.810
So it's like a Jerry Lewis telethon here and fix this. Yeah.
