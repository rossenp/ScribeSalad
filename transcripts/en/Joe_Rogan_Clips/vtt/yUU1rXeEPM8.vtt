00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.360
Was that one of the reasons why it was treated with so much skepticism.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.390
<v 1>Uh, because, uh, w w I mean,</v>

4
00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:15.860
no one doubts the existence of the skeleton, uh, at least, you know, no, no one.

5
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.640
<v 0>Since I'm sorry, there's so many things that are so specific,</v>

6
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:27.320
like the, the carbon dating of the upper and lower layers,

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.420
the fact that you have so many bones,

8
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:34.280
the fact that they're not repeating the fact that it's a clearly some sort of a

9
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:38.330
primate, and that you've put all this stuff together and reconstruct the skull.

10
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:40.490
And I mean, what is the controversy.

11
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.650
<v 1>Uh, the controversy, uh, well, there's a couple of things. I mean,</v>

12
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.290
you could talk for a long time about this, but, uh,

13
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.260
I guess one point of controversy is,

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.360
is it indeed a member of the human family? And, uh,

15
00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.980
you know, as I said before, you get further back in time,

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.990
and the things that tell you,

17
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:06.530
it's a member of the human family become more subtle, like these canine teeth,

18
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.900
for example, uh, uh, the bipedality is, is another one, but, you know,

19
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.830
there's, you know, a great deal of skepticism in the field about, you know,

20
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.740
there there's people who, who, uh, who I talked to who tell you,

21
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.440
who doubt that any of these early species that have been

22
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.430
identified as hominins or early members of the human family,

23
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.580
they doubt that any of them really are, or, or that's just unknowable.

24
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.980
So this kind of like this, this, um, I don't know, almost in some people this,

25
00:01:36.981 --> 00:01:39.620
this, uh, uh,

26
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.580
almost like neolistic view that you can really ever know that that's that's one.

27
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.130
Uh, um, but I, but I do think that is the, the, the,

28
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.230
uh, validation of already as a member of the human

29
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:57.800
family, the human lineage is, um, I,

30
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.970
I think there is a growing number of people who are, who are accepting it. Uh,

31
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.710
and there's some people with a lot of outside people who have basically

32
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.570
endorsed what the research team at S you know,

33
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.630
had said, you know, whether it's a direct ancestor or like, you know,

34
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.720
one of your extinct and uncle, you know,

35
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.230
maybe it's not your grandfather, but maybe it's like your aunt I'll go,

36
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:26.210
you know, that's, we, we may never know that, but, um, uh, so anyway,

37
00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:30.530
that's one point of controversy, is it, is it in R D the human lineage? Uh,

38
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:33.080
another one is, um,

39
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.120
the arguments that the discovery team has made about what it reveals about the

40
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:42.470
last common ancestor of humans and apes. And, uh, you know,

41
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:45.380
like for example, we were talking before about,

42
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.950
about this model of a Chimp, like common ancestor of humans and,

43
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.390
and, uh, African apes. And, uh, you know, the,

44
00:02:56.391 --> 00:03:01.390
the RD team would spent 15 years studying this thing before they announced

45
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.110
it to the world. They, uh,

46
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.810
believe and strenuously argued that this skeleton shows you

47
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:14.890
that the common ancestor of humans in the African apes was in fact,

48
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:17.380
not like a Chimp, not nowhere near as Chimp,

49
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:22.120
like as everyone thought, because there's no vestige of knuckle walking.

50
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:26.470
I mean, there's a whole bunch of things that gets into sort of, I guess,

51
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:30.460
some anatomical, very esoteric, anatomical stuff. So if you,

52
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.190
if you're reading the book, if you're interested,

53
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.820
cause it gets into two to do all that. But, uh, uh,

54
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.980
so anyway, so that's, that's part of the controversy. Uh, so, um, so there,

55
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.990
there, there is a sort of subset of the critics who have come to

56
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:51.550
accept already as indeed a member of the human family. So they say, yeah,

57
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.710
they're, they're right. They placed it correctly in the,

58
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.450
in the human family tree, but they are not yet convinced that it,

59
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.430
it, that it, it, it falsifies this idea of a Chimp like ancestor, you know,

60
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:07.180
their argument would be well sure. In ways that are already,

61
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:11.440
may have still descended from this Chimp like ancestor, but, you know, it,

62
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.120
uh,

63
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.410
evolve these new adaptations that sort of erase those from

64
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.540
its anatomy. So that that's one element of controversy. Uh, I mean, there's,

65
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.520
there's, uh, you know, the great thing about this skeleton actually, because it,

66
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.370
because it is so complete and because it

67
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.280
was released with this huge package of it as whole,

68
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.450
a whole series of paper about, you know, the hand on the foot, you know, the,

69
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:41.590
the pelvis and the skull, there was, um,

70
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.570
a lot of fodder there for debate and disagreement, and that's,

71
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.520
what's been happening for the last 10 years.

72
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.120
<v 0>Now, when they talk about a Chimp ancestor,</v>

73
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.970
a Chimp like amp ancestor, is this just because chimps are around,

74
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.690
we know genetically that we're at least closely related to champs.

75
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.670
And so it's just presumed.

76
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.990
And is it possible that there was that all the way back,

77
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:11.580
like from the beginning that our ancestors were bipedal?

78
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.430
<v 1>Uh, well, I don't, I don't think many people would say, well, ancestors, uh, of.</v>

79
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.640
<v 0>Human, right? Like when you look at RD,</v>

80
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.500
RD is the oldest known full skeleton that we have of our ancestors.

81
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.510
If we go back, if we somehow,

82
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.180
or another found something that was 12 million years old,

83
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.730
what if that thing was bipedal?

84
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.500
<v 1>Okay. Well, okay.</v>

85
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.400
So one problem is that this split between humans and in and champs,

86
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.400
it's probably not that old. So if you're at 12 million,

87
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:45.090
you're probably somewhere before the huge ships, Jim Smith. I mean,

88
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.390
there's a lot of like squished time in this. So, you know, and actually,

89
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:51.210
I think actually as it happens, I think some of the,

90
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.480
the estimates that are kind of furthest out are in fact 12 million, but,

91
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.741
you know,

92
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.850
somewhere between six and 12 million where they were humans and chimps split,

93
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.000
it's.

94
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.890
<v 0>Kind of, and what are they,</v>

95
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.560
but they do think that once upon a time there was a split between humans and

96
00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:07.420
chimps. So if you go back far enough,

97
00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:10.270
you'll find a Chimp or something like a chap. Well.

98
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.460
<v 1>You'll, you'll find an ancestor of a chip.</v>

99
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.380
And then the big question is it doesn't look like a modern gimp or does it look

100
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:19.300
like something you've never seen before?

101
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.930
Or does it look like something that's sort of a more primitive version of

102
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.680
artifice? I mean, this is, this is the great another one. I mean, this is like,

103
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:31.120
of course another quest, uh, you know, for, for science.

104
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.090
<v 0>[Inaudible] was really a monkey wrench into this whole idea of what we, yeah.</v>

105
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.270
<v 1>Yeah. So that, that was what,</v>

106
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.370
what was one of the things that was quite controversial about it? And, you know,

107
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.260
we haven't talked much about the discovery team that put this together, uh,

108
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.430
but they are, um, uh, you know, they're, they're, they're,

109
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:57.430
they're very good scholars. They're very good at what they do,

110
00:06:57.431 --> 00:07:01.840
but they're also quite provocative and, uh, which, which, you know, for me,

111
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:05.650
of course made them great material, but you know,

112
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.120
they don't present the skeleton and say here, you know,

113
00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:12.220
here's a physical description of the skeleton,

114
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.220
go ahead and make up your own minds. They presented it. And it said,

115
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.610
here is a know skeleton,

116
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.160
and this is why you're wrong and you're wrong and you're wrong.

117
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:23.770
And you're right. So there, it was, it was a provocative, uh,

118
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.370
it was a provocative series of papers with,

119
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.280
with some stunning revelations, but a lot of,

120
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:35.290
some people in the research community did not take kindly to the mode of

121
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:40.150
presentation. Let's, let's say, um, uh, cause you know, at one point,

122
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.360
um, you know, there's this, there's this, there's this huge, uh,

123
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.000
research community that studied chimpanzees, you know,

124
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.380
either at study them in the field,

125
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:51.580
doing observational studies or dyed them in the lab to try to find

126
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.880
clues about the origin of human locomotion or, or anything. I mean,

127
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.440
chimps are kind of became this all purpose model.

128
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.840
And so when the army team came along and told them they're all

129
00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:06.730
kind of barking up the wrong tree, there was,

130
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.040
there was a lot of consternation about that.

131
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.770
<v 0>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

132
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.890
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

133
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:19.060
They're going to be available everywhere,

134
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:22.660
but after December 1st they will only be available on Spotify,

135
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.650
but they will be free. That includes the video. The video will also be there.

136
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.720
It'll also be free. That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much.

137
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:32.830
Buh-bye.
