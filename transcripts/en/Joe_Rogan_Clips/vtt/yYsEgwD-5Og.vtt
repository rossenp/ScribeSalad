00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 2>Chromebooks are actually pretty logical because most,</v>

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.000
mostly what people do is scroll. You can just go online and scroll.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:09.420
I don't leave.

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.280
<v 1>The house. So what do I need a laptop for? Are.</v>

6
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.070
<v 0>You like a completely locked down?</v>

7
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.370
<v 1>No, I just meant, cause I don't like, I love my house.</v>

8
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.340
It wasn't because of Corona. This has been the case for many years.

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.670
<v 0>So you haven't altered your behavior much at all because of Corona.</v>

10
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.690
Cause this is what you've always done.

11
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.340
<v 1>Well, I've altered it in that.</v>

12
00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:29.010
Like I want to travel more but everywhere everyone was closed.

13
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.550
There's no where to.

14
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.920
<v 0>Go. Are you worried about the virus at all?</v>

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.670
<v 1>No. I'm worried about the response to the virus and,</v>

16
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.820
and this has given some very, very bad people,

17
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.470
some very useful information about how much crap people put up with. Yes.

18
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.970
And, and that we're at a point where it's just like, oh yeah, we're, you know,

19
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:49.290
we're just going to open up.

20
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.910
Even though the metrics are worse than we're closed, but now a double masks,

21
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.450
why not?

22
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.070
And there was an onion article from 99 that said drinking dog P lessons,

23
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:01.290
risks of cancer, snickering researchers say,

24
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.370
and I'm telling you if they told people to start drinking dog pee people be on

25
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.860
Twitter, wondering what the best.

26
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.950
<v 0>Breed. If Fowchee said it, he, they would do it.</v>

27
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.080
There would be a large percentage of the population that would be sucking some.

28
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.820
<v 1>And they would be yelling at you that you're not doing it. Yes.</v>

29
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.710
Because how dare you not drink the golden retriever P which is the

30
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:25.740
golden standard of P to keep grandma from dying?

31
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.521
<v 0>Well,</v>

32
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.370
I think that's one of the things that's really fascinating about this pandemic

33
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:32.040
is that it's happening during the time of social media,

34
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.440
where we've never had anything like this before,

35
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.180
where group think is encouraged in the forest and people there

36
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.620
also because of the pandemic. So many people are just online all day. Sure.

37
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.780
Because they're unemployed or they're just,

38
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.050
they're out work from home and they're not really working.

39
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.190
They're just on Twitter all day.

40
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.000
And you're seeing this like these really crazy behavior patterns.

41
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:56.760
It's like people ganging up on people.

42
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.950
<v 1>I don't think they're crazy at all. I think, you know,</v>

43
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.530
I had this tweet was a huge backlash. And I said,

44
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:03.960
if you replace the term coronavirus of Jews,

45
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.530
all of a sudden the behavior of 1930s, Germany makes a lot more sense.

46
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.380
Cause one of the big questions back in the day is how did Hitler pull this off?

47
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.330
How do you convince a population of educated people to behave in just the most

48
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.164
inhuman ways?

49
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.430
And what we're seeing is when low status people are given an excuse to assert

50
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.790
dominance over other people, for whatever reason in illegitimate, in that case,

51
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.140
somewhat legitimate. In this case,

52
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.990
they will champion the bit to tell you to sit down and shut up and obey it.

53
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:33.540
It decentralizes the enforcement mechanism. I was on the subway in New York.

54
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.860
I've been New York, all my life.

55
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.730
I've never seen anything like this where an older man in his fifties was yelling

56
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:41.340
at an Asian dude who wasn't like, it's a rickshaw.

57
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.090
He was just like a regular Asian dude standing over him, screaming.

58
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:48.090
Where's your mass, go back where you came from. And it's like,

59
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:51.210
if you're this concerned about the virus, why are you coming close to him?

60
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.710
You're not care about the virus.

61
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:56.490
This is your excuse to be dominant and aggressive or someone in the most

62
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:57.690
despicable way possible.

63
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.330
<v 0>That's a lot what you see in social media, right?</v>

64
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.840
A lot of the really behavior is an excuse to be.

65
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.320
<v 1>You know, like they found an Inn, right?</v>

66
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:13.150
Exert their behavior being violently anti-racist is the

67
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:14.590
only way lower status.

68
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.620
Whites have an excuse to be dominant and better than somebody else.

69
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.460
This is the one leg up they have. So this becomes their identity.

70
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.060
You don't see it that much from people who are minorities or people who are

71
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:28.360
immigrants. Certainly people who are gay unless they went to college.

72
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.360
But you see it all the time with these lowest status, white,

73
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.150
especially white women, they can't, they're tripping over themselves.

74
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.210
Now they have a chance to yell at someone and feel empowered.

75
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:40.840
It's really reprehensible behavior. And if you want to stop this behavior,

76
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.930
that's not the way to do it. If you want to stop ignorant behavior,

77
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.860
educate people, be friendly with them, say, Hey, you know what?

78
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.070
I come from this background. You probably don't realize what you're saying,

79
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.590
but when you're saying this, this you're talking about my grandma.

80
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.170
And when someone comes at you like that, you're like, oh crap, I'm sorry.

81
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.670
You know, I didn't, I didn't mean a thing. You buy it.

82
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.980
And you've educated that person very quickly. I don't care about that.

83
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.570
It's all about dominance always.

84
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.930
And what do I need to say to get you to do what I want? Yeah.

85
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.060
<v 0>And because of social media,</v>

86
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:11.710
they have this weird little outlet now where a person isn't just talking to

87
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:15.310
someone on the subway. Now they're talking to everyone on somebody's feed.

88
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.310
They're talking to. And a lot of people chime in that.

89
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:20.590
Also want to reinforce this kind of behavior,

90
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.720
a lot of other low status people that are finally getting their voice heard on

91
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.470
something. And it's like, it's irrefutable, like wear a mask.

92
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.840
Like that's one of those irrefutable things. No one's going to argue with.

93
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.480
<v 1>And it's like, if you're wearing a mask, why do you need me to wear a mask?</v>

94
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:37.120
It's like, you don't need a condom and a diaphragm. Right? Um,

95
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.980
when we were kids, it would have been unimaginable for someone to say,

96
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.000
I yelled at my grandparents at Thanksgiving dinner for X, Y, and Z reason.

97
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.150
Everyone would be like, jock, nerd, whatever. Like what do,

98
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.110
what is wrong with you? And now they get applause. Now they'll go on Facebook.

99
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:57.490
I told off my grandma, I told off my so-called racist dad, homophobic mom.

100
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.540
And everyone's a good for you for standing up for yourself. No, you're an. Yeah.

101
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:03.580
<v 0>Did you see that tick?</v>

102
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:06.760
Talk of the white kid talking about how all white people are racist.

103
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.410
It's amazing because it's a perfect example of that.

104
00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.310
It's a logical what he's saying like that, he's saying that he's racist, right?

105
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.800
Just by virtue of being white. And it's,

106
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:21.160
it's so bizarre to watch because he's a caricature.

107
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.520
He literally is like a parody. He's he's,

108
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.990
he's like one of those YouTube comedian parodies of the social justice warriors.

109
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.780
<v 1>It hearkened. I made the point that, uh,</v>

110
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.930
corporate America has done a much better job of importing Maoist,

111
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.590
communism than the Chinese party ever did. But this was what Mao invented.

112
00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:39.520
North Korea still has it.

113
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:43.000
They had the struggle sessions where you get up with other colleagues and you

114
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:46.060
have to denounce yourself and say what you did, that was horrible.

115
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:49.540
Then they all be rate you. And then you point out, oh, I saw Joe doing this,

116
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:53.860
Joe. I saw Mike doing this and this was their kind of community because it keeps

117
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:57.010
everyone watching each other all the time. And it keeps everyone's so-called.

118
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.920
And by honest, they mean subservient to the regime. And there was a, um,

119
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.230
phone call conference call from Northwestern university.

120
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.560
I believe when all of the law students had to get on the call and say,

121
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.190
I'm white and I'm racist. Oh yes.

122
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.570
This happens increasingly where you are ordered to say,

123
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.330
you're at the very least racially insensitive. And it's like,

124
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:21.620
let me tell you something as an immigrant like this crap does not, uh,

125
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.680
sit well with me. It's just totally foreign to my thinking.

126
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.540
And it's such this acid, this Relic of American puritanism, you know,

127
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:32.450
this kind of like, we're all such sinners and we have to denounce ourselves.

128
00:06:32.451 --> 00:06:35.090
It's this weird mix of Woodrow Wilson and chairman Mao.

129
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.810
<v 0>Wow. That's an interesting way of putting it, but I think you're onto something.</v>
