00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 3>Let me ask you a real question. Cause I haven't, I haven't asked you.</v>

3
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:09.390
I saw that Jake Paul kid chirping at your boy D C yes. What's.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.150
<v 2>The deal. Well, he wants to make some money. No know he's a good.</v>

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.050
<v 1>Good show, mellow. But what did DC say to him? DC said.</v>

6
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.420
<v 2>Take my name out of your mouth. I'm not a kid. I'll you up. And he was like</v>

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.900
former UFC heavyweight champion of the world. That's not what you want,

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.710
but shout out.

9
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
<v 1>I will say this kid knows how to everybody off. He's so good at it.</v>

10
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.330
<v 2>Let me tell you something, dude. We were in Florida in Jacksonville,</v>

11
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:40.530
sold out arena and they were all chanting. Jake, Paul,

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.370
Jake. Paul. He's filming it. He loves get his phone out.

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.730
<v 1>Cause you know what? You know what? He's hearing money. Jake Paul.</v>

14
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.520
<v 2>Jake, Paul. No, he's hearing should Shane. Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.360
the whole time he's making so much money, dude. Now be genuine.

16
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.470
1.5 million pay-per-view buys when he knocked out Ben Askren.

17
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.410
I don't know if that's true. Dana white says it's nonsense,

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.620
but maybe he doesn't. I mean, who has the receipts?

19
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.410
If he's telling the truth and you know, if he's lying,

20
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:10.770
why didn't he say 2 million? Why didn't he say 3 million? Why is 1.5? I mean,

21
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:12.780
maybe he's telling the truth. If he's telling the truth,

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.790
they made a considerable amount of money and that's bigger by more than

23
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:22.290
double. The very legitimate three fight three title fight.

24
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:26.820
UFC card of this past weekend is that apparently got 700,000 buys.

25
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.950
Granted these are 700,000 ESPN plus

26
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:36.930
verified, absolute buys. There's no, right? You know,

27
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.660
this whole Triller fight club thing. It's like, you know,

28
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:43.200
you got like rap music and a bunch of other. And you got this trailer company,

29
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:47.520
which a friend of mine who works in finance explained to me what Triller was.

30
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
They Triller verify this. See if this is true.

31
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.680
They were originally poised. Did they? They put together a company.

32
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.543
I don't know if this is true.

33
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.640
This is just what my friend told me that they put in.

34
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.600
My friends were very smart.

35
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.260
They put together this company because Tik talk was about to be banned from the

36
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:09.120
United States. And when tick-tock was about to be banned and uh, Josh Rogan,

37
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:12.570
the journalist explained to us that cluster that they,

38
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.190
they almost had a band,

39
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.620
but then they tried to capitalize on it and make money and sell it to Oracle's

40
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.860
is crazy. But anyway, when Triller Triller was set to take over, like,

41
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.860
Hey, we're the new Tik TOK. So they got a bunch of money together.

42
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.510
And then the justice department or whoever decided not to ban Tik TOK,

43
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:33.600
the thing fell apart, Tik TOK still here. So then they said,

44
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.130
we're going to put on fights. Uh, I don't know if that's true, close.

45
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.380
<v 0>Very quick. It was already an app going around.</v>

46
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.340
That was like a very small competitor to tick-tock based on let's just say like

47
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:48.960
hip hop music only. And then they expanded into video other stuff.

48
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.711
And then that happened.

49
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.500
They like were used because they were the only us competitor.

50
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.210
<v 2>So then they negotiated a deal with Mike Tyson to fight Roy Jones Jr.</v>

51
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.040
Right. And that was his gigantic,

52
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.930
huge fight that got over a million buys a believe. Right.

53
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.570
And I believe that, I mean,

54
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.220
everybody wanted to see what the was happening there.

55
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.790
And then Mike Tyson recently said he wants nothing to do with them.

56
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.940
He's not doing anything with them anymore. Something happened.

57
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.940
<v 1>No wonder the money wasn't there. Something happened with the money.</v>

58
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.670
<v 2>I've no idea. Maybe he got a better offer somewhere else.</v>

59
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.260
Maybe they didn't do them. Do them.
