00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.640
<v 3>We remember when Dennis Miller would say a bunch of crazy that like</v>

3
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.560
no one could know &lt;laugh&gt; people would laugh.

4
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.240
It would be like the most obscure references about like the 14 hundreds tone.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.800
He had a tone, though. It was a funny reference.

6
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:19.120
If you had to know what he was saying, or you were a loser. Yeah.

7
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.000
Talk about AFE.

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.910
<v 1>Babe. You're like, that sounds pretty.</v>

9
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.830
<v 0>Good. I was on a plane with nor McDonald once just randomly.</v>

10
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:26.550
And he sat next to me. He goes, you know, he, uh,

11
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.430
he doesn't even know any of that stuff. &lt;laugh&gt; he's like, yeah,

12
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.310
he just finds out and writes it down. And he just says it. It's not like he.

13
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.830
<v 1>Knows it. Norm on the, on the Dennis Miller wall show is unreal. Yeah. He.</v>

14
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.790
<v 2>Great clips came on, Dennis Miller, my hero.</v>

15
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.840
<v 0>ISN,</v>

16
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.180
the most norm thing ever to not tell everybody that you were dying of cancer.

17
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.533
<v 2>G what? A G.</v>

18
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.580
<v 0>A a total norm move too, right? Yeah. What.</v>

19
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.020
<v 2>Does he got sympathy from everybody?</v>

20
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.540
<v 1>Off. He got canceled. He could put that card on the table. Cancer. And he.</v>

21
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.730
<v 0>And he didn't even tell his best friends. He said he was going to him.</v>

22
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.010
Take care of his mom. Didn't tell.

23
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.330
<v 2>Me either. He told Adam me, he's got a big race coming for him.</v>

24
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.690
Didn didn't tell Adam how dare tell Adam.

25
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.250
<v 0>That's that's the last joke. &lt;laugh&gt;</v>

26
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.730
He's genius comic though. Genius. He was so, uh, unique comic in his,

27
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.040
the way he expressed himself, how he was really thinking like the way he would,

28
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:25.640
like, he would say something up to you in the green room.

29
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.360
He would say the exact same thing on stage. It was just like,

30
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.920
and he would say he had this way of looking at things that was absolutely

31
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.840
unique to him. Yeah. He.

32
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.800
<v 1>Bombed a good bit too. He did. He leap into.</v>

33
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.560
<v 0>It. Took chances must have so fun to watch.</v>

34
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.950
<v 2>Caroline's wants and throwing down one. Like, God, it was like, he didn't care.</v>

35
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:46.590
I saw lunch.

36
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.990
<v 1>Too. Didn't care. He got heckled.</v>

37
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:51.510
He was drinking a Coca-Cola and he got heckled. And he was like, ah,

38
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.990
I don't want to do this. &lt;laugh&gt; I was gonna go back to my act and that was.

39
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.950
<v 0>It completely.</v>

40
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.950
<v 2>Randomly, like, don't feel like it right now. I could don't.</v>

41
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.030
<v 0>Want to completely randomly two times in my life. I sat next to him on a plane.</v>

42
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.063
Just totally random.

43
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.630
<v 2>Weird V Cooper.</v>

44
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.580
<v 0>Random airport. Yep. Once in Vancouver and once somewhere else.</v>

45
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.220
And the last one he was talking like, yeah, quit smoking.

46
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.660
And he was telling me how he quit smoking. Yeah. It was hard.

47
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:14.580
It was really hard to quit. And I did it and you know, smoke.

48
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:16.420
It's terrible for you. So we land,

49
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.340
he walks as fast as he can off the plate right into one of those stores and

50
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.460
buys a pack of cigarettes &lt;laugh&gt; and he's open.

51
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.650
And he's got one in his mouth as he, the door, he went off.

52
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.090
<v 2>For an hour about how it's terrible for you. He's so glad he is out over it.</v>

53
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.530
<v 0>So I'm outside with him. I go, what are you doing? I thought you quit smoke.</v>

54
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.330
Yeah. But all that talking about, and I wanted a cigarette.

55
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.170
<v 1>So was he being funny or was he just.</v>

56
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 0>A weird no, no, no. He was just a genius. Right?</v>

57
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.890
<v 2>Not drive. Just invited people to go do tennis and stuff.</v>

58
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.800
Like pick me up on the way &lt;laugh&gt; his.

59
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.920
<v 0>Brain was just wired different. Yeah. It was just wired different all the time,</v>

60
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.080
but like, he just decided, well, let's smoke and just, I mean,

61
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.080
he couldn't light it quick enough on the way out the door.
