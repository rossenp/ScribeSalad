00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 2>There was another disturbing, um,</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.560
moment where they were talking about the rollout of the vaccine and, uh, Jamie,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.920
who was that guy that was,

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.280
he was advocating for not rolling it out to

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.360
elderly people because elderly people are,

7
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.030
are dominantly white and that we should instead do it,

8
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.070
give it to people that are essential workers

9
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.710
first mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; because essential workers are more often people of

10
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:36.990
color and that this will balance things out.

11
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.830
Like literally say if more white people die,

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.780
it'll be better because we'll have more of a balance.

13
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.940
<v 0>This came from the CDCs advisory committee responsible for</v>

14
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.780
deciding who should get the vaccine. Yes. First or not.

15
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.300
<v 1>Yes. Who was the guy that said it though?</v>

16
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.260
There was one per and everybody blew a gasket, cuz that is.

17
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.460
<v 0>Really a crazy thing. Well, the, the problem is like, I don't remember the,</v>

18
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.610
a name of who said it,

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.730
but all members of this advisory committee supported it except for

20
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.010
one guy who was like, this is not based on science.

21
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.050
Because if you look at the statistics over 80% of people dying in this country

22
00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:19.210
from COVID are people over the age of.

23
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.450
<v 1>65? Yeah. If you wanna save lives, you.</v>

24
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.840
<v 0>Would give it to, and like 50% of people being hospitalized. Yeah. Over 65.</v>

25
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.320
So yes, if you wanna save lives, if you wanna make it.

26
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.560
So our ICUs aren't like at max capacity,

27
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.640
then give the vet, prioritize the vaccine based on age,

28
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.680
instead of occupation.

29
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.480
<v 1>There is a concern though,</v>

30
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.510
that essential workers are the ones who spread it more E easily because they

31
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:44.350
have to be in contact.

32
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.310
<v 0>With people. I'm glad you mentioned.</v>

33
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.470
<v 1>That. So it's not that cut and dry. So these essential workers that are,</v>

34
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.070
that are getting it, like these folks have to be at work.

35
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.750
So they have to be at work. They're more likely to contract it.

36
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:58.270
If they get the vaccine and they're protected from it,

37
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.750
then it will spread less likely. So.

38
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.790
<v 0>There's, there's two things there first is,</v>

39
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.220
is who the CDC designates as an essential worker.

40
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.300
Um, I'll get to that in a second,

41
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.980
but all of this is built on the assumption that

42
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.020
this vaccine will prevent the transmission of the virus,

43
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.780
which is what we're hearing from some so-called health experts,

44
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.770
which we're hearing from some in the media. &lt;affirmative&gt;,

45
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.530
it's not been scientifically proven.

46
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.970
I've gone back and looked at the applications that, um, and,

47
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.290
and the data that was put forward to the FDA to get approval from Pfizer

48
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.223
and Moderna,

49
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.290
and these vaccines have been scientifically established to,

50
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.280
uh, pre largely prevent serious health complications and death from COVID

51
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.000
once you're vaccinated that has been scientifically established,

52
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.400
nowhere in their trials,

53
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.160
was it scientifically established that these vaccines would prevent the

54
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.080
transmission of the virus? And so I,

55
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.680
I see it almost every day and it's incredibly dangerous where media

56
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.040
outlets and some, some people who are, uh,

57
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:15.960
healthcare professionals are propagating this, this,

58
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.590
I mean, it it's a lie. It's not true, but they're basically saying that that,

59
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:24.190
well, you know, people who have to go and work in these jobs, um,

60
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.190
that are essential workers, they need to get vaccinated.

61
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.670
So they don't spread it. Or even, you know, first responders, we had a,

62
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.390
we had a,

63
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.110
a local news station in Hawaii who shared a really emotional interview from a,

64
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.950
a first responder younger woman who had just gotten vaccinated.

65
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.300
And she said like, finally,

66
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.780
I can go and visit my grandmother and not be worried that I am

67
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.380
going to, um,

68
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.660
give her the virus because I'm taking care of people who have COVID every day.

69
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.460
And what is so dangerous about that is she got the vaccine.

70
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.170
If she has then gone and visited with her grandmother,

71
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.130
she could still, and, and Dr. Fauci talked about this and others,

72
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.250
because this virus is, is lives inside your nasal passage.

73
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.890
You can be vaccinated and you can still pass it on.

74
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:21.120
And it could have a, a, a devastating effect, someone, for example,

75
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.960
who is elderly, uh,

76
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.960
and who is vulnerable to this and who has not gotten the vaccine.

77
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.120
So anyone who is saying that well,

78
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.520
we have to vaccinate these people or those people based on their occupation,

79
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.560
because we don't want the virus to spread. It has not yet.

80
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.510
It has not been scientifically established that the vaccines prevent that.

81
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.070
And this is why they're all, you know, Fauci and these other guys they're like,

82
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:48.350
even if you're vaccinated, you have to still wear the mask.

83
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.030
You still have to do social distancing, uh,

84
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.470
because of the potential for that.

85
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.510
So I think that's such an important thing for people to know,

86
00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:58.270
especially as people are getting vaccinated,

87
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.900
not to have this false sense of security,

88
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.220
that just because you've gotten the vaccine, now you can go visit grandma in,

89
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.260
uh, the nursing home, because you're not going to expose her potentially or,

90
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.340
or put her at risk. But the second issue is, is if you actually go on the CDC,

91
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.180
I've gone through all the CDC slides that the advisory committee put forward on,

92
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.370
who is a frontline essential worker. And who's an essential worker,

93
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.290
healthcare professionals, and first responders, obviously, yes,

94
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.170
they are so overworked. They are overtaxed.

95
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.770
They should be getting the vaccine right alongside our elderly over 65.

96
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.920
But if you start getting past them and the people who are that as frontline

97
00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:44.840
essential workers, according to the CDC,

98
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.000
you're talking about anybody who works in manufacturing,

99
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.040
anybody who works at a grocery store, anybody who works at a, oh gosh,

100
00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:56.880
what were some of the other ones, uh, in agriculture, in any sector? Um,

101
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.160
basically you're talking about, I don't know,

102
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.760
half of all working people in frontline essential jobs,

103
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.520
and then you go on to the essential workers, oh, teachers and daycare workers.

104
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.960
They're included in that as well. And then you go on to essential workers,

105
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.760
people who work at banks, people who work in the media,

106
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.910
basically almost anybody else who is in the workforce as essential workers.

107
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.870
So this goes back to the thing that you originally said is that part of

108
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:30.510
their decision making process was this kind of justice component and

109
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.270
making decisions based on who gets the VA baking decisions about who gets to the

110
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:36.104
vaccine first,

111
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.100
not based on who is most likely to die or get seriously ill,

112
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.340
but instead based on occupation. Mm.

113
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.700
<v 1>It's. I,</v>

114
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.980
I kind of understand why you would want the people that are forced to work,

115
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.820
to get vaccinated before people that are not forced to work. That makes sense.

116
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.250
You know, uh, it's just,

117
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.810
it's very difficult when you hear that you're you're,

118
00:07:03.811 --> 00:07:07.370
you want essential workers to get vaccinated and they could still spread it.

119
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:08.970
Cuz that seems to me to be,

120
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.330
that needs to be really expressed much clearly.

121
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:17.810
<v 0>Very clearly it's not being expressed much at all. It is. Because again,</v>

122
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:22.800
you let's say you have that example. I mean, you know, people over 65,

123
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.880
my parents included like you're, you're pretty much stuck at home. Yeah.

124
00:07:26.881 --> 00:07:29.920
Because of the da the very real danger that if you go out and you get infected,

125
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.800
you could die. Yeah. Um,

126
00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.480
the danger of this fact

127
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.270
about how of vaccines have not been scientifically established to prevent the

128
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:46.070
transmission of the virus that that's not being directly told to every single

129
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:51.030
person who gets it is a real problem because then they go home. Yeah.

130
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.790
Or they go and visit their parents who they haven't seen for a long time or

131
00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:54.624
their grandparents,

132
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.380
and could be carrying the virus and transmit it

133
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.260
unknowingly because they think like I'm good now. Right. I'm safe.

134
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.700
And, and so that has to be part of this. I mean, to me,

135
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.940
there's a direct scientific correlation based on facts that if you

136
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:17.460
look at the people who are dying and who are being hospitalized predominantly,

137
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:19.420
they are people over 65 years old.

138
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.650
If we wanna reduce those numbers,

139
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.570
those are the people who should be prioritized to get this limited number of

140
00:08:27.571 --> 00:08:32.410
vaccines that we have first then followed by younger,

141
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.930
healthy people. I mean, it's, to me it's and by doing that, you know,

142
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.890
really we could reduce the numbers of,

143
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:44.080
of COVID related death by about 80% reduce the numbers of

144
00:08:44.081 --> 00:08:48.080
COVID related, uh, hospitalizations by, I think it's like 48,

145
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.840
40 9%. That would have a massive,

146
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.160
massive effect on people's lives and, and on our country.

147
00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.320
<v 1>Yeah. Well said and, uh, weird that that's not being said more often. Yeah.</v>

148
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.240
<v 0>I've, I've been, I've been pushing, I've been pushing our,</v>

149
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:10.640
both our state leadership in Hawaii and also also the Trump administration,

150
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.440
so that the Trump administration, uh, just in the last few day,

151
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.470
as I think it was it January 12th,

152
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:22.270
I think the department of health and human services did actually adjust their

153
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:25.550
recommendations. Um, and they said,

154
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:30.470
vaccines need to urgently go towards people over 65. Uh,

155
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.470
it is something that they have strongly recommended to the states at this point,

156
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:38.380
it's up to states to choose whether to implement it or not.

157
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.140
Texas has Texas is one of those states that has, uh, and there are a few others,

158
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:48.500
but at this point kind of the lives of our parents and

159
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:51.660
grandparents are in the hands of the decisions being made by the governors and

160
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:53.180
state health officials in each state.
