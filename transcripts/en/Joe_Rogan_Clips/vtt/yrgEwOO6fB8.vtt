00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 1>Experience. This is what comes with it. And that's why you're so good, man.</v>

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.360
Th th that hustler mentality, that's so important. That's so important.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
<v 0>You just network, you find people that you can,</v>

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.600
that are as driven as you,

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
and then you just figure out ways to work together and do. But comedy is so,

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.030
so many are lying, bro. They're lying. How so?

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.260
And you lie, you get the leverage. And like, it's

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.620
like, so the way I got hired on radio.

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.970
So at the time the thought was that this is 2001, I'm out of college.

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.240
And if I can get on the radio,

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.360
then that'll give me more access in the city.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.360
And I can host my own comedy night by hosting my own comedy night.

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
I can offer money to out of towners who also have comedy nights and do

15
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.360
swap outs. So I needed to get the, the radio gig.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.590
So at the time they were doing some sort of contest or some,

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.690
and who's the funniest in Birmingham, some.

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.080
And I missed the window for the contest.

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.010
And so I knew the long story,

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.920
long story short is that I go to the radio station.

21
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.770
I asked the guy at the time buck while he was hosting 95 7,

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.900
not the same star book, wild, different Buchwald.

23
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.420
<v 1>I don't know any book wilds. Okay.</v>

24
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.403
<v 0>Perfect.</v>

25
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.040
<v 1>Oh, different Buckwild. Oh, okay.</v>

26
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.600
<v 0>So I said, Hey man, I'm a comic. I have a degree in journalism.</v>

27
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.250
It's a perfect fit with me. And he goes, nah, we're done with that.

28
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.410
We're not going to have a comic. I go, okay, cool.

29
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.460
Now I've done enough of the comedy club in Birmingham to know that on black

30
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.294
weekends,

31
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.410
the black radio station hosts the black comedy night on Fridays and they throw

32
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:46.920
out t-shirts and all that. So I go to the comedy club and I told Bruce air,

33
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.930
as I said, Hey, I just got hired at 95 7. Um,

34
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
and they want me to open for doc ugly this weekend. And he goes, okay,

35
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.990
that's fine. I'll go back to 95 7. I go, yo, I know you don't want to with me,

36
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.190
but I'm opening for DEO this weekend. Do me a favor. Watch my set. If I'm funny,

37
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.500
put me on Monday morning, he goes,

38
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.980
you got to do so I get to the comedy club that Friday.

39
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.490
And all I have to do is keep Buckwild and Bruce Ayers apart

40
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.830
so that neither one knows what the lie was.

41
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.870
And Bruce came backstage. And you just, if,

42
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.060
as long as you act like you belong and you act like the truth is the truth.

43
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.100
People will kind of merge in with that. And Bruce came in there and goes, okay,

44
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.850
buck,

45
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.600
while you go out and throw the t-shirts and then you bring up Roy and I went out

46
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:37.890
and it was seven minutes,

47
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:42.510
but I crushed like just when you need that one set to go right in every

48
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:45.390
syllable, every comma is perfect.

49
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.800
And I demolished in front of DOJ ugly and I walk off stage and Buckwild says,

50
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:53.610
see you Monday morning. And that's how I got radio. It's just,

51
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.880
what were you going to do? Not booked me.

52
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.240
I'm already not really working the comedy club. I'm already not hired by you.

53
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.360
What is the penalty for this lie? Is this lie? Will this lie send me to jail?

54
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.223
No.

55
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.110
<v 1>Can lie. It's a hustle lie.</v>

56
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.303
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.180
I'm not saying load your resume with 50 different credits that you don't have,

58
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.730
but if you've performed somewhere else outside of where you from,

59
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.620
you have performed across the country. Yeah.

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.700
<v 1>What you basically did, like the comedy version of a subprime mortgage loan.</v>

61
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.630
He sold the house to someone who really shouldn't be buying a house,

62
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.170
but it worked out and he kept the house. Yeah. That's amazing.

63
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.970
<v 0>It's chitin, man. I came up man. Cause you know, I got arrested when I was,</v>

64
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.730
when I was 19. So for credit card fraud,

65
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.360
we was stealing credit cards in college and like buying jeans and all of that.

66
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.660
So my first two years of standup, I was on probation.

67
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.360
So when you have that,

68
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.270
I could have gone to jail or this could be a lot worse living in the

69
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.830
back of your mind, forever hustling, like, uh, people call the hustle.

70
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.920
I'm just like, no, this is, I have no choice. I have to do this.

71
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.640
<v 1>I knew a dude who was one of the original credit card fraudsters.</v>

72
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.890
His name was international Sal international style. Yeah, man.

73
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.960
He was a dude who used to come to this pool hall I was at and international

74
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.640
Sao was like, uh, he was a real nice guy, but he was a famous loser at gambling.

75
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.833
And that he would,

76
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.490
he would make millions of dollars on credit card fraud. He had,

77
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:33.750
they had an organized crime empire and this what they would do back in the day.

78
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.490
You remember they had this transparency, like they would run your card.

79
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.620
They will put it on a machine and go shoot, shoot.

80
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.500
<v 0>Carbon, carbon.</v>

81
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.200
<v 1>Carbon.</v>

82
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.770
You would take those carbons people who worked in these department stores would

83
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:48.790
take the carbons and sell them to him. He would take those carbons,

84
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:52.870
make a totally new credit card out of that car with some sort of machine.

85
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.390
And then they would distribute them to these guys.

86
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:58.990
They would buy goods with this stuff and then they would sell the goods.

87
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.710
And then guys would come to him in the pool hall with paper bags,

88
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.000
filled with cash.

89
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.330
And all he wanted to do was gamble on pool and he could never win.

90
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.710
And when I'm telling you never,

91
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.070
when that guy was playing with dirty money and he knew it, his head was up.

92
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.020
He would be staring that nine ball would be in the hole and he would be put

93
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:20.830
away from it. And you see his hand shaken and you just shake it,

94
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.940
just it up and hit the rail and bounce it off. And people would go, no,

95
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.030
he missed it. I can't believe he missed an international. Sal could never win.

96
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.910
He could never win, but he was one of the original dudes.

97
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.200
Did you find something from him?

98
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.460
<v 2>Very weird. Just happened. What happened? So I'm typing,</v>

99
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.620
I'm typing international Sal, right?

100
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.040
And I hit space bar and two things come up,

101
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.580
credit card thief and pool player. But when I click the search for that,

102
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.540
nothing shows up like for instance, credit card thief.

103
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.300
And it just brings up a bunch of other stuff about credit card thieves and other

104
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.373
seats.

105
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.890
<v 1>Honestly, it might be because of us. I've never looked her up,</v>

106
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.010
but the search might exist because of us.

107
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.720
Cause I know I've talked about international Sal before and him being a credit.

108
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.130
<v 0>Card thief he's dead.</v>

109
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.150
My friend's mom was actually taking care of him. Uh,

110
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.610
when he was in hospice, he was, he had cancer.

111
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.570
He died of rectal cancer mouse like Sal. Yeah, it was.

112
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.280
<v 1>Bad. It was bad. No, no, no. Salbi Tara is a famous pool player.</v>

113
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.110
This international Soule was not a famous,

114
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.990
Salbi terrible international south couldn't win.

115
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.660
But he was one of the original credit card fraudsters.

116
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:36.200
He went to jail for quite a long time and then got out and was doing the same

117
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:37.100
thing. Again.

118
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.430
<v 0>It was crazy though. Is that when you get arrested, especially for light,</v>

119
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.620
some white collar like that,

120
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.370
like what they don't tell you about getting arrested is that the first thing

121
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:50.030
they do is try to pin other unsolved on you.

122
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:53.120
So before you even like get a mugshot or anything,

123
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.710
you just go sit in a room and they go,

124
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.580
here are all the mugshots of other people we are looking at for similar crimes.

125
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.230
Do you know any of these?

126
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.940
And then you get a handwriting sample and then a as in like theirs and that's

127
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:05.840
when you find out like, oh,

128
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:10.730
I was just a petty teenager that just took her credit card to get some jeans.

129
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.830
And then you start realizing like, oh,

130
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.240
there's an entire syndicate of happening in this city that I didn't know

131
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:21.320
anything about. They're trying to pin on me. And that's when the fear set in.

132
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.550
Cause like in your head, you're like, all right,

133
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:26.720
well I know I probably won't go to jail and hope I don't go to jail.

134
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.690
Oh. I might go to jail.

135
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.950
<v 1>For some you didn't do. Oh and they don't care. They do not care.</v>

136
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.600
Decided you were already a criminal.

137
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.200
<v 0>And that's when I got into comedy, that was the depression.</v>

138
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.150
Like that was the moment like, oh.

139
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:45.950
<v 1>Went to jail for armed kidnapping. That's how he got into comedy.</v>

140
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.400
He robbed a dude over some Coke with a machine gun, taped them to a chair and.

141
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.890
And then when he was in jail, he learned how to do stamps.

142
00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.380
<v 0>That is the best cold open to a biopic.</v>

143
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.470
When Joey Diaz gets his biopic,

144
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.470
it has to start with duct tape on somebody's wrist.

145
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.280
<v 1>The duty kidnapped. He took pictures together.</v>

146
00:08:04.281 --> 00:08:05.600
Didn't he put it up on his Instagram.

147
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.810
He took pictures with the guy he kidnapped. He's like 31 years ago.

148
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:11.090
I kidnapped this. Now we're friends.

149
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.840
<v 0>That's the beautiful thing. No, man. It's a redemption.</v>

150
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.600
And being able to make a mistake and get back in the mix. And.

151
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:18.740
<v 1>Oh, the greatest,</v>

152
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:23.000
most disciplined people went to jail because they were like Bernard Hopkins.

153
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.530
One of my all-time favorite boxers.

154
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.080
He's one of the greatest midway champions of all time.

155
00:08:27.081 --> 00:08:30.230
And Bernard Hopkins spent like six years in jail for armed robbery.

156
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.650
And he learned how to be disciplined when he was in jail.

157
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.360
And when he got out of jail, he not,

158
00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:39.530
not only did he have like a drive that other people probably couldn't

159
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:42.980
comprehend, but he knew what would happen if it went bad again,

160
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.710
he knew what would happen if he slid back down that road again.

161
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:49.460
And apparently likes a corrections officer to said when he was getting out,

162
00:08:49.461 --> 00:08:53.870
you'll be right back in here. And he was like, the. I will be the I will be.

163
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.820
And he turned out to be one of the greatest boxers of all time. There he is.

164
00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.940
Joey's with the guy 32 years ago, I made a mistake. So what.

165
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.340
<v 0>It's done when you started as kidnapped.</v>

166
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.790
<v 1>Showed up to my show, 32 years ago, I made a mistake.</v>

<v 0>A little crazy, you know, that's, that's what the whole redemption is about.</v>

169
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:15.810
And John and, you know, do what you can, which a second chance.

170
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:17.100
That's why I'm just trying to grind, man.

171
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.990
All this is a gift I could have been in prison.
