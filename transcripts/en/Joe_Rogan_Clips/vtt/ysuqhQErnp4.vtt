00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 2>You don't the Jeffrey Epstein.</v>

3
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.680
Thing's a weird comparison because Eric Weinstein says Jeffrey Epstein.

4
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:08.880
Wasn't smooth at all.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.800
<v 0>I, I know that's what Eric says. Eric is.</v>

6
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.110
<v 1>Far smarter than the average human being far smarter to the point where</v>

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.180
he's not buying anybody's. And he met with Epstein and he said,

8
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.270
right away, he's like, well, this is a construct. He's like, he's an actor.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.430
This is a construct. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about.

10
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.370
He thought it was a hundred percent. I love Eric.

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.800
<v 0>But, uh, and he is indeed brilliant, uh, probably way smarter than me,</v>

12
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.160
but he's also flawed. No,

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.690
like all humans are and I D I disagree with him on that one.

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.710
I listen.

15
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.750
<v 1>Did you meet Jeffrey Epstein? No, but.</v>

16
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.920
<v 0>I met a lot of you did let him.</v>

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.650
<v 1>When did you meet? You met him. Uh.</v>

18
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.840
<v 0>W just the MIT. So all the scientists are all, like, everybody met him.</v>

19
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.780
This is the dark thing. All the scientists met him.

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.100
<v 1>Yep. Here's the difference? Here's one of the differences. First of all,</v>

21
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:09.930
Eric has gotten laid. Yeah, it's happened before. Yes.

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.520
He probably got laid a lot when he was young. Just to.

23
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.570
<v 0>I have also gotten laid [inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.290
<v 1>No, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about a lot of the scientists,</v>

25
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.890
a lot of these scientists that is their kryptonite.

26
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.780
It's not a coincidence that this guy, allegedly,

27
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.040
it's not a coincidence.

28
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.870
This guy allegedly involved a huge part of the scientific

29
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:38.700
community in this crazy thing where he's got a island and he

30
00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:40.650
ships off these brilliant minds over there,

31
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:45.450
allegedly and introduces them to a lot of these ladies, allegedly. Okay. Listen.

32
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.400
<v 0>I, I meant allegedly referring to the kryptonite of sex,</v>

33
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.020
being a kryptonite for scientists, for dorks, for dorks.

34
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.260
[inaudible].

35
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.740
<v 1>Uh, there's no.</v>

36
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.030
<v 0>Disagreeing. I don't think that we can put all scientists in the group of dorks,</v>

37
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:03.600
but yes.

38
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.360
<v 1>There's a lot of Eric in there. Well, I saw through the.</v>

39
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.450
<v 0>I don't know. That's.</v>

40
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.573
<v 1>A little bit.</v>

41
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.690
<v 0>That's conspiratorial. I think, because to say there's many elements, I think,</v>

42
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.870
I think what Eric says, which is like, uh, he was just a,

43
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.150
a tool of something bigger is that's a problem to me because

44
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.890
it removes the, uh,

45
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.120
the responsibility of evil from an individual and saying that there's some other

46
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.360
evil besides in the darkness. It's it's possible.

47
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.620
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

48
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.550
He's saying that he's a part of the intelligence community and that's,

49
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.030
that's actually been reported on,

50
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.840
do you know that when he was arrested the initial arrest and when they,

51
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:44.400
he was given a very lenient sentence,

52
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.260
one of the guys who was involved in that case said it was above my pay grade.

53
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.440
And then I was told he was a part of the intelligence community.

54
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.100
Now the word had always been that he was a,

55
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.070
either a massage agent or someone along those lines.

56
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.610
If you have some of the most brilliant minds in the world and you want to

57
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.460
compromise them and you want to in somehow or another,

58
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:10.330
get them entangled in your world. There's two great steps.

59
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:11.164
I think you need some more.

60
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.570
<v 0>Yeah. I was going to say, do you want to be,</v>

61
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.920
I thought you consider yourself a man you're drinking. We're talking about not.

62
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.890
<v 1>Sufficiently finished. I know I finished.</v>

63
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.630
<v 0>Mine before you pushing it. We should have another one.</v>

64
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.670
<v 1>What I was saying is if you want it to compromise, cheers, sir. Cheers.</v>

65
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.660
Good to see you, man. Good legitimately. Really, really good to see you here.

66
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.850
As I tried to talk to you to move into Texas, um, there's two,

67
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.660
two ways you would compromise the scientific community. One of them being money,

68
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.560
right? So he gives them money funding that helps them millions of dollars,

69
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:51.490
right? Donated millions of dollars to various, uh, projects,

70
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:53.620
various things you're working on. Two women,

71
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.810
bring all these scientists together,

72
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.360
bring these brilliant guys together with the promise of money for all their

73
00:04:01.361 --> 00:04:05.380
projects that working on. And then you bring them to an island and they say,

74
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:09.250
Hey, everything's fine here. Don't worry about it. You know, I got a temple.

75
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.310
That's painted like the Jewish flag. I Israeli flag.

76
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.520
<v 0>I have faith that scientists have more integrity than that.</v>

77
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.150
<v 1>But it's not a matter of integrity. Like everything was above board.</v>

78
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.900
If they don't know what he's doing and they're innocent, right.

79
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:25.900
Then they haven't done anything wrong and he's giving them money and taking

80
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:30.670
pictures with them just simply by taking pictures with him there.

81
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.990
<v 0>Oh, the compromise your side. Yeah, I see. Okay. I thought you meant like,</v>

82
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.220
like say there was a beautiful young lady here and then she was tasked with, uh,

83
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.100
escorting me around to show how wonderful texts.

84
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.050
<v 1>I'll do is have photographs with you and this beautiful young compromise. Yes.</v>

85
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.220
Now I do not know what happened, obviously, cause I wasn't there.

86
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.320
But I would imagine that if he was really a part of the intelligence community,

87
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.700
there was probably a directive.

88
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.820
There was probably something that they were working on to try to get these

89
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:03.520
people, to go along with whatever the he was doing.

90
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.880
<v 0>But see to me that those are both different flavors of evil.</v>

91
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.060
Both of them are not good, but okay. So.

92
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.730
<v 1>But the intelligence community has always done that.</v>

93
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.210
They have always compromised people with sex and they've always compromised

94
00:05:16.211 --> 00:05:19.690
people with money is that there's this is a standard, you know,

95
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:24.070
I've directly talked to people who were in the CIA who would describe

96
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.460
methods that they would use to compromise individuals.

97
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.060
<v 0>Wait, so is this good? The scientists have done something to avoid it.</v>

98
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.620
<v 1>It's hard because if they don't know right there, they're promised funding.</v>

99
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.830
And then you have other scientists that are also going to be there. Hey,

100
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.860
this guy's going to be there. Hey, you got that guy.

101
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:45.700
This guy won this prize and he's going to be there. And this guy's from MIT.

102
00:05:45.701 --> 00:05:48.310
He's going to be there. And you're like, well, that'd be a fun party. Yeah,

103
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.020
let's go. Should I bring my wife.

104
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.850
<v 0>If Epstein, is that like, why? So there was,</v>

105
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.000
I guess actually Eric makes this argument is like the whole thing that, uh,

106
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.430
Jeffrey Epstein was a pedophile was actually a negative in that sense for the,

107
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.840
if he is a part of like the intelligence community, you know what I think he,

108
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.080
the fact that he is a criminal, sorry to drop it as a negative.

109
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.590
<v 1>I interrupted you. Um, I think it is a negative,</v>

110
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.550
but I think when you're involved in that much to Prevoty,

111
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.130
I think you can get compromised. I think it's like a DEA agent.

112
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.490
It becomes a drug dealer. You know,

113
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.470
I think when you're around darkness all the time, I mean,

114
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:38.120
that happens a lot. We're undercover. Cops who come drug dealers just happens.

115
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.641
They, they,

116
00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:42.500
they live in that world for too long and it just gets in their veins,
