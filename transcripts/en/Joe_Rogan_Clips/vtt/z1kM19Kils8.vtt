00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.400
<v 1>Or what? Like what new movie with James Bond. When's that coming out.</v>

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.600
I wanna see James Bond win again. I wanna see James Bond win.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.200
I'm tired of.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.760
<v 0>Waiting. You need to be James Bond, dude. I'm not interested in.</v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.000
<v 1>James Bond. That's not what I was saying. He's been dropped these.</v>

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.793
<v 0>He was, he be, listen.</v>

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.750
<v 1>I do not wanna be a spy.</v>

9
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.930
<v 0>I'm a Roger Moore.</v>

10
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.350
<v 1>Guy. I do love those movies.</v>

11
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.470
<v 0>Me too. Who is your favorite bond?</v>

12
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.910
<v 1>Daniel Craig, by a mile, really? By a country mile. Interesting.</v>

13
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.350
The only thing that separates people from my opinion is nostalgia.

14
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.150
If you just looked at it objectively, if I said,

15
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:42.780
which one of these really looks like he could kill people. There's one answer.

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.500
It's Daniel. Craig, you don't really think that Timothy Dalton's out there.

17
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.380
Newin no, not Timothy. No it's stabbing people. Roger Moore. Roger.

18
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.013
Roger Moore is fantastic,

19
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.340
but you don't believe that Roger Moore is like legitimately out there people.

20
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.460
<v 0>Up. You don't know. Look, he's got that dead. Ken like Barbie and Ken,</v>

21
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.210
listen to me. He's.

22
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.290
<v 1>He's a Barbie, you got two options. You got Sean Connery.</v>

23
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.850
If you're being dishonest and you want nostalgia, who doesn't love Sean Connery.

24
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.810
I love Sean Connery,

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.930
but it's just like the difference between going back to like the early

26
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.290
days of like Jim Jeffries,

27
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.730
being the heavyweight champion of the world versus Mike Tyson,

28
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.880
the newer one are better. You might decide. Woo.

29
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.640
Jim Jeffries was the old days. John L. Sullivan with his mustache.

30
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.120
How long do you think John L. Sullivan would survive with a prime time?

31
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.320
Mike Tyson? How many seconds? That would be the bet.

32
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.040
How many seconds does he live for Mike Tyson? Just crushes his skull.

33
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:41.874
Look at Roger.

34
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.470
<v 0>More. Then's thing. That's a, a robot though. Roger. Moore's a robot alien.</v>

35
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.590
<v 1>You got two options. If you being honest, &lt;laugh&gt; it. Doesn't it's not,</v>

36
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.590
it's not disrespectful for Roger Moore. It's not disrespectful for Tim.

37
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.630
Look at that face. I don't even know who some of these guys are.

38
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.070
&lt;laugh&gt; you got two options. &lt;laugh&gt; look at the Pixar one.

39
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.860
You guys got real Sean Connery. If you're a silly and you got Daniel,

40
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.460
Craig, if you're being honest,

41
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.660
Sean Connery is a wonderful actor. But if I had a choice, if I,

42
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.300
the two of 'em are locked in a room, who's gonna live Sean Connery, Daniel,

43
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.500
Craig, Daniel. Craig's gonna kill Sean Connery.

44
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.660
I'm so sad to announce to everybody love that interview where he talked to

45
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:24.450
Barbara Walters about smacking chicks.

46
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.330
<v 0>I disagree. That's Indiana Jones's father. I know.</v>

47
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.890
<v 1>&lt;Laugh&gt;. I know like he was great.</v>

48
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.170
It was a different time. It was a different time.

49
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.810
Daniel Craig looks like he can legitimately kill people. He's the only one.

50
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.280
Like if you asked me if there's a fight to the death between all those guys

51
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.960
one-on-one fights, is it Daniel? Craig, he's gonna win. I'm so sorry.

52
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.640
I never got.

53
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.473
<v 0>Into that guy.</v>

54
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.400
<v 1>He's the only one that seems like a real killer. He's like a tortured guy.</v>

55
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.680
It's a good, the problem with this is the problem with Daniel.

56
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.680
Craig is oh seven or the last one? The most recent one. Yeah.

57
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.200
That's here's the problem. Here's the problem.

58
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.880
It's almost like if you want, if you're,

59
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.400
if you're a person just wants to look at this objectively,

60
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.080
you have to separate yourself from all the other James bonds.

61
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.680
You have to pretend they don't exist.

62
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.750
And you have to look at this as an in individual occurrence.

63
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.430
Like him as James Bond is a new thing. Let's look at what that is. Well,

64
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:28.230
it really does seem like there's this dude. Who's not perfect. Like,

65
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:31.790
there's a girl who was like a threatening him talking about shooting him in his,

66
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.030
his good knee. Like she knew which knee was up. Right? He's not perfect. Right?

67
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.260
He gets drunk. He's killing people. He's having all these, uh, romantic,

68
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.780
uh, affairs with spies and and barely surviving. But as an,

69
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.620
as an individual entity, as the James Bond,

70
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.020
who's better than him. Who's better. If you really wanna be honest,

71
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.290
you, you grew up with Roger Moore, but you knew Sean con. Yeah.

72
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.531
<v 2>But do,</v>

73
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:03.650
do you think you only like him because he's the most realistic because it's the

74
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:05.050
most recent? No.

75
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.490
<v 1>No, cuz he's the best. He's the best just gets faker and fake. Listen to me.</v>

76
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.770
Listen, if he existed and then if Sean Connery or no, how about this?

77
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.010
This is honest. If he existed and then Tim Dalton came on after him.

78
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.043
Is that Tim Dalton?

79
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.343
<v 2>Yes.</v>

80
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.680
<v 1>Tim da Timothy, Don. If he came on after that guy, it wouldn't work out.</v>

81
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.773
It wouldn't work.

82
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.920
It was different James Bond back then when Timothy dont was on,

83
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.200
he was perfect for it.

84
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.920
It was like this kind of campy fun thing where the dude like dressed real night.

85
00:04:33.921 --> 00:04:37.440
It didn't have to be realistic. He always won. Ooh, smooth spy. Haha.

86
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.390
Mar Bon James Bond. And I was like, yeah, we win. Right. It was ridiculous.

87
00:04:42.391 --> 00:04:43.270
It was like karate kid.

88
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.270
<v 2>Right? Right.</v>

89
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.630
<v 1>Yep. It's ridiculous.</v>

90
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.670
But if you came to like a contest where,

91
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.430
who seems like a real killer, there's one answer. It's Daniel Craig.

92
00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.070
That's a real killer. That's a person who kills people. He nailed it.

93
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.500
The other like Timothy of the daltons killing people. Are you sure?

94
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.820
<v 2>Yeah. It started, it sounds like a, it makes uh, a lot of the,</v>

95
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.020
the stakes matter here, like the, uh, how good the movie is like, yes.

96
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.860
The action movie. If they made a Austin Powers type movie, Jane O.

97
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.900
Craig doesn't fit. Right? Mm they're starting to like slow down and.

98
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.340
<v 1>Joke and he's not shooting and no, no. He would be terrible for that.</v>

99
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.210
As Roger Moore was more comedic, like remember Roger Moore,

100
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:28.490
they walked onto the set of the fake moon landing. There was like,

101
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:31.250
do you remember that episode? It was one, one of his movies.

102
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.050
They accidentally burst into the set of people faking the moon landing and Roger

103
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.650
Moore. I forget which one it was. Yeah. It was that awesome powers. It runs it.

104
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.920
No dude. I'm telling you it was. Oh, it was hilarious.

105
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.840
It was hilarious. What was that one? See, Roger Moore was a different movie.

106
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.320
Yes. It doesn't mean that those movies weren't great. Cuz when I was a kid,

107
00:05:51.321 --> 00:05:55.120
they were great. What it means is Roger Moore man. Yeah. Oh,

108
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.480
diamonds are forever. 1971 diamonds off.

109
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.400
That was before they killed the moon landing program.

110
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.440
They did it from 69 to I believe they did it at 72.

111
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.600
So Roger Mar probably &lt;laugh&gt; was a part of how they killed the, the,

112
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.200
the, the moon landing program. Is that done? Not look.

113
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.033
<v 0>At this. Is that done?</v>

114
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.030
<v 1>Knots as a cop. How crazy this is? See, this was like a total. Oh see,</v>

115
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:20.910
this is Sean Connell. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's not even Roger Moore. Oh my God.

116
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.030
I'm wrong. Oh, I thought it was by this time. It was Roger Moore.

117
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.670
<v 0>Yeah. This was that HBO in the early eighties.</v>

118
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.870
<v 1>Handsome pastor. He was, he was so handsome in that.</v>

119
00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.750
What year did look at that? The cops are running out there and he is got like a

120
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.820
moon Rover. He is driving away to get away from the cops.

121
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.060
Oh he is gonna drive through the wall. Oh Jesus.

122
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.340
He's the fake moon landing set. He escapes,

123
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.140
bro. This is crazy. This is crazy.

124
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.660
<v 0>And there's done nuts, right? &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

125
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.770
<v 1>Wow. Where's Jackie. I'll tell you boy.</v>

126
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.010
