00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.260
<v 1>He had, he had done it for such an important reason as well, which was to say,</v>

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.250
uh, you know, we in Germany should have the right to be rude about Edmund,

4
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:16.050
particularly Edwin, who, you know, was promoted for mare to prime minister.

5
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:19.650
Now to president wants to be Salton. You know, I mean it, in a very bad man,

6
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.980
locked up more journalists per capita, I think, than any other, uh,

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.240
country in the world. Other than trying to,

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:28.110
which I don't think we can get the stats on, uh, uh, very,

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.730
very evil. I think, man, who,

10
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:35.190
who has led his country backwards in the last 20

11
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:40.110
years and is in the process of trying to destroy a wonderful country. And,

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.290
um, if you can't be rude about him,

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.290
if you can't pretend that he sleeps with animals, um,

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.420
which is what the German comedian started with, then somewhere down the line,

15
00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:53.880
you won't be able to say anything about the imprisoned journalists either.

16
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:56.940
And so on. And since also, by the way,

17
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.450
people don't seem to spend most time worrying about the Turkish journalists,

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.850
everyone in prisons. Um, the least they paid attention when I said that, uh, um,

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.820
he and angler, Merkel got up to really filthy,

20
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.430
filthy acts in the zoo.

21
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.363
<v 2>Well,</v>

22
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.290
obviously the worst case of retaliation for humor is probably Charlie

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.950
up-to, right? Hmm. I mean, which is a terrible,

24
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:26.700
and unfortunately many people, um,

25
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.860
weren't defending the murder,

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.600
but we're talking the murderers. I mean, I think, yeah, how many,

27
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.660
I think it was 11 people that were murdered and ended up placement and a police

28
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:39.870
officer. Um, they,

29
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.130
but they were saying that instead of concentrating on the murder,

30
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.160
which was done completely out of this,

31
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.120
reinforcing their rules of their ideology and,

32
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.070
and retaliation for any mocking of that ideology, instead of that,

33
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.860
they were talking about how racist Charlie Hebdo was. Yeah.

34
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.890
There was a lot of that. In fact, my friend, Jamie Kilstein was a part of that.

35
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.020
He was on television did back in his super social justice warrior days

36
00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:07.854
talking.

37
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.620
<v 1>Don't you wish among other things that people said, no,</v>

38
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:13.830
I'm not talking about something if they don't know about it. Yeah.

39
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.200
My guess was that until, until the murders,

40
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.221
I mean,

41
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:23.880
an infinitely small number of people knew about Charlene Abdo outside of France.

42
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.510
Right. I found myself in the wake of that, uh,

43
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.020
in studios with people who I know had just Googled Sharley up there the day

44
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:34.080
before I know that they just gone to Wikipedia and,

45
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.030
and read an English version of a claim about what that magazine was about.

46
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.480
Goes back to that thing about my point about the journalist and the Holocaust

47
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:46.320
denial thing that just route around a bunch of people being killed.

48
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.190
This doesn't seem to vindicate my side's ideology.

49
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.460
Therefore let me find what I can do to defame them. And oh, good.

50
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.150
Somebody at Charlie Abdo once did this cartoon that was off color.

51
00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.850
And I can't understand what the, the, the words are beneath it,

52
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.550
but I'll I'll claim it's racist. I mean, people were actually doing that.

53
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.130
That actually there were, there was a, um,

54
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.610
there was one cartoon that was used against Charlie Hebdo after the massacre,

55
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.250
uh, that was a joke against the front Nastia now and the

56
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:19.420
claims they were making about the black woman in Sarcosy government.

57
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.680
But because they, the joke and the, which if you didn't speak French,

58
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.210
it wasn't clear apparently, but, but,

59
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.990
and if you knew nothing about recent French history,

60
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.690
you knew nothing about the social, the Sarcosy administration and the, and the,

61
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.050
and the ministry. In question, these people just went to it and said,

62
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.330
racist cartoon,

63
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.250
not noticing that the cartoon was actually a joke about racists,

64
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.060
but they didn't, they didn't bother to find that out. And I thought that,

65
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.830
I thought that whole thing among many,

66
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:51.070
many other things was deeply worrying from that point of view,

67
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.910
because it means that in the immediate aftermath of something,

68
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.890
it should be so clear.

69
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.800
A bunch of people can just try to reframe the narrative and re and

70
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.160
change the history of a publication.

71
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.020
Yeah. Um, claim it is just something different. And,

72
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.770
and for a lot of people, of course, that was very, um,

73
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.230
that was very convenient because after all,

74
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:21.190
if Charlene Optos staff actually were these racists, then you know,

75
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:25.360
you didn't need to worry too much about them or why you'd been silent on the

76
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:26.920
issues they'd spoken up about.

77
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.910
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.440
The narrative then been that these people had been mocking this

79
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.420
disenfranchised marginalized group right. In society.

80
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.990
And that they had it coming yeah. In some very strange way.

81
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.080
And it's part of me struggled with that because it was like,

82
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.130
is this P some people just have contrarian instincts everybody's going left.

83
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.040
They just go away. I don't like it. And they want to go the other way.

84
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.620
There there's so many people that have that instinct. And then there's,

85
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:57.490
as you said, before this, uh, headline mentality,

86
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.070
they read the headline and don't look any further into it.

87
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.640
Even if it's a headline about a headline, right. It's theirs,

88
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.430
that's all they need. They're armed with enough facts.

89
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:09.220
They slam their laptop down and start debating. Yeah.

90
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.860
<v 1>And, um, and in that case,</v>

91
00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:15.730
as in many others totally lose sight of the only thing that matters,

92
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.160
the only thing that matters in that case being, is it ever right?

93
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.770
To make apologies for people walking into an office and

94
00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.330
gunning down people for an opinion, you don't like be honest at,

95
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.590
which has to be, of course now has to be, has to be now. Yes.

96
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.750
And yet in these moments.

97
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:41.680
So we had one 20 years before with the rush of year for the satanic verses

98
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.150
affair. In these moments,

99
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:47.290
you discover that you don't have the allies on your side.

100
00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:52.150
You thought you did in the wake of the rusty affair in 89. Uh,

101
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.620
it was people from the right and the left in Britain who started making excuses

102
00:05:56.621 --> 00:06:00.500
for the Ayatollah. You know, uh, we had, uh, the,

103
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:05.030
the chief rabbi then of the UK Djokovics to his, to his shame,

104
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.170
said both Mr.

105
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.270
Bush and the Ayatollah has offended people's feelings as if someone rusty

106
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.220
had in, in, you know, who called on all novelists to go to Tehran, assassinate,

107
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:20.450
the Ayatollah, if they had a chance, um, you had, uh, um,

108
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.130
somebody like a right wing conservative minister, uh,

109
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.220
Jeffrey Howe, who said, that said that a Bush had done,

110
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.630
had really offended Britain.

111
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:34.190
He'd been rude about Britain as if that had anything to do with anything. Um,

112
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.920
there was, uh, one, um, there was one famous case of a,

113
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:42.810
of a conservative peer who said about Rushdie that he,

114
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.480
it wouldn't bother him.

115
00:06:44.481 --> 00:06:48.320
If a group of young Muslims took Mr. Bush into an alleyway and taught him some

116
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.890
manners. Um, so,

117
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.990
and you had that from the left as well. Uh,

118
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.300
Bernie granted labor and P famously said at that point,

119
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:01.040
that burning books wasn't a problem for him. Um, and,

120
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.890
uh, that was when they were burning the satanic verses in Bradford. So,

121
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.970
so you get these weird coalitions of people who suddenly turn out not to get the

122
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:10.100
point, not to get the point, not want to defend.

123
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:11.960
And then of course you get the carrots to say things like, well,

124
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.710
it wasn't my sort of novel, you know, I didn't think a novel was all that good.

125
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:16.910
I had midnight's children.

126
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:21.440
I could cope with Sandy versus he lost me with a plot as if that means that then

127
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.950
you can call for the death of the author rather than just give it a bad review.

128
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.070
<v 2>How is he now Salman, Rushdie still in hiding?</v>

129
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.610
I know he does a lot of interviews now and it seems to be more relaxed.

130
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.960
<v 1>Yes. Uh, there, he seems to be, I don't know, the, the specifics, he, um,</v>

131
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.300
there was an assurance,

132
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:42.290
I think given some years ago in the labor year labor government,

133
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:47.540
that with Tehran, that they would not actively, uh, um, uh,

134
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.460
encourage the murder of Rushdie anymore. Um, and I say to them,

135
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.370
that's a freezing of relations, um, not unfreezing relations. Uh, but,

136
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.790
but the point I wanted to make was that that's, again,

137
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:03.890
we've all we've been through these things.

138
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:08.900
We know how it plays out over the challis, Abdo, uh, um, events,

139
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.590
uh, the murder of the staff and contributors to that magazine.

140
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.830
We knew in the immediate aftermath,

141
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.660
what was going on and that there were people who just wanted to

142
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:23.570
make excuses. And, and you still hear that everywhere. I mean,

143
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.520
I I've heard it on every single free speech debate in my adult life.

144
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.360
Um, I remember the diversity debate I was growing up.

145
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:35.060
And I remember in every one of the things in recent years,

146
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:40.020
from the Danish cartoons to the, uh, jewel Medina scandal, uh,

147
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.840
uh, publishing London's firebomb for publishing a novel,

148
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.830
it was actually amazingly phoning about Mohammed, uh, to Sharley Abdo.

149
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:50.780
And since you, you just get these,

150
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:55.500
this strange group of people from brightened left, some believers,

151
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.380
some non-believers who always just come up with these,

152
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.650
arguments and, and say things like, well, I didn't find the cartoon very funny,

153
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:08.460
or, or I never, I never took that magazine seriously.

154
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.330
I didn't think it was right when they did this. It's just,

155
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.800
they just don't for some reason,

156
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:17.370
have the fortitude to just the only thing that matters in the,

157
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.170
in the wake of that, which is no.

158
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.720
<v 2>Do you think that's because Islam is unique in their</v>

159
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:29.670
approach to anything that goes outside the lines of what they

160
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:33.570
feel is oh, absolutely. Acceptable. I mean, in terms of like,

161
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:35.010
they will murder you if you drop them off.

162
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.090
<v 1>Yeah. This is, this is,</v>

163
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.920
this is what's been described as the internalization of the Fatwah. Hmm. Um,

164
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.650
if, if, uh, I'm sure you've had this experience,

165
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.610
but it's actually worse now that the presumption is worse than the actual

166
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:51.290
reality. I have quite often people saying to me, no, I'd like,

167
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.990
like to write this piece about X. Uh, but I don't know if I can,

168
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:58.770
because you know, it might get a death sentence. And actually,

169
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.600
I always say, what are you talking about? Right. Um,

170
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.530
fortunately, so far,

171
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:07.650
I haven't given that advice in the person's end being in any way under any

172
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.400
actual danger let being killed. But,

173
00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:16.740
and I think I might feel differently if that was the case. Um, but, uh,

174
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.270
but that's, but there was this an overcompensation occurring at the moment,

175
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.870
and it goes far, far within the,

176
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:29.160
within the boundaries of what actually could plausibly get you into any trouble,

177
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.080
whether or not the trouble is, you know, legitimate to get into or not. Um,

178
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.950
so that now, yeah, I've had many journalists in recent years,

179
00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:40.370
particularly since Sharley up to it sort of sidle up to me and say, well,

180
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.060
I'd quite like to do this. I do. I don't dare. And then, I mean,

181
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:47.940
I'm talking about for like very basic reporting and things. Uh,

182
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.990
they're not people saying, Hey,

183
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.250
I've decided to do a great big cartoon of Mohammed with a great big deck and,

184
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.820
uh, you know, uh, having sex with the Pope or something, you know, I,

185
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.520
it's not that it's never,

186
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:04.350
that it's never people saying I'm really just so keen to draw

187
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.090
Muhammad today. Douglas, what did I do?

188
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.660
It never is that it's always something way, way, way down.

189
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.620
I'm thinking of even like saying something critical of certain

190
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.590
regimes. So,

191
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.990
so the internalization and the fact why since 1989,

192
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:22.530
which has been exacerbated now by the killings of Charlie Hebdo and elsewhere,

193
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.080
or the attacks on the, you know, as Posten in Denmark,

194
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.830
it means that we are in this period where, where people are really hyper,

195
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:29.790
hyper sensitive.

196
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.140
And they really shouldn't be because it really isn't that bad.

197
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.690
It's not as bad as they think, but this is, you know, you can do so much work.

198
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.120
If you, if you say to people,

199
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.650
I've got Kalashnikovs on my side. I mean,

200
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.550
the extent and people in free societies, I got a really,

201
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:54.490
really loathe to admit this, but it's the classic bounce.

202
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.540
There is the classic sort of a mob trick, you know, knocking on someone's door.

203
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.710
I'm very disappointed in you. But my friend,

204
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.900
my huge friend, uh, is, uh, is, uh, really angry.

205
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:09.490
And I'm just holding him back.

206
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.150
You can do an amazing amount of work if you're willing to pull that kind of

207
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:13.984
trick.

208
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.880
And if you can persuade people and it's actually the case that there are people

209
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:23.440
you're holding back, that you can make enormous inroads like that.

210
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.741
<v 2>Well,</v>

211
00:12:23.741 --> 00:12:26.650
especially when there's actual evidence that people have been murdered and have

212
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:27.730
been absolutely.

213
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.560
One of the more fascinating things about Charlie Hebdo to me was the refusal of

214
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:37.240
any of the mainstream media to show any of the cartoons you had to go online.

215
00:12:37.241 --> 00:12:38.590
And I felt like this was a,

216
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.280
they gave up the reins of information to the internet and it was,

217
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.100
it was a real transitionary moment in our culture.

218
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.560
<v 1>Yes. Everyone went online to see what they, yeah.</v>

219
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:48.420
<v 2>That was the only thing.</v>

220
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.580
<v 1>Place to go apart from your parents. You know, I mean,</v>

221
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.200
like they were still under the impression that these must be, you know,

222
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:55.810
incredibly pornographic cartoons that were really,

223
00:12:55.811 --> 00:12:58.480
really viciously attacking somebody. Um,

224
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.170
but no most B anyone young can, uh,

225
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:04.680
could find this out for themselves and you're right. That they,

226
00:13:04.681 --> 00:13:08.470
they gave up the, uh, the space to the net and they, they all, they all had,

227
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.220
again, these sort of rubbishy arguments of their own about it.

228
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:16.900
I tried in Britain to, uh, get the press to do it at one go,

229
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:21.520
uh, um, a couple of days after the massacre and, um,

230
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:26.860
got pretty close, uh, that if everyone's that sort of,

231
00:13:26.861 --> 00:13:31.480
I am Spartacus tactic. If everyone did it at once, then it would be okay,

232
00:13:31.481 --> 00:13:36.250
but it would make it easier. And the argument you always get about that is,

233
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.260
and it's a very persuasive argument is that the editor of the ma of the magazine

234
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:44.110
or newspaper might get protection. So,

235
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.140
but you know, a girl from the typing pool sort of thing, and,

236
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.620
uh, which is what happened actually in some of the standing versus killings and

237
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:54.640
stabbings and things, you know,

238
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.000
like the Norwegian translate as Japanese translate, you know, it's,

239
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.680
it's people who under no security protocol could possibly end up or getting

240
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:04.540
protected. Uh, and,

241
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:09.460
and on the basis of fearing that the boss almost always says,

242
00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:09.670
no,
