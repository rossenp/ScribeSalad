00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.680
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It has grown though. Oh my God. It's crazy. Right.</v>

2
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:09.920
It's changing, you know, people talk about it too much. I mean, I've lived in,

3
00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.840
uh, uh, my, my wife, Tina and I, we got married in, uh, in may. Uh,

4
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:19.760
we bought a house together, uh, Southeast Austin, but we were living downtown,

5
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.390
uh, right downtown.

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.630
I had a place there and then we moved into an apartment together and we just saw

7
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:28.270
it happening. It really started with the, with the scooters.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.510
That's really what started to mess up Austin. Um, you know,

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.590
cause they just overnight, it's like, what the is this?

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.550
And just they're everywhere. And you, I mean,

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.820
Austin's already been trying to create a bike vibe with,

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.340
uh, bike paths and you know, just all this stuff, which is ludicrous. And I,

13
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.780
I grew up riding bicycles and uh,

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.420
it takes maybe 50 years before everyone is accustomed to

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.100
bicycle traffic. You know, it's not just something that's built in.

16
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.700
I turn right around the corner. I still look, look at my right mirror.

17
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.170
I look there the make sure there's not a bike next to me. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

18
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.250
it's just built in though. People don't do that.

19
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:10.250
So people are always getting hit and then these scooters pop up and it's just

20
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.330
mayhem, you know, on the everywhere. They're on the sidewalks.

21
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:17.370
They're mowing people down. People are, you know, it's nuts. They go fast too.

22
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.970
You just, they go very fast. They go very fast. He's got a souped up one.

23
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:25.240
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; how fast does that pitch go? Like 50, 25. Oh, not a.

24
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.160
Hey 50 is ones go 50. Oh yeah. Scooters. Oh, I've seen him jacked up doing 50.

25
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.600
Oh my sure thing. If you wipe you're dead. Yeah. Well there there's that. Yeah.

26
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.840
You're going down at fi he's but 25 is already pretty fast. He flies. Yeah.

27
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.480
Cause I think most of 'em do about 15, 15, 17 miles is juicy.

28
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.350
But what I noticed is because, um,

29
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.110
all the Silicon valley companies are opening up offices in Texas.

30
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.790
A lot of 'em in Austin mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and that's where they put the, the,

31
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.870
the human resource heavy, uh, stuff. So, um,

32
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.790
not the top programmers. This is help desk. This is, um,

33
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.380
the people who review the U YouTube videos. So, you know,

34
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:07.180
they're already kind of whacked cause they're watching nothing but death and

35
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:09.980
destruction and up all day long. They,

36
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:11.940
they don't really have a connection to the city.

37
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:14.700
They're kinda like I'm here for a couple years and I'll go move somewhere else.

38
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.140
So they don't care and they're on the scooters, right?

39
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.500
So they don't really care about the city about the whole vibe,

40
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.300
like whatever,

41
00:02:22.301 --> 00:02:27.290
get up and drive and that's become increasingly more. Um,

42
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.210
Austin has some other problems. Um, now we're, we're kind of following what,

43
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.810
uh, what California, where San Francisco, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle,

44
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.970
you know, we're following the, let people camp everywhere thing.

45
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.970
So that's become a real problem. And it's crazy here, you know,

46
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.240
is based upon it all comes from, uh, uh, a lawsuit in Boise, Idaho.

47
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.640
And that's where this started, where, um,

48
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.600
and the first went through the fifth circuit and then the ninth circuit court,

49
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.480
there was an appeal that said you cannot, um,

50
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.880
move people who are camping without having a suitable place for them to stay,

51
00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:03.880
that you can offer them.

52
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.520
Because then it is a violation of the eighth amendment under cruel and unusual

53
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.960
punishment. That's why, and that's what Austin said. Well, until that's solved,

54
00:03:12.961 --> 00:03:17.000
it's cruel and unusual punishment to move someone who's homeless or not move

55
00:03:17.001 --> 00:03:21.550
someone who's camping. If you can't offer them adequate, um,

56
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:22.384
housing.

57
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.910
<v 1>So these people are just camping on sidewalks there, just like they do here.</v>

58
00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:27.390
Is that the underpasses, uh.

59
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.630
<v 0>Medias. Oh, the underpasses. Yeah. It's crazy.</v>

60
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.710
And so it's this weird legal situation. Yeah. This really started, um,

61
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.180
well they, they lifted the camp. The no camping bed lifted it.

62
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:42.300
So it was not a problem. Then they said, well, we're gonna let anyone camp.

63
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.300
And it went nuts. And all of a sudden downtown was just filled with people,

64
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.340
laying, camping everywhere. Then they went ohoh, this is not gonna work.

65
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.980
Mayor Adler, uh, and city council. So, uh, okay.

66
00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:59.810
We'll ban in the, just in downtown, which is pretty much with mayor lives.

67
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.690
You know, the w hotel, it's the, you, can't no camping in front of city hall,

68
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.210
but we have a, we're a university town. So you've got UT and it's just,

69
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.010
there's this whole, you know, like half of a, a,

70
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.810
like a semicircle of camping and just mayhem right on the,

71
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.880
on the outskirts of the campus. And you know, kids are afraid, you know,

72
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.400
like now they're getting, they're getting harassed. We have squeegee guys. Dude.

73
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.720
I, I drove into New York every single day from Jersey in, in 89 90.

74
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.240
And you know, the squeegee guys were a huge problem. And then they were gone.

75
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.600
I think Giuliani like threw 'em in the east river or something, but,

76
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:40.040
and now they're back in New York. It's like, this is not, not a good thing.

77
00:04:40.041 --> 00:04:40.570
Yeah. How do.

78
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.390
<v 1>Do you fix that though? The people are worried about the cruelty in fixing it.</v>

79
00:04:44.391 --> 00:04:48.830
Oh, there you go. You know, that's the problem. It's like you, it's a,

80
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.990
you, you have, you almost have to be cruel to stop that. No, no.

81
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.510
How do you stop? Well, you have to, engineer's sort of a.

82
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.990
<v 0>What are we talking about? Not everyone who is, um,</v>

83
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.980
squeegeeing and loitering and, uh, and soliciting is homeless, right? Or,

84
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.060
you know, it's not necessarily something that they didn't choose.

85
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.740
A lot of people choose a Vagrant lifestyle. There's tons of it,

86
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.140
particularly in warmer climates like here.

87
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.940
And I do a lot for the homeless problem in Austin, as much as I can.

88
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.140
And none of it is sanctioned by the city. They're morons.

89
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:23.730
You know's a we'll build affordable housing. We'll,

90
00:05:23.731 --> 00:05:26.730
we'll get a hotel and we'll turn that into. It's like, oh, a slum hotel. Okay,

91
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:27.564
great.

92
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.130
The number one reason people become homeless is catastrophic loss of family.

93
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.610
That's the number one reason someone dies, you know this,

94
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.330
and then it just it's downhill from there. And before you know,

95
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.970
it you're out on the street, it's very difficult to.

96
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.880
<v 1>Rebound from that.</v>

97
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.760
<v 0>Kind of thing. And so people need community. Everybody needs community.</v>

98
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.120
So where do they find the community under the bridge?

99
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.960
That's where the community is. And the community is transactional. It's drugs,

100
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.560
you know, it's, you know, whatever you, that's a community.

101
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:01.800
It's not a healthy one, but it's a community. There's actually a, um,

102
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.920
a great project in Austin called, uh, mobile loaves and fishes,

103
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.800
a community first village mm-hmm,

104
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.400
&lt;affirmative&gt; started by this guy who was in construction.

105
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.920
And he just put down a whole bunch of tiny homes and people who are,

106
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:17.950
if you're homeless, you can go there. You can live in a tiny home,

107
00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:22.390
but you rent it. And, um, there are some, you know, some prerequisites,

108
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:23.470
but you don't have to be, you know,

109
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:25.750
necessarily drug free because it's your home.

110
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:26.990
So you can do whatever you want in your home,

111
00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.270
but it's like $200 or $250 a month. Most people, if they do the paperwork,

112
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.750
they can get a social security or disability, which will cover that.

113
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.500
They still have to, you know,

114
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:41.540
either work there in the community garden to feed themselves,

115
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.900
they have different, you know, like a auto detailing,

116
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.220
got all this different stuff. Um, but there's no policing. It's not, you know,

117
00:06:47.221 --> 00:06:50.260
there's this, I think there's 500 people there now. Um,

118
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.300
and it's working out fantastically. Oh, that's cool. Um, you know,

119
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.300
cuz they have community now.

120
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.020
<v 1>That, and outside the box solution totally.</v>

121
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.130
<v 0>Totally gets no money from the city because there's a religious aspect to it.</v>

122
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:02.970
You know, there's a, a ministry part, so, oh, oh,

123
00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:07.010
we can't give money to that because you know, God nuts or whatever it is. Um,

124
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.530
but it's really working extremely well.

125
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.490
<v 1>That's great when someone comes up with something. Yeah. You know, I.</v>

126
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.930
<v 0>Don't, I mean, people should look at this. Alan Graham is a Saint. What,</v>

127
00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:19.920
what he did and he lives there. He, he lives in a, in a, in a small, you know,

128
00:07:19.921 --> 00:07:23.640
small home on premises. Really. Yeah. And if you go there, he'll be happy to,

129
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:27.200
to show you around and you got all kinds of cool stuff, but just,

130
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:31.240
just people are living together. He says, so if Joe walks out in the morning,

131
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.080
not you Joe, but the other Joe and he is got his, his, his Dick hanging out.

132
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:38.200
And he is like, uh, instead of the neighbors calling the cops,

133
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.510
&lt;affirmative&gt; the neighbors, Hey Joe, what's going on, man.

134
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:43.790
Let's sit down for a second. Let's have a coffee, let's see what's going on,

135
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.750
pull your pants up, you know, let's uh, and a community, right.

136
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.830
Community first village. That's, that's the answer.

137
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.590
But that's not the answer that you hear from your local city council or your

138
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.270
mayors. It's always, well, we don't have a affordable housing, eh.

139
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.060
<v 1>For housing, not gonna fix everything. It's also,</v>

140
00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:03.500
there's a lot of mental illness. That's a, a giant part. Well, well.

141
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.460
<v 0>Of course drug addiction,</v>

142
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.380
but there's a lot of people with mental illness who have houses. Right.

143
00:08:07.381 --> 00:08:08.820
You know, it's, it's true. Um,

144
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.980
definitely it's mental illness and drug addiction,

145
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.420
but it really starts with catastrophic loss of family.

146
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:18.860
That's the number one reason people become unhoused out.

147
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.490
<v 1>Here. It's this shift was Jamie,</v>

148
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.450
what would you say about four or five years ago?

149
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.050
It really started kicking in somewhere around then. Yeah.

150
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.970
Somewhere around four or five years ago.

151
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.890
You just started noticing like villages of tents under underpasses. Yeah.

152
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.250
And then, uh, I,

153
00:08:33.251 --> 00:08:36.730
we used to do fear factor in downtown LA like right down the street from skid

154
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:37.291
row. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

155
00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:42.040
which is an extraordinary place in if you've never seen skid row and you drive

156
00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:43.960
by, you go, what mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; this is real,

157
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.480
like this is downtown Los Angeles and you you're inside which.

158
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.800
<v 0>Which, which they turned beautiful by the way. I mean the really, you know,</v>

159
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.360
downtown LA became really nice. Some parts of it. Yeah. Great, great,

160
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.200
great infrastructure and everything, but then.

161
00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 1>Restaurants and cool, really cool apartment buildings and stuff.</v>

162
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.440
It's an interesting spot, but then there's also skid row. Yeah. Which is just,

163
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.520
you can't believe the staggering numbers of people that are just camped out.

164
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.800
Yeah. Thousands and thousands and thousands. Just a mass,

165
00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:13.960
like people coming out of a stadium to see a.

166
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.150
<v 0>Game I Corolla said, uh, uh, said it really well, um,</v>

167
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.910
forget where I saw him. Um, he said, it's like, no one wants to be the bad guy.

168
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.590
No one, no one wants say, okay, this has to stop.

169
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.950
We gotta do something about this.

170
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.230
And it starts with stopping whatever you're doing. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um,

171
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.190
and that's a part of cancel culture. Yeah. People are afraid, you know,

172
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:37.500
because it, an culture is real. If you have something to lose,

173
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.260
like you have nothing to lose. I have nothing to lose. They can, your,

174
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.100
your bullet proof to a degree I'm Bulletproof, you can cancel all you want.

175
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:47.740
You're not taking away from me. No advertisers. I don't have them. You know,

176
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.180
only the people who listen can stop listening.
