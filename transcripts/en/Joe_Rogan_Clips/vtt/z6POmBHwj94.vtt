00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So here we are about to see, uh, Josie, Aldo,</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.600
and a Yon.

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.330
Now what's interesting about this fight is people think of all though,

4
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:12.360
as being done, some people do,

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.220
but although it was only 33, make sure that's correct.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.310
Either 32 or 33, he might be 32.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.950
Like he's not old,

8
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.740
but he burst onto the scene when 33 that's crazy, man.

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.420
I mean, he's as prime, all those in his prime and in my opinion,

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:37.980
he beat Marlon Mariah's. He lost a decision. The UFC agrees with that opinion,

11
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:42.630
which is why he's fighting pewter Yon for the title and not Marlon Moraes.

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.640
That's a very rare time where someone loses a fight and then gets a fight for

13
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:52.410
the title. And everybody agrees. And this is where it's at right now. I mean,

14
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.160
people, people saw that fight and they're like, yeah, I think he,

15
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.350
I think you want, let them fight for the title. And so as soon as Henry,

16
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.030
so Hutto stepped down Henry. So Huda's trying to fight that Ryan Garcia guy,

17
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:09.870
that boxer no is Ryan Garcia is like,

18
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.820
he's the latest, really popular up and coming young boxer.

19
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:19.170
He's ridiculously fast. No, no, no, no lightweight.

20
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.300
1 35. He's got a car. You got the

21
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.840
stomach here. Is that Logan Paul, Jake, Paul, let me see it.

22
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.580
Oh my God. He hit him right in the solar plexus.

23
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.020
And God has been doing it my way. He let him go punch him or excuse me in Ghana.

24
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:46.550
Let him punch him with a, a body shield on. And he got, he didn't even feel it.

25
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.330
But then in Ghana started letting big people punch him with nobody shield.

26
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.860
Thank God. It was so big, man. He's scary as hell.

27
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:59.780
He's the scariest guy of all time in terms of like overall physical

28
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.330
danger that you're in. Whenever he swinging there is no,

29
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.330
one's scary that in Ghana, I'll never forget being there when he knocked, uh,

30
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.160
Alistair. Overeem yeah, that was insane.

31
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.850
You should have been there for the last one. W why is that swinging? Jamie?

32
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.820
What happened? We have ghosts in here. No, it's just loose.

33
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.460
I had it barely hanging on the, um, the last one, when he knocked out John Xeno,

34
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.710
Rosen strike, there was no one in the audience.

35
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.220
So it was one of those apex fights. So, uh,

36
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.170
and they did it right in front of us.

37
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:34.910
Like he charged him and just hit him with this left hook and then Rosen

38
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.480
strike drops. And then he pounds them out while he's he was already out cold.

39
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.900
And he hits him with these two big bombs. So you hear them? I mean,

40
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.040
both of them are 2 65 and they just collided was there out.

41
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.150
So it's Jody just see him. Yeah. I, I love that.

42
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.090
That was present. I brought in what is,

43
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.970
what is outsourced send sent me an email. They went through, uh,

44
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.410
they were moving a house.

45
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.440
They ripped up the carpet and underneath they found the plank. What does it say?

46
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.410
So they took, oh, quick. I was ready to drop a loon,

47
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.710
you know, meet Jamie. Oh, rude. I'm like,

48
00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:17.190
I don't understand what's going on here. I just looked over. He was sniffing.

49
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:18.024
What was ever,

50
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.290
you were already on like second base with the quail roots over there. Yeah.

51
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.530
I never know. I know he has like scientists. Come on.

52
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.480
Maybe some guys brought him a old way loop. I wouldn't take him through those.

53
00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:35.100
You would have to drive a male. [inaudible]

54
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.610
I'm really happy to drive you home. Oh, I will eat whatever you want.

55
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:41.640
I'll drive you home. I would have eaten to lose. Leave your car in the garage.

56
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.050
We'll have your car parked in the wall. Um, so here's the thing about Aldo too.

57
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.400
I'll tell you. It's a struggle to make 75 or excuse me, to make 45.

58
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.870
Cause he used to walk around like 170 pounds. He was big and um,

59
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.040
he just really had a hard time, many times making the weight and suffered.

60
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.700
But then when he went down to 1 35,

61
00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.850
he got a nutritionist for the first time in his career.

62
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.910
And now he has zero problem getting to 1 35,

63
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.660
his cut to 1 35 is way easier than it's cut to 45. He said,

64
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.040
which is crazy when she levels the same tremendous.

65
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.940
His last fight with Marlin. Mariah was just attacking the entire time.

66
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.590
Just running him down at attacking.

67
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.750
This is the way you should have been at his whole career.

68
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.030
He should have been at 1 35, his whole career.

69
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.290
And he can win a belt here for the first time since Connor knocked him out. Huh?

70
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.540
Oh yes. Well, he won a belt.

71
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.350
He won the interim featherweight title, um,

72
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.970
after Connor and he lost it to max Holloway. I think that's true. Right?

73
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.100
99% positive. That's true. I think he, he beat,

74
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.220
I forget who he beat, but he knocked out, um,

75
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.290
Jeremy Stevens, he knocked out hen natto, Moya Kano,

76
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.280
and both of those guys are big, powerful 40 fibers.

77
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.940
And he just decided to try to fight at 35.

78
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.980
And he looked better at 35 than ever.

79
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.990
Like a lot of times when a guy later in his career,

80
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.650
when they cut weight sort of a last ditch effort and you start thinking, man,

81
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.060
this guy's in trouble.

82
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.600
This guy's got that Chernobyl power behind him right here,

83
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.720
born at down the river. How dare you? Nuclear power.

84
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.330
Pretty sure he trains in Thailand. I think he's a, uh, uh,

85
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.320
poo cat top team guy. I want to do that.

86
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:34.560
One day was, uh, I had Hannibal on the other day.

87
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.950
Hannibal is such an interesting guy. And one of the things he did,

88
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.240
he took a whole month off by himself and just went to Thailand and train only

89
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.440
Thai, not even like doesn't even have experience in it.

90
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.070
It's not like did his whole life. He always wanted to be a tie boxer.

91
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:54.480
I thought it'd be fun to train and live in Thailand for a month. Nope.

92
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.060
Just decided to go, went to Thailand, train there.

93
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.890
And I just happened to be in Thailand at the same time with my family.

94
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.340
So he came up from, I think he was in Bangkok.

95
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.280
He came up to Chiang Mai where we were at and hung out with us.

96
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.780
We had dinner and shot the shadows or what are you doing out here, man?

97
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.500
He's like, I'm training boy, Ty. He's an interesting guy.

98
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.700
You know what he's doing now? He's going to Ghana. It's going to live in Ghana.

99
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.410
I go for how long?

100
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.090
Because I don't know a few months it's gonna up and live. And I mean,

101
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.680
no wife, no kids do whatever the he wants. He has real estate.

102
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.120
He's made investments has got money. That's great. It's great.

103
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.200
It's it's exciting. Uh, I like when someone lives like that, he's like, it.

104
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.810
I'm going to live in Ghana. There's a reason why he picked Ghana.

105
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.550
He's from Ghana, his, his,

106
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.270
he did his ancestry test and his on his father's side. Um,

107
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.110
a lot of it's from Ghana and you know, he felt like, Hey man,

108
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.300
what a great way to get material in? What a great experience.

109
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.620
Just a little life experience to go there and live there. But also, I mean,

110
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:07.100
imagine how much material he's going to get living in Africa for three months.

111
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.520
So gala Africa, not where Jim Jones. That's Guyana.

112
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.070
That's south America. Yeah. That's south America. Yeah.

113
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.420
You don't want to go down there. That place is probably still, you know,

114
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.180
from that until the bad,

115
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.640
bad voodoo in the air from that you ever watch that documentary and watch

116
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:29.440
it. I loved it. Remember I was a kid,

117
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.610
like I went to my mother's bar and they had the congressmen.

118
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.900
They had the whole thing and watched it. And then years later, you know,

119
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.750
you read it, you know, Hollywood, whatever,

120
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.600
to this day they said don't drink the Kool-Aid don't drink the Kool. Yeah.

121
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.741
Meanwhile, do you know?

122
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:49.540
It wasn't even Kool-Aid it was like a cheaper version of a, of like,

123
00:07:49.541 --> 00:07:53.260
you know, some punch mix, maybe a little cooler too.

124
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.470
Maybe they did have something. Okay. He was doing drill test.

125
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.460
He was making him do before I just watched something recently during the

126
00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:00.880
quarter. Yeah.

127
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.850
That's the scary part of that documentary to me where those morning

128
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.790
announcements he'd make on the PA system.

129
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:09.100
He used to say whatever creepy he was shooting.

130
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.040
I wasn't sleeping days.

131
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.380
He was a meth addict back in the seventies that strong greener on an

132
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:17.891
island.

133
00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.330
Like the hell's angels sold that that came in chunk Diana's on an island.

134
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.880
Oh, it's fine. No, no. Where he was, where was this? In south America.

135
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.880
And it's just it's it's the country. It's part of something.

136
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.500
I don't think Guyana is an island.

137
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:36.700
I'm 99% sure that Guyana an island.

138
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.340
I think it's just a, it's a country in south America where he set up his cult.

139
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.920
I think they felt like they were being persecuted in the United States,

140
00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:48.430
which they always are because it's always the same story.

141
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.600
One guy winds up stealing all the money. everybody's woman. What is it? Yeah.

142
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:57.300
It's just a part of a south America. You went in San Francisco as a child.

143
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's crazy. Yeah.

144
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:07.140
I remember it being in the news. John, I remember in Jonestown was when I got,

145
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.250
I remember Waco way more than that. Waco was not,

146
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.700
but Waco was the first one looking at all those dead people, man.

147
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.410
Isn't that crazy? Oh, that's what's so crazy. They're all just lying.

148
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:19.423
They're poisoned.

149
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.640
So scan that poison doesn't work as good as everybody thinks it. It does. Oh no.

150
00:09:25.641 --> 00:09:29.540
It takes a little time. Yeah. And. It's pure poison.

151
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.640
Ooh. Ooh. This is a fight.

152
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.650
This is a great fight.

153
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.360
Cause this is like the big test for yawn and for all dope, man,

154
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.400
you want to talk about dudes been around the block.

155
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.170
You can't fight a more experienced guy in world-class competition than Josie

156
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.170
Aldo. He's about as experienced as they get.

157
00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.100
What's interesting about all though, is he was the best kicker.

158
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.950
Like he would vest like people's legs. He almost never kicks anymore.

159
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:06.290
Almost never kicks. Now he just concentrates almost entirely on his boxing.

160
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.220
If you watch him find out, it's very rare that he throws a kick. Very rare.

161
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.590
It used to be like you would shop with those leg kicks, man. I mean,

162
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:19.100
it was like the most important part of his game because he would hit you with

163
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.020
one. Like when he fought Uriah favor,

164
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.890
I mean he hit your Uriah favorite with the first leg kick and Uriah was done.

165
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.870
It was just a matter of time. And now, although very rarely throws kicks.

166
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:34.970
And I really want to ask, get someone like a translator and ask him why,

167
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.370
but I don't want to tell anybody, you know, I'll tell them like,

168
00:10:40.371 --> 00:10:44.090
just tell me and I won't tell anybody. I just want it. I mean, is it an injury?

169
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.900
Like what is it? Cause it might be, it might be like his knees up.

170
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:51.800
He can't kick anymore. Cause all these guys, you know,

171
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.220
he's been in the sport forever. And then before that he was, uh,

172
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.720
he was a high level, Brazilian jujitsu, black belt been training forever. Right?

173
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.950
He's got to have some serious, serious injuries. He played soccer. Yeah.

174
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.470
Soccer guys all have up knees.

175
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:09.560
Soccer is like one of the best ways to tear your ACL.

176
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.810
Those guys tear their ACL holes like, oh.

177
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.670
Y'all just hit him with a big right hand.

178
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.490
The thing about this at this weight class though. Oh,

179
00:11:16.491 --> 00:11:21.290
there's a kick at this weight class. Although is so durable.

180
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:26.330
He's so strong because he's used to fighting those 40 fibers. Oh.

181
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.730
He got cracked. Oh my God. Yon is so sharp.

182
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.020
But look, although can take it at 35.

183
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.760
Cause he's used to getting hit with like Connor, big, 40 fibers. You know,

184
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.020
he's used to getting hit with, you know, [inaudible] went up to lightweight.

185
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.400
The guy's got a scar on his face. Joe. He's used to getting something. Yeah.

186
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:53.530
You think he fell on a barbecue grill when he was a kid? Oh again.

187
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.730
He's back to kick in dude. He can only take so many of those.

188
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.930
Oh this is heating up quick. Oh my goodness.

189
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.920
This is good. Right away. Yon switches,

190
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:12.460
stances. He's very clever. He's setting up traps.

191
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.060
He also doesn't want that left leg out front because if all though keeps kicking

192
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:20.710
at it, you know,

193
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:24.370
everybody was always wondering like when all those gonna return with his leg

194
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:28.180
kicks because they were the thing that everybody avoided forever.

195
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.371
And you see, look,

196
00:12:30.371 --> 00:12:34.180
he throws to with this fight and both of them spin yarn around

197
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.100
those guys that come from that soccer background, man.

198
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:44.050
They can kick the amount of leg strength you have. And like you're,

199
00:12:44.051 --> 00:12:47.050
you're used to whipping your legs around. Oh, we looked for one there.

200
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.580
He almost spun himself around him.

201
00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.420
Oh. Yon goes up high sneaky. Well,

202
00:12:57.421 --> 00:13:01.310
although got hit with a high switch kick right now and Mariah's in,

203
00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:02.940
in their fight in the first round,

204
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.950
Mariah's throws that he throws his a really sneaky, left switch,

205
00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:12.390
kick to the head. It's like a whip, another kick by Aldo. I like it.

206
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.560
Although back to kick-in landing that straight left too.

207
00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.640
Hmm. Throwing a lot of kicks. I like it. That's that that's a lot to me.

208
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:30.030
That means a lot because that means he's got all the weapons.

209
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.260
Cause when he's just tracking guys down and try to throw bombs on them with the

210
00:13:34.261 --> 00:13:38.610
punches, I feel like it's just not the same guy.

211
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.030
It's not as versatile. You don't have as many things to think about.

212
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.090
Like when he was in the WEC, he uh,

213
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.040
opened up in this fight with Cub Swanson,

214
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:51.660
with a flying knee and knocked him out.

215
00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:56.220
And the first few seconds of the fight was wild. There he goes again. See,

216
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.200
he's spinning him around with that kick. When all dog kicks your legs, man,

217
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.810
it takes a lot of movement away.

218
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.880
It a lot of things up in fighters because they have to think about that now.

219
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.610
And this is only the first round.

220
00:14:11.611 --> 00:14:13.770
This is a five rounder because it's a title fight.

221
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.170
All those keeps chopping at that leg. And I hope he does. Ooh.

222
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.000
Yarn with a big kick to the body. Oh, I'll do with the shot. Look at that trip.

223
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.830
Get some down. Oh,

224
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:33.690
big shot by Yon. Oh my goodness.

225
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.040
Let's see Dawn. What's that ref doing? Oh. Oh. Look at that.

226
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.660
Yon is mean he's mean he doesn't want uh, uh,

227
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:46.620
although with his fingers inside the gloves, that's what's going on.

228
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.310
You you're not allowed to. Oh, he got hit with a big shot there. Oh, he's hurt.

229
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.850
He's hurt. Real the body. Real bad.

230
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.610
Real bad to the body. He just break his sternum. No,

231
00:14:58.611 --> 00:15:01.940
he got hit with a liver shot, man. He can't get up right now. He can't get up.

232
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.880
He's got to kind of take this yawns him up, man. Wow.

233
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.040
That's the end of the round. He got hurt real bad with a body shot. Real bad.

234
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.500
See that redness around the right side of his body. That's where your liver is.

235
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.210
You could see when he got hit, he covered up and winced.

236
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.000
I hope they show that in the replay. Yeah. Looked higher up to me,

237
00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:28.870
but maybe I just missed it. No, I went, he hit him right in the body.

238
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.540
Okay. You know Joe, whether he's 32 or 33, he's gone through some wars.

239
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.050
He's definitely gone through some wars, but was, it was interesting.

240
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:43.030
It's all through that. Right-hand boom. It was a, his movement. Look at that.

241
00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:44.320
Spun around with that low kick.

242
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.680
It was his movement like hyper come to the body and the left hook,

243
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:52.810
his movement that caused that wound up being on his back. See, this is the end,

244
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.880
but this is not what caused the body shot. I want to see the bodies.

245
00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.990
So look at these big bombs getting hit with though.

246
00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.890
My God Yon is hitting them with some big shots.

247
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.190
They didn't show the body shot on the ground. Yeah. Unfortunately,

248
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.160
but now Yon is fired up coming into the second round.

249
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.920
But it was all though trying to take him down that, that up for him.

250
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:21.310
All right. Let's see what happens now.

251
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.600
Okay. Both guys assuming like a Muay Thai stance. Look at that. Yeah.

252
00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.510
John's getting that left leg up so it doesn't get kicked.

253
00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.550
Well that's Thai style, you know, that's uh, that light front leg.

254
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.540
It's also, you could throw a teat from there. Throw that inside leg kick.

255
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.420
He's ready to chat. They're both doing that. So they're both,

256
00:16:43.421 --> 00:16:44.710
they're both Thai style, right? No.

257
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.270
Oh, kicked him with it already.

258
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.720
Just a few of those man and your legs Ville and all those already hit him.

259
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.370
Oh two in a row. All those starting to light it up. I'll see stances.

260
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.590
And then he goes to the botch. Oh. Oh.

261
00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.930
Oh see, that's what I saw too. It looked high up.

262
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.970
What looked high up that punch Stephen Thompson just tweeted that he thinks

263
00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:24.970
josé's uh, rib is broken. Might've been too. It was way up there.

264
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:26.740
And he grabbed his chest like that.

265
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.420
It looked horribly painful to get a guy to grab his chest or a rib or

266
00:17:31.421 --> 00:17:34.360
something is where your liver is. See where my hand is. Yeah.

267
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.100
And your liver is big. You, liver is a big target. It's like quite a large,

268
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.550
large patch that you could really someone up. And when you get hit there,

269
00:17:42.551 --> 00:17:44.920
it's the weirdest feeling, man. Everything goes like this

270
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:51.360
freezes and some can suck it up and make it look like nothing.

271
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.640
But most of the time when you get hit there, your body just kind of seizes up.

272
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:03.140
It's very rare that a guy can play that off. Oh,

273
00:18:03.141 --> 00:18:06.680
I'll they'll just hit him with a liver shot. Woo.

274
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.900
Although hit him with a good left hand deliver there.

275
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.570
He switched stances again, left, laid forward, and then immediately chops at it.

276
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:16.850
Dan, this is like the Aldo of old.

277
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:26.630
Oh good. Right-hand to the body by Yon, Tim, this fight is good. Oh, he's,

278
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.880
he's kicking it up in the air every time that leg. Oh,

279
00:18:31.881 --> 00:18:35.810
now he's attaching the inside of the right leg. Yawns leg is in trouble.

280
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.710
That left leg is in real trouble already. Oh, look at that. He kicks out.

281
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.070
Oh, front leg side. Kick to the thigh.

282
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.510
Yon is really strong. Like you can see it when he,

283
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.260
when he clinches up with dudes, he's just one of those guys is very,

284
00:18:51.261 --> 00:18:52.520
very physically strong

285
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.050
and he's mean, you know,

286
00:18:57.051 --> 00:19:00.710
there's like extra meanness that some guys have and John's got that.

287
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:14.750
this is good. Okay. Russians are wild, man.

288
00:19:14.751 --> 00:19:17.210
I just watched this all over stone interview thing.

289
00:19:17.211 --> 00:19:20.030
You ever see that on Showtime Oliver, stone interviews, Putin.

290
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.000
No five part series.

291
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:28.100
I stumbled across it because I watched another crazy documentary on Showtime.

292
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.320
Oh God. What's their new one called where the,

293
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.230
about the kid that gets a it's brand new. It's crazy.

294
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.730
It's about a high school football player that gets accused of

295
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.470
being a pedophile of sexually abusing a child.

296
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:47.270
And it turns out he was completely wrongfully convicted. Oh no.

297
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.750
Yup.

298
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.890
For years he was in prison while the other guy went on to do it to more people.

299
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.120
Yup. The outcry outcry. It was unreal.

300
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.960
What happens to a guy like that? They have to pay him. And if,

301
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.780
how much did he pay the guy? Yeah. How much can you pay him?

302
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.670
I remember if they even give out the actual payment, but I mean, w you,

303
00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.600
you changed his life. Oh yeah. There's no number you could ever put on that.

304
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.500
Right. Did someone lie on the witness stand? Like what?

305
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.360
Why did they convict him so crazy? Don't tell me.

306
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.180
Okay. I'll watch it. Yeah. It's well worth not knowing this.

307
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.520
The most kicks I've ever seen all though, throw in recent years.

308
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.230
Look at that. He goes, hi. Oh. He you on up. John's in trouble.

309
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.100
John's in trouble here. Hurt him there. With that combination,

310
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.120
the kick to the body.

311
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.350
Look at that left hook to the body, man. It's only recently.

312
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.490
He's only recently filed a lawsuit. So, oh,

313
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.150
only recently he hasn't been paid yet. Yeah. Oh, poor guy.

314
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.980
Imagine you have to get a job after that. Their whole,

315
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.510
have you been in jail for you? Not only that, but it was pretty,

316
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.590
he had a full scholarship for football and he was bad-ass football player,

317
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.270
full scholarship. And he,

318
00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.860
his plan was to be in the NFL and he probably would have been able to do it when

319
00:21:09.861 --> 00:21:13.070
they show you the clips of him as a Texas high school football player.

320
00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:17.540
And he's just a star athlete, collapsing, crushing quarterbacks.

321
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.300
And how old is he now? Ah, man,

322
00:21:20.301 --> 00:21:24.830
I think he spent three or four years in prison. Right? Something like that.

323
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.760
At least two. And he had to sign up, you know, they have,

324
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.570
they do the whole thing liver right to the liver. I missed it.

325
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.650
It was a hundred percent of the liver. Yeah. They just showed it.

326
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.430
This is um,

327
00:21:42.290 --> 00:21:46.360
I can't imagine being wrongly accused,

328
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.450
thrown in jail. Well, you know what?

329
00:21:50.451 --> 00:21:53.210
It happens a lot guys. Yeah. It happens a lot.

330
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:58.370
Especially when you have a public defender's office ambling

331
00:21:58.371 --> 00:22:03.200
that because the case is so overloaded, they just cut deals.

332
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:08.440
They just cut deals. You're basically a piece of meat. Right? And you,

333
00:22:08.441 --> 00:22:12.380
you imagine if you're a public defender and guys are lying to you all the time

334
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.300
and you don't know who's innocent and who's not,

335
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:16.520
everybody's saying there's no budget. There's no,

336
00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:21.450
I don't have a budget to hire an investigator to go talk to the people was at

337
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.480
night when you're, uh, you know,

338
00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:27.800
there's so many different obstacles you have, you know,

339
00:22:27.801 --> 00:22:32.540
when I got sentenced, I got sentenced with an attorney. You know,

340
00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:36.890
it was a big difference than going in there with a public defendant to big

341
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.330
difference in not paying that guy has got 80 people. He's got to take care of.

342
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.550
He's just in business, a cotton cotton, you out of, uh, oh,

343
00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.170
cutting the deal. Two big shots of the body from all dough.

344
00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.940
Although it looks good. We're in the third here.

345
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.490
He had that one moment in the first where Yon hit him with that big body shot.

346
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:03.500
Oh, without dough.

347
00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.100
And Yon is forced to switch stances, yawns fight in south pond.

348
00:23:10.101 --> 00:23:13.010
Now because all those guys, his left leg all up,

349
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:17.600
he's got two more rounds to work on that right leg. He's in there.

350
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.210
Now he's throwing kicks with the, uh, left leg,

351
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.170
but he's going to try to chop out that, that right leg as well. Oh,

352
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:28.580
good shot with the left leg.

353
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.200
This is a good fight, man. This is a very good fight.

354
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.980
And this is the first time Jaan um, has had to fight five rounds in the UFC.

355
00:23:42.981 --> 00:23:46.100
If I, if I'm correct, all those done it. Many times

356
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.460
it's been at least scheduled for multiple, multiple five round fights.

357
00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.930
All of his championship fights. I mean,

358
00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:57.310
think about how many fights this guys fought and went five round fights went.

359
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.210
Oh, good shot to the body by Aldo back when he wasn't cutting weight correctly

360
00:24:01.211 --> 00:24:04.930
either. Oh. Although it looks good.

361
00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.270
Oh, nasty left to the liver. Digging to that. Liver is in trouble.

362
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.590
Yon is in trouble. Oh, look at that.

363
00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:16.120
Yarn comes back with the left kick.

364
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.510
His left leg is chewed up and now he's just using it as a weapon.

365
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.730
Oh wow. Oh my God.

366
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:29.980
This is although of old kid. Oh to the body.

367
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:34.120
God. Oh my God. He heard him with that left hook to the body.

368
00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.340
And now Yon is standing Orthodox again.

369
00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:43.270
He's hit a nerve. Tremendous look at that left leg. Look at yawns,

370
00:24:43.271 --> 00:24:47.440
left calf cl red. It is and swollen. Look at it. When, when they'll show it,

371
00:24:47.441 --> 00:24:52.270
if they give you a side angle, look at his left calf. It's up, man. It's up

372
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.540
all though. Just needs a couple of shots on that. Ooh.

373
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.380
See now y'all oh, we hit it again.

374
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.280
Every time Jaan is throwing a punch, it's gonna,

375
00:25:06.281 --> 00:25:11.140
it's going to be like 35% less powerful because of that leg, his leg just,

376
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.770
he can't generate power off that left leg

377
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.620
mean he could do it a little bit, but it's gonna,

378
00:25:17.621 --> 00:25:19.630
he's gonna be missing something.

379
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.150
God. It's a good fight.

380
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:34.420
It's crazy that Aldo drops down to 35 and just like becomes

381
00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:36.700
a reinvented fighter. Unbelievable.

382
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.700
And then when you find out it's really only 33, like what? Wow.

383
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:45.250
He's been around forever. Oh, I mean, he's been a world champion forever

384
00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.430
first ever featherweight champion in the WEC for the first ever featherweight

385
00:25:51.431 --> 00:25:55.510
champion in the UFC. I mean, when they instituted the weight class,

386
00:25:55.511 --> 00:25:58.330
he was the guy, they brought him over from the WC again,

387
00:25:58.331 --> 00:26:02.050
that left hook to the liver. Woo he's hit that spot so many times.

388
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.600
He likes that combination. What they call the Duchy.

389
00:26:04.601 --> 00:26:06.880
It's a left hook to the liver and the right leg kick.

390
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.620
That's like a Nesto huge special,

391
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:22.600
woo. Look at this. Oh my God. These guys are bagging.

392
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.540
This tremendous. This is a fast paced too, man.

393
00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:29.740
That's the crazy thing about Aldo going into 35 that he said, oh, beautiful,

394
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.250
spinning, beautiful, beautiful. He caught him resting.

395
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.430
That's the thing about Yon, man. He's so clever. He's filled with so many.

396
00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:42.880
He's got so many techniques again. Oh my God. Get out of there.

397
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.830
Left hook to the liver by Aldo and a counter shot to the head by yawn. Oh,

398
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.750
oh my God. Knee up the middle by Aldo.

399
00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.160
Whew. Oh, nice. Elbow off the brake by Yon.

400
00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:07.280
Aldo keeps giving the last minute of these rounds to him, man.

401
00:27:07.281 --> 00:27:10.460
This is crazy, right? This is a crazy fight.

402
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:13.933
Who,

403
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.630
I don't know if that's the right mentality when the round for the first four

404
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:24.470
minutes and give him one minute, right? No,

405
00:27:24.471 --> 00:27:27.290
I know it's not a mentality. It's just, he's just getting,

406
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.130
this is just a really close fight. Oh. And then he worked for the spin there.

407
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.880
I watched the best breakdown of all Lee Frazier,

408
00:27:34.881 --> 00:27:38.270
a guy that went back and looked through all the interviews of both of them and

409
00:27:38.271 --> 00:27:42.170
tells you how they're feeling in between each round and everything on YouTube.

410
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.153
So cool.

411
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.980
I think he's telling you at one point, like at the end of this round Muhammad,

412
00:27:48.981 --> 00:27:51.620
Ali said, this is the closest to death he's ever felt.

413
00:27:51.621 --> 00:27:54.140
And it's just the end around 11 around 12 or something.

414
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.360
I think that was rumble in the jungle run. Yeah. Yeah.

415
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:57.950
Thrilling Thrilla in Manila.

416
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.400
No Thrilla in Manila was in the Philippines.

417
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:07.250
Which one was the thrill in Manila was Joe was rumble in the

418
00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:12.140
jungle. Ali and fray or a foreman. Yeah. Right. Okay.

419
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.310
Yeah. This one was Frazier out later. They don't do that anymore.

420
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.730
It was like names. That was the festival Thrilla in Manila.

421
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.580
You know what I mean? Vegetable. Do you know that? A festival? Oh,

422
00:28:22.581 --> 00:28:26.480
that's why James Brown. No, that was the, that was a year. Right? Zaire.

423
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.330
That's what that was. That's right. That was the foreman fight.

424
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.030
That was the first form of Ali, right? Yeah, I believe so.

425
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.660
That was the one where James Brown came out and put on a concert and his Phoebe

426
00:28:35.661 --> 00:28:39.410
king insane. Jamie king play too. Oh, wow.

427
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:44.930
Wasn't James Brown at the beginning of one of the Rockies too. Yeah. Yeah.

428
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.540
And Apollo Creed's dancing. Three, three, no, no,

429
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:56.960
you're right. It was Russia, right? It was when, uh, he was trying to go.

430
00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.280
Right? Three, three is three Zaire in 74.

431
00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:05.960
That's rumbling and jungle concerts from motorway.

432
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.950
Don king. Part of the build-up for the Ali foreman fight. Wow.

433
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.600
God bill, bill Withers.

434
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.860
I got the YouTube. It's on YouTube. Brilliant. Oh,

435
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.520
he's destroys the place on my guitar.

436
00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.080
Troy's the place where the acoustic guitar. I played bill Withers the other day,

437
00:29:27.081 --> 00:29:32.030
while I was working out. Put some, put some used me on, oh man,

438
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.080
you got to check out his live at radio city music hall. Oh,

439
00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.950
what he does live is so crazy. Especially with that song with, uh,

440
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.280
use fight, man. Cause he uses the crowd.

441
00:29:45.281 --> 00:29:48.010
Like an instrument uses their claps and everything.

442
00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:50.291
He,

443
00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:54.810
he keeps looking for that left hook to the body and then Yon counters with that

444
00:29:54.811 --> 00:29:59.760
right hook to the head. Oh, elbow over the top.

445
00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.223
What? A fight.

446
00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.410
Oh nice. Neat of the body.

447
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.740
She'll go to the list of dog. He's at home. Well at swimming today, we hung out.

448
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.330
Had a good time. He goes swimming in like your pool. Yeah. With the dog. Nice.

449
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:28.650
He loves it, man.

450
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:33.450
I jumped in the police like yippee and he jumped in afterwards. That's so cool.

451
00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.820
Well, he's a golden retriever. They they're, you know,

452
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:37.080
they're duck hunting dogs.

453
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.410
They're retrievers like they're the sweetest kindest dogs.

454
00:30:40.411 --> 00:30:43.860
But like they were developed to hunt birds. Really pretty sure.

455
00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:46.890
Oh, look at that. Went for the trip.

456
00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:51.780
All those a little tired here.

457
00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:57.540
It's these moments where one guy needs to catch a breath and the other guy

458
00:30:57.541 --> 00:31:00.570
doesn't a lot of things can change and happen in those moments.

459
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.630
But John is still being forced to fight from that south pole stance

460
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.450
that opens up a lot of though. It opens up power kicks from both guys.

461
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.930
Cause the body's open. Oh, Yom with a good combination.

462
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.530
But all those so good with that. Right?

463
00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:25.260
Low kick to the Orthodox opponent.

464
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:29.010
That's like such a big weapon for him that when someone fights him south paw,

465
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.360
they kind of changes that. Oh,

466
00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.950
Yon with the trumping knee attempt.

467
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.420
Wow. Aldo has landed more significant strikes already in this fight

468
00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:49.640
than any other fight than any other fight. Yeah. It said his personal best. Wow.

469
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:54.200
That's crazy. Six landed coming, looking at me. He's so strong.

470
00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.680
See all those trying to take a little breather here,

471
00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:02.510
catch his breath and Yon senses it. He's coming on. Strong.

472
00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:06.440
One thing that although has had a problem with in the past is when guys pressure

473
00:32:06.441 --> 00:32:10.190
him, he has had problems maintaining the stamina.

474
00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.980
And that's what max hallway did to him in both fights,

475
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.540
particularly in the second fight.

476
00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.210
Cause although fights in such an explosive way,

477
00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.510
that when you explode like that and dig in with big shots,

478
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.680
you're like sprinting and you need some, you need a break. Whereas max Holloway,

479
00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.250
everything like pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. He puts that pace on you.

480
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:33.440
And that's what he did to Aldo. And um, Yon is doing it to him right now.

481
00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:35.060
As long as all those leading,

482
00:32:35.061 --> 00:32:37.880
like he was leading in the mall and Mariah's fight. He never got tired,

483
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.260
but he's not being. And Yon is pressure. That is not good. It's not good.

484
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.400
This is not good. But it's great for yawn. He's going to beat him up.

485
00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:50.420
This might be it. This might be it. There's a whole minute to go.

486
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.940
He's trying to grab the wrist. You just use just risk control, but that's hard.

487
00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.800
Oh, Yon goes right over through with the knee.

488
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:00.470
That's gonna allow him to hit some big shots.

489
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.850
1 54 significant totals.

490
00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:07.610
Total strikes 156,

491
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:10.730
significant 146 rather significant strikes. That's crazy.

492
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:14.690
These guys are throwing bombs, man. Oh. Big elbow.

493
00:33:14.691 --> 00:33:17.840
Over the top 30 seconds to go. Can he survive?

494
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.770
It just takes a few big shots from here. Look at him. He's looking,

495
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.890
he's looking. He's going to try to throw those legs to the side.

496
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.990
He just doesn't know which way to go.

497
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.180
And Aldo is not, he's not a big threat with submissions off of his back,

498
00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.400
especially not now. Why is that? It's not weird for a Brazilian like that. Well,

499
00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:43.630
I mean, it's just never been his forte. He's never really, uh,

500
00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.750
in my recollection ever really submitted anybody with like an arm bar or

501
00:33:46.751 --> 00:33:49.600
anything off the back. He's when he's on his back,

502
00:33:49.601 --> 00:33:52.060
he's just kind of hanging on and holding on.

503
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:58.230
Although he does have great Brazilian jujitsu skills, he's never been like a,

504
00:33:58.231 --> 00:34:00.790
a guard specialist. His nose is up.

505
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:05.200
That's a great school that he came from right with Novo and y'all yeah. Top,

506
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:10.150
top of fight. One of the very best and uh, Andre pet naris.

507
00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.610
Who's his head instructor. That's the guy in front of him. Not,

508
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:17.500
not the UFC cutbacks. There's another guy. Not that guy that he's,

509
00:34:17.501 --> 00:34:22.400
he, you can't see him on camera. Okay. Panera is, is uh,

510
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:26.290
a real veteran. I mean he was around the old school valley Tuto days. See,

511
00:34:26.291 --> 00:34:27.760
look at this, look at that counter.

512
00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:32.080
So all those looking for the left hook to the body and Jaan is waiting for him

513
00:34:32.081 --> 00:34:35.980
to throw it. And then he immediately counters like that. Jab. Ooh,

514
00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:39.880
he's so good at fighting from this position, man. That's such a,

515
00:34:39.881 --> 00:34:44.560
a big plus that he can fight so good from a south pole position as

516
00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:48.220
well. Because even though his left calf is up,

517
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:52.870
he basically took leg kicks out of the equation by switching stances because

518
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.620
although is not having nearly as much success with that right leg kick to the

519
00:34:56.621 --> 00:34:59.710
right front leg as he was to the left front leg.

520
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.010
Is this the fifth and final round? Oh.

521
00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:08.200
I wonder who this is a great fight tale. It's always a good sign.

522
00:35:08.201 --> 00:35:11.560
When they're hugging at the start of the day, [inaudible] look how much energy.

523
00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.610
Oh, stunned.

524
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:21.250
Well, this could be it. This could be it. This could be it. Uh, man, this is it.

525
00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.120
This is it. This is it. He's. Oh,

526
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.780
passing over. He's gonna say he's gonna,

527
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.800
he's gonna get him a crucifix and smash him. No

528
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.033
man.

529
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.420
So y'all was trying to slide that arm down to lock up the right arm,

530
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.180
slide his knee across and lock up the right arm. All those,

531
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.460
although Kenyan defend themselves and that's where he's at right now.

532
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:51.300
Full crucifix. I think his right leg is trapped in the middle of the half guard,

533
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:53.760
but still might as well be a crucifix.

534
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.600
That right arm was just totally taken out of the game.

535
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.600
So he's got no defense at all on his right side right now. Get through.

536
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:06.060
He just he's using that leg to pin it down. Although almost looks like it.

537
00:36:06.061 --> 00:36:08.400
Almost recaptured guard there. Nope.

538
00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.840
Although his grabbing the fence with his toes and they're saying the referee's

539
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:17.550
telling them not to do that. It's interesting.

540
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:25.530
Oh man. Yeah. He's now bad. He just has to get that leg free.

541
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.290
If he gets his leg free, it's a full crucifix,

542
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.760
but he keeps getting to that spot.

543
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.350
Oh elbow. Holy.

544
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.310
Now he's taking his back. Oh, that's it. It's over. It's over right now.

545
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:42.390
It is over man. It is over. It's over. Oh,

546
00:36:42.391 --> 00:36:46.230
that elbow busted him. Yeah. He's he's just, can't take it anymore.

547
00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.520
He's basically just hanging on here. That was a big elbow.

548
00:36:50.521 --> 00:36:51.660
Look at all the blood man.

549
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:59.520
Oh my God. Look at his face dude. Yon is no Juliet hammering him. This is it.

550
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:05.170
Stop this fight. Stop the fight. Stop it. Stop the fight. Stop it.

551
00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:10.220
You're fine. that.

552
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.440
Poor out though. Fights over. Not to hit him there.

553
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:20.330
You see that referee up bad spot. Oh God. Come on man. Stop the fight.

554
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.690
He's not doing anything. He's just covering up.

555
00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:30.260
Oh my God. Uh.

556
00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.250
He's not defending himself. I don't know why they're not stopping this fight.

557
00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.030
This fight already. Please, please stop. Come on.

558
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.410
They would have stopped this fight in many other cases.

559
00:37:42.411 --> 00:37:46.190
Look at how much blood is on that canvas where his head is. That's nuts, man.

560
00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.040
But now Yon has punched himself out. Look at this.

561
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.090
He's got to take a little break and he's got two minutes to go though. Yeah,

562
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:57.290
but I'm not going anywhere. No, he's losing blood by the minute yet.

563
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.880
Look at that puddle in front of his face.

564
00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.240
Obviously fight island is not New York city.

565
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:05.930
These are different rules out there. What do you mean? I mean,

566
00:38:05.931 --> 00:38:08.540
I just feel like every time I've watched fights in New York,

567
00:38:08.541 --> 00:38:12.500
it seems like they're always stopped very quickly. And clearly

568
00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.980
I don't give a. They're not stopped until night comes out. Come on.

569
00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:19.814
He's getting again with

570
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:24.830
[inaudible] Christ.

571
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.290
Thank you for all of those are going to have a headache for three weeks.

572
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:32.090
Oh yeah. At least. Yeah. Necessarily.

573
00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.270
There's no, no reason he had to take all those shots. No, no, no.

574
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.010
You know a, guy's got to do something to improve his position.

575
00:38:44.011 --> 00:38:47.550
Just sitting there like that covering up and just getting hammered in the head.

576
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.020
It's not enough basically.

577
00:38:49.021 --> 00:38:53.250
Like you're getting punished for not going unconscious. That's a good point.

578
00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:59.670
pewter Yon is no joke. I made some big acid adjustments,

579
00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.140
switch stances, smashed him. And when he got on top on the ground,

580
00:39:04.141 --> 00:39:06.510
you see how strong is. That's what I was talking about.

581
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:08.070
Like how physically strong he is.

582
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:13.830
Like although has always been very good off his back defensively.

583
00:39:13.831 --> 00:39:17.490
He's always been able to hold on. Boom. Look at that. Bang.

584
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.630
Dig into the body. Look at that. Drops him with the uppercut. man.

585
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.220
I mean, and the prolong beat him beating.

586
00:39:29.221 --> 00:39:32.760
He gave him in that fifth and final round. That was a prolonged beating

587
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.410
that referee had five bucks on Alto.

588
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:42.300
If that's all it takes. Imagine if that was all,

589
00:39:42.301 --> 00:39:46.620
it takes five bucks and you let a guy get beat to death. I have $5.
