00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And I love the fact.</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.300
<v 1>By the way that you said that you don't modulator who you bring on. So,</v>

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.420
and let me, let me share my own personal experience.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.620
I was just contacted a few days ago, and if she's listening now, I'm sorry.

5
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:15.150
If I haven't responded yet, I will.

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.100
I was contacted by a very famous former porn star.

7
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:23.430
I won't mention her name. I didn't actually know her work,

8
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.780
but I have since gone and done my research on her. And, uh,

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.630
uh, and if my wife is listening, it was completely for research purposes.

10
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.830
Uh, and so anyways, so, so I, she reached out to me and said, Hey,

11
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.220
would you come on my show? You know, I'm a fan. Now,

12
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.590
if I were the typical academic,

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.970
I would be doing all sorts of machinations in my head and calculation as well.

14
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:51.630
Is it good for my brand to be speaking to a porn star?

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.410
Doesn't it make me look less professor Ariel? And actually, I,

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.790
it never even entered my mind.

17
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.750
I saw that she had a sufficiently large platform that she was certainly an

18
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.500
intelligent person, and I'm very likely to reply to her and say, Hey, let's,

19
00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:08.820
let's do it. So, and I think that comes across with you. There's no pretense.

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's just sit down and have conversations with interesting people. Of course,

21
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.610
in my case, my show is infinitely smaller than yours,

22
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.640
but it's been successful within my sphere for, I think,

23
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:20.100
similar reasons to why yours has been so successful.

24
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.580
<v 2>The porn star thing is very interesting because people avoid even the topic</v>

25
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:29.600
of porn, but yet, clearly a lot of people are watching it.

26
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.440
And a good example, and I don't mean to throw this guy under the bus is the, uh,

27
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.110
the journalist from the new Yorker who, uh,

28
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.400
unfortunately it was on a zoom call recently and thought he had muted his video

29
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.680
and did not. And why was,

30
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.550
why was it work on the zoom call decided to start masturbating and.

31
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.710
<v 1>Didn't know that Jeffrey Toobin.</v>

32
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.030
<v 2>I wasn't going to say his name.</v>

33
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.940
I just want to say that you said his name and not me. I,

34
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.130
I feel terrible for the man, because first of all, because I,

35
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.680
I know that's going to sound crazy, but I do. And I know, uh,

36
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.880
there are many men who.

37
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.210
<v 1>You're married. So of course you. Well.</v>

38
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.870
<v 2>I, even before I was married, I masturbated. I'm going to be honest with you.</v>

39
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.830
Um, I am a lifelong masturbator. I think I discovered it, uh,

40
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.970
in my teenage years. And I've been a, uh, an avid pursuer of it ever since.

41
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.740
I think it's a clarity device, but it's also, I mean, in terms of like,

42
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:26.360
when you get horny, you get very confused,

43
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.170
like men who are horny have one thing on their mind. And it's a,

44
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.830
it's a good tool to eliminate that one thing from your mind. And you could look,

45
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.630
uh, you don't want to be fixated by something. If you're hungry, you should eat.

46
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.410
You know, you don't want to be just like starving all day. Just eat if you.

47
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.443
<v 1>I'm sorry, go ahead. Go ahead.</v>

48
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.180
<v 2>But my point is we all sort of want to pretend that we're</v>

49
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:54.050
not doing that. It's very straight, like intellectually.

50
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.080
We all know that we do it. We, everyone knows we do it.

51
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.910
Everyone does it pretty much everyone does it, but when you discuss it,

52
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.540
people like, oh, they roll their eyes. They pull their head. It's not a shame.

53
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.230
It's a very strange thing we have biological needs.

54
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.560
And if you don't attend to these biological needs,

55
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.480
I believe that you can have very confusing motives and people that are

56
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.810
excessively horny. They they're distracted.

57
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.350
<v 1>It's not healthy. Two Seinfeld references that speak exactly to that point.</v>

58
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.273
You ready?

59
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.750
So the first one is actually one that I discussed in my first book,

60
00:03:30.751 --> 00:03:33.150
my 2007 book, the evolutionary basis of consumption,

61
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.440
where I was talking about how you can analyze cultural products, including,

62
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.470
you know, sitcom themes via an evolutionary lens.

63
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:44.520
And so I take the example of the classic episode from Seinfeld,

64
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.670
a master of my domain, right, where

65
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.100
the master of my domain, of course is a euphemism for, uh, who could, uh,

66
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.270
withstand their masturbatory urges the longest. And then I say, well,

67
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.280
let's analyze that plot line of that particular show from an evolutionary

68
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:06.780
perspective. And so the first thing you might remember is that, you know,

69
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.940
there are three male characters and one female, one,

70
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.240
they all recognize that she has to put in more money into the,

71
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.160
into the pop that the better,

72
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.990
because it isn't as difficult for women to resist their master masturbatory

73
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.480
urges. So that was the first point. Uh,

74
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.400
then as each one was losing the bad meaning they were succumbing to their

75
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.593
massive authority urges.

76
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.460
It's interesting to look at what was the trigger that caused them to lose the

77
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.260
bed. So in the case of Kramer it's because he is seeing a gorgeous young

78
00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:40.020
woman, uh, scantily clad,

79
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.290
doing all sorts of sexy positions as she's exercising.

80
00:04:43.291 --> 00:04:48.120
So what triggered him to was the visual imagery,

81
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.690
whereas when it came to Elaine losing the bed,

82
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.670
it's because she fantasized about becoming the long-term

83
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.620
partner, the wife of John F. Kennedy Jr. Right. And she wasn't, she wasn't,

84
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.390
she wasn't masturbating over the cabana boy who was 18 years old with a nice.

85
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.090
And so that spoke to the differences in terms of the content of the

86
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:15.810
fantasies of men and women. And then the second point I want to make, uh,

87
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.030
that is also from Seinfeld is there's an episode where George decides

88
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:23.370
to forego sex.

89
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.840
And by freeing his mind from having to focus on sex,

90
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.490
he starts learning a whole bunch of new languages and he's solving chemistry

91
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:34.680
equation problems because he,

92
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.600
99% of his brain is no longer focused on, you know, sex.

93
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.250
And so there you go. Yeah.

94
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.820
<v 2>That's, that's a real issue with people. Uh, but again,</v>

95
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.200
discussing porn or especially having a conversation with someone who

96
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:53.760
participates in the, the actual production and acting in,

97
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.730
I'll say acting with air quotes, it's, uh, it's forbidden,

98
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.430
it's taboo. It's, it's, it's, uh, you,

99
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:05.870
you get looked down upon for some very bizarre reason that probably has to do

100
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:07.400
with our puritanical shame.

101
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.380
<v 1>The app. I'm not sure if we've discussed this before, but even if we have,</v>

102
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:14.680
I think it's worth repeating. It's probably many years ago that we discussed it.

103
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.490
So in, in one of my other books, I talk about the, you know,

104
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.440
evolutionary explanation of pornography. And I specifically talk about, uh,

105
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.670
porn that is directed at heterosexual males.

106
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.200
So typically you might think that because men are interested in sleeping with,

107
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.130
you know, many women,

108
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.140
that pornography is going to have one man sleeping with multiple

109
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:42.280
women in a particular scene, right. And that's called polygyny one man,

110
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:46.720
many women. Whereas actually the study has been done scientific study.

111
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.340
It turns out that there's a lot more what's called polyandrous depictions in

112
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:55.930
porn polyandry is one woman with multiple men.

113
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.220
So why is it that porn directed to heterosexual?

114
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:04.900
Men has a lot more scenes with one woman having

115
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:07.270
sex with multiple men. And there,

116
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.510
it turns out that the explanation comes from something called a sperm

117
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:14.470
competition hypothesis. The idea being that, uh,

118
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.360
men and actually males in many species get a rise literally,

119
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.510
and seeing other men having sex. So for example,

120
00:07:22.511 --> 00:07:24.010
when you are trying to get a stud,

121
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.270
let's say a horse or a dog to mate with a female,

122
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.170
you often will make him watch another male having sex,

123
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.160
and that will get the rise out of him. And so there's some really interesting,

124
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.900
uh, scientific ways by which you could study a product like pornography,

125
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.240
which of course is one of the most, you know,

126
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.070
the products that we spend the most money on.

127
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.800
<v 2>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

128
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.950
They're free from September 1st to December 1st,

129
00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:56.380
they're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

130
00:07:56.381 --> 00:08:00.070
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

131
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.060
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

132
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.890
That's all we're asking you to just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
