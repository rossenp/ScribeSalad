00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.280
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. He was a lifeguard. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:07.920
And he stared down the local gang leader, corn pop.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.960
Is that what the story is? Yeah. And he had a chain and then they were,

4
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:15.680
instead of fighting, they gonna, they became friends. Huh? And he was like,

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.640
I'm sorry, I called jestster Williams or so front with razor wielding gangster,

6
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:23.150
named corn. They used to rush their razors in a rain barrel. That's a,

7
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:25.030
that's a real story. That's the whole story.

8
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:28.870
That's the same with the pool dude speech. It's just, uh, I only heard the,

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.710
the legs in the pool part. I think, I didn't know about this other guy,

10
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.630
cuz now I might need to hear this. These are &lt;laugh&gt;. Are we allowed to play?

11
00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:38.950
This is this news. How's this work. Yeah. Okay. Let's hear the,

12
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:40.710
the audio to what it says. Hear it.

13
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.900
<v 1>And I was one of the guards and there weren't a loted there was a three meter</v>

14
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.220
board and you fell off sideways.

15
00:00:48.221 --> 00:00:53.100
You landed on the dam on the darn cement over there &lt;laugh&gt; and corn pop

16
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:53.700
was a, was.

17
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.540
<v 0>There a laugh track on this? One of the corn pop was.</v>

18
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.500
<v 1>A, a, B, he had a bunch of bad boys &lt;laugh&gt; and I did he,</v>

19
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.930
and back in those days, he shot things changed.

20
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.450
One of the things you had to use, if you use palmade in your hair,

21
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.410
you had to wear a bathiting cap &lt;laugh&gt;. And so he was up on the board.

22
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.810
One list, him, me. I said, Hey Esther, you off the board.

23
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.850
I'll come up and drag you off. Well, he came off and he said,

24
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:19.330
I'll meet you outside my car. This was mostly,

25
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.000
these were all public housing behind it. My car, there was a gate out here.

26
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.600
I parked my car outside the gate. And I, he said, I'll be waiting for you.

27
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:32.200
He was waiting for three guys and straight razors, not a joke.

28
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.920
There was a guy named bill Wright mouse, the only white guy.

29
00:01:35.921 --> 00:01:40.720
And he did all the pools. He was the mechanic. And I said, what am I gonna do?

30
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:44.550
He said, come down here in the basement. Where mechanics, where, where,

31
00:01:44.551 --> 00:01:47.630
where all the pool filter is, you know, the chain,

32
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:51.950
there used to be a chain that went across the deep end and he cut off a six foot

33
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.430
length of chain. He folded up, he said,

34
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:57.590
you walk out with that chain and you walked in the car and say,

35
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.870
you may cut me, man, but I'm gonna wrap this chain around your head. I said,

36
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:06.060
you're kidding me. He said, no, if you don't don't come back. And he was right.

37
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.260
So I walked out with the chain and I walked up to my car

38
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.780
and they had step those days used to remember the straight raord bang on the

39
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:19.100
curb, get 'em rusty, put 'em in the rain barrel, get 'em rusty.

40
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.770
And I looked at him, but I was smart. Then it, first of all, I said,

41
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.290
when I tell you, get off the board,

42
00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.050
you get off the board and I'll kick you out again.

43
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.530
But I shouldn't have called you Esther Williams. I apologize for that.

44
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.330
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; pause this for a secondpologizepologize for a second.</v>

45
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.050
Do you know who Esther Williams is? Oh, we're almost done. We're almost done.

46
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:40.770
Go ahead. Keep it going for a second. You need only a few more seconds to go,

47
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.010
gonna work. He.

48
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.120
<v 1>Said, you apologize to me. I, and I apologize, but I'm not for throwing you out,</v>

49
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.880
but I apologize to what I said. He said, okay, close the straight razor.

50
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:52.640
My heart began to beat again. &lt;laugh&gt;.

51
00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.780
<v 0>That?</v>

52
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.120
<v 2>How polite were those children being by the way during that.</v>

53
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.600
<v 0>Um, that was one of the things I was gonna say when I paused it. Like,</v>

54
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.440
no one's paying attention to him. All those kids are talking. They all went to.

55
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.760
<v 2>A happy place. They're.</v>

56
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.760
<v 0>All just talking. Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.000
This guy's running for president and they're behind him and he's on stage. And.

58
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.400
<v 2>Was this a president? A president stump thing. I thought something else.</v>

59
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.920
I don't.

60
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.630
<v 0>Know what it is, but he's running for president while this is going on.</v>

61
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.790
For sure. He's got, oh, he was look there's that thing. The city of, uh,

62
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.830
where is it? Cuz it says it on that little city symbol.

63
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.350
That's on the front of the podium. Delaware. Delaware. Yeah. So who set this up?

64
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.350
Where you have a bunch of kids on stage behind him not paying attention while he

65
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:40.140
gives this long winded story about razor blades and chains and

66
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.780
&lt;laugh&gt;, but basically they apologize to each other. And then, uh.

67
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.820
<v 2>It's crazy that he's a presumptive. It's crazy to run him.</v>

68
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.780
It's absolutely crazy. It's.

69
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.940
<v 0>Weird, man. It's weird. You know, you know, what's interesting. Some, I,</v>

70
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.820
it was interesting talking to Owen Smith yesterday, cuz I lo I love Owen.

71
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.730
He's a, a really brilliant comedian. Oh yeah. I know. I like,

72
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.450
I know what I'm saying. Brilliant comedian, like one of the best guys I know.

73
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.170
Yeah. And we were talking about it and he said,

74
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.970
I like the Biden makes me think like makes me feel like things would be normal

75
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.610
again. Like I think.

76
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.450
<v 2>He's saying of the people that go Obama go for Biden and that's not a small</v>

77
00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:21.120
amount of people. Yeah. There's like so Obama up Delph on it. But yeah,

78
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:24.520
Biden was never a guy who was gonna get elected before that. He's certainly not.

79
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.400
Now it it's just trying to get that, that feeling back and it's not coming back.

80
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:30.040
They gotta.

81
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.400
<v 0>In, but you've never seen a,</v>

82
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.240
a greater example of team loyalty that yeah, than this,

83
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.720
this one right here. That's what,

84
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:43.310
this is a hundred percent because no on the left wants to talk about these crazy

85
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.310
long-winded speeches and things that don't make any sense.

86
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.510
<v 2>No, the, the lefties I learned about it watching,</v>

87
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.110
I think Jimmy do &lt;affirmative&gt; the people on the left. This is why they lost.

88
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.230
I mean, I say that they lost when Nette came out.

89
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.790
But like people, people, uh,

90
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.260
on the left didn't want him and no, and they weren't on board. Bernie,

91
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.660
like Bernie saying, Hey, go along with &lt;laugh&gt; Biden.

92
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.340
People were following Bernie cuz the,

93
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.940
what they thought his policies would be not necessarily like a cult of

94
00:05:12.941 --> 00:05:15.300
personality. So they don't give a. If Bernie says vote for Biden,

95
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.420
they're like they were voting for way more lefty. Yeah.

96
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.610
And not the normal feeling. In fact they hate those.

97
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.490
The real lefties can't stand like a Owen Smith Democrat. Right.

98
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:28.570
Above all.

99
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.410
<v 0>Else. They wanted, it changed. They wanted the real lefties.</v>

100
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:33.410
Want everything changed. Yeah.

101
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.370
<v 2>Trump, the Republicans had to have their thing where Trump just trashed.</v>

102
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:38.970
He trnced them when he came in. Right. And they had their like, well,

103
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.280
he they're like his now. And so had that fight. There's no one Joe Bo uh, uh,

104
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.680
Bernie was never gonna do that with the Democrats, but isn't it crazy.

105
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.720
<v 0>That it's all about likability and electability.</v>

106
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.480
Like that's really what it's all about. When the, if people like to.

107
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.520
<v 2>A simple, clear message, you a chance dude,</v>

108
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.480
a simple clear message and see the Biden thing you're right. That I just,

109
00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:01.920
people just wanna feel normal again. Like.

110
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.880
<v 0>I don't know how you that's what that was. Owen's take.</v>

111
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.400
That was how he felt him personally. Yeah.

112
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.880
<v 2>If they could make that into a slogan, I just wanna feel normal again.</v>

113
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.920
That would be like a mag for them. But, but somebody's gotta come up with that.

114
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.120
Well.

115
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.430
<v 0>Dude, you got to look back in time and you look at history,</v>

116
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.190
all the mistakes that were made throughout history,

117
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:25.590
you know that, that's what you're reading about.

118
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:28.630
When you're reading about lost wars and invasions, it went terrible.

119
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.230
You you're hearing about trials and errors and mistakes. Well.

120
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.990
<v 2>That's when you see people's, uh, principles. How yeah.</v>

121
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.740
Get cuz I mean wasn't, especially with Biden. The thing of, uh,

122
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.580
all the people that were crowing about believe her and all that, right.

123
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.500
That are like, well you can't believe sometimes people are lying. Oh,

124
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.580

125

<v 2>That's reallypicable man. Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.940
<v 0>Well there's only a few people out there that don't do that.</v>

128
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.050
That are in like the media that are in this, that sort of, uh.

129
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.210
<v 2>The media loves this more than, I mean</v>

130
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.730
how they hate Trump when it's like 90%, their fault part.

131
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.210
<v 0>It's there's a lot of different things going on, man. Did you see annihilation?</v>

132
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.530

00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:34.840
People could see that movie now. All.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.150
<v 2>Right. Well, when you see the like they've had enough time to watch it.</v>

141
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.350
&lt;laugh&gt; I'm just kidding. The,

142
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.350
when she's there's a thing of her that's rainbow colored.

143
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:46.110
That's like a duplicate of her that, right, right, right.

144
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:48.950
And she's trying to run, it's pressing against the door. Yeah.

145
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.831
She's fighting it.

146
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:53.030
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then she stops for a minute and then she gives it a

147
00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:55.950
grenade and pulls it and Wal and gets away by being call.

148
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:57.190
The more she would fight it.

149
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.700
It would give equal reaction back at that's what these people it's like,

150
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:04.220
Trump's your reflection. And you, you hate it. And the more they fight it,

151
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:08.980
the more it presses them back up against the door. And, and, and that's, that's,

152
00:08:08.981 --> 00:08:09.581
there's no,

153
00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:12.580
they're never gonna figure out how to just like give him the grenade and pull

154
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:15.380
the pin and walk away. Cuz they can't like, uh.

155
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.260
<v 0>He there's, he definitely makes mistakes,</v>

156
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.570
but they are also so wrapped up in everything that he does

157
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.410
in a way that they distort even things that probably turn out to be a good idea.

158
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.170
<v 2>He plans for that. He does that. Every,</v>

159
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.850
the people that just could get ruined by one minor thing, you're like,

160
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.810
I'll do a thing every day. And what are you gonna do? And,

161
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.680
and people like these are gonna like a bunch of people just don't follow him or

162
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:45.400
they like it's genius. Dude. I, you, if you hate his guts,

163
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:46.960
you can't say he wasn't very smart.

164
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.880
<v 0>But was so wound up that this is look,</v>

165
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.640
anytime you get too emotional about things, your,

166
00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:56.320
your view of things get distorted.

167
00:08:56.321 --> 00:08:58.320
It's one of the things that happens in fights all the time.

168
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.320
You see fighters talk to each other. Right.

169
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:02.920
And one of the reasons why they talk to each other,

170
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.080
cuz they're trying to get the other person emotionally invested in the fight.

171
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:10.640
Right. They're trying to get 'em angry and off where they're gonna do something

172
00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:14.240
irrational. They're not gonna be logical. Right. But that's what you're saying.

173
00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:19.070
You' you're seeing that with him, you know, instead of them analyzing it,

174
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:23.710
it's like everything is a personal affront and he's a human that must Beed.

175
00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:24.590
That's people that vote for.

176
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.390
<v 2>A feel like that. Obama feeling. That's what it's such an offense.</v>

177
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.150
It's it's not about anything Obama did or didn't do.

178
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:33.710
It's the feeling that people got it's it's been offended. Right.

179
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:34.950
But that's what I, I, but you want that back.

180
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.460
<v 0>Always said about him, like forget about his policies.</v>

181
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.300
Like he was a great statesman. The way he would talk would be yes.

182
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:42.260
That's the thing. Yes.

183
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.420
He was reserved and he was articulate and smooth.

184
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.900
And when you would hear him talk, be like,

185
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:51.740
that's an excellent representation of the United States. Like perfect.

186
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.730
That's our, that's our, one of our top dudes makes sense. Right? Yeah. And,

187
00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.250
and like even keeled didn't get angry. I expect.

188
00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:01.850
<v 2>Certain bourgeoi norms.</v>

189
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.690
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Whereas like the thing with Trump is that he's,</v>

190
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.330
you know, like you said, he's not really a politician,

191
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.770
so he's just being the guy who's always been. And everybody's like,

192
00:10:11.771 --> 00:10:13.530
I thought you were gonna be a president though.

193
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.520
I thought you were gonna act like we need cuz you want, he called.

194
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.360
<v 2>Pots. I thought people got him for specifically the opposite of that. Yeah.</v>

195
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.800
It's like, and that done now.

196
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.520
So people still want that the west wing or whatever the, like &lt;laugh&gt;,

197
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.800
that's what it is. It's like you're west wing kind of.

198
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.800
<v 0>People that if you want reform real reform,</v>

199
00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:32.800
you should be kind of happy that he exposed.

200
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.390
<v 2>It. What I think it exposes is how not rigged it is because if someone</v>

201
00:10:37.391 --> 00:10:41.350
controlled it no way. Do you know? You know what I mean? Like they.

202
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:42.350
<v 0>Only control some of.</v>

203
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.310
<v 2>It. You can J yeah. Based on yeah. Yeah. The of Bernie and yeah.</v>

204
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.190
And him getting in, not that Bernie.

205
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.390
<v 0>Was gonna win. The of Bernie though, is it's crazy. It's like, you're watching,</v>

206
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:52.270
Bernie's.

207
00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.030
<v 2>Not fit to be present. Listen, if you get bulldoz like that,</v>

208
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.140
you're not you're right. I think he's a only good man think,

209
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:01.260
which is why he's unfit to be the president. Yeah. You can't,

210
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:03.380
this is not a job for that. Well.

211
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.500
<v 0>This is one of the reasons why they're so scared of Tulsas Gabbard is cuz she</v>

212
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.460
doesn't lay down like that. You see? Yeah.

213
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.820
Once she had that moment with Kael Harris in the debates. Oh yeah.

214
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.940
<v 2>She, that was.</v>

215
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.050
<v 0>Great by the way. That was amazing. Instead of saying, wow, this lady's dynamic.</v>

216
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.650
They're like, oh. We can't really control her.

217
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.810
right&lt;laugh&gt; she's she's gonna attack our, our top lady. Yeah. That's a passion.

218
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.250
She's going after people. She's saying things that, you know, you really,

219
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.170
if you, you want your team to win,

220
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.090
you're not gonna give up those cards so early. Um.

221
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.930
<v 2>Well they haven't, there's internal thing.</v>

222
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:40.480
You gotta settle with all the P people that are like actual left that are like

223
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.400
mad mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they want their Trump. Yeah. Right, right.

224
00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:47.680
And so they're not gonna go along with the same cuz cuz I think a lot of like

225
00:11:47.681 --> 00:11:49.320
just liberals don't get that the,

226
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:53.840
the lefties hate you more than they hate a Nazi &lt;laugh&gt; they hate you more than

227
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.693
any right. Winger,

228
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.520
just a regular liberal that's who they want to get the that's why they turn on

229
00:11:58.521 --> 00:12:00.200
Ellen or whoever the. Yeah.

230
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.480
Cause they're waiting to have a reason to turn on you.
