00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.040
<v 1>Experience. So when you were saying that you collect films and you have, uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.600
films, did you, do you go back to like the really old ones? Like noserro.

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.360
<v 0>Oh yeah. I love silent movies and now they're easier to get,</v>

5
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.160
cuz I always lovedloncheney. But so many of the films were hard to.

6
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.080
<v 1>Get. I was showing my kids lawncheney two nights ago. What, what movie did they?</v>

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.830
Well, we, I was showing 'em the, um,

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.590
the original Wolf man and I was showing him Jacqueline Hyde.

9
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.710
I was showing him some of the longcheney Jr. Was well longchainney Jr. Was.

10
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.550
<v 0>Wolfn Wolf, man. Dad, who was in like fan of the opera and fan of.</v>

11
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.310
<v 1>Punch back in. No Dame was Jacqueline Hyde as well. That was longcheney right.</v>

12
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.030
<v 0>Norederick March. Oh,</v>

13
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.110
well it depends what there's the John Barry Moore silent Jacqueline Hyde.

14
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:42.260
But you probablyt shoot. Oh, the Frederick, March one is great.

15
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.660
It's so perverted, IST really? Like with the prostitutes and stuff. Isn't it.

16
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:49.900
The one you showed your kids, like from the 30? Oh yeah, for sure. &lt;laugh&gt; from.

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.740
<v 1>The thirties. Is that what that's, where they pour watch porn?</v>

18
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.540
<v 0>Well, there's the boring one with Spencer. Tracy is just, is it boring? Uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.700
it just compared to the other one,

20
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.100
the other one's because anything that's sort of like the pre-code stuff is

21
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:01.260
really, we watch.

22
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.210
<v 1>Uh, the beginning of the Spencer Tracy won because it was so strange. They,</v>

23
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.330
there there's actually, when, you know, in iTunes you can watch a preview,

24
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.570
but it's not really a preview in its old films. Cause they didn't have yeah.

25
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.490
Previews back then.

26
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.890
So it's just a scene and it's a scene when he's becoming Mr. Hyde,

27
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:20.450
but he doesn't look any different. Yeah. He.

28
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.680
<v 0>Just kinda messed up. His hair looks, looks a little meaner, you know? Oh,</v>

29
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:26.760
Frederick, March one is one of the best ones I ever made. It's so good.

30
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.920
<v 1>But lone Channey was like it washantom of the opera,</v>

31
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.480
which is a really interesting one because he, he like,

32
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.640
he put on some really painful makeup for that.

33
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.800
<v 0>I mean he just invented everything. Yeah. The way he, the things he'd do.</v>

34
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.081
I mean,

35
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.590
I don't know how much the stories have been exaggerated by publicity departments

36
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:44.590
over the years, but yeah. I mean,

37
00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:48.990
it's just incredible and movies like the unknown or the unholy three mm-hmm

38
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.590
&lt;affirmative&gt; like you can get everything now forever.

39
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:53.270
It' was like impossible to see these movies for a long time.

40
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.071
I don't do it anymore,

41
00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:57.230
but I used to collect vintage movie posters and that's what I would go after

42
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.150
the, the lawn Channey silent movie posters. Yeah.

43
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:00.951
Cause a lot of times I'd be like,

44
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:04.020
there's only one of these in existence and I'm so like I gotta have it.

45
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.300
Then I realize I'm spending too much money on things. &lt;laugh&gt;.

46
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.220
<v 1>Those old films. Um, you know, when I'm I was trying to show 'em to my kids.</v>

47
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.540
I was just trying to ex we were,

48
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.980
we were going from the twenties to the thirties. There's a movie.

49
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:20.420
That's the original horror film that I found out was TW 1920.

50
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.530
It's actually two years old than nosferrado. It was uh,

51
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.730
Dr. Something, Dr. Callagari.

52
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.690
<v 0>Callagari yes. Yeah. That's a good one. Yes.</v>

53
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.970
<v 1>Yeah. We watched a little bit of that too,</v>

54
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.810
but I just wanted to show them how weird it is. Like the progression of film,

55
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.210
particularly like scary films. Because when my kids were real little, uh,

56
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:43.890
my wife was outta town and uh, I said, do you guys wanna watch a scary movie?

57
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.360
Not really scary. And they were nervous. How old were they at the time?

58
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.440
I think they were five and three or maybe six and four somewhere around there.

59
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.560
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; so I put throwing down the test. Do you want to watch it? But.</v>

60
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.240
<v 1>I knew it. Wasn't gonna be really scary. Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:56.241 --> 00:03:00.320
So I put on the original king Kong from what was that like? Thirtynineteen.

62
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.760
<v 0>33. Three, I think. Yeah, something.</v>

63
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.440
<v 1>Like that. And uh, we were laughing. I was like, let me tell you something,</v>

64
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.920
we're gonna watch this. And it's so fake. It looks so dumb. I go, we're gonna,

65
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.960
we're gonna laugh. And so we're cuddled up on the couch and they were nervous.

66
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.360
And then once they saw the thing, they're like, that's it. That's the monster.

67
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.630
&lt;laugh&gt; I was like, let me tell you something kid to 1933,

68
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.510
this was scary for people. They really thought this was realistic.

69
00:03:23.511 --> 00:03:24.470
They thought this was amazing.

70
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.830
<v 0>Do you ever have that moment? You'll watch something. Like, say I,</v>

71
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.510
I do this like Frankenstein. Yeah.

72
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:31.710
Like you've seen it so many times that it's hard to watch it.

73
00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:32.550
Like you've never seen it before,

74
00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:36.070
but sometimes I'll be watching something and there'll be a scene where like

75
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.020
Frankenstein's killing Fritzs and there's no music. He's just screaming.

76
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.050
And I was like,

77
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.900
this must have been so intense cuz no one had seen anything like this.

78
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.860
They're watching this creature who they don't understand the makeup because no

79
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:50.694
one knew I was done.

80
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.740
Like especially he cuz he kind of the first appearance of Karl off his Frank,

81
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.460
he kind of backs in and turns and I, his head's.

82
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.290
<v 1>Flat he's got and his neck it's.</v>

83
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.650
<v 0>So in the Jack Pierce makeup is so incredible that I was just like,</v>

84
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.850
people must have been like running for the door.

85
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.690
<v 1>Pull up a picture of what Boris Karloff looked like in that movie.</v>

86
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.130
I haven't seen that in forever, but I'm it's so good. It was so good. I mean,

87
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.050
and the also it's so difficult for us to understand perspective,

88
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.160
like to, to, to put yourself in their place back then. Yeah. Look at that.

89
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.000
Yeah. I mean, lighting was incredible.

90
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.680
<v 0>Now we're used to seeing that it's so iconic that like, or that it becomes like,</v>

91
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.560
but if you'd never, I mean, never seen anything like that before. I mean,

92
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.440
I guess going back to what we said a second ago, like lawncheney,

93
00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:39.960
inhanmma the opera and, and its quasi motor, you kind of the bolts in the,

94
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.550
but that must have just been like.

95
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.870
<v 1>Cables for a battery. &lt;laugh&gt; that's so crazy. The posts on his neck.</v>

96
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.910
Do you remember when uh, they did a remake with de Niro? I do.

97
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.070
<v 0>I don't remember a movie. Very good. I don't.</v>

98
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.950
<v 1>Remember it either, but I remember it being terrifying, looking like they, yeah,</v>

99
00:04:57.951 --> 00:04:58.784
he was updated.

100
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.630
<v 0>Yeah. He looked cool in that. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.500
He it's a tough one though with those movies because they got it so right.

102
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.500
The first time. Yeah. And the performances are like, when I watch, like I,

103
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.620
I really like Lagosi in Dracula and when you watch it,

104
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.460
I always feel like he's like Brando of that time because everyone else is like

105
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:18.940
talking like yeah, well like,

106
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:22.130
like they're still doing vodkaville and they're way over the top and there too

107
00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:25.210
much. And he's like this in this, doing this thing. Yeah.

108
00:05:25.211 --> 00:05:26.011
Where sometimes you like,

109
00:05:26.011 --> 00:05:28.570
you can't almost can't understand him cause of his accent. Like, wow.

110
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.250
He's like in this whole weird head trip and they're like doing play,

111
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.183
Hey listen buddy.

112
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.370
You know like the way they're talking it's and that's why nobody can remember

113
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.930
David mans who got paid 10 times with leggoci. But,

114
00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:44.320
but lagosi's like this I iconic thing like Marilyn Monroe. I mean,

115
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:48.760
that just was so out of time with so special what they were doing. Yeah. Even.

116
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.240
<v 1>In the, when in the film,</v>

117
00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:54.480
there's a scene where the woman had been bit and he is like, what's wrong?

118
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.640
&lt;laugh&gt; what's going on. Yes.

119
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.680
And he's so corny and over the top and in that, you know,

120
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.360
the style of that era, but Lagosi is on another level. And the, and.

121
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:05.710
<v 0>Like everybody,</v>

122
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.920
like a lot of those actors then seem very much like they were in the closet and

123
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:12.040
they were trying to like play with the woman &lt;laugh&gt; and Lagosi has that vibe,

124
00:06:12.041 --> 00:06:16.240
like, I'm gonna everything on this set before I leave this movie, you know?

125
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:17.830
Yeah. He just reaks of like,

126
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.870
I'm from I'm Hungarian and I'm gonna nail every actress in this film.

127
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.870
<v 1>Yeah. And he's a powerful vampire. Like he bought into it,</v>

128
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:27.910
like he was in the role, he was.

129
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.270
<v 0>In the head space and a lot of those movies,</v>

130
00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:33.390
another good one's like the black cat where like the same guy was in the

131
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.300
dracculism and he's so like swishy and over the top and Lagosi,

132
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.420
and karlla together is so intense.

133
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.860
It's like this two different movies going on the,

134
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.420
this weird H movie and this weird thing these other guys are doing, man.

135
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.500
It's like Brando and apocalypse now. Like he's making a whole different movie.

136
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.220
Him and Dennis Hopper. Yes. Yeah.

137
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.060
<v 1>You know, it's cool to just go back in time and see the progression of,</v>

138
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.690
of ho are to go from those films.

139
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:03.570
Like I still think nosferrado to this day is one of the coolest vampires ever.

140
00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:05.570
Cause it was it's so incredible looking. There was no,

141
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.210
there was no sort of benchmark yeah. Before him. Right. I mean,

142
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.970
and he looked so weird with the long fingers. Yeah.

143
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.890
And he looked creepy and the way he would rise,

144
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.410
remember when they had him on a board. Yeah. It.

145
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.600
<v 0>Just was like, and he straight up sit straight up it's so it looks incredible.</v>

146
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.360
And I still, and I love the, um,

147
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.040
the herzzog remake with Klauss Kinsky oh, that's right. Is amazing. Did that.

148
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.280
Yeah. And Kinski's so like he so perfect. Wow.

149
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.320
Cause HES like another,

150
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.640
that crazy actor that just reekaks it crazy right off the screen. Yes.

151
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.630
<v 1>Yes. Yes. It's just hard to do a good monster movie these days.</v>

152
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.950
I mean, I'm a gigantic Rick B baker fan. Obviously you see the, yeah.

153
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:48.110
Rick he's coming on here too. Oh, is he super pumped? Oh.

154
00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.230
<v 0>Yeah. His new book looks amazing.</v>

155
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:53.350
<v 1>Yeah. I'm so excited. I'm getting him to promote that, but I'm just, I was,</v>

156
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.390
when I was a kid, I wanted to be a makeup artist.

157
00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:57.030
It was one things that I wanted to do. Yeah.

158
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.900
So I studied Rick baker and I studied, you know, the, the early longchey days,

159
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:06.140
like we were talking about and I just love the prosthetics and like star wars

160
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.780
and. Like, which, by the way, I went to the star wars, uh, attraction yesterday.

161
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.260
Oh you did at Disneyland. It's the &lt;laugh&gt; Ooh,

162
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:18.020
that star wars ride. The ride is incredible, man. You'reactually it's simulated.

163
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.500
<v 0>Though, right? Yes. I can't do it. Simulated.</v>

164
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.730
' simulated ride you if you wanna just I won't throw up,

165
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:25.570
but I'll feel like I want to for the rest of.

166
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.770
<v 1>The day. It's awesome. It's awesome. So my, my kids were steering.</v>

167
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.290
They got a chance to steer the,

168
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.850
they were the pilots and you're slamming into cause they have to coordinate.

169
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.130
One goes up, one goes left and right.

170
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.050
So up and down is one kid and left and rights. Yeah, they are.

171
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.840
<v 0>They next to each other and the PI or are they separate? Like how next.</v>

172
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.920
<v 1>To each otherhan and, but they're screaming at each other. &lt;laugh&gt; don't.</v>

173
00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.800
<v 0>Hit it. Oh my God. They're like asteroids flying out. Boom.</v>

174
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.400
<v 1>Things are they're hitting. But, but uh, just the ride is incredible.</v>

175
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.320
I mean, you could see there's so much money poured into there.

176
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.600
And apparently there's a bunch of other ones that are they're they're in the

177
00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:03.280
process of developing too. Oh really? But I loved the,

178
00:09:03.281 --> 00:09:07.720
those movies and a big part of it was like, like the Cantina scene.

179
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.520
If you, if you went to that now you'd be like, oh my God, it's obviously a mask.

180
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.950
Oh yeah. Like their face. Doesn't be like, ah, it's like that weird weol guy.

181
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.190
Yeah. No, but they're not moving &lt;laugh&gt; you know,

182
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.590
but back then I was like, this is amazing. This.

183
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:26.430
<v 0>Is the, my God' can so clearly seeing that,</v>

184
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.310
remember seeing that movie for the first time. Oh yeah, because I was like it,

185
00:09:30.311 --> 00:09:33.550
like you come out. I remember coming outta the movie, like shell shocked,

186
00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:35.980
like everything I thought about everything just changed.

187
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:38.620
<v 1>Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; it's so life will never be the same.</v>

188
00:09:38.621 --> 00:09:40.900
That's another movie that's so hard to put in perspective.

189
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.620
I've watched it with my kids now. And it's like,

190
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:47.180
you gotta bring them back to the 1970s when this movie came out. Yeah.

191
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:51.780
Like you don't get it like back then. This was insane. How good it was. Yeah.

192
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.020
People would wa I mean, I watched it, like,

193
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.050
I think we had little competitions with our friends to see who could watch it

194
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:01.170
the most amount of times. I think I saw it like 13 times.

195
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.010
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, it's crazy. And I, someone gave me a laser, not a laser.</v>

196
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.290
Performation a Blueray of the original before Lucas did all the extra

197
00:10:10.291 --> 00:10:13.450
stuff and ruined it. Somehow they had cut together.

198
00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.970
Somebody went to all the trouble of getting like a Japanese lasers and,

199
00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.160
and they cut together a Blueray of exactly the movie as it was in 1977. What.

200
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.440
<v 1>Did he do differently in the new version.</v>

201
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.760
<v 0>Enhance some of the special effects. He added that scene with the digital,</v>

202
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.440
you know, job of the HUD and just like, there'll be like the tton that's like,

203
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.280
there's just little robots and everywhere that wasn't there.

204
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.520
And the original like, oh,

205
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.470
and now what seems so had asked for effects in whatever it was 2000 now looked

206
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:44.310
super bad. Crazy. So, but the stuff from 77 still, that's why I always wanna,

207
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.150
like you watch 2001, you go like,

208
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:48.070
how can this still look better than everything? Yeah.

209
00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:52.230
These are literally models shot in 1968 or something. Well, cuprick.

210
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.110
<v 1>Knew the limitations of the visual format.</v>

211
00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:01.380
And so he, he shot things in a way where he didn't,

212
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.740
he wasn't willing to compromise the way something looked to show you something

213
00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.460
that look like he sort of like the king Kong animation,

214
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.700
like that's the best they could do back then. Yeah.

215
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.620
But cubrick figured workarounds.

216
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.060
<v 0>That I just read this new book that came out well, maybe six months ago,</v>

217
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:19.450
that's all about the Mac 2001. And, and it's, the book is so detailed.

218
00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:23.050
I wish I could remember the title of, and it's amazing the amount of time,

219
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.210
like it's stuff you take for granted out just how they had to make the digital

220
00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.610
readouts on the computer screens. Mm.

221
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:32.450
Because that stuff didn't exist did not exist, exist at all.

222
00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:37.410
So the amount of time that went into just simple background things that nobody

223
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.080
cares about it, it is just mind blowing. Yeah.

224
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:42.720
And just the waitlessness scenes and how they did all that stuff,

225
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.040
which still look amazing.

226
00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.640
<v 1>No, it's still an incredible movie and it's also a time capsule. Right.</v>

227
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:50.880
It's like, it's one of those films that it's great, but it's also great.

228
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.160
And a time capsule. Yeah.

229
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.280
<v 0>It's I, I love it because.</v>

230
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.313
<v 1>Um,</v>

231
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.680
I love all his movies for the same reason because they take over the

232
00:12:00.681 --> 00:12:02.640
viewer, like most movies. They're like,

233
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.280
you watch it and it's doing what the movie thinks will make you happy.

234
00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:08.280
Whereasubrick's doing stuff like, well,

235
00:12:08.281 --> 00:12:12.360
this is what it would be like to be in space. Yeah. This is the pay.

236
00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.670
It's gonna unfold that. Yeah. Like, which is painfully slow at times. Well,

237
00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:18.830
you can't get away with that today.

238
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.990
<v 0>No, cuz people are too they're I don't know. They are rolled up.</v>

239
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.310
They don't have the attention span. I don't think.

240
00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.150
And same thing with Barry Lindon or clockwork orange doesn't matter what movie

241
00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:29.870
it is. His so the shining. Yes. Like now if someone made the shining to go,

242
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.780
it's great. You gotta cut the first hour out of it. &lt;laugh&gt; you know, too much.

243
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.620
We're gonna start it with a red rom scene. Yeah. Started with a hatchet. Yeah.

244
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.700
No slamming into somebody. Yeah. The opening shot would be, you know.

245
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.380
<v 1>And then go three months earliers. Yeah. Then get with the ax. Yeah.</v>

246
00:12:45.381 --> 00:12:47.740
They would do that. They would go three months earlier, you know,

247
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:51.540
they would do that. It's um, it's, it's cool to see though,

248
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.250
like those films,

249
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:57.130
they did what they could do with what was available.

250
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.250
Whereas with now the problem with CGI is they use it.

251
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.810
<v 0>And they overuse it. Yeah. And I think that I don't, I don't, I mean,</v>

252
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:08.050
CGI can be phenomenal for sure,

253
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.650
but it's a tool and it's turned into a crutch and I see it with actors.

254
00:13:11.651 --> 00:13:15.400
Like you see actors a lot of time and I feel bad a for the actors you'll see the

255
00:13:15.401 --> 00:13:17.520
actors that you go. I know these guys are great,

256
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.680
but they're awful in this movie because they didn't train to stand in a

257
00:13:21.681 --> 00:13:25.600
warehouse that's green and pretend to look at stuff. Yeah. Right.

258
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.440
So they really like, like when you watch the Phanto manes, you go,

259
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.040
why does it suddenly seem like Liam Nison can't act. Right, right, right.

260
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:35.550
Because he's like, they're like, look at that dot on the wall. I mean,

261
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.870
and you know, these guys are incredible actors.

262
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:39.990
I was talking to somebody once a kid that was in my movie,

263
00:13:39.991 --> 00:13:41.350
he was in all the spy kids movies.

264
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.950
And he said it was so hard because they'd be on a green screen and they'd be

265
00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:48.710
like, you're looking at that. Well, we're not sure what you're looking at,

266
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.750
but just stare at that dot and react. He's like, well, what is it? &lt;laugh&gt;,

267
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.990
you know, is it a dragon? Or is it my mom? What am I react?

268
00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.620
Like we haven't figured it out yet.

269
00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.420
And he said he was always in a constant state of confusion as to what he was

270
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.380
reacting to. Well.

271
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.580
<v 1>It's hard too, when you go back and you look at some of them, like,</v>

272
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.020
you know what movie got it. Right.

273
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:12.860
That sort of didn't get enough respect in its time. But in, in, in time,

274
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.730
like as time passed, it's become more respect it as Starship troopers.

275
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.570
<v 0>Yeah. I don't, I don't remember that movie that, well, it's.</v>

276
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.250
<v 1>A, you know, it's all like, they're gonna say force gums. Oh.</v>

277
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:27.090
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; no, but like, like removing major Dan's legs. I mean, that's like,</v>

278
00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:30.090
when CG's awesome. I thought, oh. They found a guy with no legs.

279
00:14:30.091 --> 00:14:32.370
Who's a great actor. Cuz I don't know who garysice was back then.

280
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:33.050
How about the ping pong.

281
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:37.680
<v 1>Scene? Yeah. He was a lot of like stuff like amazing it. Yeah. The um,</v>

282
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:42.760
what I was gonna with with monster movies though. It's um, uh, pat McGee.

283
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.240
He's the guy who did that. WWOL the one that's out there. Oh yeah.

284
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:48.400
He he'll make 'em for you. Like he makes oh really? Oh.

285
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.400
And we had this conversation about it. We were saying that you,

286
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.520
you can see CGI and even if it's awesome, your brain knows it's CGI.

287
00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.760
<v 0>That's funny that I have that same thought that it's something sublimal your</v>

288
00:15:00.761 --> 00:15:05.640
brain knows. It's all fake. Yes. Like godilla whereas like, yeah, like Godzilla,

289
00:15:05.641 --> 00:15:09.080
like when, you know, it's a guy in a rubber suit, crushing things.

290
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.830
Like if you watch the original one with like, when they cut in Raymond Burr,

291
00:15:12.831 --> 00:15:17.110
there's something so dark and up about that movie. Yes. Cause everything's,

292
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:21.390
that's real fire. There's actually three dimensional objects blowing up.

293
00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.470
But when it's so big and fake, like I always say like what's scarier,

294
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.310
uh, a giant CG creature that, you know,

295
00:15:29.311 --> 00:15:33.940
you will never see or like a maniac with a pillow case over his head,

296
00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.540
holding an ax coming at you. Like your brain goes, that could happen. I get it.

297
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:40.740
Yeah. Cause the other thing's like, well that's, I'm not gonna,

298
00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:44.740
that's like Roger rabbit. That's not gonna happen. You know? It's not,

299
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.380
it might be cool. Or it might be big, but it's.

300
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.660
<v 1>Not like one of the scariest hard movies of all time is alien. Yeah.</v>

301
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.170
And in the fur first few encounters they have with the creature,

302
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.050
you don't even see the thing. No, because.

303
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.530
<v 0>It's, you couldn't show it that much. Like the, you know, like the Sharken jaws,</v>

304
00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:02.170
but when you see it, it's like it's actually there. Yes.

305
00:16:02.171 --> 00:16:06.370
And you can feel that it's jaws are right in front of saegourney Weaver's face.

306
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:06.920
Yes.

307
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.970
It's not like she's looking at nothing and her eyeline's a little off because

308
00:16:09.971 --> 00:16:12.520
it's a, you know, a tennis ball and a stick she's looking at,

309
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.520
there's something about it really happening in the space that I think people can

310
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:17.354
feel it. And.

311
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.600
<v 1>Egourney Weaver is I think seegurney Weaver and alien is the greatest female</v>

312
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.880
action hero star ever because you bought it hook line in sinker.

313
00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:30.680
She was a scientist. She wasn't supposed to be this heroin.

314
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.470
That's out there just things up and killing everybody. And she wasn't.

315
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.230
<v 0>Supposed to be super hot and sexy and young,</v>

316
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.670
but she was hot enough because she became tough and it, it made her, but like,

317
00:16:42.671 --> 00:16:44.550
like the whole, I remember when alien came out,

318
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.750
it was kind of like when the thing came out and all the reviews were bad.

319
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.990
If you remember, wasn't it really? Yeah. I mean the ruless are,

320
00:16:50.991 --> 00:16:52.350
everything are bad when you go back and like,

321
00:16:52.351 --> 00:16:56.540
oh these the there's no redeemable characters or they're all cartoon, you know,

322
00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.940
these cardboard characters, they rip everything apart. But,

323
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.180
but like it's like Harry Dean Stan yaaff Koto is amazing.

324
00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:07.620
Every great character actor doing these great roles. But it was like, now,

325
00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:09.700
if they remmead that it'd be like, everybody the reviews, you know?

326
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.900
But that's the thing you,

327
00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.500
the reviews never mean anything that just like so crazy.

328
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.730
<v 1>The first time was it Harry Dean Stanton that saw it the first time?</v>

329
00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:21.050
Who was it that saw it the first time were they, they climbed down into the, uh,

330
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.490
they, they climbed down the stairs and it's it's right there.

331
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:26.290
I don't only remember, only see it for like a second,

332
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.850
but it was a physical thing. But the point is it was an actual guy in a suit.

333
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.610
Yeah. And you knew by the way,

334
00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:34.880
it was moving that it was an actual I right in front of him.

335
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.200
<v 0>And it took up three dimensional space in real life. Yes. And you could feel it,</v>

336
00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:42.600
you could feel yes. And you know yeah. I mean, just like when the chessbu thing.

337
00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:47.240
Yes. It's a, it it's an actual thing. It's a thing, you know? Yeah. It's like,

338
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.360
it's bizarre.

339
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.080
<v 1>Or an American worldoff in London, same.</v>

340
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.920
<v 0>Thing. You see brief glimpses of this thing, like really quick, like one frame,</v>

341
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.560
one second of it, you know? And then at the end of it, you, you see it,

342
00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.280
even when they mur, they kill it in the hallway or in the, uh, alleyway,

343
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.000
spoiler alert. &lt;laugh&gt; um, that's, you know,

344
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:07.840
you only see it for a couple seconds when it,

345
00:18:07.841 --> 00:18:10.350
when it stares to her and then they gun it down. Yeah.

346
00:18:10.351 --> 00:18:12.870
That was like the heyday for effects. Everybody I know who does effects.

347
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:17.110
It was like the thing American wear for London or the howling was like the thing

348
00:18:17.111 --> 00:18:17.930
that made every,

349
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.750
and fanorri when that started and you started really getting articles and stuff

350
00:18:20.751 --> 00:18:24.230
and like Rob Boin and Rick baker the week became like rock stars to the,

351
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:25.363
the horn nerds.

352
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:35.180
<v 2>I.</v>
