00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. You know,</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.080
I didn't know about standup comedy, uh, when I was growing up,

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.630
never heard of it really, because I grew up in Hong Kong.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
We didn't first hand up, you saw B T comic. Phew.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.720
<v 1>Wow. When I was 13 one who was holding.</v>

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.820
<v 0>I think it was J Anthony Brown, that deer or Bruce,</v>

7
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.620
Bruce around then it was so interesting to me because this wasn't even an

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.010
art form that existed in my childhood in Hong Kong.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.100
I'm sure there were some stand-ups, but I never heard of it. Never heard of it,

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.820
never heard of it.

11
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.880
And then I came to America and I was trying to learn English just by watching

12
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:33.714
TV.

13
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.910
And then it seems like just completely different genres in this new

14
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.280
art form. It's like, I heard music for the first time and I was like, holy,

15
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.190
this rock and roll music. And there's, you know, hip hop.

16
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.750
So it was so interesting because I remember I really gravitated towards a comic

17
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.810
view. Uh, that was so interesting. Um,

18
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.040
because it wasn't just jokes or, uh, me trying to learn English.

19
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:58.800
It was me also trying to like, learning about culture,

20
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.790
how each race saw each other, blah, blah. Even though there were stereotypes,

21
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.730
you know, that they're joking about, but it was cool.

22
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.560
Whereas I watch a comedy central premium blend then really laugh.

23
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.470
I don't know why, like, so I always gravitated to it. So urban comedy,

24
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.730
you know, and, and, and where they're having more fun. Yeah, exactly. But that,

25
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.360
because I was watching a performance of it, it's like there's hip hop fans that,

26
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.730
uh, like a song because of the beat.

27
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.450
And then there's hip hop fans that don't care about the beat and only listen to

28
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:33.780
the lyrics. I was more like the beat guy, you know,

29
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:35.430
and I just loved that side of performance.

30
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.790
And then only later on when I got into comedy, I was like, oh wow,

31
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.420
everyone that's doing that premium blend stuff. May, maybe not my cup of tea,

32
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
but it made me laugh like as an adult because I understood how

33
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:48.084
hard that was.

34
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.750
<v 2>Mm. Yeah. Uh, I found out about comedy from, um,</v>

35
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.380
my parents took me to see Richard Pryor live at the sunset strip when I was 15.

36
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.020
Mm. In the movie theater watching Richard Pryor on stage going, this is crazy.

37
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.740
I couldn't believe how funny he was. Like, I'd seen all these funny movies,

38
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.210
but to watch this guy just talking on stage, I was fascinated of those.

39
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.790
<v 0>Guys when you watch you, like, I can do that. Cause he's just talking.</v>

40
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:15.500
He just did he write this?

41
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.830
But there's so much insane talent.

42
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.340
Like Michael Jordan makes basketball look easy. But I mean, I guess you.

43
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.130
<v 1>Sort of, you know, you can't, you know, you can't talk. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

44
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.430
<v 2>There's, there's so many different ways you can get introduced to comedy.</v>

45
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.250
It's it's I love hearing, like, when people, like,

46
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:36.980
when the seed get planted in people's heads,

47
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.650
like when did you know that you were going to try to do this?

48
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.700
<v 0>People asked me that question and I hear like great stories.</v>

49
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.020
Like the Richard Pryor story,

50
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.600
like it's like me and my brother used to sneak in a movie theater,

51
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:50.420
watch Eddie Murphy live after you had heart attack.

52
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:54.110
I promise I'll be a comedian. Like really, you know, I'm amazing.

53
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.400
I don't have that. I was,

54
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:59.380
I think it was a desperation that made me want to do comedy desperation.

55
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.090
I never thought that was, um, even a thing. Right. Like,

56
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.870
because you don't go in the arts when you're Asian, that's not a real job,

57
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.940
you know? Uh.

58
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.850
<v 2>So is it because your family would discourage it?</v>

59
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.870
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also nobody in my family did it in the arts,</v>

60
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.430
like anybody that made money, wasn't finance, whatever real jobs, quote unquote,

61
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.270
you know? Um, so I, I was just,

62
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.250
I was about to graduate college with an economics degree and I hated the

63
00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:33.450
internship I had in finance and. And I just saw my life flash in front of me.

64
00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:37.590
I'm like, oh my God, for the next 40 years, I'm behind this desk, mutual funds,

65
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:41.790
who cares? You know? Uh, so I just tried, I had like a quarter-life crisis,

66
00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:43.350
right. When I was about to graduate, I was like,

67
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:46.410
I gotta do something to meet new friends, to meet girls to whatever.

68
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.880
So then I took jujitsu classes for like two months. Horrible. I was,

69
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.000
I was the smallest guy in the weakest guy in the class.

70
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.730
They would tee me up with the girls and they will twist me up like a pretzel.

71
00:03:56.731 --> 00:03:57.564
It was.

72
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.220
<v 1>Very discouraging. I.</v>

73
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.410
<v 0>Quit after like two months, if that, um, uh,</v>

74
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:07.350
and then I tried like different things like boxing classes, uh, gyms, uh,

75
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.940
whatever, you know, and then I say the story, I,

76
00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:14.250
I wrote this book and I say in the book,

77
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:19.110
like typing in local, open mics in your Google search,

78
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.070
it's one step away from typing in. What's the best way to kill myself.

79
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.810
It is that desperation that you need that I needed.

80
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.280
So then I just Googled local open mics, went through ha paid $5.

81
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.870
You have to pay $5 for five minutes of stage, time to ha so five other, uh,

82
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.980
comics can not laugh at you. It was no horrific,

83
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.810
but that still, it felt better than me sitting at home, making no friends.

84
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.720
Cause I saw a comradery. I was like, if I'm good,

85
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:52.980
I can make some friends like here in the open mic. And there's a new world out.

86
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.020
There's an out for me. So soon after I think I quit that finance, you know,

87
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.280
internship, very promising internship. And I just try to do standup. You know,

88
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:05.970
I did everything. I worked at door. I, uh,

89
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.220
at the comedy palace in San Diego,

90
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:11.880
this Greek restaurant I'll turn into a comedy club at night. I worked the door,

91
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:14.580
folded envelopes, did everything. If they let me sleep there,

92
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:18.360
I would have slept it, answer the phones and everything. I just dove into it,

93
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.040
not just for the love of comedy and the arts, but for the love of this new life,

94
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:23.874
this new fraternity.

95
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.150
<v 2>Oh yeah. That's awesome.</v>

96
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.830
<v 0>So, so a lot of it,</v>

97
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:33.750
it was an improvement on my life that was that interested

98
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:37.920
me in, in standup and through stand-up I got laid for the first time.

99
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.560
<v 1>You know what I mean? So it worked out.</v>

100
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.730
<v 0>For me. Um, and I kinda had a, uh, crisis where,</v>

101
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.350
okay, uh, I'm doing fine. You know, I have a lot of friends now I have,

102
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.270
uh, you know, I go on dates. Like it's fine. Like my life is fine.

103
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.030
And I started making money on Silicon valley, you know?

104
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.370
So I stopped doing standup. I was like, eh, I don't really need this. You know,

105
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.700
but, but then after a while, like I wasn't getting depressed either.

106
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:08.750
So it was a really good feeling. Cause it wasn't a crutch.

107
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.700
It wasn't an addiction I needed to feed. And then eventually I did stand up.

108
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.840
Finally, I think for the love of it, I was like, you know what I do miss this.

109
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.550
I'm going to go do it on my own terms.

110
00:06:19.551 --> 00:06:23.930
Not just because I'm trying to make friends and trying to pull girls I'm doing

111
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.340
it because I enjoy the process of it. So let's do it. And that's the recent,

112
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:33.110
I guess, resurgent of energy. How much time did you take off? Two.

113
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.120
Oh, from standup on and off, like a year or two,

114
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.970
a couple seasons during Silicon valley. Um, I would do standup,

115
00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:44.450
maybe at max.

116
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.700
I would just go down the comedy magic club once every two months just

117
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.120
so I can, uh, you know, talk to some friends or something, but I.

118
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.070
<v 2>Wasn't any dusted off and.</v>

119
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.750
<v 0>Yeah, but it was stuck in that same old material wasn't filling it. Um,</v>

120
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.860
and the reason for this special really was I kinda got.

121
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.830
I was cause everybody that was coming up to me in the streets,

122
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:11.390
like yo Jinjiang Silicon valley, whatever. And uh, there's some YouTube clips,

123
00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:13.070
people watching me doing it. I was like, oh, I didn't know.

124
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:17.840
This can do stand up. You know? And blah, I'm like, man, I am a standup.

125
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.500
I started as a standup. I think I'm a better standard than I am an actor.

126
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.740
You know? So let me prove to the world.

127
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.120
I'm not just like a vine guy or act to trying to do stand up.

128
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.760
I am an actor who used to be a standup and that is my forte. Okay.
