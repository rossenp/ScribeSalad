00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So are you officially retiring?</v>

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.640
<v 1>I'm not officially retiring. I am sort of, I guess,</v>

3
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.440
indefinitely on the sidelines right now.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.520
I am,

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.000
I am actively seeing more doctors and working

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.310
towards learning more about this. I obviously,

7
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.590
I want to keep fighting. It's this.

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.150
<v 0>Gentleman in LA, uh, Dr. Wong, is that what your name? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.</v>

9
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.030
So he had done these operations on, you said MMA fighters.

10
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.030
<v 1>Uh, I don't know if he operated on, he, he mentioned boxers and NFL players.</v>

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.630
I don't know if he operated on them.

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.300
He had seen it in them and helped them continue their careers.

13
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:46.620
And he keeps like a close eye. So, you know,

14
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.300
I need to get scans done at least once a year or every.

15
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.420
<v 0>Six months that patch the large patch in the back of your head.</v>

16
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:55.420
Was that particularly troubling to him more than.

17
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.540
<v 1>The other ones? No. No.</v>

18
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.220
He said like that it was in the best location possible to get to, yes,

19
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.050
because it's not deep in it. It's not in an area where it could affect my,

20
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.730
my cognitive functions, my memory, things like that. What goes.

21
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.563
<v 0>On back there.</v>

22
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.410
<v 1>Back there, you know, I'm not a hundred percent sure. Uh, they made it, I mean,</v>

23
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:20.090
he made it sound like nothing too important happens there. It's more like,

24
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.920
seems weird. I know, like I, the back area,

25
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.200
as far as what I've learned thus far is more like everyday type

26
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.240
of stuff. You know, it's not your memory,

27
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.480
it's not in a position where you could

28
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.480
violently lose your temper or kind of like have like a, a lapse in time,

29
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.670
you know, mm-hmm, &lt;affirmative&gt; where you kind of become someone else.

30
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.870
And then you come back, like, you know,

31
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.510
that all that kind of stuff happens more deep inside the brain. Okay. Uh,

32
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:54.590
where it's at on the outside and the back is just sort of like the regular

33
00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.030
stuff, you know.

34
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.870
<v 0>Obviously neither of us are neurosurgeons the way we're describing it,</v>

35
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.660
the regular stuff, uh, the area of the regular stuff. Yeah. So, um,

36
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.580
are you thinking about going in there and getting it removed?

37
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.660
<v 1>No. No, it is. It is recommended against why is that doing?</v>

38
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.540
Cause why do brain surgery? If I don't have any symptoms, that's,

39
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:19.980
that's what he says. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and you know, cuz I was up for it.

40
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:22.460
I said, Hey, should we just do this? And he is like, look,

41
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:25.690
it'll probably be six more months to a year before I would say,

42
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.690
it's okay to go back into sparring and things like that. Mm. Um, you know,

43
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.330
you're gonna be able to walk out and be fine and do your day to day stuff,

44
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:35.770
but I don't want you getting hit in the head for a while. Of course. And why,

45
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.570
I mean, it's a low risk surgery,

46
00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.290
but why take that risk if you're not having symptoms? The, the,

47
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.040
the treatment or the care is always just to keep an eye on it,

48
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.120
see how it develops. And if you start having some problems,

49
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.600
then we're gonna go in there and remove it. But if you.

50
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.800
<v 0>Say that you're indefinitely on the sidelines, it's,</v>

51
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960
it seems to me that unless you get it removed,

52
00:02:56.961 --> 00:02:58.080
you're permanently on the sidelines.

53
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 1>Well, I, you know, this is where I'm at now, you know? Um,</v>

54
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.800
this is such a, a rare and unique thing.

55
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.280
No one really knows too much, you know, I'm getting some people that are saying.

56
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.360
<v 0>No, no way mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then I'm getting these other, you know,</v>

57
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.400
specialists and people that have really dealt with it that are like, yeah,

58
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.990
it's okay. I am, like I said, it's indefinite. How old?

59
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.430
I just wanna I'm 36.

60
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.390
So you're in this mean realistically athletically, this is sort of the.

61
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.550
<v 1>Last chapter of your career. Oh yes. Oh yes. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.510
And this is how I wanted to end it, you know, as the champ, trying to, uh,

63
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.340
myself as one of the great champ of this era and, um,

64
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.940
you know, defend that belt as long as possible and, you know, say goodbye.

65
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.420
Um, but I still have hope. I still have hope that,

66
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.093
um,

67
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.300
if I can continue seeing more doctors and getting more knowledge, um,

68
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.170
you know,

69
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.410
Andy foster from the athletic commission has rec recommended another doctor to

70
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:05.010
see I'm not officially declined, um,

71
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.610
for the California state athletic commission at this point. Um,

72
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.850
did Andy foster talk.

73
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.650
<v 0>To this Dr. Wong who specifically said he didn't think it was.</v>

74
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.610
<v 1>Gonna be a problem? No, not yet. No, not yet.</v>

75
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.930
But he recommended another doctor at UCLA that actually used to work on the

76
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.000
flood commission. Um, that could be a big help. And I mean,

77
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:25.400
this is I'm right in the middle of this.

78
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.400
So I'm just gonna keep seeing more doctors and try to learn more about this.

79
00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.600
And, you know, if it's,

80
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.960
if it's really unsafe and I'm not gonna get approved ever,

81
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.680
I finally got to a place where I can accept that, you know, and, uh,

82
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.790
and I'm gonna move forward on with my life teaching and doing what I do,

83
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.910
you know, uh, at home and, um, and with all of my students worldwide. But,

84
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.230
um, but as I,

85
00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.510
if I'm still getting people like Dr. Wong and the Dr. AAN Brazil,

86
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.670
and I can find more doctors who have experience with this,

87
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.140
if they keep saying that they think it's okay then, uh, and I can,

88
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.340
you know, have hope of getting approved. I'm gonna keep fighting for that.

89
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:10.140
Where.

90
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.900
<v 0>Where can you get approved? What states could approve you right now?</v>

91
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 1>Well, that's tricky to know because, um, you know, uh,</v>

92
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.890
as far as in the us, only in New York and California require brain scans.

93
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.530
And so that's, you know, a big thing of what I want to talk about, you know, or,

94
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:32.370
or what I wanted to bring awareness to is like, you know,

95
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.170
all these other states don't require scans. So, uh, if you,

96
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.010
if you fight in those states, you know, um, it's,

97
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.080
to me it's a, of, in your best interest to on your own, if you have the means,

98
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.120
if you have insurance or whatever, get a scan done, you know,

99
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.040
to see what what's, what it looks like for sure. Um,

100
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.560
but I'm hoping that through this,

101
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.080
we can figure out if Caverno is safe or not.

102
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.920
The more doctors I have looking at this and, um, you know,

103
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.240
talking about it, bringing awareness to it,

104
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.200
that we're gonna learn and understand more of this disease.

105
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.000
And if it's possible, if it's not possible, um,

106
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.400
but I'm trying to keep the hope alive that if, if it's six months, a year,

107
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.950
even two years, that maybe I can at least get one more, you know,

108
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.870
at least get one more. Um,

109
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.110
but the thing is them putting me in a state that doesn't require a scan

110
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:29.950
doesn't necessarily mean I'm gonna get approved because these other commissions

111
00:06:29.951 --> 00:06:32.790
have a responsibility to speak up and say, Hey,

112
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.100
we don't think it's of his best interest, you know, wise right. To,

113
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.260
to compete. And you know, I'm not, I don't, I'm not, uh,

114
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.260
I'm not against the commission. I totally understand and respect that. Andy,

115
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:49.220
Foster's one of the very best yes. In the business.

116
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.300
He's so ahead of everybody else. And he, they,

117
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:57.060
they opened up a time for me to come out next month and speak with him face to

118
00:06:57.061 --> 00:07:00.090
face, um, uh, you know,

119
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:05.410
and get to see the people that are making the decisions and learn more

120
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.610
and understand more of their position and, and you know, how they feel about it.

121
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.330
Uh, and I'm just trying to gather up as much information in the meantime.

122
00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.730
Would it be possible to do that with Dr. Wong? I hope so. Um,

123
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.080
that's the plan and hopefully a few more mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; um, that's, uh,

124
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:24.000
that's what I'm working on. That's what I'm in the middle of. And until then,

125
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.960
I'm just gonna keep training and trying to stay positive. Who do you have a, uh,

126
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:32.800
match with a jujitsu match? Well, it hasn't been announced yet, but, uh,

127
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:35.480
I'm gonna be facing &lt;laugh&gt;. I mean, it's about to come out.

128
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:38.120
It's less than a month away now. Um, February 21st,

129
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:42.190
I'll be facing Roberto cyborg in a no gate grappling match. Um,

130
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.870
he's a big fella. Yes, yes. What was that dude weigh?

131
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.390
Probably in the neighborhood of two 40, maybe a little more. Yeah.

132
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.750
We've had a few matches in the past and he's a great guy. He's a legend as well.

133
00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:01.340
Like just, you know, one of the best ever, um, from my time. And, uh,

134
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.500
it'll be fun. And that's what I wanna do in the meantime is keep myself sharp,

135
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.340
keep competing, keep training, and hopefully get another opportunity.

136
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.100
But if not, at least learn more about this and hopefully,

137
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.810
you know, um, inspire others to get it checked out. You know,

138
00:08:20.811 --> 00:08:25.130
even if you're not in a combat sport, you know, or doing anything risky,

139
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.370
just like the same would, same thing you would do like to go get a checkup,

140
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.850
you know, Hey, at some point in your life, it wouldn't hurt. Yeah.

141
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.650
To get a scan done. Yeah. You know,

142
00:08:34.651 --> 00:08:39.610
it just really opened my eyes to how we don't know what what's going

143
00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:42.480
on up there and something could happen, you know,

144
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.960
and you don't have an answer to it. Um,

145
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.440
but if you knew what was in your brain, maybe you would have that answer. Yeah.

146
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:54.560
It seems like such a tricky situation to be in, because if you do.

147
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.000
<v 0>Decide to do something about it,</v>

148
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.160
you really kind of almost have to do it now. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; right.

149
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:06.120
Because at 36 with a full year off of no sparring at all,

150
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.640
or he said six months to a year mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

151
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:11.400
So he would have to see you a couple times, maybe do another scan. Yeah.

152
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:13.440
And see where you're at. Let's say six months. Well,

153
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:17.070
six months is like an ACE C surgery. Not that bad. Right. But a year is like,

154
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:20.350
Ooh, now we're into 37, 37 and a half. Yeah.

155
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.110
And then you gotta get in real tiptop shape again. Um,

00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:53.380
