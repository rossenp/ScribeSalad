WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.590
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. One it's, these are bad decisions as, as, as, as,</v>

2
00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.400
as we look back in history and we look at Iraq in

3
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:12.650
particular, and we look at, you know, the, the,

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.610
the tens of thousands of service members that served in Iraq to include myself.

5
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.400
I don't know if they want to be reminded of that,

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.240
that section of our history on a regular basis either.

7
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.900
And so when we have amputees and we have health issues with the burn pits,

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.410
that really I think is, is our cause or, uh,

9
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.940
that we need to talk about as our agent orange is, you know,

10
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:39.110
I think John Stewart just recently brought it up. We're active in, uh,

11
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.380
the hunter seven foundation, which does a lot of research in this,

12
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:46.430
but there's zero reason why the government is not

13
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.830
funding to the tune of millions,

14
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:52.730
of dollars of research to figure out what's happening to the service members

15
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:57.320
with their directly related, you know, lung and health issues from burn pits.

16
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:02.240
There's zero reason because the only reason is because if they acknowledge that

17
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:03.830
it's a problem, they're going to have to pay.

18
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.900
<v 1>For it to explain burn pits to people. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.663
<v 0>Um, it's, uh,</v>

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.110
it was essentially a big pet where you would put all of your garbage,

21
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.970
everything, everything. So that's batteries, that's all the plastics,

22
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.980
it's anything and everything that is Ricky glider. Yeah. It's fecal matter.

23
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:25.760
It's tires. It's anything that is directly associated with,

24
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.610
uh, your living condition in a war that you need to, to get rid of.

25
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.650
And you had shoved it all into a pit,

26
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.050
and then it would burn 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

27
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.420
Wow. And yes.

28
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.770
<v 2>And how close is this to where you guys were living? Uh.</v>

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.080
<v 0>In every one of the fire bases I was at, uh,</v>

30
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.280
four and a half years is how much time I have on the ground in Iraq on every one

31
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.640
of my fire bases. There was a burn pit. And.

32
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.340
<v 3>Not only that, you're going to have young privates out there with sticks,</v>

33
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.790
rolling it over in the smoke with probably some, you know, knitted,

34
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.620
fake mask that they're wearing that they got.

35
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:06.920
And they're the ones in there actually rotating the trash to burn it through

36
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:07.431
completely.

37
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.630
So they're completely subjected to that environment from a very long time.

38
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.510
<v 2>Whose idea was that.</v>

39
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.760
<v 0>Uh, really smart, really, really smart, uh, you know,</v>

40
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.150
officers and contractors, the same guys that decided that, you know,

41
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:26.120
the invasion was going to be a really good idea of Iraq.

42
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:28.760
They're the same people making those types of decisions in the way that,

43
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.560
you know, obviously when,

44
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:36.260
when we look at this now and we look back on it and we go, that's dumb as.

45
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.350
There was somebody in a series of people at that point in time in 2003 to

46
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:45.890
2009 and Iraq that were saying, this is a good idea.

47
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.550
And that type of mentality, I think,

48
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:51.740
is the same type of mentality today that says,

49
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:55.190
this is a good idea for not for us, not to fund the research,

50
00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:59.120
to figure out what the is going on. So we can do something about,

51
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.150
and when we talk about it, right, or our voices are only so big.

52
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.490
But I think if people knew what was happening with our generation of veterans,

53
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:14.110
because you know, I'm 43, you're 33, 30, 4, 34.

54
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.650
You've got all these guys that are coming up with strange

55
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.020
cancers, like weird. One of the Jocko's friends and our friends,

56
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:24.760
he just died of cancer. He's a medal of honor.

57
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:29.740
Recipient had a strange heart organ cancers kind of

58
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:34.720
cancer in his back, and he's died six months down the road and what's happening.

59
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.740
And when we talk about the other foundations and people that are diving into

60
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:41.380
some of this research, it's incredibly underfunded.

61
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.320
They're starting to have this direct connection between the burn pits

62
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:50.230
themselves and the chemicals that ultimately were exposed to,

63
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:51.430
or were exposed to.

64
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.330
And a lot of the cancers that guys are coming to me when I say that they're

65
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.230
developing, I.

66
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.630
<v 2>Guess obviously. Yeah. I mean, it has to be, there's no way. That's.</v>

67
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.160
<v 1>Good for you. There's no way. And that's in the same camp. Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

68
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.750
Right there on the farm, you would.

69
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.010
<v 0>Have to put, I would, I would take a towel and I would wet it.</v>

70
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.820
And then I would put it down underneath my, my, my,

71
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.750
my door going into this little container or shipping container.

72
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.700
And I would put another one on the top,

73
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.870
just so I could just so I could sleep the rest of the evening because the smoke

74
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:27.690
was so bad from the burn pits, as it would move in,

75
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.510
you couldn't sleep because you couldn't sleep without coughing.

76
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.940
And it was going, that was every day, depending on your, on your fire base,

77
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.520
it was every day. So it wasn't the fact that, Hey man,

78
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.160
I got all my fingers and toes, right. You know.

79
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.390
<v 4>I survived seven years.</v>

80
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.360
<v 3>A counter argument to that would be like, well,</v>

81
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.030
whatever idiots you signed up for it. But if.

82
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.850
<v 4>That's not an argument, I know someone say that.</v>

83
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:53.520
But I think that if you're willing to and those people, yeah, exactly.

84
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.750
<v 3>If you're willing to spend a hundred thousand to a million dollars on a guy or a</v>

85
00:04:57.751 --> 00:04:59.760
gal to train them up, to do a specific job,

86
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.490
because you look at how much it costs to put them through training and school

87
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.390
after school, after school, and then they get out and we're just like have fun,

88
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.480
especially guys and gals, like we're talking tier one units.

89
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:13.080
I have friends that have done 16, 17, 18 deployments.

90
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.760
And it's an injustice because they're willing to sacrifice their life,

91
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.040
limb and body and eyesight for, you know,

92
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.580
I guess the politicians assembled a war, but then it's, it's,

93
00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:26.700
it's a moral obligation as our society that we have to look out for them when

94
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.470
they come back, it's not happening. It's.

95
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.610
<v 2>Insane that this is prevalent, that they have these burn pits at every base.</v>

96
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.870
That's insane.

97
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.040
<v 0>And for the most part, most people don't.</v>

98
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.770
<v 2>Was this Jamie and Afghanistan, uh,</v>

99
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.930
at its peak more than 400 tons of waste was disposed using burn pits daily.

100
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.790
Jesus Christ. Yeah. But, and then the question is like, what else do you do?

101
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.340
Like San Francisco fog,

102
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.190
one soldier described the smoke as thick as San Francisco fog,

103
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.310
every called it like pollen dust.

104
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.720
The color of smoke could be blue and black or yellow and orange. However,

105
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.620
it was mostly black, everyone inhaled and ingested it,

106
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.620
it was absorbed by their skin.

107
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.550
<v 3>Which is, which is interesting because, you know,</v>

108
00:06:12.551 --> 00:06:15.220
I think a lot of people that have deployed, if you said, Hey,

109
00:06:15.221 --> 00:06:17.620
we got to get this trash burn. You know, we gotta do it.

110
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:19.180
Like we signed up for it, we got it.

111
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.130
But then you gotta give them the research and the medical clinicians that

112
00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:25.360
understand this going forward.

113
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:28.390
And after the fact to actually hopefully not die like.

114
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.050
<v 4>This from cancer. No, no, no. You got to not do that. No, I agree.</v>

115
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:32.884
But I'm saying.

116
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.870
<v 2>But there's no way you would say, Hey,</v>

117
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.080
let's let these guys breathe in this and then take care of them. No,

118
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:38.950
you should not burn that.

119
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.160
They've got to figure out another way to get rid of it. Agreed. I mean,

120
00:06:42.161 --> 00:06:45.610
but even landfills are terrible. One of the things they're finding out in these,

121
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:49.840
when they're doing these satellite overviews is that methane like meth.

122
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:52.750
Like they're trying to find like the largest sources of methane and what's

123
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:57.070
contributing to greenhouse gases. It's landfills, right? Landfills,

124
00:06:57.071 --> 00:06:59.680
where you take all your food, they pour it into the ground.

125
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:00.730
They just cover it up with dirt.

126
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.020
And it's just leaking methane into the atmosphere. It's terrible. Like,

127
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:06.430
I don't know what the solution is,

128
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:09.340
but the solution is definitely not burn it right where the soldiers are

129
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:11.650
sleeping. No. And I think that.

130
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:16.000
<v 0>Now that as we continue to, to evolve,</v>

131
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:20.590
hopefully as a society and we look at the way that we deploy service members

132
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:24.280
overseas, we've at least identified this as a problem.

133
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:25.920
But the,

134
00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:30.430
the big thing that I see is we have to continue to look at the

135
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:34.780
problem and fund the research and look at the direct connection between

136
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.700
these types of activities, meaning burn pits. We're,

137
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:41.980
we're looking at burn pit and I'm saying that's burned pit, but it's also know,

138
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:45.340
I know Tim, obviously he's been on the podcast. He's SF guy,

139
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:47.140
w w I'm an SF guy.

140
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.000
But when we look at the long-term effects of we'll call it the special

141
00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:56.350
operations community, because I'm, I'm obviously from that subculture,

142
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.600
but sleep deprivation.

143
00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:03.340
Anti-inflammatories your anti-malarials burn pits, multiple rotations,

144
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:04.174
PTs.

145
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.830
This is a holistic health issue for the most of these guys returning.

146
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.040
If they don't have direct or visible combat wounds,

147
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:14.860
they have some type of residual, uh,

148
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.460
they'd been affected by the war in a long-term residual way.

149
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.980
And I think what happens is, as the VA continues to evolve,

150
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:28.540
at least past these wars, we have to look to look at it as a collective and say,

151
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.610
how do we make turn everybody's attention within the VA system

152
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.830
to directly take care of these guys in a very positive and impactful way.

153
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:43.240
So we don't have people like Mary dag that get denied a full-time service

154
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:47.980
giver, a caregiver. How does that stand now? Is it still the way it is right.

155
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:49.660
<v 3>Now? That was like five days ago.</v>

156
00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:51.580
I haven't talked to her since I'm actually gonna call her after this.

157
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.610
<v 4>But yeah. At least give the resources.</v>

158
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.890
<v 3>And the necessary,</v>

159
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.640
because I'm sure VA as an organization wants to do good and correct to do great

160
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:02.310
things. I think that when people just say the VA sucks,

161
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.110
it's the wrong way to look at us. It's the way it's,

162
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.190
how do we critically think and solve the problem then put in process and a plan

163
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.080
to go. Here's the resources you need.

164
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:14.170
So we can fix the issues that are right in front of her face. Couldn't.

165
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.160
<v 2>Imagine being a VA bean counter,</v>

166
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.800
or being someone who works for a VA bean counter,

167
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.550
who gets the call that you have to like cut the budget by X amount.

168
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.770
So figure out where you're going to S slash these benefits like w and

169
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:29.480
then you have to look at these people that you're talking to,

170
00:09:29.481 --> 00:09:32.680
either on the phone or through email, you can't even look at them as a human.

171
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.710
You gotta look at them as a number on a ledger. That's crazy. And then.

172
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:41.360
<v 0>You have, you know, incredible giving nation that backfills,</v>

173
00:09:41.361 --> 00:09:46.040
that need through, you know, nonprofit organizations. Yeah.

174
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.060
I guess my only intent in that conversation is I think the government needs to

175
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:54.350
do a much better job of leading the conversation than being towed around by the

176
00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:57.320
entire conversation. They need to get out in front of it.

177
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.800
I have to take responsibility for it. And I think that's the big one,

178
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:05.450
which is taking responsibility for, you know, war just in general,

179
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.680
and then taking responsibility for the aftereffects of the individual soldiers,

180
00:10:09.681 --> 00:10:10.700
sailors, Marines.

181
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.440
Post-war that just seems to me the thing to do.

182
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.340
And I think most people, if they realize these things were happening,

183
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.220
I think the last time I tried to schedule a VA appointment,

184
00:10:22.221 --> 00:10:25.280
it was going to take me 200 plus days to get in,

185
00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:30.140
to see a physician, you know, about a shoulder injury.

186
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.230
<v 1>Really. Yeah. 200.</v>

187
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:37.760
<v 0>Days to get on the list and I'm going to be special. I'm not,</v>

188
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.010
I'm not missing anything. Right.

189
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.760
But there are a lot of people that have been directly affected by this,

190
00:10:43.761 --> 00:10:46.370
that need care. And now we have the ability, I think,

191
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:50.630
and based on the current administration to go see a primary care provider

192
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:54.140
outside of the VA, which I think was a huge step. Uh,

193
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.860
but there's still a lot to do. Right. And there's, you know,

194
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:02.630
for us having this company and what we're doing with it, you know,

195
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.550
it's a big, it's a big part of the mission of how we run the company,

196
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:09.050
what we're doing with the company.

197
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.970
<v 2>So, so the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>

198
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.090
They're free from September 1st is December 1st.

199
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.520
They're going to be available everywhere, but after December 1st,

200
00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:23.240
they will only be available on Spotify, but they will be free.

201
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:27.230
That includes the video. The video will also be there. It'll also be free.

202
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.030
That's all we're asking. Just go download Spotify much. Buh-bye.
