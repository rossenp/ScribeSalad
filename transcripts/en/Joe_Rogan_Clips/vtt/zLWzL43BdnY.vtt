WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.880
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. But as you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:05.720
and as you've talked about extensively, Joe,

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.120
this wave of censorship mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

4
00:00:08.121 --> 00:00:12.000
that has happened in the last two years since Trump got elected because of

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.440
Russian propaganda and fake news hysteria. Yeah.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.880
And it's just propped up these same institutions. Um,

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.190
and it's really just gone after a lot of alternative and independent media that

8
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:25.990
have gone by the wayside. Yeah. Um, and you know,

9
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.870
people who have been propped up by right wing billionaires and billionaires in

10
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:31.270
general are not going to be affected at the end of the day.

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.030
But all of the people who have been caught up in this censorship with the

12
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.830
algorithms, with the deep platforming, um, it's really scary. It's really,

13
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.870
really scary. What's.

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.380
<v 1>It is scary to me because the internet in my eyes is this unique</v>

15
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.260
place where people can get information and distribute information mm-hmm

16
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.500
&lt;affirmative&gt;. And then on top of that,

17
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.900
you have this almost parasitic entity

18
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.010
that is allowing you to distribute information and gather

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.410
information through it,

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.570
but also controlling the flow of information mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and then

21
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.450
controlling the flow in its own ideological bend,

22
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.050
like what to,

23
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:20.530
to sort of match its own ideas of what shouldn't shouldn't happen.

24
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.280
And I think they feel just by having a guy like Trump in office,

25
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.560
having a guy like Trump come into office and then go, well,

26
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:28.640
we have to do something about that.

27
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:31.160
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna silence, conservative voices.

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.440
We're gonna silence conservative pundits. We're gonna silence.

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.600
We call people alt right,

30
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.840
and just change our algorithms to make it much more difficult for them to get

31
00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:43.790
propagate for them to propagate their ideas. I,

32
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.830
I just find that really distressing because I think that in the,

33
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.590
the marketplace of ideas,

34
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.030
you you're supposed to be able to combat a bad idea with a better

35
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.670
idea. And this is how we, this is how ideas evolve.

36
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.380
This is how people get to communicate. You get to look at what someone's saying,

37
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.140
look at someone how someone's dissecting, what someone's saying.

38
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.740
And then for yourself, figure out what you believe and what you don't believe.

39
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.540
And there should be a free exchange of information so that you could figure that

40
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:15.660
out. And when you show,

41
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:20.380
when someone's shown to be a bad actor or a liar or show have deceptive news,

42
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.460
fake news, whatever you wanna call it. Okay.

43
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.210
Now we know this is a clear example of that.

44
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.090
So now take it with a grain of salt.

45
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.490
Whenever they say anything about anything else,

46
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.850
but when you deplatform them and shove them aside, they say, see,

47
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.850
they're trying to silence us cuz they don't believe us or, or they, they don't,

48
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:39.010
they don't want us to be in power because they're trying to, you know,

49
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.290
prop up whatever left wing,

50
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.960
socialist economy that or dictator they wanna put into place.

51
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.560
And it's this weird sort of situation where you've got people dictating and

52
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:53.080
almost engineering our culture, right? Curating.

53
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.880
<v 0>Our reality.</v>

54
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.920
<v 1>Yes. You know what's going on in Toronto? No. With alphabet,</v>

55
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.480
the parent company of Google. No,

56
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.840
it's a very disturbing thing to a lot of people where they're essentially

57
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.000
setting up blocks and they're putting cameras in these places and they're

58
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:12.160
gathering data and information and they're trying to engineer a utopian city.

59
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.720
Yeah. I was reading about it yesterday and I was like, no, &lt;laugh&gt; like,

60
00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:20.190
this is a terrible idea is so fun and terrifying.

61
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.950
What if these people don't wanna be filmed?

62
00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:27.230
What if these people don't want information gathered about them? Like they're,

63
00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:29.510
they're, they're doing it under the guise of here.

64
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.590
It is Alphabet's plan for Toronto. Depends on huge amounts of data. Great.

65
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.390
<v 0>Yeah. We need more data collection, data.</v>

66
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.950
<v 1>Mining. Their idea is that they're going to make it easier for people to,</v>

67
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.020
to get around and smoother. But how I dunno by.

68
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.500
<v 0>Like facial recognition, I love how they always say, oh,</v>

69
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.700
people are being sex trafficked and this will help. It's like, no, dude,

70
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:52.580
this is like 0, 0, 0 1% of all the people that you're, you know, data mining.

71
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.940
<v 1>It says sidewalks labs released more detailed plans for Toronto.</v>

72
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.610
The site of Google's sister companies first attempt to bring its techified

73
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.610
digital forward sensibility to a full scale development project.

74
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.810
The sidewalks lab sidewalk labs projects dates to 2017.

75
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:14.370
When the Canadian city welcomed the company to an undeveloped section of its

76
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:18.170
waterfront. Now after 18 months of speculation work, oh God,

77
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:22.960
God these to specially you can work in backlash from local

78
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.740
advocates.

79
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.520
The company has a 1,524 page master plan for the 12,

80
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.440
12 acre lot called quaside. First of all, I hate the name. What is this qua?

81
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.840
What is quaside four volume plan highlights, ambitions,

82
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.600
and sometimes flashy innovations from sidewalk labs,

83
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.750
which is play pledge to spend 1.3 billion on the project. If it goes forward,

84
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.950
the company hopes to construct all the buildings with timber,

85
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.950
which it says is better for the environment.

86
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.870
It also catches fire and build an underground pneummaticd pneumatic tube

87
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.390
system for garbage removal. It wants residents to lean on public transit,

88
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.780
walking and biking rather than personal vehicle goes. Good luck.

89
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:06.580
It's zero degrees in Toronto and plans to build streets with autonomous

90
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:09.180
vehicles, perhaps from a sister company, Waymo,

91
00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.780
they listen delivery robotsmo do you know what WAMO is? No, no, I don't need,

92
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.220
uh, delivery robots might Trendle down its wide sidewalks.

93
00:05:17.221 --> 00:05:21.810
The strategic use of large, very large umbrella like coverings might be ache,

94
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:25.570
outdoor spaces comfortable all year round, no small fruit in lake shore,

95
00:05:25.571 --> 00:05:30.490
Canada sidewalks sidewalk wants to designate 20% of its

96
00:05:30.491 --> 00:05:34.650
of the apartments to as affordable and another 20% as middle income.

97
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.690
So they're they're engineering. It's so weird. Yeah. A city. Yeah. Right.

98
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.440
This is by people who are really just openly social justice

99
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.920
warriors. I mean,

100
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.680
these are the people that censored that James de more guy and,

101
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:52.360
and fired him for having this memo that really kind of discussed women in tech

102
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.640
based on evolutionary biology based on studies. And they,

103
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:00.600
they said that he was highlighting harmful gender stereotypes, which it,

104
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.320
it's not true. It's not accurate.

105
00:06:02.321 --> 00:06:04.280
If you look at what he actually said and what he actually wrote,

106
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.600
even had a page and a half dedicated in that memo,

107
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.840
trying to come up with strategic ways to encourage women,

108
00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:13.360
to get into technology. The study that, or the,

109
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.230
the paper that James demoour wrote has no relation to the way he's been

110
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.710
framed and the way people talk about him.

111
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:24.630
This is a direct result of Google and Google's social justice warrior, um,

112
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.270
sort of ethos like the way they operate as a company. Well, Google.

113
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.270
<v 0>Pretends to be, you know, don't be evil. This is, this seems stop algorithm.</v>

114
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.110
<v 1>That they don't be evil. They took that down. That which,</v>

115
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.180
why the would you ever, we take that now. They're.

116
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.940
<v 0>Like, okay, where are evil now? But this,</v>

117
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.900
this just seems like they like plugged in some an algorithm. And they're like,

118
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:44.140
all right, this is our city now.

119
00:06:44.141 --> 00:06:48.460
Like we they're creating Sims it's but I control, I mean, Google, I,

120
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.180
I agree with David. Pacman's kind of depiction on Google.

121
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.540
I think that they're a giant corporation.

122
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:57.460
They have billions offoffshore tax havens and they,

123
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.530
they are not liberal. They,

124
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:03.170
they appear to be liberal because that's capitalism.

125
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:05.850
You're trying to basically adapt to where society is at.

126
00:07:05.851 --> 00:07:08.610
And you want to pretend like you are socially conscious,

127
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.530
but when you look at their actual policies, they're conservative as. I mean,

128
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:16.970
they actually fund a lot of crazy like Koch brother, um, Alec,

129
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.000
they fund a, a lot of right- wing organizations,

130
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.360
the Federalist society they've given huge grants to.

131
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.560
So I think that they're kind of playing both sides.

132
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:29.480
Why deregulation to lobby for kind of the deregulation of their industry.

133
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:34.640
So I think that all of the perception and the mantra of Google and YouTube and,

134
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.081
you know,

135
00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:39.830
catering to like the social consciousness and you know,

136
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:42.470
what you're talking about, I think is honestly, just to make more.

137
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.210
<v 1>Money. Well,</v>

138
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.110
I'm sure they're gonna make more money in the process of doing this,

139
00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.670
but the idea that they're gonna engineer a city to me is terrifying.

140
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.550
That's insane. I, I just don't, I don't like it. You know, there was a great,

141
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:57.950
um, podcast that Sam Harris did with the guy who's explaining, um,

142
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:02.300
what Google is essentially done and what they've done with data.

143
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.780
The data is essentially a commodity that we didn't know was a commodity.

144
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.940
And we all gave up our rights to this commodity.

145
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.340
And this commodity turns out is worth billions and billions of dollars.

146
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.980
And no one had any idea and they just took it and now they have it and they have

147
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:18.740
it. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and what are they giving you for this?

148
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.450
Mm &lt;affirmative&gt; they' let you search things. Like,

149
00:08:20.451 --> 00:08:23.130
what are they giving you for this? It lets you use their email. Like it's,

150
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.810
it's kind of crazy. Yeah. They,

151
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.050
they search your email for certain keywords and all of a sudden mm-hmm,

152
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.290
&lt;affirmative&gt;, you know, you're looking for a patio chair. You're like, um,

153
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:31.890
I'm looking to buy a patio chair and all of a sudden,

154
00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:33.890
your Google mentions to fill the patio chairs.

155
00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:35.370
Cause you sent an email to you really.

156
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.930
<v 0>Creepy or just talk about something and it just talk about it.</v>

157
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.200
<v 1>Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Um, my, my guest yesterday, my friend will Harris.</v>

158
00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:47.240
He was talking about, uh, trading in his car and he got a text message,

159
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.520
a text message that said, Hey, I hear you're looking to trade in your car.

160
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:54.920
He's so, you know, here, here's a,

161
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.200
here's a link as to what you could get for it. And he goes,

162
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.600
I'm not clicking that link,

163
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.760
like a text message with a link showed up on his phone because of something he

164
00:09:03.761 --> 00:09:07.200
was talking about. He wasn't even talking on the phone. That's.

165
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.160
<v 0>What's crazy's really, really scary. It's insane. Yeah,</v>

166
00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:11.920
no that'ss what is happening terrify.

167
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.280
<v 1>How does that happen? Does he even know how that happens? Right.</v>

168
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.470
Like if you and I were talking right now and you said, uh,

169
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.750
I need a new laptop and you started getting laptop ads in your Google feed.

170
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:24.190
What is happening? Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is your phone listening to you say that?

171
00:09:24.191 --> 00:09:25.230
Yeah. Yep.

172
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.510
<v 0>Is that legal? It's like a, no, I mean, it, it Combs through everything. I mean,</v>

173
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:31.390
that's, what's so scary about.

174
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:35.700
<v 1>It. And apple is the best at it in terms of like not giving up your data.</v>

175
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.780
It's one of the reasons why I still use an iPhone and support apple,

176
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:44.060
apple goes out of their way to not share your data when you use maps.

177
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.820
That's why apple maps suck.

178
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.860
It's one of the reasons why it's not good &lt;laugh&gt; there was a great article that

179
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.780
was written about it. Uh, that called apple maps, the Bing of, uh, of,

180
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.250
of navigation tools. It's like, you know, Bing the,

181
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.970
the search engine mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; who the uses that. I right. I,

182
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.250
I use a windows laptop. I don't use Bing the out here with that. Yeah, yeah,

183
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:06.170
yeah. Cause Google's better. Right? Right. So you just go automatically use it,

184
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.970
but Google's just no Googles.

185
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.810
<v 0>I no. And all the going back to this whole like tech censorship thing,</v>

186
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.130
they preemptively change the algorithm.

187
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:18.800
That's what's so scary to me is that there wasn't even a law, you know,

188
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:21.680
like China, we are, we all know that chinaens the internet.

189
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.800
We've done the same thing here, but people just think that we still have,

190
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:27.680
you know, freedom of information that we can all access. All these things. No,

191
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.760
I mean Googled YouTube. I mean, cuz YouTube is owned by Google now,

192
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:33.880
but they preemptively changed the algorithms.

193
00:10:33.881 --> 00:10:37.270
They backp paged all of this progressive media into pendant media.

194
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.630
So it wasn't just about what they're saying. It's about, I mean this,

195
00:10:41.631 --> 00:10:44.350
this was targeted to basically all extreme views.

196
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.190
Everything that they felt like was too radical. I mean,

197
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:48.470
going back to the DNA report,

198
00:10:48.471 --> 00:10:52.230
which is where this all started from this kind of conclusive report that they

199
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:55.670
said these 17 intelligence agencies, you know, here's,

200
00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:58.020
here's all the evidence of how rough colluded and,

201
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.620
and cost the election for Hillary.

202
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.580
They cited my show on breaking on breaking the set that you did it. Yeah.

203
00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:07.180
They said I was part of the conspiracy of Russian Medling.

204
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.140
<v 1>Did you Russian me? &lt;laugh&gt; Abby, Martin, are you a Russian medaler? I just.</v>

205
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.980
<v 0>Did. Putin told me to do man. I mean, I'm sorry.</v>

206
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.860
<v 1>Someone take that, but use it as a snip, but.</v>

207
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.330
<v 0>In, but in the, in the report it said, um,</v>

208
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.970
she fomented radical discontent. And when you look at what all this is,

209
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.130
sewing discord, all of these, um, you know,

210
00:11:26.131 --> 00:11:30.730
the black box algorithm from Hamilton 68 dashboard like this us government

211
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:35.210
funded Twitter crawler that just like determines what's Russian

212
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:37.410
propaganda, what's fake news. And then you have, you know,

213
00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.440
Facebook working with the Atlantic council,

214
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.200
which is an organization stacked with literal spooks cops,

215
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.480
CIA heads and defense contractors, UAE, us government. Um,

216
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.000
that's who's like curating our reality now. And it's all about expunging,

217
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.840
the most radical views on the internet to prop up essentially the system and the

218
00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:57.680
establishment. And,

219
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.080
and that's why I know it's not a liberal or conservative thing.

220
00:12:01.081 --> 00:12:05.840
It's literally just extremist thought and radical thought that challenges

221
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.840
the, the status quo, um, because sowing discord just means disagreement.

222
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:15.590
That's what they said. This was about these websites. So discord Joe,

223
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:16.790
I mean that,

224
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.630
I thought that was a fundamental thing about American democracy is that you talk

225
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:20.910
about what we disagree on.

226
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:25.670
And when you look at what the report says of what breaking the set covered DMT,

227
00:12:25.671 --> 00:12:28.390
you know, I mean that wasn't in the report, you were on there talking about DMT,

228
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:31.710
but we talked about aliens &lt;laugh&gt; yeah. We talking about who the we wanted.

229
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.340
But as I talked about things like inequality and,

230
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.340
and occupy wall street and Hillary Clinton mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;,

231
00:12:38.341 --> 00:12:42.500
that was all part of this grand conspiracy to so discord on behalf of the

232
00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:46.180
Russian government. So it becomes very comical once you, you know,

233
00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:49.780
kind of poke at the underlying narrative, driving this wave of David,

234
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.673
are you aware.

235
00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:00.050
<v 2>The.</v>
