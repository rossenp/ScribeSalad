00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.310
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience you want to talk about? COVID I do. What are your,</v>

2
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.860
what are your thoughts on that? What are your thoughts on the lockdown?

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.900
<v 1>Yeah, well, let's put it this way. I'm I'm, uh,</v>

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.690
I'm not speaking in a vacuum here. I've heard a certain amount of, uh,

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.770
your take and my take is a bit different. Um,

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.660
I am very concerned about SARS cov two.

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.850
I am not concerned about it because it is as lethal as we

8
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:32.210
feared. It might be, it isn't as lethal as we feared it might be,

9
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.310
but I'm afraid of it for other reasons. One,

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.290
it is brand new to us evolutionarily. It just showed up in human beings.

11
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.470
And so in my opinion,

12
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.540
we screwed up the lockdown badly because we went halfway that a

13
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:54.500
very short, very intense lockdown could have ended it. And that,

14
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:56.120
that would have been the smart thing to do.

15
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.500
And unfortunately the political will was not there,

16
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:05.210
but if you're, I am looking at New Zealand with utter envy,

17
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.100
can you imagine at this moment being free of SARS, cov?

18
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.130
<v 0>Yeah. They nailed it, but they also have so few people.</v>

19
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.630
<v 1>Oh, they definitely had it easier,</v>

20
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:19.070
but the point is they did prove it was possible. Yes. So in my opinion,

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.930
we should have locked down severely for six weeks or

22
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:27.440
something along those lines, and we should have driven it to extinction.

23
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.870
And the problem is that that runs a foul of all kinds of things,

24
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:35.660
including civil liberties concerns, which I also hold.

25
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.370
I hate the idea of a government crackdown in which they're dictating with whom

26
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:44.150
you associate and all of the rest. Right. I hated as much as anyone,

27
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:49.040
but we are dealing with a brand new landscape when it comes to

28
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.320
a global pandemic. And what's more,

29
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.240
we are dealing with a virus that I think is not what we have been told it

30
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.240
is how so. So I have, uh,

31
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.430
initially I thought that this was a bat born virus that had been

32
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:08.000
transmitted to people, um, from the wild,

33
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:10.340
probably through the bushmeat trade,

34
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.880
probably through the seafood market and Wilhelm. In fact,

35
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:18.740
Heather and I were in the Amazon where we had no connectivity to anything for a

36
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:21.920
couple of weeks. And when we came out, uh,

37
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.150
what was then called novel coronavirus was just beginning to be discussed.

38
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.330
And it, so we became aware of it as we came out of the Amazon, I was like, oh,

39
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:32.270
what the heck is that? Huh? And, uh,

40
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.200
I looked into it and immediately I saw the story adds up. You know,

41
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:39.140
it's a coronavirus of a kind that's known to circulate in bats.

42
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.200
There's a seafood market. And I thought, okay, I know what the story is.

43
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:45.800
And I tweeted, um, I don't know enough about the story yet,

44
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.180
but it looks to me like the wolfhound on seafood market is the source that the

45
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:53.090
virus comes from bats. And we have to talk about the bushmeat trade,

46
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:54.800
which has always been a terrible idea.

47
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.280
And immediately people tweeted back at me.

48
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.930
So you think just a coincidence that there's a biosafety lab,

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.480
level four in blue Han where this started and I thought, what,

50
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.320
that's a heck of a coincidence. And so I started to look into it.

51
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.440
I retracted the tweet and I said, maybe I don't know enough about the story yet.

52
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.360
And I started to look into it and I went down the rabbit hole because as much as

53
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:23.890
we have been assured by a huge range of experts,

54
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.370
that this has to have been, uh,

55
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.420
a bad born Corona virus transmitted to people, uh,

56
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.680
possibly through pangolin,

57
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.540
maybe through some intermediate hosts that we don't yet know that story

58
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.730
looks less and less likely.

59
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.560
And the story that is looking more and more likely what I would call the iLab

60
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.150
leak hypothesis is looking ever stronger. And anyway,

61
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:53.200
I've been in contact with other people who have reached that conclusion.

62
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.970
We have faced all kinds of pushback, but, um, in a sense,

63
00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.291
again,

64
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:03.100
we still don't know it is possible that this came from the wild without human

65
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.020
meddling, but the,

66
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.630
the virus itself has several components that

67
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:14.470
suggest that it is actually the result of manipulation in the lab.

68
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.600
And that it escaped probably from the Wuhan Institute of virology,

69
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:24.460
but there's another lab in Wu Han. Um, it, uh,

70
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.800
it may well have escaped and we may be dealing with consequences

71
00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:34.330
are the re of the, um, the fact that it was manipulated in the lab.

72
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.780
So one of the techniques that, uh, labs who study viruses like this,

73
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.710
that use something. So the research has called gain of function.

74
00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.810
Research gain of function.

75
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:48.760
Research means you are taking a virus and you are adding a capacity

76
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:51.100
to it in order to study how it works.

77
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.730
And then one of the things that is done to study how it works is something

78
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:58.540
called passaging where a virus is infected.

79
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.400
A creature is infected with the virus,

80
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.140
and then the virus is allowed to pass between individuals of that

81
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:05.974
species.

82
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.960
It can also be done in tissues and cellular tissues where tissues are infected

83
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.200
and the virus is allowed to spread from one cell to the next.

84
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.800
And what happens is evolution. So

85
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.620
there is a strong possibility that this virus was under study,

86
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.520
that it was enhanced in the laboratory,

87
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.970
and that we are dealing with consequences that are the result of that

88
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:35.950
enhancement that make it more dangerous than it would have otherwise be. And.

89
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.870
<v 0>What, what do you believe those enhancements are?</v>

90
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.000
<v 1>Well? So one of the enhancements, there is a, um,</v>

91
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.250
something called a foreign site,

92
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.290
a Fern site in the genome of this virus for insights are not

93
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.120
known. It doesn't mean they don't exist,

94
00:05:52.121 --> 00:05:55.060
but they're not known from other beta Corona viruses.

95
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.710
And this Fern site is conspicuous.

96
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.790
It's conspicuous in that it is in the genome as an insert,

97
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.940
rather than mutations of nucleotides that were there.

98
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:09.320
It's like somebody spliced it in. That's one thing which could happen naturally,

99
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.450
but, um, it may well not have,

100
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.820
and it has a flanking sequence which has, this is probably,

101
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.590
uh, going to be hard for people to follow,

102
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:23.510
but nucleotides that is DNA code for, uh,

103
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.030
proteins, which are made out of amino acids.

104
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.760
There's an amino acid called arginine.

105
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.750
And there are two Argentines coded for in the genome of this virus,

106
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.440
but because there are so many possible codes,

107
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:41.300
triplet codes and only 20 or so amino acids there's

108
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.140
redundancy.

109
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.940
And so which code is used to trigger the production of an, uh,

110
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.540
or the, the inclusion of an Argentine is variable.

111
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.250
And the two Argentines are coded for in a way that is not seen in,

112
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.500
in nature in this way very frequently.

113
00:06:57.501 --> 00:07:02.030
So let's just say there are elements of the genome that are,

114
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.220
um, conspicuous and suggest possible laboratory manipulation. The,

115
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.660
for insight that I referred to that has been inserted either by a natural

116
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:13.880
process or by a laboratory process,

117
00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:19.460
greatly increases the transmissibility of this virus,

118
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.590
which means various things.

119
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.750
It could be the explanation for why this virus is infecting so

120
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:30.290
many different tissues in people who get sick, right?

121
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.780
The list of symptoms is huge here,

122
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.290
and that's a very troubling thing from the point of view of treating it,

123
00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.530
medically is all of the things that can go wrong with the body once you're

124
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:41.210
infected. Um,

125
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.340
it also means that the virus is very good at jumping between people and

126
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.050
that high transmissibility is obviously one of the things that makes,

127
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.030
uh, COVID-19 such a difficult pandemic to control, right?

128
00:07:56.031 --> 00:08:00.620
It's hopping between people so readily that, uh, it just, it runs away.

129
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.630
So in any case, uh, and then there's a third question that I have,

130
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:09.100
which is maybe that there's something about the fact,

131
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.410
I don't want to say fact as if it is a fact,

132
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:14.860
but if this was an escape from the laboratory,

133
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.550
then the virus, I mean, just as you know,

134
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.990
maybe we'll end up talking about the telomere problem in mice, um,

135
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.470
which you spoke to Eric about when he was on your podcast last,

136
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.480
but evolution to the lab evolution in the lab takes place

137
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.710
and changes that the people in charge want to happen occur.

138
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.900
And then things they're not even thinking about occur,

139
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.300
there's adaptation to the laboratory environment.

140
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.510
The people who work in labs are on, on aware of.

141
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:48.700
And so one of the questions I have is this virus is highly transmissible,

142
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.780
unless you're outdoors, then it seems almost not transmissible.

143
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:58.260
That's a very conspicuous, I mean, for one thing, bats live outdoors, right? Um,

144
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.300
so is it possible that this virus has adapted to the

145
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:07.080
laboratory environment and indoor environment and that it has forgotten how to

146
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:11.610
get transmitted outdoors? And if we are casual about the outdoor environment,

147
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.140
that actually it could relearn that trick that we should take it. We a,

148
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:18.330
we need to be outdoors for various reasons. One,

149
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.360
it appears that vitamin D is very, um,

150
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.430
protective in the case of COVID-19 prevents the transmission and you end up way

151
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:30.600
less sick if you have proper vitamin D. So in the Northern hemisphere here,

152
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.370
while the sun is shining, we should be outdoors.

153
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.100
We should not be locking down those environments at all.

154
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.730
We should also be very careful outdoors, right?

155
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:43.200
Because any time we allow it to be transmitted outdoors,

156
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.210
that is going to at creates a evolutionary signal,

157
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:49.140
a selective signal,

158
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:52.200
that's going to retrain the virus to be transmitted outdoors,

159
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:53.940
which is not something we want at the moment.

160
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:55.650
This might be an advantage that we have,

161
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.750
and we're going to lose it if we're not careful,

162
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:02.070
which is why I'm very careful and why I wear this thing

163
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.870
around so that I, you know,

164
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:07.740
I can pull it up at a moment's notice if I'm going to talk to somebody. Um,

165
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.280
because even though I think the virus is very difficult to transmit outdoors,

166
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:16.110
which is something we've seen in the data out of South Korea, for example, um,

167
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.350
uh, it could learn that trick. And why.

168
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.610
<v 0>Is it easier for it to turn? Do we know why no indoors? We don't know.</v>

169
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.780
So we don't know the mechanism.

170
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.740
<v 1>And there's no good reason that we don't know. We should know,</v>

171
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.080
because it could be that it's UV light,

172
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.250
UV light is very powerful, destructive stuff,

173
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.570
but if it's UV light,

174
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:39.570
then that suggests it's difficult to transmit outdoors during the day.

175
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.410
And it should be easy to transmit outdoors at night. If it's not UV light,

176
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.810
then that's not likely to be it.

177
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.640
So there is something weird going on with viral load, or maybe it's not weird,

178
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:51.140
but it's,

179
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.140
it's weird for those of us who learned how viruses work from the usual textbook

180
00:10:55.141 --> 00:11:00.120
diagrams, where a virus gets into a cell and triggers an infection. But here,

181
00:11:00.121 --> 00:11:03.240
it seems like if you talk to someone briefly,

182
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.050
your chances of picking it up from them, even if they're sick is pretty low,

183
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.690
but if you talk to somebody for an extended period of time where you're

184
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:13.180
constantly breathing air, that they're exhaling, then your chances go up, up,

185
00:11:13.181 --> 00:11:15.590
up and up. And that's. So.

186
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.010
<v 0>There's a possibility that just the exposure to UV light as people are,</v>

187
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.890
even if they're outside talking for the same amount of time,

188
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.190
just the fact that these particles are going through the air in the sunlight,

189
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.340
that it kills the virus's ability to transmit.

190
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.680
<v 1>I don't know that that's what's going on. What I would say is, first of all,</v>

191
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.440
uh, I do think I am very much in favor still of driving this

192
00:11:39.441 --> 00:11:43.700
thing to extinction by being properly sober about it

193
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.350
briefly tonight.

194
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.450
<v 0>Pause in addresses one issue that seems to be when, uh,</v>

195
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:55.000
it seems to be an issue when someone says that it might have come out of a

196
00:11:55.001 --> 00:11:59.680
lab, this is a right wing, left wing thing. For whatever reason,

197
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:01.870
you get labeled a right wing conspiracy theorist.

198
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:06.790
If you think it came out of a lab and you people on the left are

199
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.590
so they're so willing to dismiss that without any real

200
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:15.130
evidence for we've been poisoned by these,

201
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.840
these ideologies,

202
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:20.680
when it comes to conspiracy or whether or not something is actually true,

203
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:24.550
but we've been fed the wrong information that that stuff is,

204
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.170
if you don't believe the official narrative that's being discussed on CNN,

205
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.700
you must be some sort of a right-wing nut. Right. And, um,

206
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.050
have you faced that? Of course.

207
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.820
<v 1>I've faced it. I've I've and I'm, it's hard to escape it, right?</v>

208
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.320
So I've tried to be very careful. I have described it as a hypothesis,

209
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:44.280
which is what it is.

210
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.730
I have tried to show that there are different probabilities for the different

211
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.020
origin hypothesis. Even China now admits that it wasn't from the seafood market.

212
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.650
Do.

213
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.920
<v 0>That. Oh yeah. What do they say? It's from, well, don't they say it's from us?</v>

214
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:01.950
<v 1>Uh, I have not heard that, but they, uh, let's put it this way. There are</v>

215
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.730
one of the things that is, in my opinion,

216
00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:10.500
the strongest piece of evidence that there, uh, that the lab leak, uh,

217
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:15.330
hypothesis may be correct is that there is a missing phase

218
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.220
in the evolution of this virus.

219
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:21.780
When a virus jumps from one species to another,

220
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.480
it is not well positioned.

221
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.370
It is typically very poor at its job because it doesn't have any

222
00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:31.830
evolutionary experience with that host.

223
00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:34.110
So it's not good at leaping between that host cells,

224
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:37.950
which means that it's always in very small numbers and it's not good at leaping

225
00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:39.540
from one individual to the next.

226
00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:43.980
That's the key question when something leaps into a new

227
00:13:43.981 --> 00:13:47.760
species and then it becomes a pandemic it's because it has solved that second

228
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:48.594
problem.

229
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.260
It has figured out how to infect that creature in such a way that the creature

230
00:13:52.261 --> 00:13:53.820
spreads it to others of its kind.

231
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.070
There is no evidence in the case of this virus that that happened.

232
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.600
It showed up in Wu Han and spread immediately.

233
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.230
It became pandemic. It already had experience.

234
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.200
Now how it got that experience.

235
00:14:10.201 --> 00:14:14.610
We don't know there are evolutionary ways this could have happened, right?

236
00:14:14.611 --> 00:14:19.590
It could be that we have not found the initial population that it's

237
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:21.330
circulated in, right.

238
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.710
Or it could be that it circulated in a creature that we haven't found either.

239
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.180
But the fact that there is no evidence that it shows up in Wu Han and

240
00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:32.460
immediately spreads, um,

241
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:37.230
tells us that this virus was well adapted to

242
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.670
ourselves and well adapted to transmit between individuals.

243
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.700
And that is conspicuous.

244
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.620
One way you could get there is if somebody's a had added

245
00:14:49.621 --> 00:14:54.200
components to virus in order to make it transmissible to humans.

246
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.610
So the research in question would be research that was interested in discovering

247
00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.780
what a pandemic in humans have a bad born Corona virus would be like,

248
00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.450
so that we could do something about it. Maybe we could prevent it.

249
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.250
Maybe we could create a vaccine ahead of time,

250
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.610
but if you're creating a virus that has enhanced capacity to infect

251
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.770
humans in order to study,

252
00:15:14.771 --> 00:15:17.950
what will happen if a virus ever escapes into the human population,

253
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.160
then you are running the risk that the virus you were studying will escape.

254
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.030
Would they have added something like a Fern site? Absolutely.

255
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:29.890
It is established in the literature that the addition of a Fern site makes the

256
00:15:29.891 --> 00:15:33.970
virus much more transmissible in human tissue. So if you were going to study it,

257
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.040
this would be high on your list of things.

258
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:40.510
Do you could also passage it through human tissue

259
00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.390
in order to effectively train it on,

260
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.370
uh, the infectious pathway inside of people, which again,

261
00:15:50.371 --> 00:15:52.890
we might be suffering the downstream consequences of that.

262
00:15:52.891 --> 00:15:55.950
If it escaped the Wuhan Institute of virology.

263
00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:01.830
So these things have an amazing impact. And I hear a lot that, um,

264
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.440
what does it matter? It's with us now, we just have to deal with it,

265
00:16:04.441 --> 00:16:07.680
which is nonsense because a, we need to have, it never happened again.

266
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.420
Be there may be things that we could understand about what its nature is that

267
00:16:12.421 --> 00:16:15.900
would help us, but see,

268
00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:20.790
we have a really serious problem now because all but a few of the world's

269
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:22.140
leading virologists,

270
00:16:22.141 --> 00:16:26.550
the experts in Corona viruses in particular have sworn

271
00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:30.510
that this must've come from nature and couldn't have come from the lab,

272
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.230
which is nonsense. Why do you think they did that? Unfortunately,

273
00:16:34.231 --> 00:16:37.860
this goes back to, uh, clear discussion.

274
00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.110
Our scientific system is broken. We need our scientists to be empowered,

275
00:16:43.111 --> 00:16:47.160
to tell us what we need to know. And we need them therefore,

276
00:16:47.161 --> 00:16:51.990
to be freed from a system where they are fighting for grant money in

277
00:16:51.991 --> 00:16:53.400
order to continue their work.

278
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.540
This entire group of people is now in jeopardy.

279
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.720
Because if this turns out to have been a leak from the lab,

280
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:04.830
then we were all suddenly going to become aware that gain of function research

281
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.360
puts humanity in jeopardy.

282
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.430
That one accident in gain of function research can cause the evaporation of who

283
00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:14.490
knows how many trillion dollars it could cause.

284
00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:18.630
And this is one of the other things I wanted to say to you about the danger of

285
00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:23.450
letting this virus run. Of course, if we don't stamp it out,

286
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.310
I don't know that people who have been infected are not going to continue to

287
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:31.850
have, uh, outbreaks. We don't know that yet.

288
00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.340
We don't know whether or not people who've had,

289
00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:37.490
it are going to be immune to it in the future. That's probable,

290
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.630
but it's not certain.

291
00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:44.090
And we don't know that it's not going to become a permanent fellow

292
00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:46.610
traveler of humanity the way flu is.

293
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:50.880
And even if this thing evolved to become flu,

294
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.930
like if it became as unserious as the flu,

295
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.030
the flu is very serious.

296
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.220
And the cost that humanity pays for having flu circulate every year

297
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.300
is immense.

298
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.010
So even if the only thing that has happened in the longterm,

299
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.720
if we let it go and it evolved into another flu, like a pathogen,

300
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.740
then we have increased the number of flu,

301
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:20.190
like pathogens that we have to deal with annually substantially.

302
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.470
And that would be a major loss to humans.

303
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.630
So my sense that we should be much more aggressive about dealing with this

304
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:32.100
is really about the fact that I think we have a short time

305
00:18:32.101 --> 00:18:34.410
horizon in which to deal with it,

306
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:39.090
that it will learn new tricks and it will become harder to defeat the longer

307
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.760
that we, uh, play around with it.

308
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:46.560
And so an aggressive short-term move. It's really, you know,

309
00:18:46.561 --> 00:18:48.420
it's the lesson of pulling off the bandaid.

310
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.270
We're not doing ourselves any favors by pulling it off slowly. Um,

311
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.980
what do you think we should do right now? Well, I would say, I mean,

312
00:18:57.981 --> 00:18:58.581
the problem is,

313
00:18:58.581 --> 00:19:02.060
is a much harder argument to make now than it was at the beginning because we're

314
00:19:02.061 --> 00:19:05.720
all so frickin sick of lockdown. I mean,

315
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.600
Portland is still under full lockdown. Um.

316
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.990
<v 0>But not when it comes to protests. Well, of course not.</v>

317
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.640
That's the other problem, right?

318
00:19:13.641 --> 00:19:18.290
There's a massive hypocrisy in the way we were treating businesses versus

319
00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:19.370
treating protests.

320
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.560
<v 1>Uh, it's an epidemic of hypocrisy.</v>

321
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.341
<v 0>Not only that,</v>

322
00:19:22.341 --> 00:19:27.170
the Blasio in New York city won't allow people when they're asking people that

323
00:19:27.171 --> 00:19:28.850
have tested positive for COVID-19.

324
00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.780
You're not allowed to ask them whether or not they've been in a protest.

325
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.860
So they're doing contact tracing without valuable data because they,

326
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.600
they want to be progressive. That's insane. Oh, he's insane. Yes.

327
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:46.160
<v 1>So you asked me what I would do. Um, I would, and again,</v>

328
00:19:46.161 --> 00:19:48.920
I don't want to be in this position, you know, months in here,

329
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:54.140
I want to be in this position months ago of saying the right thing to do is a

330
00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.170
six week lockdown. That will be unbearably painful,

331
00:19:57.171 --> 00:20:00.890
but hopefully it'll be short and then intense contact tracing.

332
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:06.370
<v 0>But we've done a lockdown with essential businesses open. Well, we've done this,</v>

333
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:07.340
not a real lock. They've.

334
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.020
<v 1>Done a half-assed lockdown.</v>

335
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:13.970
And the thing that we've done that I find the most troubling

336
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.250
is that we have not bootstrapped a mechanism for,

337
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.810
um, high quality ubiquitous testing.

338
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.920
Because if you want to do, if you did a six week lockdown,

339
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.060
a real lockdown, right, hold your breath and get through it.

340
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.230
And then you open back up with testing.

341
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:41.030
That's so high quality and so universal that you can spot anything that happens

342
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:43.130
and you can treat it locally, right?

343
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.410
You don't come into work if you don't pass this test.

344
00:20:45.411 --> 00:20:47.170
And if your work puts you in contact with other people,

345
00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:50.290
we're going to test your regularly, right? If you did that,

346
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.540
we could have driven it to very low levels.

347
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:55.270
And then we could have dealt with the flare ups.

348
00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.100
But what we're doing now is we're just gambling and it's insane,

349
00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:05.200
right? We're gambling. And there is no that I can detect.

350
00:21:05.201 --> 00:21:09.700
There is no movement that says open back up

351
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.350
and be very aggressive about things like masks. My feelings.

352
00:21:14.351 --> 00:21:16.330
If you're pushing open back up,

353
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.440
you ought to be pushing things that would make opening back up as safe as

354
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:20.860
possible.
