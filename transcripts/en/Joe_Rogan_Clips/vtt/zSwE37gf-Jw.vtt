1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I'll tell you a story about, about, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.820
about a terrible person. Um, there's, there's.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.220
<v 1>Queue up some spooky music. Yeah. Right?</v>

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.340
<v 0>So this there's this guy. I hope I like don't get sued by this guy.</v>

5
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.350
<v 1>You don't have, don't say his name. Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.960
<v 0>Well, I'm going to, I've got to say the place that he runs, um,</v>

7
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.310
this is a guy who tells people that he can cure their cancer. Uh,

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.120
yeah. Uh, you know, cure their cancer naturally. Right. He's got the whole,

9
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.400
you know, he gives him, he gives him a wheat, you know, gives them wheat,

10
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:29.540
grass smoothies. Right.

11
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.230
And he tells them that if they just think positively and, and they, you know,

12
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.910
the, that big pharma is, is corrupt and chemotherapy is a sham.

13
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:42.440
And if they just come to his place, which I went to in, in Florida,

14
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.130
um, he's you go to interview him? Or I did, I did.

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.530
I went to interview him because, and he looks like, I mean,

16
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.620
he just looks like he he's like a caricature of a snake oil salesman.

17
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:55.880
He's got this like artificially tan skin and like a pointy goatee. And, and,

18
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.290
and, and, and, and so I think you're totally right as was, gets on this guy,

19
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.870
this, this up guy who is, who is getting people's hope up, right.

20
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100
<v 1>It's not right, because it's also,</v>

21
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:12.020
he gets to the people and they could have SEACT sought out real.

22
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.900
They treatment could be cured and live and people.

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.990
<v 0>Die. People die because they go there. And the people that were there,</v>

24
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:20.180
this was the crazy thing. And this is, this, again,

25
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:22.430
gets back to how the ultra processed information is happening.

26
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.060
These were not ed it's, man. These were people who, I mean,

27
00:01:26.061 --> 00:01:29.630
I don't know what it's like, um, because I've never had, I've never had,

28
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.660
you know, knock on wood. Um, I've never had, you know, I've never had cancer.

29
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:37.550
A person very close to me has never had cancer. Like these are people who,

30
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.270
you know, when that happens, um, you're looking for anyone.

31
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.120
You're looking for anyone to tell you a story that gives you a sense that things

32
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.640
are actually not chaotic, right? The things are simple.

33
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.180
That there's an answer that there's a community that, that, that can help you.

34
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.870
Um, and so, and so they go, right, and he, and he taps,

35
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.310
he taps into that and he gives them what they want. Right. In a sense,

36
00:01:58.311 --> 00:01:59.570
he gives them what they want, which is,

37
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.690
which is a feeling of certainty and belonging and hope.

38
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.370
And he's terrible, terrible human. But, but, but it ends up,

39
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.420
it ends up being really bad for these people.

40
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.370
And it ends up being bad for, you know, society in certain ways. And that,

41
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.640
and so I struggle. Right. And the problem is if you attack that guy,

42
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.910
I don't know if you've run into this at all. But if you attack the charlatans,

43
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.300
they've been turned into saints by the people that look up to them.

44
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.280
So when you attack them,

45
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.450
you also end up attacking all of the people.

46
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.160
<v 1>Believe him. That belief. Yeah. I've been there before with chiropractors. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.950
Wait, so say a little more, well,

48
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.920
I don't know if you know the history of chiropractic.

49
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.620
<v 0>I just wondered. I have to figure out where you come down on this.</v>

50
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.860
<v 1>Before. I, I think it's nonsense. Yeah. Okay. So a hundred percent nonsense.</v>

51
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.310
It's this ready, right? Yeah. Me cracking my fingers. That's what they're doing.

52
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.750
Your back. It's not fixing anything.

53
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.990
Chiropractic medicine was created by guy who was a magnetic healer who

54
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.880
came about it through a seance,

55
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.240
the idea that he was gonna manipulate people's spines and cure them of

56
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.980
tuberculosis and blindness.

57
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.080
He was murdered by his son who drove over him with a car and then took over the

58
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:15.940
practice. And somehow, or another,

59
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:19.650
this has been grandfathered in like what I told us,

60
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.790
a friend of mine the other day was talking to me about chiropractors. I go,

61
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:26.080
do you know how much time a chiropractor spends a medical school? They go,

62
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.570
how much I go, zero, zero time.

63
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.050
They're doctor of chiropractic medicine. But they're not a.

64
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.790
<v 0>There's people flipping out right now though,</v>

65
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.790
who have been to their chiropractor, who feel like they've gotten relief.

66
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.290
We respect their craft. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's.

67
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.020
<v 1>Some relief in someone manipulating your body folks.</v>

68
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.800
You should get a deep tissue massage and you should get an MRI and find out

69
00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:47.530
what's really wrong. I came through this because I used to go to a doctor,

70
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.790
a chiropractor, excuse me.

71
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.120
And I had a bulging disc and it was me up for a long time.

72
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:56.110
It was really bothering me. And this, this chiropractor was assuring me.

73
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.200
It definitely was not a bulging disc. And there's probably a muscle tear.

74
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:02.380
And we're going to fix it by manipulating this. I'm going to change your,

75
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:06.010
that and crack and see, oh, I got it there. Let me adjust this boom in your hip,

76
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.570
this, it was all horseshit,

77
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.310
but he was a Saint compared to another one that I went to.

78
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.860
I'll tell you a story about a guy who was ripping people off.

79
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.110
This guy was really ripping people off.

80
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.320
He was doing this thing that he called zone healing, and you ready for this?

81
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.190
He would, I'm not bullshitting. He would touch your head. And he would,

82
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.610
he would press your head here and press your head here, press your head here.

83
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.170
And then press it really hard here. And he goes, oh, you feel that? And I go,

84
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:36.700
yeah. And I'd be like, yeah, that's, that's a [inaudible] is off.

85
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:39.910
And then somebody, no, you squeeze hard on my head. I'm not stupid.

86
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.930
And then he would adjust you and tell you that this is going to fix, you know,

87
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:46.270
whatever auto-immune disease, you have whatever this.

88
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.680
And so I was going to him because all these other jiu-jitsu people were going to

89
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.020
them and they were all telling me, oh, this guy's great at cracking backs.

90
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.810
And he's, he's amazing. He fixed my neck. He fixed my desk.

91
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.290
Cause people want someone to fix their thing, right?

92
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.890
If you have a neck injury and you just spend time off and it gets better and you

93
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:05.740
get some treatment from a chiropractor, well, heal things heal.

94
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.530
Your body knows how to heal. And he goes, oh, he fixed my neck. No,

95
00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:12.160
your neck healed. Okay. Things do heal.

96
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.530
But this person touching your back saying,

97
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.710
he's fixing your gallbladder is a scam artists. Right?

98
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.820
So I had this guy and I've talking to him. And so I said, well,

99
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:23.980
how does this work? And he's explaining to me, he's got a chart.

100
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.250
This is zone is how we're fixing this and that, that, and this. And I said,

101
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:29.050
but all you're doing is pushing down on my back.

102
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.430
How are you fixing all these things?

103
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.830
And so he tries to give me the shenanigans and a little song and dance. Hey,

104
00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:36.550
Hey. And I keep going. And I say, how are you fixing this?

105
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.690
You tell me what is going on here. And so it goes down to the placebo method.

106
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.840
He literally tells me, oh, he said, if you believe,

107
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.460
if you believe in these things, I go.

108
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.170
So you're telling me I have to be so dumb to think that if you push on my back,

109
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:55.120
it's going to fix my liver. And then it will fix my liver. Well, he goes, well,

110
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:57.410
you do know the placebo method does work. I go,

111
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.440
so you're taking money from people to lie to them.

112
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.410
So we have this tense conversation in his office

113
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.840
and I'm looking at him and I know this guy has got a nice house and who's got a

114
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:11.810
nice car and he's just stealing money from people.

115
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.800
But giving them these false hopes, it's, it's creepy, man.

116
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.740
And it's really creepy when you're alone with the guy and you're talking to him

117
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.820
about it and you get them to say, it's the placebo method. And meanwhile,

118
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.870
other than that nice guy, which is even more up,

119
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.490
like I knew him. Like he seemed like a nice guy. I didn't, I didn't know.

120
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.850
I didn't even know chiropractor stuff was.

121
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.450
<v 0>The history of it. I mean, like you said, right, if you look into it,</v>

122
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.230
it's sort of hard to believe that people like it's still a thing. I mean,

123
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:43.690
it's an insurance covers it and it's, and it, you know,

124
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.880
and this goes back to the religion stuff too. I mean, I got all,

125
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.700
I got into all of this stuff. So I like my,

126
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.110
my actual area of academic expertise is classical Chinese philosophy. So like,

127
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.790
that's what I, that's what I did as an actor do, did do, uh, as an academic.

128
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.880
And I, you know, I read all these ancient Taoists texts and stuff like that.

129
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.660
And there's all these promises in there about, you know, if you take my,

130
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.050
you know,

131
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.730
mercury mixed at night with this and you eat in this way and I'm looking at this

132
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:14.050
stuff, I was like, you know, this seems very familiar, right?

133
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.080
There's a lot of that going on today.

134
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.990
And then you look at the history of chiropracty and it's there.

135
00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:22.870
These vital forces, right. Homeopathy is a similar thing.

136
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:25.690
There's vital forces that are actually what's causing illness.

137
00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:28.390
And if you look at the history of that, it's quasi religious Reiki,

138
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:29.200
which is like the.

139
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.260
<v 1>Oh my God energy healing. Right. And it's like, they didn't even touch you.</v>

140
00:07:32.261 --> 00:07:33.094
Right. Right.

141
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.920
<v 0>And it's these words, I mean, it's really interesting. These words,</v>

142
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.080
energy is one of these words that can easily slide from explicitly

143
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:44.770
religious to seemingly secular, right? It's like, oh yeah, energy.

144
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:48.610
That's in physics. They have energy. Right. But it's like, no,

145
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.800
this is the thing they're not manipulating your energy.

146
00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:53.050
There's not something scientific happening here. This is a,

147
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:54.400
this is a religious ritual,

148
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.230
a healing ritual disguised as some kind of science.

149
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.620
Right. And, and, and yet, as you know,

150
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.000
and this is what I discovered with my first book,

151
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:05.950
I used to joke with people like I got out of religion,

152
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.420
cause I didn't want to talk about touchy stuff.

153
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.430
And then I started talking about food and medicine.

154
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.060
And that was when people really got. Like when you,

155
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.100
when you start to talk about what they eat.

156
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.220
<v 1>So you got out of religion just because he didn't want these uncomfortable</v>

157
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:19.040
conversations.

158
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.400
<v 0>I'm not even joking. It's not, I actually got, I got, I,</v>

159
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.650
I stopped doing religion, like,

160
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.950
or not stopped doing cause I still do scholarship stuff. Um,

161
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.360
but I wanted to talk about it in a way that was relevant to modern society.

162
00:08:31.361 --> 00:08:33.340
So I didn't just want to do classical Chinese thought.

163
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.420
I wanted to look at how the stuff I learned about how religion works or about

164
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:39.700
the history of religion and apply it to, you know,

165
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:41.050
how are people choosing the foods they eat?

166
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.500
How are people choosing the medicines? Like with Chinese medicine, right.

167
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:48.250
People would say crazy stuff. To me, they'd say things like, you know,

168
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.220
acupuncture is natural, right. Or whatever. And that's,

169
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:53.650
and that's part of why it works. I'm like acupuncture, they got stainless steel,

170
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.491
Fila form needles.

171
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:57.480
You think those were when the yellow emperor was writing his classic? Like,

172
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.180
no they don't. And when people talk about Chinese medicine,

173
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.360
they don't talk about, you know, exorcism, exorcisms,

174
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:05.290
not thinking was very popular back in the day,

175
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.020
but that's not something people embrace.

176
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:11.790
And so I saw these weird uncritical embraces of dietary

177
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:14.400
regimens and healing rituals.

178
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.510
That to me were just obviously right out of, you know,

179
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.420
ancient China or you know, any ancient context, um,

180
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.300
where people would never believe them. And yet today, you know,

181
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:26.730
you're going in and you're having your, your back cracked.

182
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.600
It's so weird that it's so prevalent, but push back on it and oh.

183
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.000
<v 1>I've experienced it. I've experienced it now. Oh no,</v>

184
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.450
that was going to happen a hundred percent. Well,

185
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:39.800
I don't read social media luckily. So I'm not going to hear from it. But,

186
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.330
and let me do say this.

187
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:45.950
There's a bunch of people that are chiropractors that do use some valid methods

188
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:49.550
for rehabilitation, right? There's a lot of them that use deep tissue massage,

189
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.370
cold laser therapy, actual real methods.

190
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.490
A lot of them use a Rolfing.

191
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.870
There's a lot of them that use a bunch of different methods of stretching that

192
00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:01.100
are very beneficial,

193
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:05.930
but the practice of cracking backs to cure disease is nonsense. Right. Right.

194
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.350
And that's a problem. And the practice of calling yourself a doctor,

195
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.830
the of that is also nonsense.

196
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.780
<v 2>It really is. Yeah, yeah.</v>

197
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.490
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely. Uh it's but at the same time again,</v>

198
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:23.240
and I don't know you, I keep saying, you know this, but like it's, it's, it,

199
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.040
it must be difficult when, when people are in pain, right.

200
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.380
Or when people, when people are in pain, when you're in pain,

201
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:33.830
either psychic pain or physical pain,

202
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:39.020
you really need someone to tell you, they have an answer for you.

203
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.860
And to explain it and fit it into a system, they can say to you,

204
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.430
I know why you're sad. I know why you feel empty.

205
00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:48.050
I know why your back hurts.

206
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:53.420
It's because of this simple thing and I have the answer

207
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.800
I'm going to fix it. I'm going to fix it.

208
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.270
And actually just hearing that itself is therapeutic.

209
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:00.440
<v 1>Really is.</v>

210
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.270
And that's the problem with going to a healer because there's

211
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.690
many people that have gone to people that have claimed to be a healer.

212
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:13.400
And just this process of embracing this new,

213
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:18.290
new situation, this like, I am here, I'm getting healed.

214
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.360
Oh my God, it's happening. Oh.

215
00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:25.250
And you're a lot of what makes people ill is anxiety

216
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.900
is stress. And the placebo effect of having some sort of a,

217
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:35.000
in your mind perceived solution does have tangible physical benefits

218
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.600
for some strange reason, which is really weird. Like what,

219
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.100
what goes on in the human mind.
