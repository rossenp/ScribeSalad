1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.250
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's actually my point. So I was sent a video.</v>

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:07.020
I'm going to skip tracks to a different video.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.090
Cause I want to make a point that we live in a, we live in a mediated world now,

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.980
right? Immediated epistemology is what I would call it, the media itself,

5
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.880
social media.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.920
So all of us participating are able to spin narratives around like

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.240
a 32nd video.

8
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.450
So the other day this guy sends me a video on Twitter and I watch it and it's

9
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.270
some black guy with a microphone and you know,

10
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.420
in a radio studio and he's like going, and he's like, you know,

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.670
these white people, ain't gonna take a Omo. Ain't gonna take him.

12
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.340
And he's like yelling. He was like, oh, they're going to rise up. You know?

13
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.920
And it's, it's obvious what you're watching. You're like, man,

14
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:44.160
this guy's like these riots are out of control.

15
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.960
And so I wanted to share it,

16
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.600
but it was sent to me on Twitter and I couldn't figure out how so I looked it up

17
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.990
on YouTube. And so I had like a 42nd clip sent to me and I'm like, yeah,

18
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.510
well that this riots and I want to show it to somebody.

19
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:57.510
And so I go and I find it on YouTube and I watch it.

20
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:59.790
And it's the same thing in 40 seconds. And it ends,

21
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.010
but the video that I watched is several minutes.

22
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.900
And then the next thing the guy says.

23
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.070
<v 1>Is this president is divisive. This president is the problem is so divisive.</v>

24
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:11.580
He goes all the division and it's like, holy. He's actually talking about Trump.

25
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.690
And then I kept watching it. And he's like, president Obama has got to go.

26
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.510
<v 0>At the end. And so it depends on which part of that clip.</v>

27
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:23.250
You see the story changes completely. I watched the 40 seconds and I was like,

28
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.300
holy, this is the riot. And then, oh my God, it's about Trump. And then boom.

29
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.960
Now it's this dude railing about Obama several years ago.

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.210
And the video was sent to me because it was going crazy with the

31
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.330
implication that it was about the riots, but hadn't, it was about Obama.

32
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.340
That's crazy. This is like the deal, right? We, you, what we're seeing,

33
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:47.240
isn't always the whole story, right?

34
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.850
<v 2>And there we live in this clip culture now, which is a real problem.</v>

35
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.650
<v 0>Right? And we pieced together the story,</v>

36
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.920
we believe based on our prior assumptions about it,

37
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.900
the Covington case exactly.

38
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.260
<v 2>Where the kid was just standing there and the native American guy came up to him</v>

39
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:02.480
with the drum and he was smiling,

40
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:04.910
the native Americans face and they got a photo of it.

41
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:07.220
And it really looks like this. Kid's a prick.

42
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.210
And then he's taunting these native Americans who were just peacefully banging

43
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:11.970
on their drums as.

44
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.240
<v 0>Exactly. Right. So we live in this situation now where the,</v>

45
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.900
I don't want to say the media, like it's an entity because actually in a sense,

46
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.270
we are all participating. These clips, you know,

47
00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:24.170
that people are loading up on Twitter, that whole context isn't there.

48
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.030
And you said, you know, does it just Jack everything up to a higher frequency?

49
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:33.500
And absolutely it does because everybody can take that clip and then just upload

50
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:37.790
their story of what they want to have to be true into the clip.

51
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.630
And it becomes like, it's like an, I mean, we're already talking about religion.

52
00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:45.320
It's like a miracle, like, you know, back in 2000, 3000 years ago, you know,

53
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.860
some something weird happened. And then, you know, people,

54
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.950
one person tells another and another print and other, and then it's like, eh,

55
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.940
and I swear, you know,

56
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:56.090
an angel came down from the sky and touched him and he was healed and he could

57
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:58.730
walk again, you know? So it's like a miracle story,

58
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.150
but mediated through partially informative video. It's, it's almost like,

59
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:05.470
you know, everybody's scared to deep,

60
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.980
fake is common where they can basically put your face on whatever porn star or

61
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.770
saying some horrible thing that you never said or whatever.

62
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.480
<v 1>It's, it's, it is the precursor to that because you.</v>

63
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.470
<v 0>Can cut that clip just right. And then all of a sudden, it means one thing,</v>

64
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.000
if you cut it just another way,

65
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.260
it means something exactly the opposite or totally different in different groups

66
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.550
that want to push a narrative,

67
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.480
which is like everybody latches onto it and runs with it.

68
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.170
And this of course causes crazy polarization. Right?

69
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.710
So that same clip I saw, I don't know that it would be a good example,

70
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:41.710
but you know, you could take it as the riots and you know, that get one,

71
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.820
that black guy sick of the riots. And so the right wings all over it, like,

72
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:48.970
look at this guy, you know, and then boom, this president.

73
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:51.730
So divisive now it's the left story and you cut it right there.

74
00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:53.770
And the next thing you know, what's president Obama, you know,

75
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.700
and all of a sudden it switched sides. It switches sides again, and right.

76
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.960
And it's also history.

77
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.350
And then even the thing I watched that was longer was four and a half minutes.

78
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.280
And then the whole thing is like an hour. So what really,

79
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.750
what was really the whole goal, the whole point. And so,

80
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.870
um, we're getting away from being able to understand, because you know,

81
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:15.880
our attention spans are so short, you live in Twitter.

82
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.880
It's like you have the attention span of like a goldfish man.

83
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.850
You can't pay attention to anything we're marinading in dopamine all the time

84
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.260
brain doesn't work. Right?

85
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.570
So you don't have time to like parse anything together.

86
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:28.330
You see this thing you're off, you're a retweet, you know, snarky comment.

87
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.180
<v 2>Don't you think that also just the format of Twitter itself is</v>

88
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:36.300
just, I think it's detrimental to people's mental health,

89
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.280
big time communicating through these small little sentences

90
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.310
and little paragraphs of 280 words. So.

91
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.960
<v 0>Let's write characters. Yeah. Yeah. So it was like 30 ones. And so this,</v>

92
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:51.180
I actually called Twitter, a deconstruction machine,

93
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.130
which is straight out of this again,

94
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:56.310
the same critical postmodern philosophy stuff.

95
00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.690
And I kind of keep circling around deconstruction is the idea that, um,

96
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.960
it's the same thing as the media mediated ideas that we're going to take a thing

97
00:05:03.961 --> 00:05:06.570
apart, make it look absurd, or we're going to show,

98
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.300
show it in a particular light and then, you know,

99
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.320
pull it apart into [inaudible] you don't really trust its validity anymore.

100
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.400
And that's it specifically its purpose is to make it that you don't trust the

101
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:20.700
validity of the thing anymore. And so anything you put on Twitter,

102
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.640
once you get an account of a certain size, at least anything,

103
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.180
like I have an account that's big enough now. So I experienced this regularly.

104
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.340
It's a 100% chance that some is going to say something that just messes with

105
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:36.180
your head, right. And or somebody is going to take it out of context,

106
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:38.730
or they're going to, they're going to tell you what they thought you mean.

107
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:40.020
And now that's the thing you mean,

108
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.930
or they're going to screenshot it and it's going to go around and they're going

109
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.630
to like, it's like, I mean,

110
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.120
you're famous enough where it's obviously happens to you all the time.

111
00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:48.781
I'm sure it's like,

112
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.750
they take something that you say on a podcast or you put on a Twitter or your

113
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:54.780
shows or whatever, and they clip it up. And then there's like,

114
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.950
you know who Joe Rogan is.

115
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.120
But then there's like this new Joe that they created that's out in the universe.

116
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.030
Right? So they take you apart. They deconstruct you.

117
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.970
They're the real Joe Rogan and your real intentions and your real meaning.

118
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.230
And then they put it out into the world.

119
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.260
And then there's this new Joe Rogan that does horrible thing or that new Joe

120
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.363
Rogan, maybe that's.

121
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.590
<v 2>Well, I always tell people too,</v>

122
00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:15.940
like if you have an issue with some of the things that I say, guess what?

123
00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:19.330
I have an issue with some of the things I say, and if you were here with me,

124
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.990
when I say things and you disagreed, I'd listen to your point.

125
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.640
I'm not an idealist or an ideal log. When it comes to, uh,

126
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:33.190
ideas, when it comes to concepts, I'm not married to anything that I say.

127
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.350
<v 0>Right. We need to be able to talk about it. Right.</v>

128
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:38.260
So you say a thing and then I'm like, okay, but I think part.

129
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.720
<v 2>Of the problem is they can't talk about it. You have to tweet about it. So,</v>

130
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.130
but because they're not in the room and they don't have your attention, right.

131
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:48.100
So then they get angry and that's part of the problem with podcast,

132
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:51.040
as well as like, right, right now, you and I are having a conversation,

133
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.220
but millions of people are listening to this conversation and there's a lot of

134
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:56.680
them that wish they could chime in if they don't get to.

135
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:00.310
So what they do is they get angry and they put some stuff on Twitter.

136
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.900
I understand the motivation. I understand the thought process behind it.

137
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.130
I really do. But I personally can't engage because it's just too unhealthy.
