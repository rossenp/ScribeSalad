00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.120
<v 1>The, the zionionist thing is, uh, define the difference between Jewish,</v>

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.040
Jewish and Zionist.

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.423
<v 0>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.520
Zionist is the idea of that the Jews have a right to national.

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.030
Self-determination the Jewish SHA you go, yeah, please.

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:22.590
You looked at me like I should. No, no, no, no, no, no.

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.910
The Jewish longing to return to the land of Israel is something that's like

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.870
inescapable. If you read the Bible, right, like it's all over there.

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.750
The whole idea of, and you can discount it, discount God,

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.430
whatever the fact is is that the Jews are a people that were

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.540
birth sort of in this land, which we now call the land of Israel.

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.060
And they somehow, and they were expelled by the Romans around 2000 years ago.

14
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.460
And then they came back to that land, right?

15
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.500
It's it's like they defied the logic of history in doing that because

16
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.850
by all rights, they were an indigenous group to that land.

17
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.730
They were kicked out and expelled and then they went back 2000 years later.

18
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.690
Like it's a crazy, extraordinary story.

19
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.770
So leave that to one part Zionism, the way that I,

20
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.963
and the way that I,

21
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.530
I think is the simplest definition is the belief in the Jewish right to

22
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.970
self-determination and it's the Jewish liberation movement.

23
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.720
And so in the ni let's go back to like pre 1948,

24
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:31.360
which is the year that the state of Israel is established. And you have Jews in,

25
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.640
you know, Poland and all of these other places debating,

26
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:37.560
like what is the way that we can solve our constant,

27
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.640
like the systemic oppression that we are constantly enduring.

28
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.510
And there are all of these different responses to that problem.

29
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.870
One argument was the socialist argument. You know, if we, or the, you know,

30
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:51.550
the anti-capitist argument, if the, the problem is capitalism,

31
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.790
and if only we defeat capitalism, anti-Semitism will go away.

32
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.910
Some argued that total assimilation was the right way to solve it.

33
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.790
We just need to kind of disappear as Jews.

34
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.300
That's the only way we'll be fully accepted. And another group, you know,

35
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:07.180
which was not even the most popular group, is this idea of,

36
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.620
we need to be able to determine our own fate and the,

37
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.060
we will never be fully accepted.

38
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.140
The only way that we can determine our own fate is if,

39
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.660
is this idea of us having our own state and our own army,

40
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.980
where we can protect ourselves.

41
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.650
And that is ultimately the idea that sort of wins out.

42
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.450
So when you're having a debate about, you know, when people say today,

43
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:30.410
they're an anti- Zionist. Yeah.

44
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.890
The reason that that is so problematic is they're not making that argument in

45
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.570
1920s, Eastern Europe, when the state doesn't exist.

46
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.650
It's one thing to be an anti- Zionist in theory. Right? It's the same.

47
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.200
The analogy I like to make is if we're a couple and we wanna have a baby and

48
00:02:47.201 --> 00:02:50.280
we're debating, should we have the baby? Can we afford the baby?

49
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:52.280
Where are we gonna send the baby to school? All this stuff.

50
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:56.160
That's a totally moral argument to make. You can't make that argument of,

51
00:02:56.161 --> 00:03:00.120
should we have the baby after the baby is born? The baby is born. It exists.

52
00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:03.920
Israel exists. It's a place. It's not an idea. It's not an abstraction.

53
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.680
It is a place that contains the largest Jewish community on planet earth.

54
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.240
And so when people say that Israel doesn't have a right to exist, it's like,

55
00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:14.720
what are you talking about? It exists. So what do you want? What?

56
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:17.520
So I ask the person that makes the anti Zionist argument,

57
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.390
what imagine will happen? Like, are you, do you think that you're,

58
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:26.190
you're advocating for an genocide right away, or like,

59
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.110
you have to have no sense of middle Eastern history or politics

60
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.150
to make the argument that you can be a minority in that region without

61
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:38.950
protection. We know what that looks like. That looks like the,

62
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.900
the story of the Azidis. It looks like the story of the Kurds,

63
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.140
the story of the Zo, austriatnians the story, frankly,

64
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.220
of Christians who are gonna be completely expelled from the middle east,

65
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.540
within the next decade, which is a story. No one talks about.

66
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.100
<v 1>So the anti- Zionist sentiment, when people start talking about Zionist,</v>

67
00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:59.060
what they're essentially talking about is Israel just existing. Yes.

68
00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:00.730
They're anti-isra.

69
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.003
<v 0>Existing. Correct.</v>

70
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.010
And Jeremy Corbin made this very plain where he actually said the words,

71
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.210
the BBC has a bias towards believing that Israel has a right to exist.

72
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.890
He said that, yes. Yes.

73
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.490
<v 1>So he's on SHA can confirm and, and he's on the left. Like he's on the, he.</v>

74
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.360
<v 0>Hit him. The eyess the, the sort of anti- Zionism,</v>

75
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.800
which bleeds into anti-Semitism of the far left. Meaning let me put it this way.

76
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.200
Anti- Zionism has become such a plank of like normative political progressiveism

77
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.120
that if you're an 18 year old and you go onto a college campus, and you're like,

78
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.550
during the, you know, orientation week,

79
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:46.110
you're signing up for like legalizing pot club and better rights for cafeteria

80
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.270
workers. Oh. And by the way, you know,

81
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.390
the boycot divest move sanctions movement against Israel,

82
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:54.350
which is an anti-zyionist movement. You're not an anti-Semite,

83
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:55.190
you don't hate Jews.

84
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.750
You're just kinda like swimming along with progressive waters because that's how

85
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:02.500
successful this movement has been. But if you step back and you're like, wait,

86
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:06.620
hold on. There's a political movement. Gaining popularity in the west.

87
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.860
That was in fact embodied in the person of Jeremy Corbin and what became of his

88
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:15.100
labor party that believes that there's only one state in the world that doesn't

89
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:17.940
have a right to exist. Like that's crazy.

90
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.930
<v 1>I can't believe he actually said that he did do, he, he.</v>

91
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.730
<v 0>He said a lot of things. Apparently I'm trying.</v>

92
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.970
<v 1>To find, he definitely said it he's, he's a ridiculous person.</v>

93
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.450
One of my favorite things that he said was, I mean, he's, what is he like 60?

94
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.930
He's like my pronouns. Are he him like, shut the up. Like,

95
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.610
I see what you're doing. I know what you're doing. Just, I mean, he.

96
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.050
<v 0>Gots crushed. Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.880
I think the thing to like the analogy you I make is like,

98
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.040
America has done horrible things. We have, you know,

99
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.160
the example everyone loves right now is children in cages at the border. Yeah.

100
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.480
It's a disgusting imoral thing that we're doing,

101
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.400
but no one goes from that horrible policy to say,

102
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.400
America shouldn't exist. Right. And we should just meld into Canada or Mexico.

103
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.720
Right. And by the way,

104
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.240
they're saying that they're making that argument in a context where they are

105
00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:11.640
literally surrounded by neighbors who want to murder as many

106
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.800
Jews and Jewish Israelis as possible. Like

107
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.470
it it's an imorallar it's, it's a, like, it's,

108
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.310
it's an argument that I really can't wrap my mind around.

109
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.710
Like how people get away with making it. Well, it's.

110
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.190
<v 1>A strange concept to even say that it doesn't have the right to exist when it</v>

111
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:33.630
does exist. Correct. But so I could see how you could say, did he say it?

112
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.180
What does he say? Jeremy Corbin accused of antisemitism thousand 11 video,

113
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.380
which he questions Israel's right. To exist and says,

114
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:46.300
the BBC is biased in favor of the Jewish state questions are right to

115
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:48.220
exist. See,

116
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.460
I could see how someone could say that there is evidence that some

117
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.460
Israeli, Israeli soldiers have done horrific things to Palestinian.

118
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:58.890
Of course they have. Yes.

119
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.090
<v 0>Of course they have. Yes. I will never deny that.</v>

120
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.650
<v 1>And I could see how you could look at the,</v>

121
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:11.650
where Palestine is in the state of the Palestinian people and saying there has

122
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:16.090
to be a better way for them. It has to be, uh, a better civilization for them.

123
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:19.600
It has to, it has to improve &lt;affirmative&gt;. These are human beings. They have,

124
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.520
it has to be a better, just a, a,

125
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.880
a better situation. I mean,

126
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:30.760
they're not even recognized as a true state or as a true country,

127
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.680
by a lot of people I could see that. See idea. I believe that. Yeah.

128
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.960
<v 0>I'm sure you, I believe that because that's my human's.</v>

129
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.793
<v 1>Distinguished, right?</v>

130
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.870
<v 0>Yes. I, I believe that because I'm a human being and I believe that also,</v>

131
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.150
because I'm a Zionist,

132
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.190
I don't want the state of Israel and the state of that's supposed to be

133
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:54.350
embodying Jewish ideas to be occupying in other people like

134
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.070
that is a state like that is.

135
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.710
<v 1>Horrible. What can be done.</v>

136
00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.340
<v 0>About, well, here's the problem, right?</v>

137
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.580
We saw what happened in the Israeli pullout from the Gaza strip.

138
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.340
It pulled out completely all of the settlements from the Gaza strip.

139
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.140
There's not a single Jew left. There it's completely uteinrine.

140
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.300
And yet hamass is still sending tons of rockets from the Gaza strip

141
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.380
into Israel, the occupation,

142
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.570
the area is ended it's over and that's still going on.

143
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.410
And so then you have to ask yourself, like, does the average Palestinian, like,

144
00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.490
I believe that the average Palestinian I've spent time in the west bank talking

145
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:34.930
to Palestinians whose lives are imisrated by the,

146
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.650
by the Israeli occupation. Like they just wanna live a normal life, you know?

147
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:41.640
And, and yet they are being held hostage.

148
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.720
I spoke to this young mother in Gaza who fled, and she said to me on the phone,

149
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:51.720
we're being sort of amiserated twice, you know, once was by Israel.

150
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.360
And now by our own leaders by Hamas, right? These are like,

151
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.920
lepttocratic authoritarian regimes. That hate women that hate gay people.

152
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.400
I mean, it's horrible. Like life under these regimes is absolutely horrible.

153
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.640
So the problem is Israel then sees what happens in Gaza. And they're like, okay,

154
00:09:09.641 --> 00:09:12.960
we're in this situation where we wanna be a liberal democracy and yet we're,

155
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.990
you know, occupying in other people. It's an, it's an untenable situation.

156
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.150
If you want to be a liberal democracy to occupy in other people, the problem is,

157
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.950
is literally geographically. If they pull out of the west bank,

158
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:29.270
they will likely have another situation like they had in Gaza.

159
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:30.430
And now all of a sudden,

160
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.350
not only do you have rockets going to the south of the country and places like

161
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:39.180
steroid from you have rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv and the population

162
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:42.700
centers of Israel. So what do you do? What do you do?

163
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.020
<v 1>I don't know. Does anyone know? Not does, does anyone have a rational course?</v>

164
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.040
No.

165
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.540
<v 0>Really? No. I mean, I think, I think one of the,</v>

166
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.460
the places we've arrived to right is like,

167
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.890
what does Palestinian now nationalism really seek Western liberals like

168
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.890
me want, or for years I told myself,

169
00:10:02.891 --> 00:10:07.690
and I think this was certainly like the view of lots of experts that what

170
00:10:07.691 --> 00:10:11.210
Palestinian nationalism really wanted was a Palestinian state.

171
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.730
Palestinian just want, self-determination like everyone else in the world.

172
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.480
And I am AB absolutely on board with that. The problem is,

173
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:20.080
is that they're leaders.

174
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.240
And then you look at some of these polls and the numbers are really disturbing.

175
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:28.080
And they say, no, the goal is not having our own state alongside Israel.

176
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.840
The goal is erasing Israel. The goal is for Israel not to be there.

177
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.670
Right. And then you look at the evidence of all of these peace offers that were,

178
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:39.110
you know, Oslo and camp David,

179
00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.350
and we can go on and on and they were all rejected. So it's like,

180
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:47.430
is the goal your own land and having a place of your own or is the national,

181
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:48.790
or have we told ourselves,

182
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.030
and I include myself in this a lie about what Palestinian nationalism,

183
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.910
or at least parts of it seek. And that's really, really upsetting to confront.

184
00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.700
<v 1>So the hardcore position from people like from hespoah</v>

185
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.220
is that Israel is stolen yes.

186
00:11:07.221 --> 00:11:08.980
From Palestinian people. Yes.

187
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.813
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

188
00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:13.110
<v 1>And so, but.</v>

189
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.150
<v 0>Hisalah remembers in Southern Lebanon. Yeah. Right. That's like a, you know,</v>

190
00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:17.790
but they're all Iranian proxies and.

191
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.780
<v 1>Hamass oh yeah. Hezalah all these, they're all Iranian proxies.</v>

192
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.340
<v 0>Hezalah is an Iranian proxy. Yeah.</v>

193
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.180
<v 1>And hamass as well. Right.</v>

194
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:30.940
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and they all their position is that Israel shouldn't exist.

195
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.193
<v 0>Oh, absolutely.</v>

196
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.100
They do not want any Jewish state between the Jordan river and the Mediterranean

197
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:38.700
sea. They believe that any,

198
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.690
any Jewish presence in the middle east is hertical and that's.

199
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.370
<v 1>What they believe. That's probably also, um,</v>

200
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.690
accentuated by our support for Israel. Right.

201
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:55.440
Cuz the United States is fully in support of Israel, militarily politically,

202
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.833
socially.

203
00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.120
<v 0>Mm. Yeah. I mean, that's like saying, you know,</v>

204
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:08.080
I'm trying to think of the right analogy here. I mean, they're,

205
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.200
they're Nile like these are, these are terrorist,

206
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.470
unless you think terror like terrorism is rational.

207
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.830
I don't think that anything is accentuated by like,

208
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.550
I think they would think that about Israel,

209
00:12:20.551 --> 00:12:22.870
whether or not the us was supporting Israel. Right.

210
00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:27.110
<v 1>Yeah. When you see a situation like that,</v>

211
00:12:27.111 --> 00:12:30.150
where there doesn't seem to be a solution mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it's.

212
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.260
<v 0>Well, the solution is shrinking the conflict as much as possible. Right.</v>

213
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.220
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I do not believe right now you can resolve the conflict

214
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:43.140
because Israelis who have lived through times

215
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:47.300
where it was normal for buses and cafes to just blow up, you know,

216
00:12:47.301 --> 00:12:50.500
the number of people I know who were touched by the second. And defadada like,

217
00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.100
I was there during times where, you know,

218
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.930
a CA FA would just blow up down the street.

219
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.730
So like they have been thoroughly disused of the idea

220
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.850
that I think,

221
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.090
I think that many of them have given up on the idea that there could be peace in

222
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:08.570
the short term. So what can you do right now to make things a little bit better?

223
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.370
You can improve the economic life for people,

224
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.360
for Palestinians living in the west spank and you can try and shrink the

225
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.160
conflict, meaning no settlement expansion.

226
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.840
And I would say pull out of some of these settle Jewish settlements that are

227
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:23.840
like, you know,

228
00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.240
far flung and that the Israeli army is sort of protecting for no reason.

229
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.120
But I think that's the best case scenario for right now, for right now.

230
00:13:33.121 --> 00:13:33.441
And there's a,

231
00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:38.310
there's a book I think it's called them catch 67 by Mika Goodman that I would

232
00:13:38.311 --> 00:13:42.990
recommend to people that's about how to shrink the conflict and that for now

233
00:13:42.991 --> 00:13:45.630
being the best case scenario. But again, it's like,

234
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.590
why does you have to ask yourself,

235
00:13:47.591 --> 00:13:51.990
like why does everyone in the world obsessed about this particular conflict?

236
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.190
Yeah. There's a weird obsession with it.

237
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.060
<v 1>Why do you think that is?</v>

238
00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.820
<v 0>I think it's inescapable that part of it is an obsession with the Jews.</v>

239
00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.940
Like there are 500,000 Palestinians living in Lebanon,

240
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.700
most of whom live in refugee camps.

241
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:14.100
And by official Lebanese law are barred from being lawyers,

242
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.530
from being doctors, for being accountants. It's a horrible situation.

243
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.610
Do you think most people in the world know about the situation of the

244
00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:24.930
Palestinian imiseration in Lebanon?

245
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.410
They don't even know Palestinians are in Lebanon or in Jordan.

246
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.130
They have no idea. The reason is because you know,

247
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:38.080
it's like Palestinian lives matter when people that are hurting them are Jews.

248
00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.200
They don't seem to matter when the people that are hurting them are other Arabs.

249
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.160
<v 1>That's one of the things that I wanted to talk to you about it's that this</v>

250
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:53.320
acceptance of antisemitism almost globally mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; is

251
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.120
unique. It's not, it's a,

252
00:14:57.121 --> 00:15:00.400
it's a weird racism or a weird

253
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.680
discrimination. A a it's weird. It doesn't,

254
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:10.160
it doesn't parallel with any other sort of discrimination. Right?

255
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.710
<v 0>It's like people aren't sitting around thinking about how, you know,</v>

256
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.390
left-handed people or Koreans are uniquely evil.

257
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.150
Like they're sitting around thinking about that with regard to the Jews.

258
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.910
<v 1>There's going to be a certain amount of population,</v>

259
00:15:23.911 --> 00:15:25.110
certain percentage of the population,

260
00:15:25.111 --> 00:15:27.230
no matter what that's gonna hold those beliefs.

261
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.710
And these have been passed down for thousands of years.

262
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:36.260
<v 0>Yes. And the challenge is to keep society as</v>

263
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.180
like healthy,

264
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.900
as possible to keep those forces at bay.

265
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.660
Really. I mean, it's, it's really,

266
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.340
it's unbelievable the extent to which it's, it's become accepted. Like

267
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.770
I'll give you an example. Like there was, um,

268
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.410
and this is the way that anti- Zionism presents itself. The anti- Zionism,

269
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:01.770
I think is the modern form.

270
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.770
One of the modern forms of anti-Semitism because what else do you call a

271
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:10.650
movement that says that the Jewish state that already exists does not have a

272
00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:15.210
right to exist? Like that sounds like, oh,

273
00:16:15.211 --> 00:16:18.930
that's like a cool theory, but it's like, it exists. They live there.

274
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.690
They are surrounded by people that want to murder them.

275
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.490
So what are you suggesting that it just like goes away,

276
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.250
like the effect of it would be nothing less than unbelievable bloodshed.

277
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.600
And yet lots of people in this world are going around saying,

278
00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:35.000
calling themselves anti Zionist.

279
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.360
<v 1>Do you think that they've,</v>

280
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.960
it seems like almost a sentiment that gets expressed that hasn't been

281
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.200
really examined. Yes. So it's a, like a coory.

282
00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.240
<v 0>It has to do with criticism of Israel. Like people should be able,</v>

283
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:54.710
Israeli government is full of like, unitix just like our government,

284
00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:57.270
just like any other normal country, but it's like,

285
00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:58.950
Israel's not treated like a normal country.

286
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.310
It's treated in a way like this has these superpowers,

287
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.750
both superpowers to like affect peace in the middle east and superpowers

288
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:10.630
to like, like a super villain.

289
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:15.740
It's both at once people hate a country that doesn't exist and they love a

290
00:17:15.741 --> 00:17:16.620
country that doesn't exist.

291
00:17:16.621 --> 00:17:20.780
They project themselves and their ideas of things onto this place.

292
00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.420
And it's just like a normal country.

293
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.740
<v 1>That's where it's,</v>

294
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.860
it's so strange cuz it that's where there really doesn't seem to be a way out of

295
00:17:29.861 --> 00:17:32.620
this because it's an idea.

296
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.610
That's not that hasn't been full explored, but has been expressed.

297
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.250
So frivolously almost mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt;.

298
00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.690
<v 0>Well, it's just, it's like, if you think about,</v>

299
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.930
think about if there was a movement in the world that suggested that,

300
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:51.000
you know, the Japanese weren't real people and the,

301
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.880
and Japan does not have a right to exist.

302
00:17:52.881 --> 00:17:54.920
Like think about how crazy that sounds. Right.

303
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.360
But that's a normal thing that a lot of people believe.
