00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um.</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.260
<v 1>What, what made you want to write this? Like w where'd this come from.</v>

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.880
<v 2>Actually two things, uh, about 10 years ago, 11 years ago,</v>

4
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:13.910
I had this really weird experience. I was in San Francisco.

5
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.310
It's a lot of breath, work, yoga stuff going on there.

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.230
And I kept getting pneumonia. I surf a lot at,

7
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:22.280
at ocean beach and I thought that that was the reason.

8
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.370
So I kept getting bronchitis pneumonia year after year,

9
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.710
that just kept happening. So a doctor,

10
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.220
friend of mine suggested a breathing class might help.

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.410
I didn't know much about this, but went down,

12
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.580
signed up and was sitting in the corner of this studio,

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.290
cold room legs, crossed breathing in this rhythmic pattern,

14
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.830
nothing crazy just, and then really slow.

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.270
And I sweated through my t-shirt through my socks.

16
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:53.210
My hair was sopping, wet, sweat all over my face.

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.740
So I went back to her and I said, what happened? Like you're a doctor.

18
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:01.730
You should know this. And she said, oh, you must have had a fever.

19
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.510
Or the room must have been too hot. So she had no idea,

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.840
but I didn't know what to do with that story. So I just kind of filed it away.

21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.140
Forgot about it for a number of years until I met some free divers.

22
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.270
These are people who have through the power of will enabled themselves to

23
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.640
hold their breath for 6, 7,

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.540
8 minutes at a time and dive to depths far below what any scientists thought

25
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.250
possible. So I thought, wow,

26
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.460
there's something in breathing here that I don't know about.

27
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:31.700
And I figured other people might not know about as well. Uh.

28
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.390
<v 1>That's, that's, that's really interesting, you know, um,</v>

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.650
I've known a bunch of free divers and, uh,

30
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.320
I've known a bunch of jiu-jitsu people that got really into yoga primarily

31
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:47.060
because of Hicks and Gracie and Gracie. Do you know he is famous, uh,

32
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.880
probably the most famous of the, of the,

33
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.290
like the classic jiu-jitsu people he's known as being the very best.

34
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.290
He was like one of the, uh, original,

35
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.750
real pioneers of jujitsu in America as well.

36
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.190
And there's this documentary on him called choke. Have you seen it? I have not.

37
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:07.430
No, it's really fascinating. This documentary,

38
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:12.290
he's doing all this crazy stomach breath stuff, the Yogi stuff, you know,

39
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:12.710
cause he's,

40
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.710
he's really into yoga as well for flexibility and balance and all those

41
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.850
different things. And he was, uh, probably the first guy to introduce yoga,

42
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.200
to jujitsu as well. But, um, him and his son,

43
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.000
who's also a world champion in jujitsu,

44
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.310
just stressed constantly that it's all about the breath and that breathing

45
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.480
is it's everything that it's everything for jujitsu,

46
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:38.240
it's everything for martial arts, it's everything for your mindset.

47
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.040
<v 2>You're going to find that the foundation of so many different sports,</v>

48
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.930
I think a lot of that has been forgotten.

49
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.070
I know that coaches in the fifties used to have their runners take a big

50
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.380
mouthful of water, run around the track,

51
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.100
and then they'd have to spit out that same amount of water into a cup to force

52
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.320
them to breathe through their nose, to force them,

53
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:01.060
to move their diaphragms up and down little more because breathing is so

54
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:03.880
essential to the recovery, their endurance and their performance.

55
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.320
<v 1>One of the things I find interesting about your book was the experiment with</v>

56
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.800
plugging up the nose for pro what'd. You guys do it for a month.

57
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.970
Is that what it was 10 days, 10 days. And that, that tender, I,

58
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.950
my nose was broken. Most of my life. I had a useless nose til I was 40.

59
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.580
And then I got an operation to have my deviated septum corrected and the

60
00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:27.840
turbinates shaved down and then it changed my life. It really did. Like,

61
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:30.030
I didn't realize like what,

62
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.030
like the term mouth breather is a really interesting term, right?

63
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.800
Cause it's a term for a moron, but I felt like a moron. Um,

64
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.310
like after I got my nose fixed, I was like, why didn't I do this before?

65
00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:43.530
Like I was robbing myself of oxygen.

66
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.611
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:48.750
And there's so much science supporting how injurious it is to constantly be

68
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:51.780
breathing through your mouth. There's there's no debate about that.

69
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.520
But what people don't realize is about 25 to 50% of the population habitually

70
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.683
breathe through their mouth.

71
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.110
And they don't realize that neurological problems that this causes the

72
00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:05.310
respiratory problems, this causes problems with snoring, sleep apnea,

73
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.760
even metabolic disorders. I mean, it goes on and on and on.

74
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.930
So I had been talking to the chief of rhinology research at Stanford.

75
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.460
We had done many interviews over a series of months. He's a big nose guy.

76
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.530
So he said, this is the most amazing organ.

77
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.750
No one's talking about it at the NIH.

78
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.020
There's no school for studying the nose and its effects.

79
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:26.520
And he thought that that was criminal.

80
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.850
So he had warned me how bad mouth breathing was,

81
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.980
but no one knew how quickly that damage came on. So, uh, we,

82
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:37.080
we knew that after years it can change the structure of your face.

83
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.890
It's so common in kids that it has a term called adenoid face.

84
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200
If you see these kids with very long faces,

85
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.190
because they've been mouth breathing so long that their faces have actually that

86
00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:48.420
the musculature and the Skeletor teacher has.

87
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.180
<v 3>Changed. It changes your skeleton. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.780
<v 2>It, it, it makes it creates a longer face. So, and that,</v>

89
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:59.280
that also makes these people much more apt to snoring and sleep apnea. So, but,

90
00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:02.700
but no one knew if, if a month of mouth breathing would be bad a year,

91
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.320
like how soon those, those issues came on. So I asked him, I said, well,

92
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:08.430
why don't, why don't you test it?

93
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:12.870
You're one of the best universities in the world. You have the means to do this.

94
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.120
And he thought, in his words,

95
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.100
it would be unethical because he knew how damaging that it could be for people.

96
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.190
And so I volunteered. I said, well, why don't you test it on me?

97
00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:26.610
I'll get somebody else to do it. Uh, they had no money for this.

98
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:30.620
So we had to pay for this study, um, just to experience what,

99
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:35.490
what that was like. And, and the point wasn't due to do some like stunt,

100
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.000
it was to LOL ourselves a new position. My body certainly knew.

101
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:43.500
I think I was mouth breathing through much of my youth and that 25 to 50% of the

102
00:05:43.501 --> 00:05:46.260
population knows. And to actually measure what happens.

103
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.890
<v 1>Now,</v>

104
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.890
do you think th there was some bacterial growth that was inside your nose as

105
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:53.010
well from this? Do you think that some of that could be attributed to just the,

106
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.430
the act of plugging the nose? Cause you physically plugged it.

107
00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:59.840
It's not like you to breathe out of your mouth. You actually like,

108
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.150
see you closed up the opening.

109
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.620
<v 2>Yeah. That's that's right. And it could, no one knows for sure,</v>

110
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.480
because the less you use your nose,

111
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:10.630
the less you're going to be able to use your nose, just like any other muscle.

112
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.020
So when people start habitually breathing through their mouth,

113
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.850
their noses are going to start to close up.

114
00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:19.720
And we know this from the doctor of speech, language pathology at Stanford,

115
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.520
she measured people who had laryngectomies holes drilled in their throat so they

116
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:27.370
could breathe. She found between two months and two years,

117
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.580
their noses were completely blocked. Zero air coming in.

118
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.150
So the more you use it, the more you're going to be able to use it.

119
00:06:34.151 --> 00:06:36.850
So the less you use it, the more apt you will,

120
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.590
you will be to have problems with.

121
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.860
<v 1>What is the process of, well, why does the nose close up?</v>

122
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.590
It would seem that it's a whole, like that whole quote.

123
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.760
<v 2>It's not in use this terminates, all those tissues, just, just start closing up.</v>

124
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.810
Um.

125
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.860
<v 1>And so using your nose actually makes the opening wider. Absolutely.</v>

126
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.420
Really for you. Yeah, absolutely.

127
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:59.680
My nose got physically wider after my operation. It's really strange.

128
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.543
Like I was,

129
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.320
I looked back on the photos from when I was 40 on

130
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.090
my actual physical and I attributed it to the fact that they put these big foam

131
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.440
things and these plastic spacers in there because the doctor that did the

132
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:19.300
operation, he S for, I forget the period of time afterwards,

133
00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:24.220
I had to have these things stuffed into my nose and this plastic that was sort

134
00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:26.890
of sutured in place to hold it into position.

135
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.550
And I attributed that to why my nose got wider,

136
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.660
but I noticed it like within the year or two afterwards, I'm like,

137
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.360
my nose is wider. Like, it's different.

138
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.400
Like if I look at older pictures of myself,

139
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:41.650
my nose was more narrow and now it's more flared out. And I,

140
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.760
I felt like it was because of that. But now that you're saying this,

141
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.670
now I'm thinking maybe it's just from breathing out of.

142
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.790
<v 2>It. Well, surgical interventions are going to open that airway.</v>

143
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:53.080
There's no doubt about that,

144
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.630
but we know the more that you breathe through your nose,

145
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:56.950
the more that it's going to open up,

146
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.590
and you can see this with people who are habitual mouth breathers,

147
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.680
who are also joggers, who have just been breathing through their mouth for,

148
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.890
for decades. They start breathing through the nose at the beginning.

149
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:06.670
It's really, really.

150
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.850
<v 3>Hard. And they say, I can't do this. This is awful. Then.</v>

151
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.030
<v 2>Weeks go by months, go by and their noses open up and,</v>

152
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:17.110
and allows them to, to breathe through the nose and the benefits of that.

153
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:21.040
They're innumerable so many benefits of nasal breathing, not only oxygen,

154
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:25.390
but it helps defend your body humidifies air conditions, air on and on and on.

155
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.990
And this is something that I just don't think a lot of people realize. And,

156
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:32.600
and from the researchers I've been talking to, they were a bit frustrated too,

157
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:37.660
to seen so many chronic conditions tied to mouth breathing and how so

158
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:42.430
many of those could either be improved upon, or sometimes outright here,

159
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.850
but by switching the pathway in which you breathe. So.

160
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.850
<v 1>Does breathing through your nose, make your actual nostril opening wider?</v>

161
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.460
<v 2>I don't know that I, and, and, uh, I haven't seen any papers on that.</v>

162
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:54.730
So.

163
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.500
<v 1>It's what my nostril holes and everything is probably just from the surgical</v>

164
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.410
intervention and stuffing it with plastic and stretching it out.

165
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.690
<v 2>And I would assume so. Yeah. Now.</v>

166
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.890
<v 1>What Wim Hoff will you referenced in the book? He doesn't give a about mouth,</v>

167
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.620
about nose breathing or mouth breathing. He just goes, just breathe.

168
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.180
The breathe. Well, that's what he said. Oh.

169
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.450
<v 2>Yeah. I practiced. I, his, his mode of breathing all the time.</v>

170
00:09:17.451 --> 00:09:20.150
I'm used to having, you know, his, his little voice in my head.

171
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.750
<v 1>Doesn't he care about breathing out from the nose of the mouth.</v>

172
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.800
He just wants you to be breathe.

173
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.260
<v 2>Because if we're breathing 25,000 times a day,</v>

174
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.960
if you're taking 500 of those breaths through your mouth,

175
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.880
it's not going to really make any impact on you.

176
00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.190
I'm talking about habitual mouth breathing.

177
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.990
I'm just talking about through breathing.

178
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.330
<v 3>Exercises. He's he's so what he's.</v>

179
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.480
<v 2>Done is he wants to make this easy and accessible for people.</v>

180
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.180
So many people can't breathe through their noses. So they go,

181
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.440
they can't get that breath in those 30 huge breaths. Do you need to take right?

182
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.780
They take too long to do it. So he says, it doesn't matter. Don't pay attention.

183
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.900
You need to get that breath in. You need to expand your lungs.

184
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.450
And for the rest of the time, you know,

185
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.100
the benefits of nasal breathing that habitual breathing is, is so important.

186
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.610
<v 1>It seems so strange to me reading your book, um,</v>

187
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.090
that I'm just learning this in terms of like, I mean,

188
00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:13.790
I've been doing athletics my whole life.

189
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.230
How do I not know that breathing through the nose is more beneficial?

190
00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:20.210
How do coaches not know this?

191
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.570
<v 2>Yeah, this is something I just got running up against over and over again.</v>

192
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.160
And when I first started writing this book,

193
00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:27.470
my friends who were journalists and authors, they said,

194
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.010
you write a book about breathing. Why would you write a book about breathing?

195
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.550
Yeah, there's, there's a good new book about walking.

196
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.580
<v 3>Really? Um, so.</v>

197
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.990
<v 2>So they were ripping on me quite,</v>

198
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:42.020
quite a bit until they heard some of the details of it. Um,

199
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.890
and the stuff is like, has been right in front of us the whole time.

200
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.400
And it's so obvious that no one's really paying attention to it.

201
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.940
And the scientific foundation, all the research is there.

202
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.210
And that's what makes these, these researchers, these scientists.

203
00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.600
So frustrated is they, we have 50 years of rock,

204
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:02.600
solid science here showing the problems with mouth breathing,

205
00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:04.640
showing the problems with snoring and sleep apnea.

206
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.590
No one's really been paying attention. We're,

207
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:11.120
we're treating all these separate problems that are associated with these core

208
00:11:11.121 --> 00:11:13.190
issues. And we're not looking at the core issue.

209
00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:17.900
And I think that breathing has to be considered along with diet and

210
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:22.790
exercise as, as a pillar of health. Because even if you eat keto, vegan, paleo,

211
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:26.060
whatever, even if you exercise all the time, if you're not breathing right,

212
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.400
you're never really going to be healthy. We know that beat the.

213
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.060
<v 1>Truth. So air comes through your mouth. Air comes through your nose.</v>

214
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.430
What is the difference between the air coming through your nose?

215
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.530
<v 2>So your nose, if you were to take your fist, you've got a really big fist.</v>

216
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:44.480
So if someone with a slightly smaller fist and to take that fist and imagine

217
00:11:44.481 --> 00:11:46.100
just pushing it inside of your head,

218
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.250
that's about the volume of your nose and all of the sinus cavities.

219
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.560
So they even stretch up above your eyes.

220
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.340
<v 1>So volume of your that's crazy.</v>

221
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.220
<v 2>It's about a billiard ball. Um, so, so a little less,</v>

222
00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.090
it depends on what size fish you have, right? So, so all,

223
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.640
and they call it the nasal concha because it looks exactly like a seashell.

224
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:10.330
If you were to split a seashell in, in half and look at it,

225
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.160
that's what's happening in your nose.

226
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.400
And all of this stuff evolved this way for a reason.

227
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.150
So that air that comes in through the nose is slowed down.

228
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:23.410
It's filtered it's humidified and it's condition.

229
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:26.140
So by the time it gets to your lungs,

230
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.290
your lungs can absorb that oxygen so much easier.

231
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.470
And that the nose is really the first line of defense.

232
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.030
Another amazing thing with a nose is it produces something called nitric

233
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.880
oxide, which is this wonderful molecule.

234
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.020
That is a vasodilators that plays in a central role in oxygen delivery,

235
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.850
and also helps battle off viruses and bacteria and other pathogens.

236
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.320
So this is all happening in the nose and slowing down that air.

237
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.330
And all of these other functions allow us to gain about 20% more oxygen

238
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.940
breathing through the nose than breathing through the mouth.

239
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.780
So you can breathe less and get more by breathing through the nose.

240
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.100
<v 1>Wow. Um, so breathing through the mouth,</v>

241
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.060
even though you're filling your lungs up, even though you're,

242
00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.700
you're taking a big, deep breath, you're filling your lungs up.

243
00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:16.260
You're not getting as much oxygen.

244
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.860
<v 2>That's right? Because you can over breathe. When, when people, uh,</v>

245
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:22.260
at a gym or when people are jogging, you see them

246
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:27.690
really going to get the maximum amount of oxygen. And that's not what happened,

247
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.490
what is happening to your body.

248
00:13:29.491 --> 00:13:34.080
So you are offloading the CO2 by offloading too much CO2

249
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.250
you're causing constriction in your circulation. So right now,

250
00:13:38.251 --> 00:13:42.660
if we were to breathe 30 huge breaths, you'll feel some tingling in your head.

251
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.450
You'll feel some, maybe your fingertips will get cool.

252
00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:49.260
Your toes will get too cool. That's not from an increase of oxygen.

253
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.710
It's the opposite. That's happening. That's from a decrease of circulation.

254
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.020
So your body wants to be imbalanced.

255
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.920
You want to have the right amount of CO2 and oxygen for optimum delivery.

256
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.620
And that's what the nose helps you to do.

257
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.390
<v 1>That was one of the craziest things about the book where you're talking about</v>

258
00:14:03.391 --> 00:14:07.800
yogis, that we're able to vary the temperature between each hand. No,

259
00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:09.570
on the same hand. Oh, in the same house.

260
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.740
<v 2>Same hand, one area was gray. The other was red. Oh,</v>

261
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:15.600
in the same,

262
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.770
not even this God on the same hand.

263
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.420
And you know, when I came across this, people are saying, this is impossible.

264
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.960
There's you know, who did this study? Some guy in, in towels in his garage.

265
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:30.330
<v 3>It was, no, it was at the manager clinic.</v>

266
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.840
<v 2>Which was the world's, uh,</v>

267
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.420
at least in the U S the largest psychiatric research facility at the time.

268
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.870
And, uh, Navy physicists did these tests.

269
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.660
It was reporting in the New York time and replicated.

270
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.470
They haven't found someone who had the powers of Swami, Rama. They found,

271
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.140
I think, whims about as close as we've gotten to that guy.
