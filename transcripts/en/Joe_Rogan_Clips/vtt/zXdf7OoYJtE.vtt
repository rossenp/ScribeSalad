00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>Hello, freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.660
This is an interesting fight coming up for you to be fighting TJ after training

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:09.740
with him for so long and all the bad blood that you guys have at TJ leave and

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.900
the team and going to train with Dwayne, not.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.840
<v 1>So much about the team. That's, there's a lot of confusion about what, what,</v>

6
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.770
what went down and it's it's well, let's lay it out for people.

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.920
<v 0>Because TJ trained with you guys for a long time. Here's.</v>

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900
<v 1>If I send you a text, I'll say you,</v>

9
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:28.220
the four minute video of him explaining exactly what happened,

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.350
which is it isn't that you don't have to do that,

11
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:31.790
but you tell me from your point of view.

12
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.410
So TJ left the team like said, Hey, look,

13
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.790
I first off it was, it was a.

14
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.380
<v 2>It lived on the ultimate fighter with Kotter. He came in from that,</v>

15
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.420
cause he was there and that was when we were defending them.

16
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:51.230
That's why I'm kinda like took it to cause he like, I'm all about loyalty.

17
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.220
And like, we don't.

18
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.570
<v 1>Do that. And I never really liked Dwayne, especially the way he left.</v>

19
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.720
Cause he was a strange guy and like, it was always about money and weird things,

20
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:02.930
et cetera, et cetera, he left. And that was like, fine. That was his deal.

21
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.790
TJ was going to try to have him come back and train at our gym for his fight and

22
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.690
Duane refused to do it. And I had a talk with TJ and he's like, it was crying.

23
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:12.620
And like, you know, that,

24
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.330
that Dwayne just wanted to focus on his own gym and this and that.

25
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.590
And he's like, you know, whatever. And so he's like,

26
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:20.840
I'm going to spend some time there and spend some time here, et cetera.

27
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.970
Like that's fine. So TJ, when he got there,

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.440
got some exposure for muscle farm and muscle farm.

29
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.630
<v 0>They help people out here. Duane,</v>

30
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:37.190
Ludwig's a former kickboxing champion who was an MMA fighter who fought the UFC

31
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:38.360
and then went on to be a coach.

32
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.430
<v 3>For a year, for a year. Three of those.</v>

33
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.490
<v 0>Seconds. No, no, no. He coaches now a lie, right? It was his own jam.</v>

34
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:46.520
But for you guys, he was your striking coach for a little.

35
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.650
<v 3>Bit, for a year and three months. And he worked with.</v>

36
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.640
<v 0>A bunch of your fighters and he had a very special relationship with TJ. Right.</v>

37
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.660
Then he moved out to Denver and he moved out to Denver to fight his out,

38
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.510
to start his own thing. And then muscle farm, which has a big gym in Denver.

39
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.240
They invited TJ to come train there.

40
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.360
So it fill in the blanks for people that don't know the story that aren't maybe

41
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.223
big time fans.

42
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.630
<v 1>So yeah. So then he, he basically said that he wanted to, that he wanted to,</v>

43
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.780
uh, he, he was doing his camps there for about a year and a half.

44
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.900
He'd spend a little time there a little time here. Uh,

45
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.380
most of the time are he lived in Sacramento most time there we'd go work with

46
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:26.300
Dwayne. No problem with it. I cornered with Dwayne even after he left with, uh,

47
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.910
with, you know, guys and stuff like that, wasn't an issue.

48
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.200
So then I heard Dwayne actually texted me and was like,

49
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.650
Dwayne said something like, well, I mean,

50
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:39.380
there's a whole side of the Dwayne thing, which is hilarious.

51
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.480
That was him getting weird like a year after he left,

52
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.920
like acting like he was there.

53
00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:50.810
He like tried to Sue me for a figment of his imagination of some money

54
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:51.890
that wasn't even there.

55
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:54.920
And like this whole thing he had like as one of the students write this thing.

56
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.100
So there is something where he said that I had like,

57
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.420
I can't even remember like something like,

58
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.960
I didn't give him a discretionary bonus that was supposed to be given or

59
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:08.830
something like that. And so there was like some,

60
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.980
some like intermingling is about that, whatever.

61
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.580
So Dwayne texts me and says, and I said, dude,

62
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:18.010
I never said I had to set the record straight on Dwayne.

63
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.510
And Dwayne texts me and says, Hey,

64
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.960
I'm not the one trying to steal your team in your fighters.

65
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:26.560
I know there's a team out here in Denver being built,

66
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.980
but I'm not a part of that. And I was like, are you talking about,

67
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.000
and then I had talked to an, uh, and someone else that said that, Hey,

68
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.260
I heard that Matt brown and TJ Dillashaw are getting paid

69
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.850
to be on this team. And so I come in and I was like, Hey, I,

70
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.700
we were talking about some team things in TGS and practice. I go, I go,

71
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.300
I got the weirdest thing. Dwayne texted me this and this other guy said this.

72
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:53.590
I said, are you going to like, are you getting like paid to go be,

73
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.880
start a new team or something?

74
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.390
And it was T Cody was there and Lance was there and all was there.

75
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.800
And TJ like lies straight to us about, about the whole thing. He's like,

76
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.930
he's like, no, man, I know they offered me, but I'm not,

77
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:07.450
I'm not I'm with you guys. You know? Well team alpha male.

78
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.090
He was like this and that. And I was like, okay, whatever.

79
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:15.010
Then time goes on and we have an actual sit down and

80
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:19.720
talk. We go eat sometimes and everything. And TJ, Chad Mendez, uh, my buddy,

81
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:23.830
Phil, we all go and eat. And TJ just tells me like, Hey man,

82
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.340
uh, my next camp, I'm going to go out to Denver,

83
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:30.100
which he'd already been going out to Denver had been like a year and a half

84
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.740
since two and he'd be gone. It wasn't like he like gone or whatever.

85
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.030
And he's like, but muscle farm offered me like some,

86
00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:40.990
some real good money to like be part of their team. He's like, so I'm basically,

87
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:45.310
I'm no longer going to be representing team alpha male. I like,

88
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.700
I'm going to do my camp out there and I'm going, gonna, you know,

89
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.010
for they're going to announce me. And we were talking about,

90
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.110
he told me at the time it was, I think 4,500 bucks a month, a month.

91
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.460
And they were going to rent them a house and I go and I was like, okay.

92
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:03.520
And Chad was sitting right there and he just sit there and go, I go, well,

93
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:05.830
shoot, man. It was nice having you on the team. And he's like,

94
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.800
why are you getting upset? I go, I'm not upset. I'm just saying like,

95
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.100
like you're off the team then. And he's like, well, yeah, but he's like, but I,

96
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:16.690
I have a house here. I'm still going to come back and like, come in and spar.

97
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.570
And when I'm in town in the off season or whatever, and I'm like,

98
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.210
where do you guys for real weird. And then I said, I said, well, I said,

99
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.190
so that, so he was no longer going to be on our team.

100
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.680
He's gonna be on a different team. And,

101
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.980
but then he wanted to come in at the time I'm ranked number three in the world,

102
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.300
Cody and him are going at it and practice it's anybody's given day, you know,

103
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.200
we can look at the footage if you guys have the footage. Yeah. But, uh,

104
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.630
and then holds were seven and oh, and, and had just won the ultimate fighter.

105
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.350
And so TJ is basically saying, is leaving the team. I go, bro, TJ. I said,

106
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.580
I said, you can, you know, you're welcome to stay on the team. But like,

107
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.460
if you're, if you're no longer on the team, like, you know, what,

108
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.750
what does that mean? And he's like, well, I mean, it's just a good opportunity,

109
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:07.460
man. Like I don't there. I don't have to pay, they pay me to train and,

110
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.380
and like, you know, it's,

111
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.320
they're starting a team and everything's going to be under one roof and I go,

112
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.154
all right, cool.

113
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.540
<v 0>That's anybody ever done that? Where it worked? I never know.</v>

114
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.100
They always try that black. Wow.

115
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.450
<v 1>But, but here's the thing. So then after that it was like, he's like,</v>

116
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.800
who's going to leave in two weeks.

117
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.960
And so me and T me and Cody are sitting in there and like, we'd,

118
00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:33.370
hadn't said anything. I told Fabio art instructor, uh, or jujitsu instructor,

119
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:36.610
what was happening. And he told someone in Brazil as a Brazilian in Brazil,

120
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.480
leaked it out. That TD was changing camps. And there's all this drama and,

121
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.710
and this and that. And then, um, I said, look, TJ. So he,

122
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.350
he was coming in and TJ was never the best teammate.

123
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.240
He would like try to hurt people.

124
00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:51.850
He's a very competitive guy and he has a temper and yeah,

125
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.600
like trying to hurt people, how she shot, she shot.

126
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.720
<v 4>Him. She shot, we always, we always.</v>

127
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.420
<v 2>Use it. And the bell boxing, he Nia, because I know.</v>

128
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.850
<v 1>He's like, I just need him to the bottom. Like, yeah. We're blocked.</v>

129
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.930
You mean easy to the body of the box. Did she ask you?

130
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.180
There's no secret about TJ. I mean,

131
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.540
we talked about it when he was still on the team also that he had to be like

132
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.250
reeled in a little bit. Right. He's just,

133
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.880
he's just got a temporary that's when you call them kill Shaw. Yeah. Kyla, Shaw,

134
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.080
Dilla, shank, like all that kind of stuff. I mean, it was,

135
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.000
it w that was his thing, you know, just super competitive,

136
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:27.040
aggressive guy and cheap shots.

137
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.830
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. The super competitiveness, like I'm competitive.</v>

138
00:07:29.831 --> 00:07:31.390
I don't want to lose someone takes me, you know,

139
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.690
I'm fighting tooth and nail not to get taken down or get that extra when that

140
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:38.110
round it, just at the end of the bell knees, you know what I mean?

141
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:40.330
That's why Chris is out. You know what I mean?

142
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:44.500
Need them in the back of the head. I mean, Chris Holdsworth, that's where the,

143
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.190
I.

144
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.140
<v 1>Don't want to Chris doesn't want us really talking.</v>

145
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:51.960
<v 2>About that. [inaudible] we're talking about cheap shot and that's what was that?</v>

146
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.100
I mean, he doesn't care if we talk about it. I mean,

147
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:58.520
I guess that's what happened. How did it go? I'm not to say it. I don't know.

148
00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.150
[inaudible] I remember distinctively, Dwayne used to come up to the crisp, like,

149
00:08:04.151 --> 00:08:07.570
Hey, like grasshopper. He's like, we have a, you know,

150
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.120
TJ his fight and he'd take it easy. Can you take it easy?

151
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:13.720
I'm a criticism killer as a killer, him up everybody. I mean, Chris is,

152
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.320
it was an animal and I guess Chris choked him out and TJ got out and,

153
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.170
even in the back of the head, when he's down in the man, who's down on the mat.

154
00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:23.090
<v 0>Grappling match, sparring.</v>

155
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.100
<v 1>Needs to the back of the head. That's what, wow.</v>

156
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.970
<v 2>Chris admitted. I mean, just dirty. I've been a couple of times, Chris.</v>

157
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.940
<v 0>Let them up, let us, let them submit to them, let them off.</v>

158
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.040
And then TJ need them in the back of that. I don't know if that's.

159
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.470
<v 1>Exactly how it was. I, I remember seeing the whole thing.</v>

160
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:41.350
I don't really want to get into this cause it's Chris's gig, man. Yeah,

161
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:43.480
that's fine. But we've already gotten in there. He got into.

162
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.830
<v 2>It, but yeah. So bought TJ being a cheap shot.</v>

163
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.750
<v 0>That's what literally killed Chris's career. Yeah. Well obviously.</v>

164
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.120
<v 2>Concussions. Yeah. We grew up good friends with Chris.</v>

165
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.360
<v 5>Together. They lived together.</v>

166
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.703
<v 2>He went through it.</v>

167
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.220
That's why his last fight was he had to fight with concussion because he,

168
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.750
you know, he was scheduled to fight just like that. And you know, we've all,

169
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.390
you know, as one of the things that when I first came out there,

170
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:11.670
I was never really close with TJ. I was out there.

171
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:14.430
I was doing well with the guys. And a couple of the guys told me like, man, TJ,

172
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:17.100
can't wait to spar you. This is when he was coming off. His Raphael,

173
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.530
since cell loss, I was like, cool. Like I'm.

174
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.020
I can't wait to spar with him either. He's better. You know,

175
00:09:22.021 --> 00:09:25.170
it's going to be a good round, you know? And I was pretty warned like, Hey,

176
00:09:25.171 --> 00:09:29.130
TJ does some cheap. Just, you know, keep it going. And, and I there's video.

177
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:30.660
I think I have some, uh,

178
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:33.810
one of the kids that was at a boxing and he sent it to me months ago,

179
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.590
TD like cheap shot me after the bell. I was like, remember to tell TJ, I said,

180
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:40.050
look, you're cheap. Shot me again. We're taking the gloves off.

181
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:43.620
We're going in the street and fighting. Yeah. Thought of that.

182
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.580
I just don't ever like that. Especially teammates. You don't do that. Like, Hey,

183
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.050
you, you, you, you get me, you get me.

184
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:50.610
But don't cheap shot at me at the end of the bell.

185
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:53.100
And then as soon as you're hitting someone off the chief, you're like, oh dude,

186
00:09:53.101 --> 00:09:55.290
I'm sorry. Like, you know, so.

187
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.900
<v 1>Anyway, so anyways, that being said, we knew that was part of TJ, its thing,</v>

188
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:02.270
but now he's no longer part of our team.

189
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.990
And he is also getting paid to go somewhere else.

190
00:10:05.991 --> 00:10:07.610
He's no longer contributing in any way.

191
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.850
And he wants to come in and come in and spar our guys. And like,

192
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.640
like he basically want to be on our team,

193
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.210
a benefit of our team without being a part of the team anymore and getting paid

194
00:10:17.211 --> 00:10:18.044
to be somewhere else,

195
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.110
which I would have been finding that he talked to me about like, Hey,

196
00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:23.780
I want to work something out where I go get paid and do this, whatever.

197
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.230
But then I'm like, okay, so that whole week he's in there.

198
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.360
And he's sitting there watching me and Cody in practice. And he,

199
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.090
I don't care. I mean, TJ is a competitive,

200
00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:38.780
he's always looking for edge the whole week prior to telling us that he was

201
00:10:38.781 --> 00:10:42.950
leaving. He kept getting like, Hey, there's a getting some proprietary series.

202
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.610
And this series, there's a single, a guard series I used to get them with.

203
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.100
And he's like,

204
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.490
have me and Martin Canton show him all this stuff we were working on. Oh, Hey,

205
00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:53.180
can you show me this? And told me that like the week before and then,

206
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.840
so I was like, I go, TJ, look, man, this is getting awkward in practice. I said,

207
00:10:56.841 --> 00:10:59.060
look, we can, I had him over at my house. I said, look,

208
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.960
we can build a friendship. However we want to do it. I said,

209
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:03.920
but this is getting awkward.

210
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:08.270
And like you being in practicing no longer being on the team and everything

211
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:13.220
else, like, you know, let's finish out this, this last couple of days. And then,

212
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.270
you know, you be on your team. We can be friends on, on the outside.

213
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:20.810
We can work on that as a, as a deal, whatever. And he's like, like you,

214
00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.840
he wanted to come in and train with our team still, you know, as,

215
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.670
not as not part of the team. Right. And then I was like,

216
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.680
but you're welcome to stay on our team. Obviously,

217
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:35.090
if you want and continue to do your camps and whatnot. And he is just like,

218
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:41.170
like out. So that at that point it became him taking this opportunity,

219
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.390
going to Denver, being with Dwayne, getting paid, to do the muscle farm thing.

220
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.010
And then the whole thing with Connor happened on the TV show before this,

221
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.740
before any of this happened, Conor McGregor started calling, uh,

222
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.420
call him a snake, a snake because me and Connor had one conversation.

223
00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.000
We're sitting there and he goes, he goes, man,

224
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.050
congratulations on TJ defending his belt. Cause he was still on our team,

225
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:07.540
his last title defense. And I go, thanks. He goes,

226
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:10.660
but what's up with Dwayne saying that no one on your team wants to be champions.

227
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:13.600
That's weird. I said, oh, he's just bitter because you know,

228
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.180
he's trying to get everyone to go out to his camp, but you know,

229
00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:20.770
he's just being a hater, this and that. And he goes, he took that little bit of,

230
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.500
of, of drama between me and Dwayne.

231
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:25.810
Like Dwayne saying that no one on our team wanted to be your champions,

232
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:29.830
including Cody who sent him a text, a tweet that said, Hey,

233
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.150
keep my name out of your mouth.

234
00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:33.640
And you're like a jealous girlfriend or whatever. And he said,

235
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.390
he took that one little thing. And the next time he saw TG goes, oh,

236
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.110
there's a snake in the grass and just built it in this big thing. So that's,

237
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:41.230
it's.

238
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.270
<v 4>Crazy that how well he is so good at seeing that kind of. Yeah.</v>

239
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.950
<v 1>Took like what really happened, which is TJ got paid to go somewhere else.</v>

240
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.950
Me saying, all right, fine. If you're going to do that, it's cool. But like,

241
00:12:52.951 --> 00:12:55.710
you know, if you're on that team, you're on that team. And then,

242
00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.180
then Connor turned the public around on him. Yeah.

243
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.210
Because it came out later after the thing.

244
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:08.250
And so then TG became the victim and then he, and now TJ is news stories that I,

245
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:08.740
I,

246
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.820
I got mad that he was training with Duane Ludwig and I kicked him off the team.

247
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.560
<v 0>Well, you know, TJ now has a snake as his logo. I know.</v>

248
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:20.490
<v 2>Or he brought in snakes, you know what I mean? He just, he's at home with it.</v>

249
00:13:20.491 --> 00:13:23.460
You know, he's cool with it. So it's all good where.

250
00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.410
<v 3>We want it back a little bit. Like if you want.</v>

251
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:29.170
<v 1>To be friends, let's be friends, but don't, don't don't lie.</v>

252
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.130
<v 2>Went back to it. I remember going to Canada, the,</v>

253
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.180
it was during the ultimate fighter sticking up for, for TJ,

254
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:38.760
because TJ wasn't saying that the car was basically, you know,

255
00:13:38.761 --> 00:13:41.970
like inviting them to fight and, and teachers like, yeah. You know,

256
00:13:41.971 --> 00:13:45.060
like nonchalant, like whatever about it, but it wasn't defending himself.

257
00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:47.040
Like I'm not a snake. Someone calling me a stake in the grass and say,

258
00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.520
I was like this loyal to my teammates and we're fighting.

259
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.130
And that's why I stick up for TJ because TJ is literally, I'm like,

260
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.140
we're partying in Vegas. We're having a good time.

261
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:58.620
Like for the first time had kind of a heart to heart with him, with TJ. Yeah.

262
00:13:58.621 --> 00:14:01.170
And he's like, so he's telling me this, like, he's like, dude,

263
00:14:01.171 --> 00:14:04.230
I'm with you guys. Like I'm not leaving. that. Like I'm with you guys.

264
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.710
So I'm like, this is not, I am not, I'm not that close with TJ,

265
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.240
but he's a champion. He's, you know, you need a champion,

266
00:14:12.241 --> 00:14:14.400
you get taken care of and people, you know, I'll defend him.

267
00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:17.430
So Connor was doing that. He's like, what are you guys going to do?

268
00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:20.580
And it was talking about TJ. So I was like, man, I'll do something bad.

269
00:14:20.581 --> 00:14:22.680
Like you're asking for a fight, we'll fight and you know,

270
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.770
broke into the pushing match. And it wasn't going out to the outside.

271
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.880
Cause that's TJ saying that we were, that he was with us. I'm like, dude,

272
00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:30.714
he's not going to talk about.

273
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.160
<v 0>So how does it feel now knowing that you're going to defend against TJ with all</v>

274
00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:37.980
this weird drama, all this.

275
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.450
<v 2>I don't ever get wrapped up into it. It might look like that with the show. And,</v>

276
00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.530
and th th this is my life's been like this.

277
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.840
I can live and prosper and focus on when it's time to focus and die.

278
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.560
It's like flipping a switch. Like I can be doing dumbest.

279
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.070
Like you're fighting Dominick, Cruz. We're in the back just doing dumb.

280
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:58.190
And I'm like, I'm not even warm it up. I'm just, I'm just flipping. The switch.

281
00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.810
Always was like that since I was a little kid like wrestling football,

282
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:04.370
just when the lights shine. That's when I sh like, I, I shine the brightest.

283
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.170
I always feel like, and now with TJ, I don't respect him as a person,

284
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.990
but it doesn't mean I don't respect him as a fighter. The guy is skillful.

285
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.650
He's mean as. And he's going to bring a fight. That's going to be what I,

286
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.680
I love a challenge. Like with TJ, it's going to be a challenge.

287
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.290
I know him like the back of my hand, my coaches know him.

288
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:24.770
Like the back of my hand, we were able to dissect Dominick Cruz for me,

289
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.690
you know, through all their experiences.

290
00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:30.530
This is a guy they build up that was there longer than I've been. You know,

291
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:32.980
I went out there at one and, oh, I had 10 fights now with the,

292
00:15:32.981 --> 00:15:37.040
with the team alpha male 11, no 11 old world champion through there. You know,

293
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:38.690
obviously I was skilled before I got there.

294
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.270
We blended together that the recipe for success,

295
00:15:41.271 --> 00:15:44.810
I listened to follow a lead with favor and a lot of other guys on the team.

296
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.720
And you, so we know TJ, I always want to do,

297
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:51.260
I know what I have to be prepared for. So I'm excited for it.

298
00:15:51.261 --> 00:15:55.280
Like all those drama, Hey, whatever. Like it's been going on too long.

299
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.180
Like I'm just ready to focus on this fight and go in there and do what I have to

300
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:00.014
do to get this winning.

301
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.810
<v 0>Again. Well, you have a good mindset. I mean,</v>

302
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.070
think that is the gigantic part of what makes someone successful in this sport

303
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.320
is being able to do that. Like you said,

304
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.630
having the confidence that you're going to shine the brightest,

305
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:12.910
when the lights are on and having this mindset,

306
00:16:12.911 --> 00:16:16.900
like you're appreciating the fact that TJ is mean and skillful is going to give

307
00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:17.800
you a great challenge.

308
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.320
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. It's like, man, I'm sitting on the couch.</v>

309
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.200
Something like you where you think TJ is doing, he's sitting on the couch.

310
00:16:23.201 --> 00:16:24.940
So you're getting, I'm going to do the extra woodwork. Cause you know,

311
00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:28.300
TJ is a workhorse like that. That's for me, makes me motivated.

312
00:16:28.301 --> 00:16:31.060
I need these guys to keep me motivated. Like Dominic, you know,

313
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.790
he's I watched the embeddeds of him. He was running alone, you know,

314
00:16:33.791 --> 00:16:36.190
like a sob story on Christmas. Like I just gotta do this. I like it.

315
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.130
I'm sitting there. You know, we're having a party or a party like, man,

316
00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:42.310
I'm enjoy this. Like I'm about to fight for my first title. You know,

317
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:44.080
I'll never have this time again in my life.

318
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.440
I'll never fight for my first world title. Now it's a fight.

319
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.190
I'm finally getting to defend my title. Who cares a lot.

320
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.820
We were talking about this. A lot of people winning the title,

321
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:53.530
but what the do they do with it? Right know,

322
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.610
now it's about creating that legacy. And now I have TJ who's man. He's a bad.

323
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.250
He was ranked in the pound-for-pound before and the top 10, he's a killer.

324
00:17:03.251 --> 00:17:04.084
So that's a,

325
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.850
I'm going to catapult my career with him and I know what I'm going to do to do

326
00:17:06.851 --> 00:17:09.880
with him. You know, like I said, I've been with one another.

327
00:17:09.881 --> 00:17:13.630
When I was green as hell, just boxing, wrestling, athletic, loved to fight.

328
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.900
Now I've blended and found my own style and just filing, um,

329
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.590
getting really composed in there where I can let my show with my skill show off

330
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.440
it. And it's, I'm finding higher people.

331
00:17:23.441 --> 00:17:25.540
So like my skill level rides I've always was like.

332
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.920
<v 0>That. Now this is video, supposedly of you knocking him out. Oh yeah.</v>

333
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.570
Yup. Oh yeah. True. It's true. Yeah. How come you guys didn't release it?

334
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.700
<v 2>Well, first off I don't stop my video. I have seen it. It's just,</v>

335
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.140
it was on Justin's GoPro and do this. I literally that I felt bad.

336
00:17:44.141 --> 00:17:48.350
Not bad for it because it was just wherever TJ came, followed me around the gym,

337
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.050
wherever, go put my gym bag away. Like I see like, Hey man, like I slipped dude.

338
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:56.240
I'm like, okay. Like literally, like he was off his rocker about I'm like

339
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.840
[inaudible] how did it go down? What happened? I never had them throw on a,

340
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.770
you know, doing his little foot work. And then he did the jump down.

341
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.640
He does the uppercut and I just threw overhand. Right. Boom. Nailed him out.

342
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.480
And he got up and he was literally fighting, uh,

343
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.790
Eastern right before the Eastern flex. I remember the date.

344
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.280
<v 1>He didn't go out cold, like flat.</v>

345
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:24.200
<v 2>Out. He just got dropped and came back on stanky leg, like Walker.</v>

346
00:18:24.201 --> 00:18:27.920
And he's gonna come on, hit me. I'm like, just like, I'm like, like Paul,

347
00:18:27.921 --> 00:18:32.510
my drive out. Like, you're saying that after you dropped him. Yeah. He's a nut.

348
00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:32.780
I love.

349
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.690
<v 1>It. So got it. It's easy as a night.</v>

350
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.280
<v 0>Knock out as much as it was. He just dropped him. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

351
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.530
<v 2>I dropped him too. I mean, he, he is. And.</v>

352
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:49.280
<v 0>Then he got back up and started saying, come on. So he was conscious. Right.</v>

353
00:18:49.281 --> 00:18:50.210
And he knew that he had, he was.

354
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.170
<v 2>Staggering, bro. He looked like John Dotson had him on skates again. Let's see.</v>

355
00:18:54.171 --> 00:18:56.780
That's why I was like, oh, okay. And I was like, I'm not going to hit him.

356
00:18:56.781 --> 00:18:58.880
You're fighting in two weeks. I wasn't like that.

357
00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.670
But literally he had to say he fell forward and he slipped. I'm like, dude,

358
00:19:01.671 --> 00:19:03.680
doesn't matter. Like I'm not going to stay anyone. You know?

359
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.310
And then I was showing Danny how I like the Casteel. Cause he likes over. Right.

360
00:19:07.311 --> 00:19:10.430
Sorry. Like throw my head off the lane, bring the right hand. This and that.

361
00:19:10.431 --> 00:19:14.510
And the buck was, comes over, sir. Dude, he goes, and it was on, it was um,

362
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:15.913
Christmas day or something.

363
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.310
<v 1>Filming his own film was all inspiring. He's.</v>

364
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.330
<v 2>Like, watch you knock TJ out. And I was like, oh yeah. I was like,</v>

365
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.240
oh you see, I have it on my GoPro. I'm like, oh that's cool.

366
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.860
And then nothing ever came about it.

367
00:19:27.861 --> 00:19:31.430
And then TGO was saying that he used to make me cry in practice. No,

368
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:32.930
I have cried in practice for,

369
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.290
cause this jumped me on my head before the I made a fight.

370
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.680
I was like mad about it. Favorite comes in and has a camera crew,

371
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:43.520
the purest labs. And like, we're going hard. And like don't show on my head.

372
00:19:43.521 --> 00:19:45.860
I'm like, I get mad. Like, you know, I'm like,

373
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.620
try not to get hurt before the fight. So like I've never cried.

374
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.650
Tina never made me cry. So I was like, please, you talking about making me cry?

375
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:53.060
Like, oh man, I cried. So.

376
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.930
<v 0>When you get dumped into your head, did you get concussed or something or more.</v>

377
00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:01.820
<v 2>Of like favorite things? I'm like, huh? He's out. He cried pride, pride, pride.</v>

378
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.640
He's saying favorite comes in. Just come.

379
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.330
<v 1>On. I don't know. Barely remember this. I think it was happening first off.</v>

380
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.930
Here's the thing. Cody is a dangerous, dangerous.

381
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.620
If you're not on your, even if he's not trying to,

382
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.000
you get rocked or hurt or whatever. So I have to be on,

383
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.520
on a game with him, even if you're going light, you know,

384
00:20:22.521 --> 00:20:23.600
unless he's going to go light,

385
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.660
but light doesn't work when the guy's accurate and strong and everything else.

386
00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:30.590
So we had to go. So it was just like a, like a wizard hip heist.

387
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.730
<v 2>Lots me do it. Watch me on my head because you you're coming after me.</v>

388
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:39.170
He was like, so I know now there's a camera crew fall in favor.

389
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:40.940
It's not light. It's it's the fight.

390
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:43.950
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

391
00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:46.850
<v 2>So that's, that's where that came from about the video and like coming out,</v>

392
00:20:46.851 --> 00:20:49.780
like we have the video of you get knocked out, TJ, you didn't make it.

393
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:52.480
He was saying he made us beat us all up. Like with the Dominic sit down.

394
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.540
<v 1>Dwayne was maybe saying that or something.</v>

395
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.360
<v 2>He said, Dominic's like, oh, you beat your teammates up. And he's like, yeah,</v>

396
00:20:58.361 --> 00:21:01.020
I actually, for a matter of fact, haven't beaten him up. I'm like.
