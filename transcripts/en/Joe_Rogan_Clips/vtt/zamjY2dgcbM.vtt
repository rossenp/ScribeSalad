00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 1>I'd say you're honest. And I mean this,</v>

3
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:08.010
I think you're one of the most open-minded people I've ever met. Thank you.

4
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.320
You have very little, like, off.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.390
<v 0>In you. I got a little off, but my off is for fuckery. You know,</v>

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.480
when people just, when it's like openly horseshit, like, come on.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.450
If someone's like, you know, like psychics or something like that,

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.420
you got to meet my reader. Like, my reader. I've had people say that to me.

9
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.630
My psychic reader read your cards. I'm like, no, Terry, no, no,

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:33.120
I'm not gonna let her. I'm not gonna let her read my cards.

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.360
<v 1>That reminds me of Ms. Cleo. Remember Ms. Cleo in the 1990s.</v>

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.890
<v 0>Didn't Dionne Warwick have a show like psychic friends network. Wasn't there?</v>

13
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.210
Something like that. Was it Dionne Warwick? Was it right? Yeah. Dion worked.

14
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.870
The amazing singer had the psychic friends network. That's so weird.

15
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:53.520
He was a singer. And he did that. A woman Dionne Warwick. No,

16
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.110
you know though, way to San Jose. I know that song. Yes. Yeah.

17
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.860
Psychic friends network. 1992.

18
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.940
That's [inaudible] yeah. Look at that. Dionne.

19
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:09.270
Warwick would sit you down with a bunch of people that were lying and they would

20
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.840
pretend that they knew things and they would sit there. Oh, there's Linda Jo.

21
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.520
My God. Yeah. That guy is psychic and she's psychic and they're ah,

22
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.840
all these are people from, uh, uh, one life to live in another world.

23
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.850
So there's soap, opera stars that were like,

24
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.820
this psychic changed the way I do my readings.

25
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.410
Now, when I play my character.

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.873
<v 2>Who called those.</v>

27
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.290
<v 0>Voices? Let me hear that. Give me some of that.</v>

28
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.450
<v 3>And the end of our relationship. I mean, this is going to ultimately destroy.</v>

29
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.780
<v 0>No, no, no, go back, go back. I need to hear what this nonsense.</v>

30
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.280
<v 2>Archie in here would one of our psychics head to say about daytime.</v>

31
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.750
TV's hottest. Couple.

32
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.780
<v 3>Is this going to be the end of our relationship? I mean,</v>

33
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.670
it's just going to ultimately destroy our, I asked her yeah, meet others.

34
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.240
<v 0>I imagine that's the commercial.</v>

35
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.750
She's like you asked her that what the is wrong with you? Don't you know,

36
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:11.580
we're going to be together forever. You're such an, mark. Oh my God.

37
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.710
How the did you ask something?

38
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:16.350
You already know we're going to be together forever. Right.

39
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.840
<v 1>Th that, uh, first of all, nineties infomercials are glorious.</v>

40
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.350
<v 0>How about Deon Warwick's hair? How about that? That was something special.</v>

41
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.690
When you never heard Dionne Warwick sing the song.

42
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.120
<v 1>That you just sang. I've heard before, but I didn't know who the sang.</v>

43
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.003
<v 0>Beautiful voice.</v>

44
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.070
It's always sad when someone's like genuinely talented and you wind up,

45
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.650
you see them wind up, like doing something like that. Like, oh yeah.

46
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.630
People off just stealing that is because it really is the psychic

47
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:47.040
within. I'm like, oh boy, what is that a game? It's a psych, a kit.

48
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.390
Oh my God. Oh no. Let's be real Dion.

49
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.580
<v 1>It's only 2195, Joe.</v>

50
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.110
<v 0>I feel like we should order. It contains a full color video featuring Linda,</v>

51
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.720
Linda Jordan. That's that lady go back to that. So I could see what that said.

52
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.140
They're full color video featuring leech. Lisa Georgian,

53
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.770
Linda Georgian and the master psychics. Oh, look,

54
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.390
they're taking in two eyes. How about they spelled taking wrong?

55
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.310
I don't trust him. Take the attack. [inaudible] talk.

56
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.080
How'd that?

57
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.000
How about they're taking you step-by-step but they're spelling taking with an

58
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.010
extra eye. Nobody even caught that. Wonderful.

59
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.440
Go back to that in a week and they'll go. Hulu were talking about us.

60
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.020
Change the wording, the psychic.

61
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.960
<v 1>Within. Do you remember crossing over with John Edward?</v>

62
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.160
<v 0>Oh, that guy was a real.</v>

63
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.450
<v 1>Oh man. You know,</v>

64
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:41.290
I think he got fired when he tried to do it with like nine 11 victims.

65
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.740
I don't know. Am I, am I right about that, Jamie? I think that's what happened.

66
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.570
I'm going off memory on that one. Okay.

67
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.470
<v 0>Oh my God. Yeah, the audacity. I know.</v>

68
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.990
<v 1>That's what happened. The network was like, you're doing what?</v>

69
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.570
<v 0>Oh my God. The audacity.</v>

70
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.230
<v 1>Oh, that guy's terrible, man. That sounds about.</v>

71
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.740
<v 0>Correct.</v>

72
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.990
<v 1>Wow. That was all memory too.</v>

73
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.970
<v 0>It makes sense though. I mean, if you're a thief,</v>

74
00:04:06.971 --> 00:04:09.400
you're a thief and that's all they are. They're just thieves.

75
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.780
They're just doing it in a different way.

76
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.300
They're stealing and lying in a different way. It's just,

77
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.130
instead of like breaking into someone's car,

78
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.580
they're pretending they have an earpiece in and they're pretending they,

79
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.120
they can sense where, you know, your childhood trauma comes from,

80
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.000
you lost your father and your intent. Oh my God.

81
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.460
<v 1>Some of these people.</v>

82
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.920
<v 0>Thought to less than two months after it.</v>

83
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.830
<v 1>Wow. Imagine that. Holy.</v>

84
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.580
<v 0>Imagine that he was like, I know what we're going to do.</v>

85
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.020
We're going to capitalize on this.

86
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.240
This is going to take our show to the next level.

87
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.790
<v 1>They, uh, they caught one of these guys.</v>

88
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.770
Remember I think the guy's name is Peter Popoff.

89
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.530
He used to have all these infomercials at night where he's like by the holy

90
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:51.070
water and it'll save you. Oh. And then they caught him. They,

91
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.760
I think somebody did this thing where it was like a sting operation. They had,

92
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.240
he had an earpiece in and he was listening to people and he was like telling

93
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:01.000
them stuff that they thought he couldn't know. But he heard it earlier.

94
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.000
That's them look at that. He looks evil.

95
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.490
<v 0>Yeah, it definitely is gross. Whoa. Wow.</v>

96
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.110
It looks demonic. He does.

97
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:15.370
