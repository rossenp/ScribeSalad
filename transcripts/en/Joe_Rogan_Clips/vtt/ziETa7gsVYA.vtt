00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 1>But I'm also very childlike that way,</v>

3
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:09.240
because I think a lot of that kind of got ex you know, taken away a little bit.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.560
So I still, you know,

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:13.200
I still enjoy cartoons and Marvel movies or whatever it is,

6
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:13.761
and these type of things,

7
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:16.840
these escapism stuff that I feel like I just never really kind of fully got out

8
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:19.840
of the way. And so it's like, I, you grew up fast and I's like,

9
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:21.750
you're making up for time and doing that kind of stuff. I.

10
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.510
<v 0>I started embracing them again.</v>

11
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.470
I thought they were foolish like comic books and comic book movies and stuff

12
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:30.350
like that. I thought they were foolish for a while. And then I got,

13
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:33.070
as I got older, I go, but wait a minute. I like those.

14
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.870
And then I started embracing them as I got in, I guess, into my thirties. Yeah.

15
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.150
I.

16
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.740
<v 1>Think, I think you have a better under ending and again,</v>

17
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.380
not to get so super deep on superhero movies,

18
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.420
but I think there is something that,

19
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.980
that really kind of shines a mirror on people to,

20
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.300
if you have this blank canvas and be able to create something as to

21
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.340
whatever you wanted and then you can create this person.

22
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.660
It's kind of interesting. I remember I,

23
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.450
I forgot there's an they going around or something that's talking about like

24
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:04.370
Superman, for instance,

25
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.130
and like how there is some interesting psychology behind it.

26
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:13.850
The idea that everyone on Krypton is Superman and his alter ego is actually a

27
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:15.290
human as opposed to every other

28
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.410
superhero alter ego is their superhero.

29
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.080
But he actually has to pretend to be normal cuz as he just himself is mm.

30
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.880
You know, whatever, it's like this weird kind of thing.

31
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:28.320
And I remember reading that kind of stuff and thinking about that and thinking

32
00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:32.120
about how like, um, most recently I think Spider-Man,

33
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.080
they finally cast a young young guy as opposed to like a grown man.

34
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.710
And there was like,

35
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.600
what kind of stuff would you go through as a teenager that all of a sudden

36
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.110
discovered that you have all this stuff going on and they did a good job in the

37
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.070
most recent movies about him going to high school and telling his best friend

38
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.670
and getting caught about it and getting all this other stuff.

39
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.590
I feel like there's like as an adult watching it is not the same.

40
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.950
I think I really enjoy it at a different level, but it's.

41
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.070
<v 0>Cool. Yeah. Well it's just superhero movies.</v>

42
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.620
They're just fun. That's all it is. That's right. It's just, it's.

43
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.260
<v 1>Fun. Just junk food. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.420
<v 0>Exactly. Junk.</v>

45
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.140
<v 1>Food for the mine. Yeah. I think that there's,</v>

46
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:15.700
there's a time like when people would come by and say, this didn't have any it,

47
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.020
like, are you arguing the realism? Like people who pick it apart like that,

48
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.850
it's just kind of.

49
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.660
<v 0>They can do whatever they want. Like if,</v>

50
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.050
if that's what you wanna do with a superhero movie. Yeah.

51
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.570
Go back and do that about bugs bunny too stupid. That's right.

52
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.210
<v 1>Exactly. Exactly. Oh, he got shot in the face.</v>

53
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.570
You could totally not survive that. Like yeah, exactly. He is talking rabbit,

54
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.410
bro. Yeah.

55
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.010
<v 0>Exactly. None of it makes any sense.</v>

56
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.090
You know what I watched the other day that I haven't seen in a long time,

57
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.010
the Watchman. Yes. That's a up.

58
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.330
<v 1>Movie. Yeah. But that's uh, there's um,</v>

59
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.680
I mean that is so well written. Yeah. And especially the new, have you used,

60
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.680
have you watched the series? The TVs? The, the, the.

61
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.680
<v 0>One I was watching the series for a little, but Dr. Manhattan's.</v>

62
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.040
Like Dr. Manhattan's supposed to be a glowing nuclear blue guy with a giant Dick

63
00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:59.800
and all of a sudden he's a regular guy. Right, right, right.

64
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.120
What is this nonsense? Right? That's like,

65
00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:05.400
if the Hulk was just a guy who like went to CrossFit, wait, wait.

66
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.240
<v 1>Wait in the, in the HBO series. Yes. Yeah. I mean, I, I mean, so bro.</v>

67
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.800
<v 0>He's supposed to be super jacked with a giant Dick. That's true. Okay.</v>

68
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:16.800
That's the that's that's Dr. Manhattan. That's right.

69
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.270
He's supposed to be able to like time travel and do whatever he wants.

70
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.590
He's go to other planets and you look at yeah, for sure.

71
00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:25.790
He seems way too normal. &lt;laugh&gt; see. Let me see what he looks like,

72
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.590
pull up what he looks like. Cause the one in the, in the Watchman, the movie,

73
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.670
like, it looks like what you'd expect a God to look like. That's right.

74
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:34.790
He's got the crazy white eyes.

75
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.830
He's almost like animated where everybody else in this show is, you know,

76
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.980
basically just a person with superpowers for.

77
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.180
<v 1>Sure. And, and some of 'em don't even have superpowers. And I think that that's,</v>

78
00:03:45.181 --> 00:03:49.180
that's again, that's one of those things where living in a oh God was the,

79
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:49.980
what is that?

80
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.340
<v 0>Yeah. Look at them. Get the out of here. How is that? Dr. Manhattan?</v>

81
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.900
That's ridiculous. The real Dr. Manhattan,

82
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.170
the movies like a perfect specimen. He's like a God he glows.

83
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.170
And then this other one is just like a dude with makeup on.

84
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.290
Like they just got lazy. Like I don't understand it.

85
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.450
<v 1>There's a, what is the, oh my God.</v>

86
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.650
I can't. I'm blanking on it. Look at, look at that. That's on it. That's not it.

87
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:19.930
That's not that's.

88
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.680
<v 0>It's just some guys for hanging out Halloween something. Is that what it is?</v>

89
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.720
Yeah. Yeah. Thank God. &lt;laugh&gt; I throw up in my mouth. Let, let himself go.

90
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.400
It just, I just watched it for a little bit and I was like, I don't know,

91
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.120
this just.

92
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.440
<v 1>It's but it is, it is more raw. I think that the, the,</v>

93
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.760
when you're talking about a show or move that kind of stuff,

94
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:44.710
when you start to of blend at these superhero, um, situations into real life,

95
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.350
like people aren't gonna be cool with everything and they're not all gonna be

96
00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:49.510
cool. You know?

97
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:52.510
Like that's the thing I think there there've been a couple U dystopian type of

98
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:57.030
things where what if Superman was bad? He'd decided to do terrible. It's like,

99
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.830
we, what.

100
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.510
<v 0>Could we do? Well, that's the thing about the Watchman, right?</v>

101
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:03.700
Like median is a terrible person in the Watchman. Yeah.

102
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.940
The guy with the mustache and the cigar. Yeah. He he's horrible. Horrible.

103
00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.420
He's a murderer. Yeah. You know, and, but yet he's a superhero. It's very,

104
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.980
yeah. Very conflicted. Yeah. The power.

105
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.580
<v 1>Yeah. Absolute power corrupts. Absolutely. That type of thought process. Right.</v>

106
00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:20.780
There's what is the, um, what is that Mo the, the,

107
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.290
the series is the guy that come out, same similar situation where,

108
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.650
um, it's, it is a superhero story. And it's about, uh,

109
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:34.330
the same thing about these superheroes. Like Dr. No, sorry, Mr. Something. God,

110
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:35.530
man. I can't I'm blanking on it, but,

111
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.970
but they basically go follow these superheroes. That just aren't good.

112
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.960
<v 0>People. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. The boys, the boys,</v>

113
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.400
the boys. I didn't watch that. Right. Is that good? It's good.

114
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.400
I thought it was like a Watchman, a Watchman rip off.

115
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.440
<v 1>You can kind of see it that way, but it's obviously,</v>

116
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.423
it's just very well written.

117
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.373
<v 0>I'm that way it, that.</v>

118
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.280
<v 1>That, yeah. You can see it that way.</v>

119
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.400
<v 0>Like when you make evil superheros, like that's a.</v>

120
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.480
<v 1>But it's, it's, it's really, it is true. I mean, if you had,</v>

121
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.280
if you gave somebody ridiculous amount of power or whatever it is,

122
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.640
how could you possibly expect that person to just decide to choose

123
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.863
pure?

124
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.400
<v 0>You know, that's what we have right now with the government. &lt;laugh&gt; yeah.</v>

125
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:15.880
Give a lot.

126
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.910
<v 1>Of power for just listen. So there go. Yeah.</v>

127
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.430
<v 0>Exactly. It's a, it's a weird time for that.</v>
