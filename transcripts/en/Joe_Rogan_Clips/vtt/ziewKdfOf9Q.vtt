00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.520
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience like the guns, like that was the thing, right?</v>

2
00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:08.680
When they first said guns are not essential. Right.

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.400
Then they pulled back on that.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.680
<v 1>And they said, well, it was essential.</v>

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.200
And then they decided to stop it from being essential.

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.320
Cause it was giant lines outside of gun store. Yeah.

7
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.520
And people were kind of tweaking and then people complained about that.

8
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.430
And then they stepped and said, it's not. And everybody said, you.

9
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.790
And then they go, okay, we're kidding. You could have your.

10
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.550
<v 0>Guns. So let me tell you, cuz cuz I had, I directly experienced this last week.</v>

11
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.550
I bought a gun. I bought a gun last week. This is the first time.

12
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.510
<v 1>You've ever owned a gun.</v>

13
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.310
<v 0>No, no. I owned a gun back in the eighties.</v>

14
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.190
I used to target shoot with some guys I worked with up in, uh, Oakland,

15
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.500
but &lt;affirmative&gt; I, I bought a gun. Right.

16
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:47.140
Because all of this went down and people like why'd you buy a gun? I said,

17
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:51.700
because the purge went from a movie to a documentary &lt;laugh&gt; &lt;laugh&gt;

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.980
I was like, I don't wanna be the only one, you know, but,

19
00:00:55.981 --> 00:01:00.940
but the way I had to do it was you go online and you make an appointment

20
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:05.490
with the gun store and then you show up and you wait outside. Like they,

21
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:10.490
they come and what'd you buy? Uh, I bought a Glock, uh, 45, uh oh.

22
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.043
<v 1>Stepping up. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.370
<v 0>So, uh, I checked with the gang bangers. They were like, yeah,</v>

24
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:20.290
this is the one you hold sideways &lt;laugh&gt; but, but anyway,

25
00:01:20.291 --> 00:01:23.680
you had to wait outside, you know, know six feet apart or whatever.

26
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.520
And they brought you in one at a time. And, and then I was able to do it.

27
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.680
I did the background check by the way, the people who fight against the, the,

28
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.240
the test and the background check, like how, like you understand,

29
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.040
how have you done? Do you know how easy these questions are? They're very easy.

30
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.830
This questions on there. Like, are you a felon? Yes. Are you, you know, um,

31
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.190
is there currently a restraining order out against you? Like well who,

32
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.870
who would check yes. On that box? &lt;laugh&gt; you know, well, you have to.

33
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.870
<v 1>Cause if they find out that you're lying, you'll never get a gun. Right. Well.</v>

34
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.510
<v 0>I, you know, I'm pretty confident that I'll pass and I'll get it.</v>

35
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.820
And the guy was cool. This was,

36
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:08.660
this was one of my concerns was I was cuz I don't, you know,

37
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.540
I don't know what gun store to go to. Right. So, so I was ho I said, man,

38
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.780
don't let me walk into some place where there's a big Confederate flag on the

39
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:18.100
wall. &lt;laugh&gt; in.

40
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.060
<v 1>LA, in LA.</v>

41
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.330
<v 0>In LA county. Yeah. You can find, yeah, listen, listen, Joe,</v>

42
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.450
trust me on this. &lt;laugh&gt; trust me on this. They're out there. But anyway, no,

43
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:29.570
the guy was really cool. A.

44
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.650
<v 1>Farm country off the five.</v>

45
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.610
<v 0>Yeah. And the funny thing was the,</v>

46
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.130
one of the big things was the size of my hands. Right. So I have big hands.

47
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:39.290
So he's kind of like, yeah man, you gotta try,

48
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:43.010
literally try it on and see how it fits. And the Glock fit my hand.

49
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.000
Well, and then I was asking about shotguns and he was like telling me,

50
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.760
cuz I've fired shotguns. I've done that. Skite shoot and stuff.

51
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.960
And he was talking to me about tactical shotguns. And so, so he said, yeah,

52
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.280
you want to get, he said,

53
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.000
you probably wont one of these because you don't really have to aim too. Well,

54
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.320
when you got one of these, you just blast in the direction. I was like,

55
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.400
all right. That sounds good. So I'm probably gonna get one of those too,

56
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.880
but uh &lt;laugh&gt;. Yeah, but it was cool. And, and you know, I get it like I'm,

57
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.361
you know,

58
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:17.520
it's funny cuz people say that people have accused me of being anti-gun and I'm

59
00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:22.310
like, no, I'm not anti on I'm pro common sense. I'm pro common sense. But,

60
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.790
but what were.

61
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.230
<v 1>Your thoughts on gun laws before this?</v>

62
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.670
Did you think that people don't need to have guns? No. I.

63
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.710
<v 0>Never thought people don't need to.</v>

64
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.030
So why'd they think you did because I've talked about like, we,

65
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.230
we don't need 50 round clips. You know, I had a joke. I said, listen,

66
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.910
I got a 50 round clip for self defensee.

67
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:40.380
I'm like if 50 people want to you at the same time,

68
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.980
maybe it's you &lt;laugh&gt; perhaps there's some part of your

69
00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:47.420
personality you need to look at,

70
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.980
I'll tell you one thing I've always got about guns. I'm a motorcycle guy.

71
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.833
I'm a car guy.

72
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.540
And I know some gun people and from the mechanical artistic point,

73
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:00.010
like this is, you know what I mean? Yeah. I get that. Like you. Yeah, yeah,

74
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:01.810
yeah. There, there are guns that are beautiful.

75
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:03.650
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; just from a mechanical standpoint,

76
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:06.170
like you look like this is a beautiful thing and,

77
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:10.050
and if you wanna shoot it and shoot targets and this and that, like great.

78
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.650
If you wanna hunt, like you hunt, I called you, you remember I texted your wife.

79
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.530
I said, Joe, if this goes down, I'm coming to your bunker. Cuz I know,

80
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.480
you know how to kill animals. Like I got a friend who knows how to kill animals.

81
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.200
I'm gonna go hang out with him. &lt;laugh&gt; it would be way more.

82
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.760
<v 1>Difficult than that. I had this conversation earlier today.</v>

83
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.840
Someone was asking me, if would you be okay? And I'm like, you,

84
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:34.200
you probably would not be okay with no civilization because you'd break an ankle

85
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.440
and you'd die. You,

86
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.120
you get an infection and you die and good luck finding animals all the time.

87
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:41.430
And what if you run outta arrows or you run outta bullets,

88
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:44.790
you can't make your own bullets. Like it could get real weird real quick.

89
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.390
<v 0>But, but all of that aside, but tho those are the people who I'm like,</v>

90
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:51.510
those are the ones we need to watch. The ones who like,

91
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.550
I gotta have this whole yeah. Bunker full of ammo and this and that.

92
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.990
I have hundreds governments thousand guns,

93
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.070
the government's coming to get me and all that. Like those are the ones.

94
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.660
So when, when I, I talk about gun laws and red, that's why I say common sense.

95
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.340
There's a common sense level to it. You know, that, that I'm okay with.

96
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.100
But uh, but no, I'm not anti I'm not anti-gun I'm but.

97
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.660
<v 1>You can't. The thing about people is they think it's a slippery slope.</v>

98
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.260
So if you say I am for the second amendment,

99
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.610
but I don't think you should have 50 round clips or I don't think you stepped

100
00:05:22.611 --> 00:05:25.290
in. And they're like, well, who gets this? Decide who gets.

101
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.210
<v 0>To decide common sense, common? You know, you know,</v>

102
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:31.130
who should decide should be the majority mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; it should be

103
00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:35.810
people. But, but again, this is where we're all one side or the other.

104
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.290
And common sense is in the middle. If, if we had a government, a Congress,

105
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.080
whatever that could debate and talk about and input and say, Hey,

106
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.880
the hunters say that we need this. And, and you know, now it all makes sense.

107
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.400
Then you come up with it with a, a reasonable gun thing. Like for instance,

108
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.560
I think that cars are a good example.

109
00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:57.880
Like we regulated guns the way we regulate cars,

110
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.880
in a sense you have to have a license. And when you sell it even privately,

111
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.960
if I sell my car to you, I notify the government. Like, Hey,

112
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.760
I just sold my car to Joe VIN number, blah, blah, blah.

113
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.200
He's now responsible for it. If the system worked,

114
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.880
we'd have a system of common sense.

115
00:06:12.881 --> 00:06:16.830
Unfortunately we just have one extreme of the other, the,

116
00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:19.950
the thing about no guns, it's like, what are you gonna there?

117
00:06:19.951 --> 00:06:22.950
There's already millions of guns out there. So that that's impossible.

118
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.510
Like that's an unreasonable, it is thing to say.

119
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.670
<v 1>It's one of those conversations. Doesn't have a, an answer.</v>

120
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.630
It's not a clean answer. So when, when people bring that up, they go, whoa,

121
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.070
it's true. You dude. I'm like, okay, first of all,

122
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.380
a there's only 20 million people in the whole continent.

123
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.740
And it's a size that contiguous United States.

124
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.140
So there's more people in California than there is in Australia. Right.

125
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.860
So shut the.

126
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.300
<v 0>Up. Yeah. And, and they also did it over a period of time.</v>

127
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.540
They did it pretty quickly and they did it at a,

128
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.700
they did it in a moment of outrage. Exactly. Yeah.

129
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:57.100
They did it in a moment of outrage and, and unfortunately used us as an example.

130
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.290
Yeah. You.

131
00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.690
<v 1>Could still get guns over there for hunting though.</v>

132
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:01.090
People hunt with guns over there. It.

133
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.530
<v 0>Just Canada people hunt in Canada, you know,</v>

134
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:07.810
and Canada had a mass shooting not too long ago. Yeah. Yeah. But

135
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.690
so, uh, I, you know, yeah, like you said,

136
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:14.290
it it's one of those without an answer. That's the problem.

137
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:15.691
<v 1>Like if you definiti,</v>

138
00:07:15.691 --> 00:07:20.360
if you definitively think that this is the way and you don't see the other side

139
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:23.560
of it, then you're gonna always have this polarized argument. Right. And,

140
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.160
and if people.

141
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.680
<v 0>Would, would lose that, if they'd lose the, I have to win. Right.</v>

142
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.840
And just like, let's come up with a compromise that works. But the.

143
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.920
<v 1>Gun people like particular NRA people,</v>

144
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.680
they don't think you should give up any ground.

145
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:38.990
Cause if you give a Benny ground from where we are, right, right now,

146
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.190
it's just a slippery slope and they're gonna keep taking.

147
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.950
And they do have a point with some people. Now,

148
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.790
a lot of those people that used to think like that now are buying guns,

149
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:52.910
which is hilarious. &lt;laugh&gt; buddy mine's wife was, you're never having a gun.

150
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:55.510
You're never having a gun. This went down. You need to get a gun. Yeah.

151
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:56.470
Like he said, the,

152
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.220
it was a 180 switch and it happened immediately when everything was shutting

153
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:01.060
down. Yeah. You start,

154
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.060
you start thinking of people in their worst case possibility rather

155
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.740
than, ah, we live in a nice area. Right. We're fine.

156
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.300
<v 0>Yeah. And, and again, you're right. Either extreme is, is impossible.</v>

157
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.380
Neither one wants to give up an inch. Yeah.

158
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.500
And you both have to give up an inch, you know, neither one,

159
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.610
one wants to give an inch,

160
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.610
but you both have to give an inch and you ha you know, uh, and again,

161
00:08:24.611 --> 00:08:27.250
this is what we were talking about earlier where the federal government,

162
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.810
the federal government does need to be involved in a sense where you have like

163
00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:33.570
Chicago, that has a huge gun problem.

164
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.410
Partly because you can just drive over to Indiana and buy anything you want and

165
00:08:37.411 --> 00:08:39.130
bring it to Chicago. Hmm. Is.

166
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.000
<v 1>That what the problem is? Yeah. How close is Indiana to, to Chicago.</v>

167
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.600
<v 0>Gary, Indiana to Chicago. I think it's like two, three hour drive. Oh wow.</v>

168
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:48.920
And that's where guns come from. When I grew up in, I grew up in New York city.

169
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:51.320
Right? New York city has some of,

170
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.960
if not the strictest gun laws in the country,

171
00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.440
guy, new guys, they, you go down south, you go to Virginia, North Carolina,

172
00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:01.274
South Carolina,

173
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.720
buy any gun you want drive up and sell 'em in New York because remember we,

174
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.960
our borders, you know, there's no border between states you drive.

175
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.760
<v 1>I hope that stay stays the way it is.</v>

176
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.520
I know that's a terrible thing that people are bringing guns from Virginia,

177
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.910
but I hope the border thinks stays the same way.

178
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.710
And if you want to drive across the country, you can just go, yeah.

179
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.510
<v 0>I think the border should stay the same.</v>

180
00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.630
But I think there has to be some sort of

181
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:28.150
federal oversight to this. So that, of what, um,

182
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.070
there again, what,

183
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.830
what you can buy what's required to buy.

184
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:38.740
It what's require if you had to provide ID to show who

185
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.780
you are and where you live. So now if you're in to buy gun, you mean.

186
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.740
<v 1>Yeah. You should have more than that. You should definitely do that too.</v>

187
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.420
<v 0>Though. But that's what I'm saying. Yeah. So now,</v>

188
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.820
if you're in one of the more lax states, like, uh, Virginia,

189
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:53.220
and I'm just using these example, I don't know, specific laws,

190
00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.970
but a Virginia or Arizona or something like that at, you know,

191
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.410
you can't just go there, live in California,

192
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.250
live in New York and go there and buy one. Like you gotta prove like, yeah,

193
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:08.130
I live in Arizona so I can buy the, so I'm subject to Arizona's laws.

194
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.970
<v 1>Yeah. How does that work?</v>

195
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.810
If you're a citizen of the United States and you drive to Arizona,

196
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.410
can you just buy a gun? Like you live in Arizona?

197
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.480
<v 0>I, from what I understand and listen,</v>

198
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.280
I'm far from an expert and I know there's experts, listen,

199
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:23.080
we should probably Google this. But, but the gun shows,

200
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.080
I think that's where they said you have a lot of, lot.

201
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.920
<v 1>Of fuckery in the gun.</v>

202
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.080
<v 0>Shows. Yeah. Cause the gun shows is just one guy,</v>

203
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.360
one person selling to another and that's where it gets really vague. Yeah.

204
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:34.080
That's the.

205
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.280
<v 1>To what the rules are, people buy all kinds of illegal.</v>

206
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.750
<v 0>It right. So I think you, you know,</v>

207
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.590
I think in a gun store you need to provide ID and stuff like that.

208
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:46.150
But the gun shows, yeah. It gets really kind of a gray area.

209
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.550
<v 1>Didn't Bruno from uh, didn't uh, Sasha Baren Cohen.</v>

210
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.590
Does Bruno character go to a gun show? Yeah.

211
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.910
I think supergacious super gay character. &lt;laugh&gt;

212
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.380
yeah. Guns are fun. The problem is people are morons. It's not,

213
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.340
the problem is not that guns. Aren't fun. You know, I get, yeah. I like guns.

214
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.540
I, I have friends who are really gun nuts. You know,

215
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:10.660
I have friends that have so many guns. They don't know how many guns they have.

216
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:13.140
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; they love guns and they love 'em for the mechanical thing.

217
00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:15.540
It's their hobby. Like some people are really into muscle cars,

218
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.820
some people the motorcycles. And.

219
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.050
<v 0>I'm, I absolute cool with that because most of the people, I knew one guy who,</v>

220
00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:25.850
he was one like, I'd be worried about, you know, he was one like, mm, yeah.

221
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:27.170
This guy's waiting for a reason.

222
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.410
<v 1>I have have a friend who's a gun nut.</v>

223
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.970
And he got carjacked and he shot a guy and killed him.

224
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.730
<v 0>But most of the gun guys, I knew they collected him. Like you said,</v>

225
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.240
it was like muscle or motorcycles or whatever. It was just their thing.

226
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:46.000
Yeah. And, um, and they were good with, and the other thing is the gun safety,

227
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.360
you know, the, these idiots, like there's so many stories like yeah,

228
00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:53.640
the gun was in the backseat and the kid shot the other kid and it it's like,

229
00:11:53.641 --> 00:11:57.360
come on there. There has to be some kind of, yeah.

230
00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:01.120
Safety and liability issue, you know,

231
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:02.680
like what's morons.

232
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.400
<v 1>Just's what it's, it's not you, you would never do that. I would never do that.</v>

233
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:05.870
Right.

234
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.040
It's the problem is you taking something with godlike powers and you give it it.

235
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.600
<v 0>To morons &lt;laugh&gt; and then there has to,</v>

236
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.510
so there has to be that you have do somehow you're too dumb for a gun roll

237
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.550
regulate tomorrow. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; like simple test, you know, man,

238
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.550
we've talked to a few people and uh, yeah, no, it shouldn't.

239
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.870
<v 1>Be just, are you a felon? It should be like a competency test. Right. You know,</v>

240
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.910
I mean, you need a competency test to drive a car because a car could be deadly.

241
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:38.660
<v 2>I.</v>
