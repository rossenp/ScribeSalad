00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.600
<v 2>What is it like to have a movie about one of the worst experiences.</v>

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.000
<v 1>Of your life? Yes. Yes. Thank you for asking it like that. Yeah,</v>

4
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.480
no one ever has. It was an it's an honor to do that, to,

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.790
to be a part of that. And, um, it's funny because like, Hey,

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.870
they made a movie and the books and it was great. And I was like, man,

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.110
it's about me getting my whipped as a fighter and a warrior.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.950
Those are usually the stories you don't want out. Right?

9
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:33.910
So I'm in the lost column. I carry a lot of weight, 19 promises.

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.790
I never forget it. So I walk around, I always remind myself,

11
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.510
I can run into somebody who knows or loved one of them or one of their family

12
00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:42.500
members. So always carry myself a certain way. I have to,

13
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.380
that was the deal I made to get me off the mountain.

14
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.940
People asked me who my heroes are,

15
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.660
everybody who had to come fetch me outta hell. I was in there pretty deep.

16
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.200
And um, the way that lined out, it's a great story. If you wanna hear,

17
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.760
I mean the whole process, I would love to hear it.

18
00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:59.560
It's funny on the way up here, I was like, now how's this interview gonna go?

19
00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.680
And I was watching dope, uh, Joe dirt last night. I was like, look,

20
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.510
do it like that. You wanna start from beginning &lt;laugh&gt; bro.

21
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.070
I'll tell you some stuff you can't believe. I'm glad you.

22
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.390
<v 0>Said let's start it off with whiskey. Yeah. As soon as you said that, I'm like,</v>

23
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:09.990
this is gonna go.

24
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.630
<v 1>Great. It is. Yeah. I only drink whiskey with my friends and you know,</v>

25
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:15.830
the reason we say that is because the things that come out when you drink

26
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.270
whiskey. Yeah. So I've been looking forward to this.

27
00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:21.310
We've been friends for a while. I thought we should have a good time with it.

28
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.490
A hundred.

29
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.300
<v 0>Yeah. You know, I, I watched a movie again last night.</v>

30
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.860
I watched it yesterday just to prepare myself.

31
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.100
<v 1>And uh, I haven't seen it. I never watched it all the way through.</v>

32
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.860
I know the director's cut. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, no. Yeah.

33
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.540
So it was, um, I can imagine it was something to back it,

34
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:43.490
up to the book and how that all happened. Are you back it up to the military?

35
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.410
Wherever you wanna start, we can go all different directions with it.

36
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.530
But I was in the, I was in the hospital. So when I got back,

37
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.330
I was in the hospital for a while. And then they,

38
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.610
I went back into the teams and started doing another workup for deployment.

39
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.920
And then in between that, I was getting called to the,

40
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.200
to the boss's house. I've always been watched over on high ground.

41
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.993
That was a blessing

42
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.910
because so many of our guys died and we had a fallen angel.

43
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.670
When we have a fallen angel, y'all always hear about it.

44
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.470
Like normally if seals die or something,

45
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.950
it's on the bottom of the ticker or only the family members here. But we had a,

46
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.500
a fallen angel, which means we have an aircraft going down. And, um,

47
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.580
I didn't know about it actually, when I, when, when the mission started,

48
00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:33.460
because everyone who knew about our operation was on the helicopter.

49
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.740
That's why I was out there for so long. And, um,

50
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.220
I remember I was in,

51
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.910
I just got outta the hospital and I was doing physical therapy at the team and

52
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.430
they called me up and they said, Hey,

53
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:48.990
we're gonna de we're gonna declassify part of this operation.

54
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.830
And we're gonna put it out into a book. And I was like, okay,

55
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.630
I didn't know what that meant. Well,

56
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:01.280
then they pulled me back up to the, to the, to the head sheds where the,

57
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.800
we had this big meeting and they brought, they assigned me the, the, I mean,

58
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.880
I was privileged enough to have the best lawyers, the best writers.

59
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.440
Like I interviewed with everybody until I found a fit.

60
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.880
Like I got to travel around, like when Patrick and I met,

61
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:18.400
he came out to the house. My mother fell in love with him. So that's how he,

62
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.470
we knew he was gonna, and I had to live with him.

63
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.590
So what I would actually wake up on Sunday or Monday morning and go into work,

64
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.630
do a workup, fixing to deploy. And then on Fridays, I'd have to fly to Cape Cod.

65
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.150
And I would sit with Patrick and tell him the story.

66
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.870
And then Sunday night I'd fly back.

67
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.910
Patrick is the guy you wrote the Patrick Robinson? Yeah.

68
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:38.590
He's the guy you wrote the, he was, yeah. Cause my name wasn't in the book.

69
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.020
It wasn't supposed to be anything like that. I was still operational.

70
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.740
And then I deployed back to Iraq in oh six and oh seven. I ripped Joco out.

71
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.500
I know you met him. Love.

72
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.733
<v 0>Joco great guy.</v>

73
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.580
<v 1>And he loves you, man. He was, he was my boss. One of my bosses. He.</v>

74
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.380
<v 0>Got so excited. When he, when he heard you were coming on, he texted me, we.</v>

75
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.460
<v 1>Went back and forth. He's something I called him. He he's just, what, what you,</v>

76
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.483
you see is what you get.

77
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.130
He's you notice his face looks like it could perfectly fit in a Spartan helmet.

78
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.610
&lt;laugh&gt; yes. You know what I'm talking about? Oh yeah. He's always,

79
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.010
he's when he comes to leadership break glass.

80
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.730
<v 0>That's it. In case.</v>

81
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.450
<v 1>Of war. We have those guys. Yes. They're real. I know you've met some of 'em.</v>

82
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.450
Yeah. We need those guys. They exist. They're terrifying.

83
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.130
<v 0>They I'm so happy. They're real. Yeah. They're real. Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.840
And Jocko is my he's he's the archetype. Yeah.

85
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.560
<v 1>He was here was the reason why he was, he was over Chris and, and uh,</v>

86
00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:31.120
Michael and mark. If you notice in the seal teams, all of our medal of honor,

87
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:34.160
guys are named Michael, you ever noticed that? No. Oh yeah.

88
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.120
Let's call mark angels. They always get the medal of honor.

89
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.920
You get a mark and a Michael running together and the seal team something bads

90
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.070
&lt;laugh&gt; it's gotta go down. So you always joke about that. But

91
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.430
when the book came out, I was in Iraq.

92
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.350
I remember the lawyers and everybody would, they would write me emails and like,

93
00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:54.270
please don't die. And I was like, well, I'll try not to. Thanks. Jesus Christ.

94
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.750
So I got hurt in Iraq again. And when I got back,

95
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.700
they positioned me out of the seal teams and then they kind of rewrote

96
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:03.860
that part, put my name in it.

97
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.420
My job was to go around and tell you about your boys and what they did and how

98
00:05:08.421 --> 00:05:11.540
hard they fought. And they died. And that was the greatest job.

99
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.260
It was the hardest job I ever had to do.

100
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.700
Cuz I remember when they pulled me offline as an operator and having really

101
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:19.700
sitting there telling me, he was like, son,

102
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:22.050
you're gonna do more for the seal teams and you ever did in combat.

103
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.650
And that was, I, I thought that was kind of an insult. I was like, wait,

104
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:28.490
what do you mean? &lt;laugh&gt; right. I was like, do I need to work out harder?

105
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:31.810
Do I need to? He's like, no, this is what you need to do.

106
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.690
So I did that and I traveled around I, and I told you guys,

107
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.610
and then the movie Hollywood came calling. So I got stationed to live there.

108
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.520
I actually sat me down and introduced me to all the directors and we had to find

109
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:46.680
the fit. And then once Pete and I linked up for the first time,

110
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.640
rest is kind of, you mean Peter Berg?

111
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.760
<v 0>Yeah. Peter Berg. God, he nailed it, man.</v>

112
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.920
I know you haven't seen it cuz you've seen the director's cut, right? Yeah.

113
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.200
Yeah. But uh, he, he nailed it. That guy's a hell of a director. He,

114
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.840
you know, it just, there was no in that movie, you know,

115
00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:04.840
there's a certain amount of.

116
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.720
And I don't know if it there's any in terms of like the reality of the

117
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.360
experience versus the, the film version of it. But there was no,

118
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.510
um, no gloss to that film.

119
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.190
<v 1>So the way we I'll talk about when I met Pete for the first time,</v>

120
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:26.230
so I got pulled up to LA to interview all, all of 'em. I was traveling around,

121
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.190
um, just getting to meet all of everybody. Oliver stone.

122
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.510
I sat down in front of him. I mean, we,

123
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:34.750
they went through me through the guy I had, I had lunch. Oh wow. Yeah.

124
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.060
It was pretty, I remember meeting him cuz I wanted to, he was, he was a veteran.

125
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.260
Right? Yeah. And um, I love that guy.

126
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.260
The lawyer that I got assigned to, he was great. Alan Schwartz is his name and,

127
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.580
and for those, have you ever seen baseballs? Yes. Okay.

128
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.460
The Schwartz in baseballs. Yeah. It's named after him.

129
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.050
So he's Mel Brooks' attorney. This, this is, this is real. That's crazy.

130
00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.130
This is crazy. That was one of the coolest things. Why I got to meet him and,

131
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.930
and I was like, wait a minute. You're the Schwartz? He's like, yo &lt;laugh&gt;. So I,

132
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.530
I got like,

133
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.090
I signed to him and then my literary agent was this guy named ed Victor since

134
00:07:10.091 --> 00:07:12.650
passed. But he was great cuz he was a British guy, tall, skinny.

135
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:16.050
And he would wear the sweaters with tied around his neck and the white and black

136
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:20.280
wingtips, us to the nines had that, that awesome accent.

137
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.240
And he would tell me, he's like mark it's darling. I'm the seal in this world,

138
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.200
just in this environment. Just let me take care of this. What you saying? Me?

139
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.080
How dare he? And I just kinda like Roger that.

140
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.280
Cause if you're the resident expert,

141
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:32.280
something I'll always drop in right beside you.

142
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.680
So I was traveling around and I'd been in LA for a couple days and I was

143
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.990
supposed to get back to the bay and they were like, wait,

144
00:07:39.991 --> 00:07:43.030
there's one more guy who wants to meet you? His name's Peter Burke. And I,

145
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:44.030
I didn't register in my head.

146
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.270
I couldn't put the name to he's been around forever.

147
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.670
He's like he's down on the set, uh,

148
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:50.590
filming a movie called Hancock and will Smith.

149
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.110
And I was supposed to get on my plane, but we went late and miss my flight.

150
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.670
He's like just go down there and see him. And I was like, all right.

151
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:00.380
So we dropped down there and he's, he's sitting in his chair and then, uh,

152
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.180
there there's a train scene. So there was this huge train and will standing.

153
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:08.620
I got to meet him. It was pretty cool. And Pete walks up Peterburg. He's like,

154
00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:12.220
Hey, let's take a walk. I was like, right. And we sat down on this park bench,

155
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.060
overlooking the water. He's like, this is what I think of this.

156
00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:18.220
This is what I wanna do. And he kind of shot me straight. He's like,

157
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:19.100
before I say anything else,

158
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.730
I wanna yo you a movie that I just filmed and I want you to watch it so that I

159
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.970
got to go to the theater and watch this movie.

160
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.170
And then the next day it was his attention to detail.

161
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.770
He like focused on the stuff that you would normally miss,

162
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.930
which makes it kind of realistic. And I was like, okay, it's yours. I was like,

163
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:36.010
no, this, if you screw this up, if you do anything to dishonor,

164
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:36.890
any of my friends I'll kill you.

165
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.650
&lt;laugh&gt; and he didn't know what to do about that.

166
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.040
And I mean, the look, look on his face.

167
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.400
Cause I shook his hand and I had his hand and I was like, okay, here's the deal?

168
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.800
It's yours. If you want it, if you screw it up, I'll have to, you know, no,

169
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.800
no it's nothing personal for real. And um, right when that happened, I mean,

170
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.640
he took it. We,

171
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.560
we made him go to all of our tra he got the door was open for him cuz it was an

172
00:09:03.561 --> 00:09:06.080
assignment, most everything else, the books and the movies and everything.

173
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.680
And they, they were shut down except for this one.

174
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.280
So when the Navy's got your back and you know the seal teams, man,

175
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.510
that's how that works. So we sent him overseas. He had to go live with,

176
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.710
I mean the guy went through some stuff.

177
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:20.150
He came back early and didn't tell me about it.

178
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.470
Cuz some of the stuff he saw and I was like, Hey, it's real. Right. It's real.

179
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.150
And he is like, that's all I needed to see to change how I feel. I was like,

180
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:31.070
okay, well let's do this man. And then it started, oh, so he went.

181
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.150
<v 0>Overseas mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; and experienced. What did he experience?</v>

182
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.740
<v 1>They, they in bed, him with a seal platoon. Oh Jesus.</v>

183
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.820
He got to see them guys and how they, I it's a really cool story.

184
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.860
I'll let him tell it because of what he, he got to see and what he got to do.

185
00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.180
And some of the guys called me from the deployment and they were like, Hey,

186
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:51.420
we put Pete through the ringer &lt;laugh&gt; I was like good cause of what he was

187
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.300
stepping into. And um, I mean to this day, we're still best buddies.

188
00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.340
I talked to his son yesterday. Like he kind of comes over and we do like,

189
00:10:00.341 --> 00:10:03.140
he teaches my kids some things and I teach his kids some things and it's just,

190
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.980
uh, everywhere. I, I go, I was always taught to make a friend over money. Right.

191
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.660
Cuz those are the, that's the best cash you can have as a friend and um,

192
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.300
getting to live with him and experience that Hollywood lifestyle was,

193
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.930
was amazing. I remember showing up at his house the first day I was like, man,

194
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:21.170
why does this place look so familiar? He's like O J's house is right.

195
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:24.330
He lives in Brentwood. &lt;laugh&gt; he's like O J's house is right there. I was like,

196
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:29.330
oh yeah. Okay. And then it just got crazy from there. First time he took me out.

197
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.050
I mean, those, those are great stories.
