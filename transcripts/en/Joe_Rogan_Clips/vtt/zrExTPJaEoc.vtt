00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, thanks for being here. I really appreciate it.</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.250
<v 1>I am super, always happy to come. Well.</v>

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.830
<v 0>We've been talking and we've been talking about, uh,</v>

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.250
immune systems and this is one of the main things that I wanted to talk to you

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:14.761
about. Like,

6
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:18.060
what are the strict cause is all we're hearing is shelter in place where I'm

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.310
ask, don't touch anybody, don't go outside,

8
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.350
but we're not hearing what can you do to strengthen your immune system?

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.270
And I think that as a public health public service, you know,

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.850
a health thing, this is, uh,

11
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.300
one of the most important things that I think you can really focus and

12
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.081
concentrate on.

13
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:40.770
And an actual thing that you could be proactive about during this weird time.

14
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.380
<v 1>Yeah. Well, definitely I think focusing on, on, you know,</v>

15
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:48.560
lifestyle factors that you can, you know,

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.060
possibly modulate your immune system and strengthen it is, is important.

17
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.590
What's interesting is that the immune system, you know,

18
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.500
after doing just so much, of course, the past, like couple of months,

19
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.221
I've been nothing,

20
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:05.180
but like reading about the immune system and trying to understand, of course,

21
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:09.710
this new virus SARS cov two. Um, but I've just learned so much,

22
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.950
uh, you know, over the past couple of months, I'm not an immunologist,

23
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:16.340
I'm not an infectious disease expert. So, um, you know,

24
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:20.480
while I've had some training in immunology, I definitely, you know, didn't know,

25
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.080
don't know everything there is to know, but what just, you know, doing some,

26
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:27.740
some reading about like, why are people's immune systems so different? Like,

27
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.890
that's, that's the big thing. Like when you take like a young population,

28
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.860
as you get older, your immune system does decline. I mean,

29
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:36.710
there's lots of changes that occur, but like in general,

30
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:38.630
like people have different immune systems.

31
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.650
And what's interesting is that there's been tons of like genetic studies done on

32
00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:46.040
like, you know, identical twins and they're followed over time.

33
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:50.720
And what's found is that genetics is not the major regulator of immune function.

34
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.100
Um, it's something in the environment and what, this is what surprised me.

35
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.590
And I know it's not totally gonna answer your question, but we'll,

36
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.780
we can totally get to that. But the main,

37
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:04.010
one of the main things besides age that regulates immune system is like previous

38
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.840
exposure to viruses. Like, so I thought that was really interesting.

39
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:13.820
And in particular, one, one virus, the cyto medic megla virus CMV did,

40
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:17.720
you know, like between 50 to 80% of the us population, has it like,

41
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.110
at least by the time they're like an adult, how's it permanently or has it,

42
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.630
it's a, it's a herpes virus. So it's,

43
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.340
it's a lifelong thing and this is why it basically, so it, it,

44
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.810
it changes your immune system. What are the symptoms of it?

45
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.420
Most people that are healthy don't ever know they have it cause there's no

46
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:35.270
symptoms. Yeah. Unless you're immunocompromised,

47
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.180
but most people that are healthy, they don't know, you know,

48
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:40.550
that they're infected with it. Say it again, what is it?

49
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:44.810
The cyto megalovirus it's CMV sounds like something Godzilla fights.

50
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.420
There it is. So what's so interesting,

51
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.250
but here's the interesting thing about this virus is that it,

52
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.070
so this is one of the major things multiple studies have been,

53
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.510
have been looking at, like, you know,

54
00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.820
just immune variability and it's like CMV been identified in multiple studies.

55
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.910
And the thing that, the reason it got me interested in it, cause I was like 80,

56
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.230
almost 80%. I mean, I could have it. Right, right. Totally have it. Um,

57
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.810
and uh, it changes the immune function.

58
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.880
It's totally different between young and old. So,

59
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.030
so when you're younger and if you have it, uh,

60
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.120
it actually enhances immune function. So there they've done studies where like,

61
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:22.060
they, they, they have, um, given people, influenza vaccine,

62
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.500
and oftentimes these vaccine studies are used to kind of test the immune

63
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.940
response and like how your, how robust your immune responses, because you're,

64
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.880
you're given a vaccine and there's all different types of vaccines, you know,

65
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:38.110
pieces of an antigen or all different types of, you know, ways that you can,

66
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.790
you can expose someone to a bacteria or virus, but, uh,

67
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.150
you have a response to it. And the response is, uh, you know,

68
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.650
involves your adaptive immunity.

69
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:50.320
You make what's called neutralizing antibodies that, you know,

70
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.500
basically eventually bind to the virus and neutralize,

71
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:58.000
it prevented it from entering the cell. So people that have CMB that are young,

72
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.230
have a really robust response to the vaccine, much better. Um,

73
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.920
but older people have the complete opposite where it's like, you know,

74
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:06.754
deleterious.

75
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.350
And the reason for that scientists think is because basically

76
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.810
this virus it's,

77
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.670
it's stuck with you lifelong and kind of reactivates every few years.

78
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.630
And like every time it reactivates, it kind of trains your T cells,

79
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.370
which are part of your immune system to, to become focused on that CMV.

80
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.640
And so as you get older, your,

81
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:34.360
your T-cell population becomes more focused on fighting that virus and less so

82
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:36.430
on other viruses that you're exposed to.

83
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.940
<v 0>But this virus doesn't have any symptoms.</v>

84
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.780
<v 1>Both healthy people don't have any symptoms with it. I know it's really like,</v>

85
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:44.880
it's really weird. So what I'm wondering,

86
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.390
and the reason I'm even like going here, and it has nothing to do with,

87
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:50.370
you know, taking vitamin C or zinc,

88
00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:53.730
and we can talk about that stuff and vitamin D but I just thought it was so

89
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.560
interesting because we hear all these stories in the news where, you know,

90
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:02.970
some people are asymptomatic, some people are, you know,

91
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.300
then some people are just really getting, you know, hard hit. And,

92
00:05:05.301 --> 00:05:08.160
and these people let's say they're more age matched. Right.

93
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.910
We know that elderly people are more, um, prone to severe form,

94
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:15.570
but it just made me think what if this, you know, previous,

95
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.550
previous viral exposure to something like CMB is,

96
00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:23.010
is kind of like also kind of shaping people's immune responses in some way,

97
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.470
surely people are going to be looking, looking at that.

98
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:29.610
But I just thought that was a really interesting thing to come across, you know?

99
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:32.400
And then the other sort of on the same,

100
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.040
on the same law along the same lines as previous, you know,

101
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.720
previous virus exposure is like something that really seems to be something that

102
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:44.400
is a main regulator of how people, like, what, how you're immune, you know,

103
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.850
what your immune response is, you know? And so, so.

104
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.420
<v 0>You mean by how many times you've caught the flu, how many times you've heard,</v>

105
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.360
whether you hit your chicken.

106
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.220
<v 1>Respond to it, you know? Yeah. I mean, like you, if you get the flu,</v>

107
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:58.850
is it going to not is like a three-day kind of thing or is it going to knock you

108
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:02.690
out for two weeks kind of thing? Right. That's what I mean. Right. So, um,

109
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.790
I mean, if you, if you get a sample,

110
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:08.150
like there's been these Ciro surveys where they basically, um,

111
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.990
that just means they both get a sample of plasma and look for different

112
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:15.080
antibodies, viral antibodies, and they'll find at any given point,

113
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.890
a person has like antibodies against 10 different viruses, just randomly,

114
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.980
you know, so you're, you're constantly being exposed to viruses, you know,

115
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.440
you're not always, you just don't succumb to them, right.

116
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:27.050
You're not always getting sick. And so, um, you know,

117
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:31.790
like another really interesting kind of thing is like,

118
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.510
you know, there's, so the SARS cov two virus, um,

119
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.740
is part of a family of, of Corona viruses called the beta coronaviruses.

120
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.880
So SARS, cov one,

121
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.350
the VAR virus that was responsible for the original SARS outbreak in 2002 or

122
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:48.020
something, the mayor's one in the middle east.

123
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:52.430
And then there's two different ones that are responsible for the common cold.

124
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.990
Now coronaviruses are only responsible between like 15 to 30% of common cold

125
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:01.310
cases. So it's not like the common cold is, is the illness you get,

126
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:03.290
but there's lots of different viruses that can cause it.

127
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.850
But what's interesting is that there's been studies showing that these two beta

128
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.050
Corona viruses that are responsible for some of the common cold cross-react

129
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.610
with. Um, so there's one that cross-react with the SARS cov one,

130
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.520
which has a very, it's very, um,

131
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.680
the sequence is very homologous to SARS cov, two virus. And,

132
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.740
um, it's also been shown that the SARS cov one,

133
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:32.390
the antibodies against the SARS cov one can neutralize the common cold one.

134
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.840
So there's like cross immunity happening between these other viruses. Right.

135
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.580
And so, um, th and there's been some studies by the CDC, uh, on,

136
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.670
on SARS cov two, where they found basically, uh,

137
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.980
that people that are infected with SARS SARS,

138
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:50.660
cov two also boost their antibodies against the common cold one.

139
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:51.740
So, you know,

140
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:56.120
there's there certainly I think a good hypothesis to be made that

141
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.530
potentially, you know, one or two of these common cold viruses could,

142
00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:04.910
the antibodies you make against them could also somehow maybe, maybe, you know,

143
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.720
interact with the SARS cov two virus potentially neutralize it. I mean,

144
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:12.500
that's a big open question that seems possible. Um,

145
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.430
without we don't have any answer to that, I think we will, like, there's large,

146
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.000
there's large scale, uh, Ciro surveys being done.

147
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.950
I know at least three that, um, think his name is Dr. Michael Bush,

148
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:29.420
she's at UCF. He's like, he's, he's doing like really large, um,

149
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:30.750
surveys where they're, they're,

150
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.380
they're going to be analyzing Sierra from people from like, you know,

151
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:34.460
blood donors and stuff,

152
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:38.330
and like following over the course of several years to see, um, you know,

153
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.850
just basically understand more. So.

154
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.700
<v 0>What is the speculation,</v>

155
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:47.530
if there's any sort of uniform speculation as to why when you hear about prisons

156
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.210
where a lot of these prisoners,

157
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.020
I don't know if you've seen that there's a video going around where one prisoner

158
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:57.480
had, uh, SARS SARS, two COVID, 19, whatever,

159
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.550
and spitting into a cup and then passing it around to all these other inmates so

160
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.180
they could all get it so that they get released. So these,

161
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.540
because they're releasing people, especially California, which is so wacky,

162
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:10.980
they're releasing sex offenders,

163
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.230
and there's been some really high profile releases of these horrible people that

164
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:19.170
should be in jail probably forever. And they're releasing them. It's like,

165
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.000
it it's really disturbing,

166
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.540
but what would cause other than something like that,

167
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.160
what would cause all of these prisoners to not just be positive,

168
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.520
that makes sense. But to all be asymptomatic,

169
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.790
is there any speculation as to why large these large groups,

170
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.090
there was another one that was a meat packing plant where most of the people

171
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.110
were asymptomatic as well?

172
00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.970
<v 1>I wasn't, I wasn't aware of the meat. Plaquing one being asymptomatic. Um,</v>

173
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.900
but I did read about the one in prison and it was like blowing my mind. Like,

174
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:51.260
what's like, what's going on? Like, that's insane. It's kind of like,

175
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.750
you read these stories. So, so this is like,

176
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.770
there's one thing that it's important to keep in mind when we say asymptomatic,

177
00:09:57.771 --> 00:09:58.730
like, you know,

178
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:02.240
there's asymptomatic in like a person that never actually gets symptoms. Right.

179
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.960
And then there's asymptomatic. So there was a study done at the CDC,

180
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.190
I don't know, a month ago, maybe a little more where they measured, like, uh,

181
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.120
they did it, they did this nasal pharyngeal swab test in, in a nursing home,

182
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:18.590
70 something people. And, uh, 13 of them, uh,

183
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.710
tested asymptomatic. Like they had no symptoms, but they tested positive.

184
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.030
But then they went back a week later and 10 of those people had symptoms and

185
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:30.230
three re symptomatic. So unless like, there's another,

186
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.560
like if you test someone and they're asymptomatic at that time of testing,

187
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:35.810
they could be pre-symptomatic right. In other words,

188
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:39.890
like you have to go back a week later and see if they have symptoms,

189
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.440
because that that's really important. So, so let's say even, you know, you know,

190
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.040
60% of were asymptomatic. Like,

191
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:48.950
I don't know if they went back and tested a week later if it was just like a

192
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:51.710
single time, but that's what, that's what,

193
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:54.510
this is what got me thinking about this whole thing was, you know, in,

194
00:10:54.511 --> 00:10:57.710
in the prisons and jails, I mean, they're in close quarters and there,

195
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:02.300
you got one virus that someone's exposed to and they all get it. Right. So like,

196
00:11:02.301 --> 00:11:05.690
what if there's, I don't know the CMB, you know, percentage there,

197
00:11:05.691 --> 00:11:09.170
but what if the coronaviruses are going around there? What if, what if,

198
00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.950
you know, some, some common cold coronavirus has gone around and that, you know,

199
00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:15.620
those antibodies that they've made to neutralize that coronavirus beta

200
00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:19.220
coronavirus are somehow helping with the SARS cov two, like,

201
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.090
I would love to see that tested.

202
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.460
Do you know now immunize.

203
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.550
<v 0>Uh, people did vaccinate people when they go into jail. I was trying.</v>

204
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.080
<v 1>To figure that out as well, because like the tuberculosis, tuberculosis, um,</v>

205
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.840
one of the types of vaccines they do for TB,

206
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.580
I think they do it in like Japan and some other countries where they've got a

207
00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:43.910
really low, um, death rate. And so they're kind of, that's a test,

208
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.490
that's a clinical trial. That's now going on where they're trying to test,

209
00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:49.370
but I was trying to figure out, is there a vaccination? Yeah.

210
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:51.890
<v 0>Cause I would imagine it would be simple for them to do that.</v>

211
00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:54.730
You're entering into prison. Just vaccinate you just to.

212
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.460
<v 1>I couldn't come to an answer. I was, I was searching for that the other day.</v>

213
00:11:57.461 --> 00:12:01.300
I was trying to figure that out, but I think that's also a really good, I mean,

214
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:04.210
there's a ton of theories, right? I mean, it's just,

215
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.420
you could go on and on and on, but the whole,

216
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:10.450
the thing that I just think that I would like to see more research,

217
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:12.100
and I'm just hoping, you know,

218
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:15.670
that that CDC and other people are investigating these, these other,

219
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.820
the cross in unity, right? Like if there's,

220
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.000
if there's antibodies that you're making against another Corona virus,

221
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.880
beta Corona virus is in the same family as this Sarge one, no,

222
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:27.160
one's had Sarge one in the United States, you know?

223
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:31.210
So like that one doesn't that that's not as relevant as, but the common cold,

224
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:35.020
you know, that's, that's very common, right? So, you know, if,

225
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.520
if 15 to 30% of the common cold is composed of Corona viruses,

226
00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:43.810
we know at least two of those coronavirus are in the same family that have been

227
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:47.830
identified to make, at least in one case there's been neutralizing antibodies.

228
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:52.000
So there has been crossed immunity, then you'd think why, why not test that?

229
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.430
Let's get some animal studies started on that, you know.

230
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.620
<v 0>And of animal studies.</v>

231
00:12:55.621 --> 00:12:58.690
There was an article that I was reading yesterday that was saying that they're,

232
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:03.600
they're hoping that they've found some antibodies in llamas that

233
00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:07.260
they're hoping they're going to be able to, because of the,

234
00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:12.020
see if we could find this, um, because of these antibodies and llamas, they,

235
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.350
they they're hoping they can either transfer them to people or learn something

236
00:13:16.351 --> 00:13:20.820
about how these antibodies are created. But llamas seem to be heritages.

237
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.650
Lamas could be the key to fighting new coronaviruses research says make that

238
00:13:25.651 --> 00:13:30.240
larger. It says, uh, it may sound bizarre to most,

239
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:33.660
but Lamas could be the key to finding new coronavirus researchers from Belgium.

240
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.150
Oh, that remember that's the big lady that I was showing you earlier.

241
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:41.040
She's the health lady and the United States published an article this week in

242
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:44.910
the journal cell that highlights the potential use of llama antibodies to

243
00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:49.650
prevent COVID-19 infections antibodies from a four year old Belgian Lama named

244
00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:54.420
winter show promise in blocking Corona virus from infecting cells.

245
00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:56.910
According to research from the university of Texas Austin,

246
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.960
the national institutes of health and the Ghent. I said that Ghent,

247
00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:06.470
G H E N T university studying early forms of the coronaviruses researchers

248
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.920
found an antibody in winter that effectively attached itself in neutralize

249
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:16.110
spike protein in SARS cov one and MERS, cov, uh,

250
00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.670
researchers believed the particular antibody,

251
00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:19.800
which has been found in other Lamas as well,

252
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:24.450
can be injected into an uninfected individual to protect them from getting

253
00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:26.880
infected with the new Corona virus. That's very interest.

254
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.140
<v 1>Yeah. So there, I think, you know, there's, there's lots of avenues for,</v>

255
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:36.120
you know, therapeutics and, you know, in addition to like repurposing drugs, um,

256
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:37.950
monoclonal antibodies, you know,

257
00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:41.940
being able to basically identify antibodies that do neutralize SARS,

258
00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:46.830
cov two virus, whether they come from Lamas or humans and, you know,

259
00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:51.440
and basically identify the specific antibody that can bind to that spike

260
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:53.930
protein that you just mentioned, which is, um,

261
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.260
that region it's known that the antibodies bind they're neutralized. It,

262
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:01.790
it's also the region that, that is used to get inside of the cell. So, um,

263
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.260
monoclonal antibodies, I think are a really big, um, you know,

264
00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.160
possibility for a promising therapeutic because you can then, I mean,

265
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:14.450
the problem is growing like large scale manufacturing them, right? So like,

266
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.540
if you can identify these antibodies and then manufacture them,

267
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:21.140
you can inject them in people and then potentially get some protection.

268
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:21.891
The problem is,

269
00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:25.730
is that that's not like it's going to be a short lived protection.

270
00:15:25.731 --> 00:15:27.350
Like it's going to be, it's not like you can,

271
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:31.280
it's not like a vaccine where your body's making its own antibodies and they're,

272
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:33.380
and they're more longer lived, you know?

273
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.280
<v 0>So in areas where people are going to expose,</v>

274
00:15:36.281 --> 00:15:39.160
perhaps you could give it to them and it would stop them from getting,

275
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:41.020
but how long would you say short-lived?

276
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.320
<v 1>Well, we don't. No. I mean, how so it's, you know,</v>

277
00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:49.060
it's probably enough to PR like if you're a healthcare worker, your first line,

278
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.223
you know, health, you know,

279
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:55.210
first responder people that are definitely like being exposed

280
00:15:55.211 --> 00:15:58.540
to large doses of the virus, um, that,

281
00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.280
that could be a promising area,

282
00:16:00.281 --> 00:16:03.100
but also I think even just treating patients like that have already been

283
00:16:03.101 --> 00:16:06.010
infected, you know, so that's, that's also another,

284
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.480
so like in combination with some of this other stuff, like from desert vere, uh,

285
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:12.940
which is, you know, it's not like a silver bullet,

286
00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:14.920
but it seems like it's also promising,

287
00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:19.420
promising probably with combination of other, other factors as well. Um,

288
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.640
but yeah, the mono monoclonal antibodies is a really,

289
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.390
I know there's like Regeneron is a big company they're, um, they're,

290
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.850
they're growing some large scale ones. I think there's a, they,

291
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:30.790
they isolated from humanized mice or something,

292
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.730
but there's other companies that have isolated from humans that have been

293
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.290
infected. Uh, so, you know, that's, that's definitely, um,

294
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.420
a promising area for sure. And the, a good thing about that is that, um,

295
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.210
have you heard of antibody dependent enhancement? Do you know?

296
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.200
So that's a big concern. Um, all right. So,

297
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.700
so basically when you, when your body is exposed to a pathogen, like a virus,

298
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.150
your, your innate immune system, you know, the first line of defense,

299
00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:58.871
like neutrophils,

300
00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:01.630
things like that are making hydrogen peroxide trying to kill the virus,

301
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.720
but then in the background, your adaptive immune system,

302
00:17:04.721 --> 00:17:07.540
and I'm just totally generalizing is, you know, is,

303
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.530
is also working in the background. And, you know, part of that, uh,

304
00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.040
an adaptive immune response is, you know, to produce antibodies.

305
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.910
So you have memory B cells that are making antibodies that are specific to bind

306
00:17:18.911 --> 00:17:22.270
to different regions, epitopes on the virus and neutralize them,

307
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:26.590
prevent them from getting inside of the cell. Um, and so, uh,

308
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:30.670
that adaptive immune system usually takes about seven days after you're exposed

309
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:35.140
to the virus. Right. Um, the problem is, uh,

310
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.820
antibody dependent enhancement.

311
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:41.410
So sometimes a neutralizing antibody is an antibody that can bind to the virus

312
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.050
and neutralize it, stop it from entering yourself, right? So you're,

313
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:44.950
it's doing its job,

314
00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:50.460
but you sometimes make antibodies that are non neutralizing or don't do as good

315
00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:53.880
of a job. They don't bind as tight or something. And, um,

316
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.300
then you can have what's called antibody dependent enhancement.

317
00:17:57.301 --> 00:18:02.220
And this was like a big problem for all the RSV vaccine. Um, back in the,

318
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:05.760
you know, like most kids get RSV, it's a respiratory tract infection.

319
00:18:05.761 --> 00:18:08.160
The most kids get it by the time they're two, uh,

320
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.090
like there's no vaccine that that's given. Uh,

321
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.550
back in the sixties, there was, um,

322
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.360
this antibody dependent enhancement happened in some clinical studies with

323
00:18:18.361 --> 00:18:21.750
toddlers and some problems got really, really sick and a couple of died.

324
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.140
But what happens is basically the antibody binds to that.

325
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:25.831
There's a couple of things.

326
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:29.670
The antibody binds to the virus and can basically change its confirmation and

327
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:33.300
allow the virus to get into the cell better. So then you become like, you know,

328
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.150
you get like a higher viral load and then you don't have antibodies to

329
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:38.910
neutralize it. And it just, you know, it could be more, it could be,

330
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.740
it could lead to death. Um,

331
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.200
the other thing that happens is the antibody binds to the virus.

332
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.100
Doesn't neutralize it,

333
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:48.270
but it like makes us crazy immune complex that like activates your immune system

334
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:50.640
to just go haywire. And it causes all sorts of pathology.

335
00:18:50.641 --> 00:18:53.160
And that's what happened with the RSV toddlers.

336
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.300
So there's a few viruses that this happens with. And unfortunately,

337
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.650
coronavirus is one like this has been identified with the SARS cov one, um,

338
00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.790
virus. And I think marriage as well where, um, uh,

339
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.590
so this is also a problem with vaccines. So like people like giving,

340
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.170
giving the vaccine people's immune response, um,

341
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:15.420
some people can have that antibody dependent enhancement,

342
00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:18.390
and that's what was shown to happen with these, with the SARS cov one,

343
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.170
there was some non-human primate studies that, that did that. Um,

344
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.610
and also, uh, animal studies as well. So, you know,

345
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.090
Mon the thing with monoclonal antibodies is they're a little more specific cause

346
00:19:30.091 --> 00:19:32.670
you know, they neutralize and you're like growing them up.

347
00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.550
Like you've done all that test as opposed to just letting your immune system do

348
00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:38.010
its thing. And then potentially, you know,

349
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:42.000
you may have this like non neutralizing antibody that, um,

350
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.120
could cause problems, but that's kind of the concern.

351
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.680
And I know that the vaccine,

352
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.570
people that are working in vaccines are working on that and it's like,

353
00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:52.110
they're concerned about that and completely trying to like figure that all out.

354
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:52.370
Wow.
