00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.240
<v 2>I have been hearing some America's stereotypes, my Scottish friend,</v>

3
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.280
and some Ecuadorian friends. And they're like, they make me go like, oh no.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.960
So like, we can't see it. We're in the forest, you know?

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.680
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; you can't see the trees. Number one. Yes.

6
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.960
Americans like to wear free bank. T-shirts free bank.

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.390
T-shirts that's stuff. MB N a you'll see, no other country.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.630
Will you promote a bank? Just because they gave you a free shirt,

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.430
start looking around. You'll see it. Here's another one.

10
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.870
Americans love to comment on the beauty of a sunset while you're watching it.

11
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.670
&lt;laugh&gt; nobody else does that. Everyone's watching it, man. It's beautiful.

12
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.620
And then they go, yeah, we know dude, a can shut up and enjoy it.

13
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.280
Hmm.

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.260
Here's the last one Americans rush to assist in a situation that they have no

15
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:51.820
experience with. They'll see a bird hurt on the beach and like, get it in a box.

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.380
We have to take it. It's like, do you know anything about this? Like.

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.580
<v 0>Sort of how Burt moved Tom's arm when he broke it?</v>

18
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.450
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. He he's touched it. Did he? Really? He was like,</v>

19
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.050
let me move it. Yeah.

20
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.850
<v 0>Picked it up and put it over there. Probably it up for life. Oh.</v>

21
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.890
<v 1>Told jelly legs. Jelly, legs, squirrel, dude. It didn't even make sense.</v>

22
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.770
He just came down. He don't even like it. Wasn't like you see NBA players.

23
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.250
They come down. Yeah. Like, like it's con of McGregor stepped wrong.

24
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:20.250
You see snap?

25
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.170
<v 0>No, that's not what happened.</v>

26
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.200
<v 1>What ever Saura starts to jump. And then it was like,</v>

27
00:01:26.201 --> 00:01:29.520
he's cursed by a witch. And he just goes and he just went jealous.

28
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640
&lt;laugh&gt; there was no impact.

29
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.960
<v 0>No, he blew out his Batel tendon. He blew out everything. Everything.</v>

30
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.880
<v 1>Like.</v>

31
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.641
<v 0>Yeah. His arm, like what is that?</v>

32
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:40.440
His arm broke when he landed on his arm and the legs.

33
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.200
<v 1>Everything broke. Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.590
<v 0>Well, what happened was apparently he thinks he it up the day before,</v>

35
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:49.430
because he was jumping in his office.

36
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.270
They were trying to touch the ceiling in the office, like, like this ceiling.

37
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.590
Yeah. Trying to touch the ceiling. And he felt something weird in his knee,

38
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.950
but he didn't think too much of it.

39
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.910
And then the next day they were playing basketball,

40
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:05.620
they were doing this dunk contest and he dunked a couple of times and then on a

41
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:10.420
lower RI and then one time he really loaded up and his Patel tended just blew

42
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:15.380
out. So on the leap up, his legs just blew it apart. It gave way blew apart.

43
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.980
Wow. Yeah. His knee just went like that hot. It's.

44
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.220
<v 1>So crazy looking. Yeah. It's he doesn't yeah. It's always on the comedown.</v>

45
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.770
He went on the way up. I heard a doctor say &lt;laugh&gt;.

46
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.250
<v 0>Is that him? Oh my God. That's hilarious. &lt;laugh&gt;.</v>

47
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.930
<v 1>That's great. Of course. He's making merch on it.</v>

48
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.730
I got nobody cashes it more than time. That's hilarious. Ugh. He, um, he, uh,

49
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.490
I heard a doctor once a long time ago,

50
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.280
say in your forties is when have you do explosive movements and you don't have

51
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:50.840
explosive strength and that's where you get in trouble. Interesting.

52
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:55.360
Still trying to make ski jumps and you should have stopped at 31. Right. But at,

53
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.400
at 60, you're not trying to make those jumps anymore. That makes sense. Yeah.

54
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.640
<v 0>Or you just keep lifting weights and don't be a. Yeah. You're an outlier. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.360
Yeah. Just gotta know what your body's capable of doing.

56
00:03:08.361 --> 00:03:10.480
And the only way you know, is to make you do a lot of.

57
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.640
So you know what it could do all the time. Most people just stop.

58
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.960
That's what happens completely. Yeah. It's the grind. It's all about the grind.

59
00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:20.270
Like most people like they get to a point that I don't wanna lift anymore

60
00:03:20.271 --> 00:03:22.270
weights. I'm just gonna get on this elliptical machine.

61
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.430
Listen to a book on just go bust or Douglas. Yeah.

62
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.510
Just be like fat up and just fatten up. Lay back. That happens.

63
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.990
A lot of fighters. Ricky Hatton got huge. Really? Oh my God.

64
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:35.430
He got huge NFL players. He might have lost weight now, but he got real big.

65
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.670
A lot of guys get real big when they just,

66
00:03:37.671 --> 00:03:41.700
they just don't want you do anything anymore. I get it. They don't want be in.

67
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.700
