00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.800
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.480
<v 1>Experience. You know, when we first met, uh, I knew you were an author,</v>

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.320
and I knew that Chris PRT was involved in doing that thing with you and that you

4
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:11.880
guys were working towards making a, which is happening now,

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:13.800
which is very exciting. Yeah. Crazy. But, uh,

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.000
I had never read any of your work until now. So getting ready for this,

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.440
I actually listened to the audio book, which is really well done. The,

8
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.830
a guy who reads it, what is his name? Ray Porter. He's great. Yeah.

9
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:28.070
He's awesome. It's a little disturbing when he does a girl's voice, but no,

10
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:28.590
getting around that.

11
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.470
<v 0>Like if a guy's doing a girl voice, especially putting an accent to it. Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.470
There's like no, getting around the creepy fire to that's. It's.

13
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.110
<v 1>A little weird, but you, you take,</v>

14
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.430
but he's so good at like Russian accents and then, uh,

15
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:43.900
south African accents. I, and it's a really good book, man. Thank you.

16
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.780
It's riveting. Like it's thank you. It's hard to put down.

17
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.940
It's it's really good. And most of it, I listen to either, uh,

18
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.140
on workouts, walking, uh, hikes with the dog or in the sauna. &lt;laugh&gt; nice.

19
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.420
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt; perfect place to listen.</v>

20
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.020
<v 1>To it. So I burn through it in a few days. Nice. It's it's really good, man.</v>

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.530
Yeah.

22
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.050
<v 0>You know, like half the characters, uh,</v>

23
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.250
are the one people that were inspired by actual people.

24
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.450
<v 1>I know that was what's crazy is like so many people, whether it was, uh,</v>

25
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.450
you know, uh, John Dudley or Barlow or, you know, halfface blades,

26
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.410
like all these black rifle, coffee icon four by four, the six,

27
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.410
so many different things. Sitka. Yeah. So.

28
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.600
<v 0>Many different things that I strange not to, for me to,</v>

29
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.960
for me not to talk about gear,

30
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:25.880
just cause I was a gear guy before I went in the Navy.

31
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.200
And then of course in the seal teams, you're like, that's your time to shine.

32
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.320
And to like go down these rabbit holes and try to make the gear better or

33
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.600
anything, that's gonna make you more effective and efficient on the battlefield.

34
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.800
So he really gets it go all in. And then just after the military, same thing,

35
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.920
I'm just a gear guy. So it would be strange just to say he pulled out a rifle,

36
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.110
you know, or something like that. I couldn't wait. I just,

37
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.470
it wouldn't sit right. When.

38
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.590
<v 1>You were in the seal team,</v>

39
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.430
did you think you were ever going to become an author?

40
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.070
Is this something that you'd always had in the back of your head you would like

41
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:54.230
to dabble in some day? Like yeah. Yeah.

42
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.390
<v 0>It wasn't even a thing I was gonna dabble in. It was, I was going to do it. Um,</v>

43
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.390
and since I was a little kid, my mom was a librarian.

44
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:02.670
So I grew up surrounded by books and this love of reading from a very early age

45
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.260
and back then,

46
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:07.100
like so early eighties there's hardly anything written about seals. Uh,

47
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:10.380
but what there is written is a lot of times from fiction mm-hmm,

48
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.900
&lt;affirmative&gt; so protagonists in different stories by guys like Tom klanancy,

49
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.460
David Morell, Nelson DMI,

50
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.780
ajquinelle all these guys in the eighties who had protagonists with backgrounds.

51
00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.820
I wanted to have in real life one day. And I enjoyed reading them so much.

52
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.450
I knew that after the military, then I would write. So I just said, wow,

53
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:24.730
this's gonna.

54
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.890
<v 1>Be the path. So you had kind of mapped it out, joined the military first,</v>

55
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:33.650
joined the seals. Yep. And then after you retire then, and,

56
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:36.690
and how many years were you in for, uh, 20. You were in for,

57
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.610
and then during that time you had always mapped out that you were going to be an

58
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:42.090
author when you were done. Yep. Yep.

59
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.320
<v 0>Wow. And Bernie thought it like, while I was in, I wasn't writing,</v>

60
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.760
I wasn't practicing, but I was reading. So I'm first, I'm a fan.

61
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.240
I'm always a reader, uh, both fiction and non.

62
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.000
So all those guys I read in the eighties,

63
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:53.040
those are like my professors in the art of storytelling.

64
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.200
And then I coupled that with the academic study of warfare, uh, terrorism,

65
00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:00.520
insurgencies counterinsurencies and then the practical application from

66
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.120
Afghanistan, from Iraq.

67
00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:05.360
And then it all kind of came together at the right time in place as I was

68
00:03:05.361 --> 00:03:07.520
getting out. So for that last like year, year and a half,

69
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.120
then I started writing. Cause I wasn't taking guys down range anymore.

70
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.360
My job was essentially to get out of the military. Uh,

71
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.120
and cuz it's you feel like you're the first person to do it. Um,

72
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.440
even though people do it every day, but you want,

73
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.630
you need to get something signed or go to a meeting or get read out of a secret

74
00:03:21.631 --> 00:03:23.190
program or go to medical or dental.

75
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.030
So your job becomes to get out of this gigantic bureaucracy.

76
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.430
So during that time, time, how on that, that takes like a year.

77
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.750
I mean you can probably do it in a week really.

78
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:32.030
Like jockco didn't do any of it from what I understand, he's just like,

79
00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:36.390
no and he just left, like &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, but no,

80
00:03:36.391 --> 00:03:39.380
you can into those that I know he likem done. Yep, exactly. Yeah.

81
00:03:39.381 --> 00:03:42.260
I didn't do these transition classes you're supposed to do and you sit there in

82
00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:46.420
these rooms and people drone on and on about transition and options for you and

83
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:49.940
you're awful horrible. But uh, but I did it. I thought you had to, it was like,

84
00:03:49.941 --> 00:03:52.820
get something signed and off you go, but yeah, you don't have to do it. Well,

85
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:55.820
I think you do just jockco didn't &lt;laugh&gt; like, that's what he told me.

86
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:57.700
He's like, no, I didn't. I'm like, well who's gonna tell him to do it. You know?

87
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.290
&lt;laugh&gt; right. Like no one, no one's gonna say you have to do this. Get crushed.

88
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.410
<v 1>Yeah. It's not good luck. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; so,</v>

89
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.330
so you were planning all along to write and so during that time,

90
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.650
while you were being deployed and while you're, you know,

91
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.570
you're being a seal in the back of your head,

92
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.210
that was always a part of the plan.

93
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.880
<v 0>Yeah. That was when I'm done with this, then I'll do that.</v>

94
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.760
So I wasn't thinking about like how to set it up.

95
00:04:22.761 --> 00:04:25.080
Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; I didn't know anyone in publishing didn't know anything,

96
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.320
but I knew that one day that's what I would do. And it wasn't even a question,

97
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.960
but.

98
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.560
<v 1>You clearly had equal enthusiasm for being a seal as well. Yeah. Oh yeah.</v>

99
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 0>You have to. That's why they had to be separate. So I had to be 100% all in,</v>

100
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.281
on being a seal.

101
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:39.400
Cuz you have to-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; that's what you owe the guys under your

102
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:42.110
command. Uh, when one down range, that's what you owe their families,

103
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.110
the country, the mission. Uh,

104
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.510
but when I got home from that last Iraq deployment and took a breath and looked

105
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:51.030
around and saw, oh my family needs me. I've been gone for quite some time.

106
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.750
Even when you're training, when you're training,

107
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.950
you're out for three weeks here, two weeks there,

108
00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:56.710
month there getting ready to deploy.

109
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:58.790
So it's not just the six to seven month deployments.

110
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.140
It's all that time spent training up a down range with your team.

111
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.820
So I knew that my family needed me it's time to get out. So it was very clear.

112
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:07.220
It wasn't a hard decision for me.

113
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.740
Plus I'd I'd gotten to the end of my time where I would tactically lead guys on

114
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:12.700
the battlefield. Uh, so that's a troop commander.

115
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:15.780
So that's where jockca was when he did his last deployment as a troop commander

116
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:18.100
as an oh four, which is a, a major in the other services,

117
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.010
a Lieutenant commander in the Navy. And after that, yeah, you're still a leader,

118
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.490
but you're leading from behind essentially or the tactical operations center.

119
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:27.050
You're more of a manager type leader.

120
00:05:27.051 --> 00:05:29.450
You're not out there kicking doors with the guys, uh,

121
00:05:29.451 --> 00:05:31.890
which is what we all come in to do or most of us come in to do anyway.

122
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.090
So I knew that that part of my life was over and it was time to transition,

123
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.170
take care of the family. So it's time to start writing. Did you take.

124
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.610
<v 1>Journalism classes or writing classes or?</v>

125
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.920
<v 0>Nope. It was all the reading, all that reading I did growing up and uh,</v>

126
00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:49.840
my mom introduced me to a guy named Joseph Campbell back in 1987. Oh sure.

127
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:50.674
So he did, uh,

128
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.600
a series of interviews with bill Moyers on PBS mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; called, uh,

129
00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:56.800
the power of myth and he wrote a book called hero with a thousand faces.

130
00:05:56.801 --> 00:06:00.360
So back in 1988, so I'm, I don't know, 11 years old or whatever, 12 years old.

131
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:01.160
Um,

132
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.320
I get introduced to him and I read that book and I watched all those interviews

133
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.120
and I read the book that came out called the power of myth based on those

134
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:11.200
interviews. And I think I applied that paradigm,

135
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.600
that model of the hero's journey, the monolith to really every,

136
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.310
every movie I watched, every series I watch to every book I read from then on.

137
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.750
And that really helped as I made the transition because I had this foundation,

138
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.950
it wasn't just like I woke up one day and said, you know, what,

139
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.790
can you make money at writing? Oh, that sounds like a good thing to do.

140
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:30.790
I'll I'll go back and read and I'll go back and see kind of figure out the

141
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:32.430
history of this genre. No,

142
00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:35.670
I already had that figured out because I did it my whole life and it was that

143
00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:38.620
foundation. So that was already the air. And while I was in the military,

144
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.380
I kept reading for fun, read those, uh, fiction books still.

145
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:45.500
And I discovered Stephen Hunter and Brad Thor and Vince Flyn and Daniel Silva.

146
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.940
And uh, and now mark Graney today. So those are kind of the, the,

147
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.180
the kinda the bigger names in the genre. And, but then I was also studying,

148
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:55.220
studying all that nonfiction stuff, trying to stay up on my game to make my,

149
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.460
make the best decisions I possibly could under fun.

150
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.490
I for the guys when it mattered. So, uh, I'm just always studying,

151
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:02.050
always reading. When I was down range,

152
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.050
I never really watched a movie or played video games.

153
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.890
It was always if I wasn't out operating or we weren't, uh,

154
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:08.810
putting together a target package that I was reading.

155
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.170
<v 1>That's interesting because I,</v>

156
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.010
I would think that most people that would venture and become a professional

157
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.040
novelist, they would have some sort of background in writing,

158
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.440
like some sort of education, some classical education,

159
00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:24.920
English literature or something.

160
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.080
<v 0>Yeah, no, it was all reading. It was all wow. Knowing what I liked,</v>

161
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:29.040
knowing what I didn't like.

162
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.120
And that's why the first novel is really all about revenge because that theme

163
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.081
resonated with me.

164
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:36.800
Obviously it's resonated with people from the beginning of time from telling

165
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:39.110
those stories around campfires usually, uh,

166
00:07:39.111 --> 00:07:42.630
told in a way to pass on some sort of a lesson about something to the next

167
00:07:42.631 --> 00:07:44.910
generation. So they don't have to learn the same lessons in blood,

168
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:48.790
but they're told as a story and pass down that way. And I think that's,

169
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:50.110
that's why there's so many death wish movies.

170
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.990
That's why there's just cause you can't. If someone cuts you off in traffic,

171
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.190
you can't go out and do something or someone, you know, at work,

172
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.630
there's some politics, you don't get the promotion or whatever you get mad.

173
00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.940
You can't do anything about it. It, but you can in the pages of a novel,

174
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.740
you can escape there or you can escape in the movie theater and you can see

175
00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.940
somebody that goes out and gets this revenge and it makes you feel good cuz you

176
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:10.340
know, you can't do it cause in real life, if you do it, you're gonna go to jail.

177
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.500
You can get the death penalty. It's not possible, but you can do it in the,

178
00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:16.580
you can explore all that in the pages of a fictional thriller. So, uh,

179
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:19.500
I think that's why it resonates with, uh, with people. And then in this part,

180
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.090
their case,

181
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.730
I got to take the emotions and feelings behind things I was involved in down

182
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:26.530
range and then just apply them to a fictional narrative.

183
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:28.650
So I didn't have to talk to somebody and say, Hey,

184
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:31.690
how did it feel to be a sniper in ramati in 2005, 2006,

185
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:35.650
and then filter that through whatever biases I had or whatever my past

186
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:39.050
experience or whatever, and then put it into a fictional narrative. No,

187
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:43.680
I just took my experience and then just morphed it and put it into the

188
00:08:43.681 --> 00:08:45.920
narrative. So it, uh, ended up being very therapeutic.

189
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.440
<v 1>So did you approach, um, an agent first? Like how did you get.</v>

190
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.720
<v 0>Started? Thank goodness. I didn't know. You're supposed to do that.</v>

191
00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.040
&lt;laugh&gt; cause I'd probably still be looking for one today.

192
00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.440
So I did very little research on that front cuz I think that a lot of people can

193
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.080
study how to do something too much or too long and it's gonna be different for

194
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:05.440
everybody, but you know,

195
00:09:05.441 --> 00:09:08.680
some people can study how to do something their whole life and never actually do

196
00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:10.640
it. Uh, cuz you only have certain amount of bandwidth.

197
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.440
And for me I read so Stephen Presfield,

198
00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:17.190
who's become a great friend now who's on this show. Um, a while back.

199
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:19.630
He wrot I love that guy. He's so great. Yeah. He wrote gates of fire,

200
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.870
a legend to back Vance, the Afghan campaign.

201
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.470
And then has those series of books on creativity, the war of art, art. Yeah.

202
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.990
Just toely you gave that out to people. Right. For a while he had a stack,

203
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.870
a stack of them. That is to keep it the studio. Yeah. So he's uh, he's amazing.

204
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.220
And actually listening to him on this show before I started writing,

205
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.260
gave me the idea of writing a one word theme down to keep me on on point.

206
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.980
So I wrote revenge for that first novel on a yellow sticky,

207
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.820
but he didn't really say this on your show.

208
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.700
He was talking about somebody else who a playwright who would write a sentence

209
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.620
to keep him on theme. But somehow through my filters, I heard him say, uh, oh,

210
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.050
a one word theme on a yellow sticky on my computer. And so I did the same thing.

211
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.570
So it wasn't, it's not really what he said on the show,

212
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:05.050
but I took it as what he said and I wrote it down and that really for the first

213
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:05.884
book, revenge,

214
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.210
second book redemption and then fourth book I morphed or third book,

215
00:10:09.211 --> 00:10:11.570
I morphed a little bit dark side of man. But uh,

216
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.050
so those are the themes that really kept me on track. But,

217
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.480
and you're on the fourth one right now. You're on the yeah.

218
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.360
How long does it take you to do one? Uh,

219
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.920
the first one can take as long as you want,

220
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.800
because you have to have for fiction, you have to have the finished product.

221
00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.000
So for nonfiction you can sell like an idea, a chapter, an outline,

222
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:30.080
something like that. Like you're coming from sports or politics, you know,

223
00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:33.280
you can sell that idea cuz they know they're gonna get some sales for this.

224
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.160
You have to have the whole manuscript done.

225
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.070
So the first one took about strive two years. Um,

226
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.910
and you get it as good as you can possibly get it.

227
00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:42.790
And then what you're supposed to do is go to an agent. But I didn't know that.

228
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:46.310
Thank goodness. Um, because I didn't do, I did that research.

229
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:49.230
I talked about with Stephen Pressfield's books on creativity, war of art,

230
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:53.310
authentic swing, uh, turning pro do the work, uh, read those,

231
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:56.630
read Stephen Kings on writing Davids, Stephen King's books.

232
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.900
It's so it's an autobiography really? Yeah. It's not just about writing. Yeah.

233
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:01.940
It's about his, his entire life. Uh,

234
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:05.100
David morerell's the successful novelist and I think those were the,

235
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:08.180
those were the main ones that I, that I read. And then I was like, okay, got it.

236
00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:10.580
And I put those within sight of me and my computer,

237
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.060
but I didn't touch 'em again and I, but they were there.

238
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.700
So I would look to them for inspiration as far as oh,

239
00:11:15.701 --> 00:11:17.020
Stephen Hunter says you're profess, sorry,

240
00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.090
Stephen press field says you're a professional. Uh, you're a writer.

241
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.690
You sit down and write, uh,

242
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.570
the writer's block doesn't exist cuz it doesn't exist for dentists or truckers

243
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.570
or doctors. Yeah. They don't get doctors' block.

244
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.410
So you don't get writer's block you're professional and you write.

245
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.930
So just having them that close, uh, really helped with that transition.

246
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:37.570
And I made the decision to now once I was a seal and now I write,

247
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.120
so I think that really helped, but I didn't know he needed, he needed an agent.

248
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.320
Um, and thank goodness I didn't because uh, otherwise, like I said,

249
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.440
it'd still be looking for one cuz those are the gatekeepers essentially mm-hmm

250
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.280
&lt;affirmative&gt; and they have assistance that are even gatekeepers to them.

251
00:11:50.281 --> 00:11:53.320
So it's, it's tough. I think, but lucky for me, um,

252
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.960
a friend of mine sat next to a guy named Brad Thor who writes in the genre, uh,

253
00:11:56.961 --> 00:12:00.880
has a character called Scott harvatht who's a former seal and uh, he's a,

254
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.714
he's a great guy.

255
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.840
My friend sat next to him at a one of these events for Trey's money for a seal

256
00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:08.000
foundation type thing. And as I'm writing,

257
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.520
I'm about four months in and my buddy says, Hey, do you want,

258
00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:13.430
do you know this guy named Brad Thor? And I said, oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,

259
00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:15.950
I mean, I don't know him, but I've read all this stuff and he said,

260
00:12:15.951 --> 00:12:18.310
do you wanna talk to him? I know you're writing a book. And I said, yeah,

261
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:21.070
I'd love to talk to him. Would he talked to me? And he said, yeah,

262
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:24.110
that I'll set it up. I helped him out with a couple things in, in his books.

263
00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.511
So sure enough,

264
00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:29.070
he sets it up and actually I'm up here in an event in LA at the time I was

265
00:12:29.071 --> 00:12:32.230
trying to find a quiet place to, to have this call with Brador.

266
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.420
So I go to the parking lot at the, the terrane resort parking lot up there.

267
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:40.660
Sun's beating down on my old &lt;laugh&gt; my land cruiser. Everything's off though.

268
00:12:40.661 --> 00:12:42.860
The engine's off. Cause it's so loud. And, and uh,

269
00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.660
I thought my pen and paper are there. I'm sweating, but uh, sure enough,

270
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:49.180
we had this great call and, and uh, it was like a job interview.

271
00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.940
I think he wanted to know like, Hey, why do you wanna write?

272
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:55.170
And I told him the same stuff I you or tell everybody that I grew up loving

273
00:12:55.171 --> 00:12:58.650
reading and knew I was gonna do this one day and about my mom being a librarian

274
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.770
and, and knowing the history of this genre and all that,

275
00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:02.930
and just being excited about it, he could sense the passion and he's like,

276
00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:06.370
all right. So if you write a book, what I can do for you,

277
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:07.970
your friend told me some things you did in the seal teams.

278
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.730
And as a thank you for that, uh, I'll let my publisher know it's coming.

279
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.570
I can't guarantee they'll open the package.

280
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.240
Can't guarantee they'll read one word.

281
00:13:15.241 --> 00:13:19.160
Definitely can't guarantee that they'll like it. But as a thank you,

282
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.160
I can let them know it's coming. And I said, that's all I need. And he said,

283
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:25.520
how long until you're done? And I said one year from today. And so he's,

284
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.680
he's like, all right, don't call me. How did you.

285
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:28.960
<v 1>The chapters, this is your first book.</v>

286
00:13:28.961 --> 00:13:31.640
How did you know one year from today you'd be done? Cause I was cuz.

287
00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:34.790
<v 0>Other guys that have serious characters have one book at you year.</v>

288
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.670
And so I figured, well, &lt;laugh&gt;, you know, doing this doing thing.

289
00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:40.430
I was about four months into it. So I was like, ah,

290
00:13:40.431 --> 00:13:42.990
give or take a couple months. So sure enough. I, uh,

291
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.230
I called him back one year from the day and he's like, but he said, Hey, don't,

292
00:13:46.231 --> 00:13:49.590
don't call me. Don't send me chapters. I'm not gonna give you any advice. Uh,

293
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:50.950
and he did gimme some advice on that call,

294
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:53.390
but he didn't want me bugging him throughout the year. Right. Uh,

295
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:57.300
which I totally understand now, um, and called him back a year from,

296
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.380
from then and said it's done. And to his credit, it was so awesome. He said,

297
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.380
is it done or is it the best you can possibly make it? And I said, well,

298
00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:07.780
I could probably edit it a little bit, but it's finished. And he's like,

299
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:11.100
all right, call me back again. &lt;laugh&gt; when it's the best you can possibly do.

300
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.260
So I took another four months of reading it and editing it,

301
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:15.420
sending it to a couple of friends. And uh,

302
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.250
I then called him back four months later and said,

303
00:14:17.251 --> 00:14:20.090
this is the best I can possibly get it. And he said, all right,

304
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:21.570
I'll let 'em know it's coming. So, so how.

305
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.610
<v 1>Many hours a day do you think you were putting in? Gosh.</v>

306
00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.930
<v 0>So it's not like hours. I mean,</v>

307
00:14:26.931 --> 00:14:28.690
I would love to get on a discipline type schedule,

308
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.610
like a jockco type schedule someday, but, uh, I'm not quite there yet. Uh,

309
00:14:32.611 --> 00:14:35.050
especially at this stage where I'm still feel,

310
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.480
I still feel like this is a startup and I can't say no to a lot of things.

311
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.440
Um, I need to take advantage of emerging opportunities,

312
00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:44.920
just like I would on the battlefield, uh, looking at the enemy,

313
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:47.280
they're learning from us, we're learning from them. Uh,

314
00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:48.720
and it's really who adapts quicker.

315
00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:51.240
You're looking for those emerging opportunities, taking advantage of momentum,

316
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.713
um, looking for gaps.

317
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.960
So the same things that you would do for a startup or starting like a coffee

318
00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.000
shop somewhere you have to do for writing.

319
00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:02.880
And I didn't really get that at the outside. Like how so? So I, you,

320
00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:04.600
you're not just writing and sending it to New York,

321
00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:07.720
which is what I thought up until about the time I published the first one.

322
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.200
I thought you just went back and forth with an editor a little bit.

323
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:15.390
You start the next book. Well really you have to do, uh, advertising, branding,

324
00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.150
co-branding all your marketing stuff, your budgets, your social media,

325
00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.190
like anything you would have to do with any other business that you're starting

326
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:25.390
up, you have to do as an author. Mm-hmm &lt;affirmative&gt; so, uh,

327
00:15:25.391 --> 00:15:28.590
so I kind of treated it as a startup and starting it, like,

328
00:15:28.591 --> 00:15:30.710
just like you're starting something in your garage and you're hungry and you're

329
00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:33.780
passionate and uh, you're seeing an opportunity here or there and you're,

330
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.580
and you just want to build this readership and uh,

331
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.980
let people know that you have this character and see where it goes. So, uh,

332
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:42.580
so it's been a, a sprint. So point being, uh,

333
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.380
at some point I think you get to a stage where you can say no and you don't have

334
00:15:46.381 --> 00:15:50.020
to sprint off in all these different directions, uh, almost at the same time,

335
00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.850
um, and can say, okay, you know what I'm gonna do.

336
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.690
I'm gonna wake up and I'm gonna write for four hours.

337
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.370
And it doesn't matter if someone calls for an interview or if CNN wants you on

338
00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:01.170
or Fox news wants you on it doesn't matter. I'm just gonna do my four hours.

339
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.410
And then after that, then I'll check my texts. Then I'll check my emails.

340
00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.290
And if something comes up, yeah, we can schedule it out.

341
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:09.170
And later you later in the week, but right now it's just like, oh,

342
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.970
really Fox wants me on bam. I mean, I'm on. And they,

343
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.800
and all of a sudden now I'm not writing for those four hours in writing. Right.

344
00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:19.440
Right. Usually it's, uh, the first novel and these and this, all the others,

345
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.560
uh, were really done between 10 at night and about four in the morning,

346
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.280
because that's the time it was quiet in our house with three kids, a dog wife.

347
00:16:26.281 --> 00:16:26.840
And yeah.

348
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.480
<v 1>That's how I do stand up writing too. Same thing. And everyone's,</v>

349
00:16:29.481 --> 00:16:30.560
asleeping's your best work?

350
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.440
<v 0>Cause there's no one interrupting that interruption. It.</v>

351
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.270
<v 1>That feel like they can't work like that.</v>

352
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:38.110
And they only work good if they get up in the morning and then write

353
00:16:38.111 --> 00:16:40.350
immediately, they write even before breakfast.

354
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.550
<v 0>So I was getting up and working out like that up until up until the publication</v>

355
00:16:44.551 --> 00:16:46.670
of the first book. And then things got a little crazy,

356
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.910
the publicity stuff and publicity stuff. And then writing late at night,

357
00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:51.350
also working on the next one,

358
00:16:51.351 --> 00:16:54.180
dialing that in and then you're editing while you're writing another. Oh,

359
00:16:54.181 --> 00:16:56.340
so you're kinda juggling at the same time when you're in this, oh,

360
00:16:56.341 --> 00:16:58.860
Jesus book a year, uh, type program. That's what you're,

361
00:16:58.861 --> 00:17:00.260
that's what you're doing. Um,

362
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.820
and maybe I'll get past that at some point and I'll have a end date and then

363
00:17:03.821 --> 00:17:07.460
I'll start the next one. But right now it's not, uh, not quite like that yet.

364
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.090
<v 2>Okay.</v>
