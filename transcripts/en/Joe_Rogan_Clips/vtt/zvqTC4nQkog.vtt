00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.920
<v 2>I, I was brought up, I was brought Mormon, really? So I was brought Mormon.</v>

3
00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.960
Your family's Mormon. Well, my family's Mormon, but we're all excommunicated.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.640
What happened? My dad got us all taken out of the thing. So it was just like,

5
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.560
we were like deep, we were deep. And then when we moved provinces,

6
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.670
the church good here in Ontario. So in Nova Scotia, big,

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.070
big fellowship. We Mormon world, you know,

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.070
then what my dad was like a high deacon or whatever the it was. Or like, we,

9
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.270
we always like sat next to like the Bishop's family, like front row,

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.350
cuz it's all like the families whoever's like up on the stage or whatever,

11
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:42.780
like the family sit in the front row and. So then when we moved to Ontario,

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.740
I, you know, uh, like when we were about 12,

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.341
13,

14
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:53.900
right around like that time when we started all of a sudden doing like drugs and

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.340
drinking is when we stopped going to the church because that's maybe a part of

16
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:57.700
it too.

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.380
<v 0>Right. Where like we were like,</v>

18
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:03.130
I never had a Coca-Cola I never saw a P E G rated movie.

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.930
We only watched G rated. Really. I never saw the Simpsons until I was, you know,

20
00:01:07.931 --> 00:01:09.530
like things like that. Like we were allowed.

21
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.890
So once you got excommunicated from the church, they just, well, we,

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.850
we took ourselves, my dad,

23
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.530
I don't know if excommunicate the right word left the church. We,

24
00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:17.350
when we left the church,

25
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.810
but because they have so much information on you and your family, like family,

26
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.280
church stuff, like it takes a long time to actually get your,

27
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.280
like your out of there. What do you mean? Like, uh, your info?

28
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:32.560
Like I think they just have like a lot of information on you and your families

29
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.400
and they do a lot of ancestral stuff. Right. So I think they do like a lot of,

30
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.360
and you, you know, the pen you gotta give all like,

31
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:42.750
even like I would get $2 a week for my allowance and I would have to give 10% to

32
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:44.870
the church. So we would all key my brothers,

33
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.190
we would have to take our nickels or whatever, our dimes really.

34
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.910
And we'd have to give our, our 10% to the church. Really. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

35
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.350
So that was training,

36
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:56.750
like just saying like that training of like giving the church,

37
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.470
the money from day one. Oh and all that kind of. So it was just like, and then,

38
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.220
you know, my parents are like, they were young and it's, they were like the,

39
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.220
the young, the young couple that got knocked on and my dad was like,

40
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:10.020
come on in like drink a, like, you want a beer? Oh God. And, and,

41
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.100
and all of a sudden, my dad was just like,

42
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.300
and it was one of those things where I'm like, why, you know,

43
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.980
we were so like you, like when I found that out later on, I was like,

44
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:21.180
you literally just like somebody knocked on the, you let a missionary in here,

45
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.300
you know? Like where it's like, so funny.

46
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.250
How old were you when you were asking him? That question? Like late, like later,

47
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.610
like in my twenties. Yeah. Like when I had like some balls to like, you know,

48
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.290
dads are so scary. So I was just like, you know, like when I, huh? Yeah.

49
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:36.290
Just why you're asking him why. Yeah. Just like some que,

50
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.283
like where I was just like, you know,

51
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.130
like he would come visit me in college and we'd go have like lunch, you know,

52
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:42.810
my dad would drive up to the city and, you know, having those father,

53
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.800
son kind of conversation and it's like, Hey,

54
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:47.840
like this was kind of crazy back then. Or like, why was this? Or like, you know,

55
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.800
like, why, why, you know, why were we never allowed to like,

56
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.040
sleep over at other kids' houses? Or like, you know,

57
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.600
like things like little small things that I don't think are, you know, crazy.

58
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.880
But I think it's definitely like one of those things that like, you know,

59
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.280
never having like Coca a Coca-Cola and then all of a sudden I'm like doing acid,

60
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.640
you know, I'm all gas, you know, like, it's just like, I was like, oh cool.

61
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.320
We're not Mormons anymore. Let's.

62
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.920
<v 1>Do some blotter acid. Sometimes that's what triggers it. Right.</v>

63
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.440
Is the repression there's so much repression.

64
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.910
And then all of a sudden they take the rains off you. Well.

65
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.470
<v 0>And the idea of heaven, just like at a young age,</v>

66
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.870
I strongly felt like there was no heaven. And I strongly felt,

67
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.110
I didn't believe it from a young age. Cuz I also, and,

68
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.310
and there's three levels of heaven in the Mormon,

69
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.270
in the Mormon or in the book of Mormon. Right. There's like the celestial,

70
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.230
the whatever in the whatever. So I was just like,

71
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.820
there's just a three levels of heaven. There's like three levels of heaven.

72
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.220
So then there's tears, there's tears. Right? So the thing that I was,

73
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.420
I was a crypto as a kid, I would like walk into like, you know,

74
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.540
a little store and like grab a little thing.

75
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.980
Like I remember I saw a Jack knife once from like this, like, you know,

76
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.300
hardware store. Like I would just like take things, you know, a little clip do.

77
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.180
And in my head at a very young age, I was like,

78
00:03:59.181 --> 00:04:03.730
I'm never were gonna be eternal with my parents at a very young age.

79
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.250
I was like, my parents are like, you know,

80
00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:07.570
they did the whole thing with the underwear and they're married forever.

81
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.490
And like underwear is wild.

82
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.330
I think they had to give it back or they had to get rid of it. I don't know.

83
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.570
Give it back. I dunno. Let's FaceTime Steve. And be like, what the?

84
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.370
So did you have to give the underwear back, dad?

85
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.130
<v 1>I still don't understand. Like they have information on you.</v>

86
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.080
Like why is that that make it hard to leave? Because they tell you, Hey,

87
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.000
we know things about you. Like what?

88
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.120
<v 0>No, I don't think it's like weird, like that kind of stuff.</v>

89
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.440
I just think it was just to get our out to be like stricken

90
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.840
of the.

91
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.760
<v 1>Books. Right. So you don't have to pay them every week. Can.</v>

92
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.400
<v 0>You? Well, you don't have to pencil like you, or I think it's called Pence,</v>

93
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:38.520
but I think it's like, once again,

94
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:41.350
there's probably a lot of Mormons watching this that are being Maddie doesn't

95
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.110
know. And I don't know. Okay. I don't know. I just lived it. Right.

96
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.070
But I just think it, it, it is. Um,

97
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.310
I remember it was just one of those things where

98
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.910
I remember my dad and my sister. It was crazy.

99
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.070
Cuz she had a child out of wedlock. She's gonna love that. I say this,

100
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.710
but she had like a child out of wedlock.

101
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.300
And so that was like a thing where I think it was like, I don't even know.

102
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.980
I think there was like a thing where she got like a piece of paper saying she

103
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:10.620
had to go in front of like a tribunal. Oh boy. And like, you know,

104
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:14.220
explain herself or she was getting, or maybe she was getting X. I still forget.

105
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:15.054
It's kind of fuzzy.

106
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.380
But I think it was like one of those things where I remember when the

107
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:19.740
missionaries showed up and,

108
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.810
and it was almost like they served her like papers some.

109
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.370
And I remember my older brother almost like beat the out of these missionaries

110
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.130
where was like, get the outta, you know, one of those kind of things.

111
00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:29.770
Like get off our porch, get the outta here.

112
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.090
<v 1>Serving you, papers. You violated. I don't know.</v>

113
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.090
<v 0>Religious. Like that's the thing is like, I, I don't like a lot of, uh.</v>

114
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.090
<v 1>Well that is the wackiest religion. It's.</v>

115
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.010
<v 0>The WIES right? Yeah. I know. Of.</v>

116
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.360
<v 1>Course I'm a part of it. It's like other than Scientology, I was baptized.</v>

117
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.720
It's the wackiest one. It's the wackiest one. Right?

118
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.640
Cause they know the guy who made it up and he.

119
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.080
<v 0>Was a conman. We, we used to go,</v>

120
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.000
we used to go to the hill where he found the book of Mormon and they used to

121
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.440
redo the event and we would visit the, the.

122
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.800
<v 1>Jail where he was like murdered.</v>

123
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.360
How old was he when they killed him in his twenties? That's in that wild.

124
00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.280
John Smith, John Smith, um, Joseph, Joseph Smith.

125
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.400
He invented it when he was 14 years old. Let's go. That's incredible.

126
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.030
That's like, now that's like a talker. Know, everyone just follows TikTok. Same.

127
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.110
Well, I just can't imagine a 14 year old. That's not full of. Yeah.

128
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.310
You know like a 14 year old that tells you a story like that.

129
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:28.110
And everybody's like, wow. He's like, let let's you've met angels,

130
00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.350
but where they like, they were beautiful. You have a golden tablets.
