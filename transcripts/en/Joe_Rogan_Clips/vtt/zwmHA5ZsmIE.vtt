00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. If you go to the Congo,</v>

2
00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:08.130
you got to go walk through the stretch that has that giant champ living in it.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.810
Do you know that giant Chimp, the Bondo ape,

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.230
the bundle? Yeah. It's a larger version of the chimpanzee.

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.850
It's like six feet tall, huge 200 plus pound chimps. Jeez.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.510
The locals call them line killers. It really? Yeah. They,

7
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.840
they nest on the ground or we got an image of they nest on the ground,

8
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.950
like gorillas. Yeah. Well this one is not,

9
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.330
this is an image is a dead ones. See if you can go to,

10
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.260
uh there's um, th if you just Google Bondo, ape,

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.800
there's some really good. See that one in the upper left hand corner, Jamie.

12
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.400
Yeah, but that picture, I don't think is real. I want to say that's fake.

13
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.160
Congo's giant Bondo. See that, that one's real. Those people with the dead one.

14
00:00:56.161 --> 00:01:00.450
Okay, good. Make that larger, please. Can you just make the,

15
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.070
there you go. That is a, that's the first evidence of one that they ever found.

16
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.090
And then, um, they, they shot this thing and they took pictures of it,

17
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.000
but I believe that was in the 1930s.

18
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
And then they got another one that they shot at an airport.

19
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.550
And these guys are posing with this thing. See if you could find them,

20
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.970
that's it at the bottom. The very bottom that right there. Bang. Look at that,

21
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.750
go, go full screen. The one below it. Yeah. Look at that.

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.540
Make that larger look at the size of that Chimp.

23
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.070
So that is this thing that they call the Bondo eight and it has a crest on its

24
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:38.640
skull, like a gorilla. Yeah. Yeah. It's not like it's not,

25
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.750
skull is not shaped like a chimpanzee skull. And so go back to the picture,

26
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:45.810
please. That's okay. That's big enough,

27
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.210
but because there's not a very clear picture anyway.

28
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:52.200
So these guys shot this at an airport and a look at the hog on them too.

29
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.360
But the size of that thing, I mean, look at the, the men behind it.

30
00:01:57.361 --> 00:01:58.380
I don't know how big they are,

31
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:01.080
but let's assume they're tiny and they're five foot five.

32
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:05.070
That thing is 5 10, 5 11, probably. Well,

33
00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:09.450
north of 200 pounds. And it's a Chimp. Oh my God. A rip you to pieces easy.

34
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.340
But the cool thing is, is this is a weird sub species. That's only in this,

35
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.340
I think it's called Bailey in the Congo and they call it.

36
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.180
They either call it the bili ape, or they call it the Bondo ape.

37
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.610
But it's an enormous.

38
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.300
<v 1>Sure. I've stuck picture there where the guys are either side holding it up.</v>

39
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.163
I'm sure.

40
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.320
<v 0>Google, uh, Bondo, Abe camera, trap photo.</v>

41
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.550
There's a camera trap photo of one of them walking upright.

42
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.040
And it's about six feet tall. Upper left-hand corner. That one. Yeah.

43
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.590
They said by measuring the stuff around it,

44
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.330
they think that that is a six foot tall chimpanzee walking through the

45
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.440
jungle. And that's this guy, there's a guy named Carl Oman. He's a,

46
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.620
I think he's from Switzerland. He's a wildlife photographer.

47
00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:00.370
And he spent a considerable amount of time trying to find these things and take

48
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:04.210
photos of them because of all the descriptions that the, the natives have,

49
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:08.110
these enormous chimpanzees, they got video of one of them eating a Jaguar.

50
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.770
They don't know if it killed it or if it found it dead, but.

51
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.430
<v 1>Whereabouts in the Congo is at, you know?</v>

52
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.600
<v 0>Yeah. I think it's called BI L I, it's not a large place,</v>

53
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:23.110
but it's incredibly dense jungle. It's very hard to get to.

54
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.790
But for a long time it was just legend. But now they have actual video of them.

55
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.370
They have photograph, they have scat samples, DNA,

56
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.510
and then they have the skulls,

57
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.500
the skulls that are not quite gorilla and not quite chimpanzee when they first

58
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:37.330
got I'm pretty sure they thought it was a hybrid.

59
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.320
They thought like a gorilla a champion. Come here, bro. And then, um,

60
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.430
now they think it's a totally different subspecies of chimpanzee.

61
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.500
So they're really ULI forest. So that's where you got to go, bro.

62
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.520
<v 1>Yeah. That's not far from the of that looks like the source there. Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:55.570
Is that.

64
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.080
<v 0>Could you go through there? So that area looks small,</v>

65
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.040
but it's probably bigger than Florida. The area where these things,

66
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.060
I mean the condos.

67
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.730
<v 1>Oh, is it the Congo? She's always fast from a young age,</v>

68
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:08.710
you hear all sorts of stories about the Congo don't yet.

69
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.080
<v 0>Isn't it wider than the contiguous United States?</v>

70
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.910
I think the Congo itself is wider than the United States.

71
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.940
I think there's more landmass in the, in the Congo.

72
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.490
There's an amazing BBC documentary on the Congo from many

73
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:28.180
years ago from, I think it was like from the nineties, but, uh, they spent, uh,

74
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.070
29 times. The I'd say is 29 times bigger than the Congo. Okay. Well hold on,

75
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.320
stop, stop. Uh,

76
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.240
200 and 342,000 square kilometers. But the width of it,

77
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:41.170
I think it's the width.

78
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.250
<v 1>Well, I only 5 million people, even a size.</v>

79
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.270
<v 0>Oh, that's it. Okay. No, it's not. Okay. It's not as wide. It's him.</v>

80
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.610
It's close to Texas or something. Yeah. It's like,

81
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.860
it's bigger than Texas for sure.

82
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.850
It's like Texas and California and maybe like one other states most down there,

83
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.160
it looks like it's like 30% of the United States.

84
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.770
<v 1>Still in love wilderness that there was no. Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.650
<v 0>Man. And if there's a giant Chimp limit in there and all kinds of other in all.</v>

86
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.440
<v 1>Sorts, all.</v>

87
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.910
<v 0>Sorts. Have you seen that? A shoe bill bird that lives there? No. Oh my God.</v>

88
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.530
It's a five foot tall dinosaur of a bird with an enormous face.

89
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.970
His face is like this big and it looks like, like, it doesn't look real.

90
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.833
Like you see.

91
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.050
<v 1>But the way that you're describing it, maybe photos, videos.</v>

92
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.180
<v 0>Face that they have there.</v>

93
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.170
There's some great high resolution photos of the shoe bill.

94
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.830
When you look at them in the eye and you're like, what the is that?

95
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:39.220
Is that real? They're little like the most ferocious looking bird.

96
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.960
It looked like that right there. Yeah. Come on bro. Face.

97
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.960
Imagine walking through.

98
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.910
<v 1>Waking up and see, and not looking down at you.</v>

99
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.770
<v 0>Or walking through the jungle and you part some leaves and that thing is staring</v>

100
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:55.810
at your face. Oh my God.

101
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.370
<v 1>We came across, you know, L have you heard of elephant boots?</v>

102
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.840
I think David Attenborough, elephant birds, elephant birds.

103
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.550
I think David Attenborough first discovered it or went to Madagascar because he

104
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.310
was fascinated by the elephant bird went extinct. I don't know how long ago,

105
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:15.230
but their eggs were about there. About what's half a foot like a football.

106
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.030
Yeah. Almost. Okay. Yeah. Rugby ball football. Um, in, in size.

107
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.403
There we go.

108
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.753
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

109
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:25.250
<v 1>That'd be painful.</v>

110
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.710
<v 0>That's so big. Look at the size of that.</v>

111
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:34.040
<v 1>Tyson with an ostrich. Oh my God. Um, on the left, there you go. Yeah. Holy.</v>

112
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.820
And these were big, but I came across the elephant boot eggshells.

113
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.380
They're about this thick as well,

114
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.650
maybe quarter half a centimeter in thick in thickness.

115
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.890
And they're just scattered across the Southern beaches of Madagascar in their

116
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:46.790
thousands.

117
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.230
<v 0>So this thing is still alive.</v>

118
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.280
<v 1>Extinct. It's just the eggs are still there. Yeah. There you go.</v>

119
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.240
As David [inaudible]. I think he bought one box and called it

120
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.073
, which is the capital city of.

121
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.130
<v 0>Any of them. You can just go get one.</v>

122
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.150
<v 1>This thought. Yeah. Just crushed because they're so thick. Oh,</v>

123
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:01.984
I look at that compared.

124
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.920
<v 0>It just lasts forever. Oh, holy. They're huge. Okay.</v>

125
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.740
<v 1>How many years ago they went? Extinct shows a couple.</v>

126
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.640
<v 0>Of thousand. How many of these things have been kept or, uh, collected?</v>

127
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.380
<v 1>I'm not too sure. Don't know how many.</v>

128
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.100
<v 0>Why did they disappear? What does it say? Human people? What?</v>

129
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.290
<v 1>I believe it was the humans. Isn't it? Hunter?</v>

130
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.830
<v 0>Roll-down humans may not be to blame all.</v>

131
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.640
Pop-ups get us every time. Wow.

132
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.640
<v 1>Immense fast. Huge though. Isn't it?</v>

133
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.120
<v 0>Yeah. But did you ever see the ones they had in north America? The Terra birds?</v>

134
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.230
No. Oh. They had seven feet tall murderous,

135
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:44.000
carnivorous birds that couldn't fly running around north America. Geez.

136
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.010
Yeah. Pull up terror. Birds.

137
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.540
Jamie's he's searched over time. In this episode.

138
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.980
I'm just trying to scare you with all the I've seen in your whole life.

139
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.530
These were enormous birds.

140
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.170
There's one that shows a real look at the size of that thing.

141
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.590
There's one that shows the go to back to that national geographic thing that you

142
00:08:03.591 --> 00:08:07.630
just had right there. Jamie in the middle. Yeah. I think that was like a,

143
00:08:07.631 --> 00:08:11.630
a CGI documentary that they had done on one says verse wolves.

144
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:12.500
I don't even want to click. Oh.

145
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.473
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.360
<v 0>Well, I think there's so much bigger than the wolves.</v>

147
00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:19.160
They probably hunted them down. There's a size.

148
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.740
<v 1>Comparison there. Isn't I say next to a human. Yes.</v>

149
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.420
<v 0>There is. It's a far left, just chasing horses.</v>

150
00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.680
<v 1>Do you imagine like exploration back there will be a whole different ball game</v>

151
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:31.310
when it, oh.

152
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.160
<v 0>You had no idea. So.</v>

153
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.030
<v 1>I have a dangerous as well, you know?</v>

154
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:35.301
<v 0>Well,</v>

155
00:08:35.301 --> 00:08:37.970
when you're talking about people that believe in witches and people that believe

156
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:39.080
in witchcraft, like back then,

157
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.190
you almost had to have some belief system to keep you going because you had no

158
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:47.510
idea what was around the next corner. So these Terra birds were alive.

159
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.020
I believe when human beings were alive. Right? When did these things,

160
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.130
when were these things alive? If I had to guess,

161
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.360
I'm going to guess they died out million years ago,

162
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.250
half a million years ago.

163
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.660
<v 2>62 To 1.8 million years ago. Whoa.</v>

164
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:07.800
<v 0>62 Million.</v>

165
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.110
<v 2>This is a temporal range covers from 62 to 1.8 million years ago.</v>

166
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.600
So I think that's 62 million, not 62 years ago.

167
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.740
<v 1>So definitely the dinosaur dinosaur age centers.</v>

168
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.903
<v 2>Outlook era.</v>

169
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.220
<v 0>So just some kind of monkey Chimp type thing was all we had back then.</v>

170
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:29.820
You know, I think that was like Australia, pivot guests or something like that.

171
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:32.880
What was it? What year was that? Okay. You got I'm over Googling. You.

172
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.510
<v 1>Still stuff living, living with is the one that's less terrifying.</v>

173
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.800
We had the camel spider. Yes. Her injects. You have like an anesthetic. Yeah.

174
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.150
Like stories of soldiers waking up half an ear missing because they've been

175
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.780
injected in the middle of the night by this big camel,

176
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:51.330
spider size of a dinner plate. Isn't it? What does this Jim.

177
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.750
<v 2>Mammals of the myosis scene, which are, I guess the same as the same era.</v>

178
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.060
So it looks like giant sloths time period. That,

179
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.040
that north American bear time period.

180
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.960
<v 0>Look how small the horses are. Holy.</v>

181
00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.140
Compared to those giant slot things avatar isn't it's a short face bear.

182
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.350
That's what that is. That's that enormous bear. You've seen that thing. Right?

183
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.510
The, uh, short face bear.

184
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.550
<v 1>Short faced bear. I haven't.</v>

185
00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.750
<v 0>Seen no, bro.</v>

186
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.110
The short face bear was the most terrifying bear in all of history.

187
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.420
Short face bear was way bigger than a polar bear and super carnivorous.

188
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:26.880
And they think it might've been the thing that kept human beings from

189
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:30.840
successfully navigating the Trek through the bearing landmass until they went

190
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:32.610
extinct. They're huge. There's,

191
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.500
there's a picture of a guy standing next to a recreation of a short face bear

192
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.980
and it's cry. It's so big.

193
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.520
They think people probably hunted them off to extinction or they don't,

194
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:49.230
they don't really really know. Do you get an image of a short face bear? Yeah.

195
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:52.440
It's ridiculous animal that I didn't even know existed until a few years ago.

196
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.810
<v 1>Probably so much. That's why that's sappy.</v>

197
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.530
And I dunno if it goes into the details, Sapient does go into the details of it.

198
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.170
<v 0>Go with the one on the far right corner, upper. Right.</v>

199
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.000
That's what it looks like.

200
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.040
<v 1>You just would not venture outside.</v>

201
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:10.320
<v 0>Imagine how big that is.</v>

202
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:12.090
<v 1>Root. Isn't it it's.</v>

203
00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.360
<v 0>Like a cartoon comic book version of a bear.</v>

204
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.700
Like you can't believe we're looking at this thing.

205
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.400
We're literally this thing standing up these gentlemen,

206
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.070
let's just assume there's somewhere in the neighborhood of six feet tall.

207
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:27.300
This thing is their entire height plus a couple of feet.

208
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.780
So double their entire height. I should say,

209
00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:35.070
plus a couple of feet as we gate there, their head,

210
00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:36.850
this thing standing up and their,

211
00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:39.210
their heads are like right around where his hip bone is.

212
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.770
Although he is on a little bit of that.

213
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.570
<v 2>That's pretty close to 14, 15 feet maybe standing up.</v>

214
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.260
<v 0>Yeah. But why they have a motto mound? Listen. We know he's tall,</v>

215
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.290
but put them on it. You're exaggerating. You're making it look more ridiculous.

216
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:56.540
It's ridiculous. As it is without putting him being on a mound,

217
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.240
why do you have him? You trying to make it even crazier. It's crazy enough,

218
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.320
but super predatory. Yeah.

219
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.480
Between that and saber tooth tigers,

220
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:09.580
there was an African line that used to live here.
