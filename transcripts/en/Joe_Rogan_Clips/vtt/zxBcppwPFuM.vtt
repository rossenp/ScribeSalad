00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The Joe Rogan.</v>

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 1>Experience. How many members, when you combine all the cartels,</v>

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.000
how many members are we talking about?

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.490
<v 0>That's that means it's pretty hard to put a number on how I will say this more</v>

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:18.780
than a million. I will say this, they defeated the Mexican army in Sina LOA.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.000
<v 1>Yeah. That was bananas. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.510
When they captured El Chapo son. Yeah.

8
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.280
And then the army gave it back. Yeah. They're like, yeah.

9
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.390
You going to have him back?

10
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.100
<v 0>Well, sorry. Uh, th that whole situation, uh, and it was like,</v>

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.270
I remember that was happening and I was getting asked questions about it and it

12
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:42.720
was wife. It was all of a sudden just popped off, you know,

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.173
um,

14
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
basically supposedly official story from the Mexican government is that they

15
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:54.300
send a special police unit to capture him. Right.

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.570
Which is completely false.

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.550
I think because you don't send 35 agents to capture one of

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.270
the, the heads of one of the biggest scene, lot law cartel cells. Right.

19
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.440
So it's pretty much a by chance, they spotted this party,

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.610
people around on there, they went there. All of a sudden chapel's son is there.

21
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.770
<v 1>They just stumbled into him. There's.</v>

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.570
<v 0>A, I, I posted a video on, on my feed of the capture of the, uh,</v>

23
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.890
of, uh, El Chapo son.

24
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.900
And you can see it and you can see the surprise and really how

25
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.890
the agents are kind of uncomfortable or are fearful of what they just stumbling

26
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:32.760
on. Um,

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.620
imagine us agents stumbling on one of the America's most wanted

28
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:40.230
individuals up here. They're gonna put them on the ground.

29
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.480
They're going to handcuff it. And the video,

30
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:47.010
you can see that the point that rifles Adam and he calmly takes out his gun and

31
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:50.820
hands it to somebody inside of the inside of the house he was in and walks out

32
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.540
and kind of tries to negotiate with the people outside the federal agents that

33
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:58.860
are trying to arrest them. And you can see that the agents are like, oh,

34
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:02.220
what did we stumble in on? Right.

35
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.990
So that happened. They grabbed them, they reported back to Mexico.

36
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.940
They captured him. They started to announce the capture and his brother,

37
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.980
um, uh,

38
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.570
his half-brother Archie Baldo basically called in all of the reinforcements from

39
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.970
all surrounding towns and regions and seeing the law.

40
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.220
And it was flooded with a bunch of armed cartel guys, all of us,

41
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.870
you know, it was, wasn't there a video.

42
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.630
<v 1>Of the government, people in the cartel, people talking.</v>

43
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.860
<v 0>Yeah. There's, there's, it's on my feed. You can see it if you want. It's uh,</v>

44
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.690
it's basically, uh, an army unit that was being sent to reinforce security in,

45
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:45.390
in Quilligan being surrounded by cartel members. Yeah. Is this a right here?

46
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.540
Yeah. Uh, that's it, uh,

47
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.470
obviously the guys running around with a vest and wearing skinny jeans or some

48
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.900
of these, you know, oil cartel members. Um.

49
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.600
<v 1>And they just talk.</v>

50
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 0>It through, I mean, uh, they're outnumbered. And also there was a,</v>

51
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.720
there's talk about, uh, there's a,

52
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.200
there's a specific community out there and seeing the law where all the army

53
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.850
families members live,

54
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.960
and they were apparently being held hostage by cartel guys as a bar bargaining

55
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.880
chips. So all these guys that we're seeing here,

56
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.940
they're dressed in civilian clothes with the vest. Those are all cartel guys.

57
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.470
Those are real cartel guys, Jesus Christ. And that shaking hands with everybody.

58
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.370
Well, you know, Hey, what's up homie? I mean, uh,

59
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.780
there again, we go back into the whole, what,

60
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:33.070
what is the fight they have in them? Right.

61
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.600
Seeing cartel was basically surrounding some of their communities and Helen

62
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.110
holding their family members hostage. So that went out over the radio.

63
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:45.520
So as an army member going into fight the cartels and you know what

64
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.850
I'm out of this flight. Yeah. So they raised their hands.

65
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.800
So then they release the hostages. Everybody backs out. Yeah. I mean, there's,

66
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.670
they defeated the Mexican government basically. Um,

67
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.340
anything they went up against, you know, um,

68
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.420
it's surrounded the city usually you'll see classic, uh,

69
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.720
classic Mexican cartel, uh, uh, CAC activity.

70
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:11.710
They close off the streets going into the city by burning, uh,

71
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.170
semis and trailers and stuff like that.

72
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.440
So you would see all these burning semi-trailers in the region.

73
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.820
So if you want to move in, you can't, and if you want to use your helicopters,

74
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.510
the cartels have an entire graph capabilities. So,

75
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.530
uh, they broke out a bunch of people from the prison,

76
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.360
just taking advantage of the whole chaos. Uh, you, you, you could see you,

77
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.670
there's a few other videos with, uh, there's, uh, armored trucks with, uh,

78
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.940
50 cows. And Medusa's on the back of them just moving around the city.

79
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.580
So there's no way, there's no way you can,

80
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.270
this is the breakout state prison, you know,

81
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.450
took advantage of the whole chaos and just, you know, let's just, let's, uh,

82
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.590
let's break some of our friends out. Right. So just pure chaos.

83
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.050
Uh, eventually they let that, the government decided to let them go,

84
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.170
that's the official story. But according to the people there,

85
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.660
there was no government saying, let them go.

86
00:05:04.661 --> 00:05:07.750
There was like the guys holding him and said, you know what? It's not worth it.

87
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.140
Yeah. That's one of the, uh, the technicals as they call them up here.

88
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.840
Yeah. Dump trucks, they armor plate the sides and put somebody out,

89
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.710
imagine P and a person living there. Well,

90
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.030
that's what I'm trying to picture, what life is like for the civilians.

91
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.570
And most of these videos are all done now by civilian.

92
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.110
So there's a certain normal, we'll see, in some of these cases,

93
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:35.200
especially in scene law, it's part of it. It's, it's part of the culture there.

94
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.280
And as far as sides go, you know, Hey, the army is coming to save us.

95
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.480
That's not usually what to, some people in some of these communities think,

96
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.080
you know, because the cartels are, those are the guys in charge.

97
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.260
So Sina LOA always been like that. Like how long has it been a little,

98
00:05:50.261 --> 00:05:54.940
it has traditionally been a cradle for like the origins of some of the high,

99
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.670
some of the more successful cartel heads. Right. Isn't that.

100
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.930
<v 1>Where Julio, Cesar Chavez.</v>

101
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.880
<v 0>Is from. Yeah. Yeah. He is. Yeah. And, um, you know, lot, lots of,</v>

102
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.210
uh,

103
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.170
lots of anybody that's anybody in scene a lot has some sort of relationship to

104
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:11.210
the cartels because they're a part of culture there.

105
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.390
There's no way of getting around. It had a surreal experience.

106
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:18.410
Once when I went there, I did a class out there. Um, and the, uh,

107
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.910
it was running down this bumpy road and then all of a sudden, just flat,

108
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.940
beautiful road. Oh yeah. This is the cartel part of the road that they built.

109
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.160
It's like, okay.

110
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.970
<v 1>Wow. So it's like, sort of like the mom in Vegas in the,</v>

111
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:33.170
in like the fifties and sixties.

112
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.530
<v 0>Exactly, exactly. But it's now, and they're way more hardcore,</v>

113
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.370
way more hardcore. You know, some of their, uh, they have, uh, uh,

114
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.170
[inaudible] is called the narco cemetery they have,

115
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.850
and it's basically luxury condos. They look like, I mean, I went there,

116
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:53.420
I thought it was a church and it turned out to be a tomb. Wow. All right.

117
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:57.470
So the, the opulence and the money there is just overt, you know, and,

118
00:06:57.471 --> 00:06:58.730
and how they move around.

119
00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:02.690
They roll around in vehicles with guns and nobody does anything because they own

120
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:03.524
the city.

121
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.200
<v 1>What can be, what are they planning on doing it?</v>

122
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:12.530
Was anybody have any plans or is it just, they just get accepted?

123
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.760
<v 0>Yes. Well, you know, you, you, you, you get a lot of rhetoric about, uh,</v>

124
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.530
collaboration. Yeah. That's, that's Hardy and his LMI, all of those are graves.

125
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:26.240
Some of them have CCTV video inside air conditioning, you know,

126
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:30.590
alarms. Those are great. Those are grave sites. And the cartel guys, uh,

127
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:35.480
heads go there on the day of the dead avenues, live bands,

128
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:38.690
shoot their records into the air. Nobody does anything. Wow.

129
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.700
<v 1>Jesus Christ. This is crazy.</v>

130
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.500
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, the opulence has made, I mean, just seeing it, you know,</v>

131
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.510
it's like having several Escobar's in one place, you know, it's not,

132
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.110
you know, it's like a lot of, a lot of, uh, cartels, uh,

133
00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.830
heads are from that region. And a lot of their kids grew up in that and,

134
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:02.540
you know, the opulence is amazing.

135
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.473
<v 1>Like, is this.</v>

136
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.900
<v 0>Going to grow? I think it is. And it's, I mean, I don't think it is,</v>

137
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:12.560
it is growing, you know, again, going back to my friend, John Norris,

138
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:15.380
and having seen his experiences up here, uh,

139
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.830
finding all these illegal drug rose in, in, in, in, in public lands,

140
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.230
it's growing, it's growing over here too. So, yeah.

141
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.183
So, um,

142
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.970
th the thing that a lot of people have to think about a lot of these cartel guys

143
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:31.900
had their kids up here, so they,

144
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:34.790
they made their money down there and they sent their wives up here.

145
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.790
And a lot of these kids that were born in the late eighties,

146
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:42.740
early nineties coming of age, up here with that cartel pair degree. So,

147
00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:44.840
and they're us citizens as passport.

148
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.450
So he's gonna S you're going to see some sort of shift and, you know,

149
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.510
they're coming of age, it was get experience. You get, you know,

150
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.570
a handoff of rains from the older generation to the newer generation.

151
00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:59.490
You're going to see definitely it's definitely grown.

152
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.200
<v 1>It seems so crazy to watch because it seems like it's not discussed nearly</v>

153
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:08.140
enough. And it, it seems like if it,

154
00:09:08.141 --> 00:09:12.150
if it keeps getting stronger, like what we saw with El Chapo son being released,

155
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.710
like, what is, what's this topic from taking over Mexico entirely?

156
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.780
<v 0>Well, I mean, you, you, you would have people arguing that already has in,</v>

157
00:09:20.781 --> 00:09:22.230
in different ways. So

158
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.400
I think another thing that people kind of have to kind of figure it out and

159
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:29.760
realize is that there's factions in Mexico, in the Mexican government.

160
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:34.020
So you will see a federal government that apparently is being paid off by a very

161
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:35.430
specific large cartel group.

162
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.650
And then you'll see state governments that are different political party

163
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.460
influenced, uh, paying off by other cartels, uh, groups.

164
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:46.500
So you'll see, you know,

165
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.090
military units moving on the town and the state police blocking their way to get

166
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:55.200
in there because they play for different teams. Right. Whoa. Um,

167
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.971
you know, there's a,

168
00:09:56.971 --> 00:10:00.990
there's a lot of talk right now about Philippe Calderon's tenure and how his

169
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:05.130
head of secure ahead of public safety was on the payroll of the senior law

170
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.640
cartel, which actually came out, uh, during El Chapo trial.

171
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.340
So now you're talking about basically a federal police force that was on El

172
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.523
Chapo's side.

173
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.070
So he had free range to grow and do whatever he had to do in that region

174
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.990
with the support of the federal government in a way.

175
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.510
So technically, you know,

176
00:10:27.511 --> 00:10:30.420
who's in control of some regions and realistically,

177
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.960
some regions of Mexico are completely in cartel control.
