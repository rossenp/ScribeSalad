00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. He.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 1>Sends me this text message. He goes, dude, check this out.</v>

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.380
And it's you training with hot fail Codero and I remember.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.680
<v 2>Looking at it going, oh, what happened?</v>

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.260
<v 1>What happened? Cause the last time you were in here,</v>

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.290
you were talking about how you didn't want to work out. Yeah.

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.300
Because it would ignite the ego.

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.040
<v 3>Hey, let's talk about that too. So, um,</v>

9
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.180
I was discussing my wife, something about me being away, you know,

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.880
when you have to yes. Sometimes when they complain and your wife,

11
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.540
when you wouldn't pick her up behind some kind of perspective, and she said,

12
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:40.160
well, why don't you just get on the treadmill for 15 minutes a day? I said,

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.300
excuse me, just 15 minutes. So it went from 15 minutes a day to two hours a day.

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.340
And that's what you were worried about. Yeah,

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.930
exactly. Um, but I was complaining about my weight and so,

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.450
um, I don't know. I guess I tried on some clothes and it was disastrous.

17
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.310
And so I was worried about my weight and she told me the 15 minute round knew in

18
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:09.050
two hours a day. And um, I just started losing weight. And then,

19
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.700
um, somebody called my brother-in-law said, Hey Mike, man,

20
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.220
I know you're not going to one. But somebody said,

21
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.180
will you fight this guy for like 40 million, 30 million bucks? I said, man,

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.760
whoa. I said, oh, that's not the thing to get the the world.

23
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.050
I said, well, who would they like me to fight and said, wait a minute.

24
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:31.070
And then it's Bob fat said, okay. And so I'm saying to myself,

25
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.020
well I know Bob. And then ho, cause I know Bob was big and strong and say,

26
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.390
hope one minute, how would they like me to fight them? Kind of fight him on,

27
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.280
in the market of Queensbury rules. And he said, wait a minute, Mike,

28
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.970
he asked the guy, the guy said yes. I said, I'll fight them. Right.

29
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:51.200
And so Bob Sapp was the first one that was brought up. The one, some people.

30
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.770
<v 1>Don't know, Bob side, Bob side was a giant fighter in pride.</v>

31
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.380
At one time he was like 375 pounds.

32
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.720
He was fighting all the kickboxers solid muscle.

33
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.720
<v 3>Yes, incredible. Right. And um,</v>

34
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.770
it went from him to somebody else and another guy in the MMA, the next guy.

35
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.120
And then somehow, no,

36
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:13.010
some other fighter van that didn't win from who else was another heavyweight

37
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.610
champ. We just a bunch of guys up here in fight. And they thing, you know,

38
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.440
it came down to Roy and I, and I'm like, I don't know what the hell is going on.

39
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:24.710
And then he signed the contract. I found the contact.

40
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.600
Next thing I know I'm in the gym again.

41
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.340
And this disaster is I'm trying to get in the. I really do this.

42
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.841
You know, you,

43
00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:39.410
you would probably know because if you getting in shape and getting conditioned,

44
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.970
the two different animals,

45
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.500
they don't even believe belong in the same workout

46
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.240
division of working out, getting in shape is just being kind of fit. Yeah.

47
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.680
No. Should get in shape and able to fit your clothes. Right. Right. You know,

48
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.320
that's getting in shape, being able yet to fit your clothes,

49
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.350
being the condition is being able to come out. Fight of your soul.

50
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.610
No. Yeah. You can't do that automatically.

51
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.580
<v 1>You're talking about being in fighting condition. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

52
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.040
That's a rare state and.

53
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.580
<v 3>You can't keep it for very long. No, it is.</v>

54
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.450
People need to understand that the emotional state to prepare for that is an old.

55
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.940
<v 2>Wound mind body. Well, that's.</v>

56
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.670
<v 1>What I was seeing when I was seeing you hit the pads. I'm like this,</v>

57
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:26.280
isn't just working out. There was something going on, man.

58
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:27.540
When you were working out with Cardera,

59
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:30.450
when you rip into the body and throw those hooks, I was like,

60
00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:33.930
this is a man who's preparing to go to combat. This is not normal.

61
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.320
Getting ready to work out. That's why, when I saw that video, I was like, oh.

62
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.510
<v 3>Let me tell you something about that video. Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.390
I did that video and I was in bed for a week.

64
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.720
That was 30 seconds that I was in bed for a week.

65
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.220
And it's not funny because it made me realize that this is, this is,

66
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.540
this is big. Okay. It's big boy. right there.

67
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.640
That wasn't really cool. That's in the gym. That's now the thing is though, nah,

68
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.840
nah, that's, that's gone for, you know, five and six rounds that's now.

69
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.200
But I'm talking about before that 30 seconds, the first time I ever did it,

70
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.730
I caught 'em. What's the you could where you can

71
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.670
[inaudible] they came and everything, all that.

72
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.540
They came back to made me quit boxing. All the pain started coming back.

73
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.800
<v 1>So when you started training again, did you start doing it slowly.</v>

74
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.190
<v 3>After that? Extremely slowly. And then I started, um,</v>

75
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.640
dabbling in alternative stuff. Like what kind of stuff?

76
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.750
<v 1>Prior therapy type, cryo.</v>

77
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.981
<v 3>Um, stem,</v>

78
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:39.870
cell research and therapy and some other interesting stuff that

79
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:43.740
I just don't know. And this just beautiful stuff. Like what kind of stuff?

80
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.640
I don't know. Hyperbaric chamber, other than just everything, everything,

81
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.760
everything that helps you recover. It's really interesting.

82
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.030
<v 1>It is it. Well, I saw you when you walked in today, I was like, God,</v>

83
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.500
you look good. You look good, dude. Like your muscles look good.

84
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:04.350
You look like your vascular. You look fit.

85
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.180
<v 3>And that's um, and I'm starting to feel fit.</v>

86
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.900
That's what's interest them. So I know what they do and stuff like,

87
00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:15.570
I think I'm in shape. And then the next thing you know,

88
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.740
you think you're in shape and then you start having like Ralphie and start

89
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:20.880
throwing punches at me.

90
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.520
It's like a fight and I can't punch back when I got to avoid.

91
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.370
And then two rounds go by and he said, whoa, I'm not in shape.

92
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.740
I meant in the bag, six round, I'm doing this three,

93
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:31.680
five round six I'm jumping rope. And then I do two rounds.

94
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.130
Somebody is a whole different psychological preparation. And whoo.

95
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.610
How much time has gone.

96
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.700
<v 1>Since you first started exercising? Like when did it, when did it start?</v>

97
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.910
So here we are with like August 23rd or something like that. 22nd.

98
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.590
When did, when did it start?

99
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.900
<v 3>It had to start, um.</v>

100
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.330
<v 1>Something like April, April. So want something in the middle of the lockdown?</v>

101
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.570
Yeah. So you just, just started just training.

102
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.380
And now here you are five months later, four months later.

103
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.240
How, how far away do you think you are to being in like fighting shape?

104
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.030
<v 3>Oh, fighting shape when the time comes like by, um, November 28th. Yeah.</v>

105
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.710
That's when he'd be ready. Exactly.

106
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.990
<v 1>Now, did you guys decide to move it?</v>

107
00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:22.900
You were supposed to be in September where I was born. I believe two other.

108
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.830
<v 3>Viewing, um, situation, um,</v>

109
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.530
at the proper timing for more people.

110
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.720
<v 1>For audiences or something of that.</v>

111
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.100
<v 3>Nature. It's so exciting so often because, um,</v>

112
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.570
it's going to be, um,

113
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.310
me and everyone else that's involved arrows and anyone innovation.

114
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.061
Then we go to, um,

115
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:47.080
start off the legends only league and that's going to be really, um,

116
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.200
breathtaking, especially starting off with me and Roy. Yeah.

117
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.730
And I'm looking forward to that because I have athletes from every gentleman.

118
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.910
It's a Ray of everybody who was,

119
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.040
who believed that someone they're all going to come back in all fields and this

120
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:07.570
is going to be something that mean, um, arrows intervention created together.

121
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.060
And I think this is going to be pretty awesome. So.

122
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.880
<v 1>Legends only league will be like all sports, baseball, basketball.</v>

123
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.750
<v 3>Yeah. Yeah. I think mandolin and crazy.</v>

124
00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:21.370
Like we did with Billie Jean King to have somebody else say one of two

125
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.920
somebody playing McEnroe and that kind of stuff,

126
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.230
exhibitions and stuff like that.

127
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.150
If somebody like I'm a man of war can play one-on-one with

128
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.830
whoever I was in with somebody, I mean many peace men of war,

129
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.753
the horse.

130
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.940
<v 1>Metta world peace. Yeah. No, it's, it's an amazing idea.</v>

131
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.140
But particularly for you,

132
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.100
like seeing you hit the bag again and seeing you hit the pads and get excited

133
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.280
about it, it was very, very interesting to me because, uh,

134
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.340
I knew that you had that thing in your head where you did want to ignite your

135
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:58.660
ego and then you had this quote that the gods of war reignited, your ego.

136
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:04.270
<v 3>I read that. I got so excited. Well, that's the excuse I can use.</v>

137
00:08:04.271 --> 00:08:07.060
Yeah, really great excuse that I can use.

138
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.400
<v 4>Episodes of the Joe Rogan experience are now free on Spotify. That's right.</v>
