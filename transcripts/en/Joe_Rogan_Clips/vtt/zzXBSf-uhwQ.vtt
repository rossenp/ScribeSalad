1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>Wrong weight class. Yeah, absolutely. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.640
one thing to fight Conor at one 70,

3
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:10.590
but Rory's giant one 70 and he's also training with GSP

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.020
and just Tri-Star and I'm a giant fan of Foracia hobby and what he's managed to

5
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.490
put together up there in Montreal,

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.360
they just have a camp it's a such an elite camp, you know,

7
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:25.500
it's just a different, different level of, uh, of, uh,

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.570
just well-rounded fighters. It's a phenomenal, yeah.

9
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.480
<v 1>Phenomenal, phenomenal coach. One of my favorites,</v>

10
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.430
one of my favorite coaches see.

11
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.210
<v 0>Nate fight. Poria I'm excited to see Nate back. You know, I was,</v>

12
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.240
I was wondering, I was like, man, it's been like two years. Yeah.

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.650
I was surprised he took the fight.

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.700
And then I was also surprised that he was mad that they were doing a Conor vs.

15
00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:47.534
Khabib.

16
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.340
<v 2>I didn't expect that at all. They were.</v>

17
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.940
<v 0>Both mad. Dustin's mad too. I was like, what the? You guys? I had four. Well,</v>

18
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:53.240
I thought.

19
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.700
<v 2>Dustin was going to wait for the, you know, to get his title shot.</v>

20
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.620
But I guess that probably makes sense, man.

21
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.300
<v 0>He might not have got that title shot though. Tony Ferguson's healing up,</v>

22
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.170
you know, he's back in the mix who knows what's going to happen with, uh,

23
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.670
James Vick when, uh, James Vick is gonna fight 'em uh, Justin Gagey

24
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.090
VIX on, I think at 10 or 11 fight.

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.360
<v 3>Wind street. Yeah. That'll wait something crazy. Like the 55 pounds</v>

26
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.440
stacked, stacked weight class, man.

27
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.040
<v 0>You know, and then you still have so many guys that are,</v>

28
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:28.340
that are coming up that are, you know, like one or two fights away.

29
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.400
Then of course you got Kevin Lee, who,

30
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.150
in my opinion has the best argument for the next title shot. He's.

31
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.300
<v 2>A monster was a monster. His last fight. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.970
<v 0>So it's him, Tony Ferguson when Tony's healthy again,</v>

33
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.700
Tony's not a hundred percent healthy, but I mean, Dustin,

34
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.540
I think it's right to take that fight because he's not the most compelling guy I

35
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:51.500
know he wants to, but he just got knocked out by Michael Johnson a year ago.

36
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.570
You know what I mean? It's, there's, there's a lot,

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.830
maybe a little bit more than a year ago, but it's like still,

38
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.840
and then you got to remember what Johnson,

39
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.310
when Johnson fought Khabib could be Malden. I mean, there's a lot of,

40
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.260
a lot of people in that way class. Yeah.
