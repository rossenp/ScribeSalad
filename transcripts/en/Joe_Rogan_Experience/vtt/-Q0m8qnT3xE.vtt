00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 1>Norm MacDonald at one point was a handsome guy,</v>

3
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:08.640
but he lived on a farm with his grandpa in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:10.800
So I don't think he got the handsome love.

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.290
<v 2>Yeah, he's a great guy. He's my hero. I love him to death.</v>

6
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.410
<v 1>Well, maybe one of the funniest guys on the planet, David tell norm,</v>

7
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.000
and that this, something.

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.490
<v 2>About those two national treasures. I agree.</v>

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.170
<v 1>And, and the fact that he's not like the biggest comic of all time is weird.</v>

10
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.820
Well, here's to us, I guess.

11
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.860
<v 2>The comics, I mean, he's not the biggest,</v>

12
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:34.580
but the comics he's on the Mount Rushmore keeps getting bigger.

13
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.510
Foreheads is not a good enough not to stop using that thing. Yeah.

14
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:42.080
It's a bad thing to say the Mount Rushmore, but uh, in the hall of fame,

15
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.080
hall of fame, there you go. Yeah. He's in the hall of fame.

16
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.650
<v 1>You got another level where he's invented certain things. I never knew,</v>

17
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:52.280
like he's, he's taken common to this higher point, which I didn't know existed.

18
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.373
Like I wish.

19
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.250
<v 2>Well example another guy too, that still does real comedy. Like he,</v>

20
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.080
when he goes on stage, he's still, he's ballsy. Yeah. He's swings. Right?

21
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.220
Like, Hey, and he gets confused if everybody's mad, like what's happening. Yeah.

22
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.020
Just a joke here. Folks.

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.260
<v 1>Was, he's a, I don't want, you don't have to pull this up. Cause it's long.</v>

24
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:14.330
But there was a radio show, like a morning show,

25
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:18.380
like you have to do on the road for press and he's doing one. And he's like,

26
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.460
well, you know, black people, they're poor. And the lady is like, Oh my God,

27
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:25.400
how can you say that norm? That is so racist. Like, I'm not,

28
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.940
I'm reading the newspaper. I'm watching the news. I'm looking at the stats.

29
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.270
They're poor. And she's like, Oh my God. And all these black women calling,

30
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.260
they go Norm's right. We're poor. It sucks. And he's like, you see, you see,

31
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.340
it was such a great moment. What radio show was that? It's on YouTube.

32
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:43.100
I don't know. It was just some Dick. Listen, TJ's in the morning, you know?

33
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.400
<v 2>Oh,</v>

34
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.630
one of things don't like him doing things when he was doing his Netflix show.

35
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.440
Oh,

36
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.070
one specifically did not want him doing interviews because he got on the Howard

37
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:55.370
stern show. And he wanted to say, well,

38
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:58.700
if you think that way you're retarded, but he didn't,

39
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.170
he didn't want to be offensive. So,

40
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.510
well you think that you must have down syndrome.

41
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.350
He thought that'd be the better thing to say. I guess everybody is.

42
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.480
I'm not sure everybody started freaking out like that. He said that. Right.

43
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.090
Instead he thought he was like covered his tracks.

44
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.193
<v 0>Right.</v>

45
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.350
<v 2>So he couldn't do interviews after that. Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.900
<v 1>He's brilliant. I mean the little things like the,</v>

47
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.190
he's just one of those guys who describes the most basic that we all know.

48
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.080
But it's funny when he, cause he points it out.

49
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.630
Like his Letterman set the last Letterman when he goes, uh, yeah.

50
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.140
Germany decided to attack the world in hell and you're like, that's so true.

51
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:39.410
And then he goes, who do you think you are? Mars? I mean, it's just so funny.

52
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:42.200
Those little things where he's just telling you facts and it's funny.

53
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.250
<v 2>Yeah. Well, he's a, he's a unique dude. You know,</v>

54
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.220
there's a lot of unique people in this, uh, weird art form. Have.

55
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.410
<v 0>You hung out with him? Yeah. I've hung out with him. I.</v>

56
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.490
<v 2>Hung out with him twice. Accidentally on two separate occasions,</v>

57
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.500
the air planes I told you about it. I heard.

58
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.980
<v 1>They are the one of them and was, yeah.</v>

59
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 2>That's hilarious. Soon as he landed,</v>

60
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.930
he was talking about how great it was to quit smoking. As soon as he landed,

61
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:06.550
he ran into the gift shop and bought cigarettes.

62
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:08.920
It was lighting them before he was on his way out the door. I go,

63
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.640
I thought you quit. He goes, I did talking about it. I want her to smoke. Yeah.

64
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:15.310
He just does what he wants to feel. On two occasions,

65
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:19.500
I was sitting next to him on a plane catch new episodes of the Joe Rogan
