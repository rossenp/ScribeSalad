00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.640
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience when by oxen came along,</v>

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.630
boxing was my first love, you know, I,

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.930
I got distracted by the music game because of, I mean,

4
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:16.490
by boxing because of the music game, I always wanted to be a boxer,

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.180
but it wasn't any gyms and Phil fraud, you know,

6
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:23.660
so I always said to myself, if I ever make it,

7
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.130
I want to build a boxing gym, a recreation center in my hood,

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.570
and that's what I'd done.

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.760
And shortly after I'd done that had the opportunity to go in the gym

10
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:39.350
and I started watching the amateurs and I just kind of fell in love with boxing

11
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.190
all over again. And which ultimately led me.

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.170
I pray for a champion, everything I tried to accomplish in life,

13
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:53.060
always exercise, prayer. It worked for me. So I prayed for a champion.

14
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.223
And, um,

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.170
I set up a meeting with Mike Tyson in Las Vegas, and I went to Las Vegas.

16
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.870
This had to be 99 or 2000. So,

17
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.680
you know, I knew a friend that knew Mike and Mike, you know,

18
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:13.990
accepted the invitation because he was familiar with my movement where rap,

19
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.930
Ralph alive was concerned. And I flew out there, uh,

20
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.970
with my focus on Mike and man, I walked into him spawn, and I was like,

21
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.720
you know, I was on cloud nine. Cause I had never saw him, you know,

22
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:28.940
in person spoil. And it was always at a fight.

23
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.200
And I walked in and he would throw in leather with another heavyweight.

24
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.200
And I was like starstruck.

25
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.250
And in the midst of watching this Sporn, uh,

26
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.200
Floyd Mayweather came in a gym and flawed, you know, I didn't know who he was.

27
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.940
He kept coming to him and yo Jay, yo, Jay, uh, man, I know, I know,

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.390
I know about your group, you know, he's calling groups out and I'm like, Oh,

29
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:58.370
okay. Thanks bro. Thanks bro. I'm zeroing back in on Mike. Boom, boom,

30
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.880
boom flaw. Come over again. It was just, Hey yo, Jay, yo, man.

31
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.820
I know about this group here, man. And in Jay,

32
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.130
if you want to do something later on, you know, this is my number,

33
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:11.540
I'll come pick you up. I'm like, all right, bro. Okay. Focus on Mike.

34
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.380
I don't know who Florida is. Right? So afterwards, you know,

35
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.970
me and Mike go to his house to have the meeting that I came to have because my

36
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:23.360
objective was to become his manager, to be on his management team.

37
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.490
And he and I met for an while.

38
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:28.940
He got his ex wife on the phone and you know,

39
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:33.530
I was pretty much convinced I was on the team after the meeting and everything

40
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:37.970
took place and uh, you know, hung with him all night. The next day,

41
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.700
uh, I tried to reach Mike and I couldn't reach Mike and I was left, uh,

42
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.570
Florida nom. And I asked my friend, I said, who, who number is,

43
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.560
is this number right here? He said, Oh, that's flora Mayweather.

44
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.960
The 130 pound champion. So bam,

45
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:58.880
a red light went off in my head because pray for a champion long story short me

46
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.040
and was in business together less than a week. That's how his manager,

47
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.220
you didn't even know who he was. I didn't know no idea.

48
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.140
<v 1>It was when he was pretty boy Floyd. Yeah. That was before money Mayweather.</v>

49
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.710
Is that yeah, he had a totally different style back then too.

50
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.070
He was much more aggressive. Went for the knockout war.

51
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.260
<v 0>Yeah. Well I think he used his legs a lot more then,</v>

52
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:26.340
but if he saw the opportunity, he definitely went in for the kill. But you know,

53
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:30.120
his whole image was different before I came about.

54
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.380
<v 1>Well, he had a lot of hand problems, right? Like he's had several hand breaks.</v>

55
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.220
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I don't know about a break, but I know, uh,</v>

56
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.170
we eventually had to get a specialist to wrap his hands because you

57
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:44.850
know, he would hurt him a lot. Yeah.

58
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.120
<v 1>Yeah. And do you think that affected his style? Is that like,</v>

59
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.600
cause he developed a very defensive style as he got older.

60
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.720
<v 0>Um, I think that's a part of a confidence. I think that's a part of, uh,</v>

61
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.840
evolve. And as a fighter, you know, in the beginning,

62
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.960
I think Florida uses legs much more,

63
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.430
but as he evolved with experience, he got comfortable, you know,

64
00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:12.480
with B roll and defense. Yeah. Greatest defense of all time. Oh man.

65
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.003
Yeah. I agree.

66
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.680
<v 1>I had my friend Andrew Schultz on here yesterday. We were talking about it.</v>

67
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.190
We were like, he might've got hit hard four times in his career,

68
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.320
which is insane. 50 and Oh, and got tagged four times,

69
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.600
which is unthinkable. No.

70
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.070
<v 0>He was amazing. But his work ethic is amazing. You know, the guy I got to work,</v>

71
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.020
you know, I've had an opportunity to like witness a lot of fighters, work ethic,

72
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.210
Andre Ward's and Florida.

73
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.230
Maywell the work ethic is unlike any fight I ever saw.

74
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.720
<v 1>Yeah. You don't get there without it. Exactly.</v>

75
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.720
Because there's so many talented people to so many athletic people.

76
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.860
There's so many fierce dudes, but to be a champion. Yeah.

77
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.150
You need everything. You need gifts. You need athletic gifts.

78
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:59.250
You need a sharp mind. You need a,

79
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:04.050
a passion for the technical aspects of the game, but you gotta have that ethic.

80
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.680
If you don't have that work ethic, you don't, you never keep it going. You, you,

81
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.160
you always fall short of your expectations and without naming any names,

82
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.910
we all know those champions that could have been great,

83
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.310
but they got fat in between camps and they just never trained as

84
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:22.980
hard as they should've. And yeah, I mean,

85
00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:25.860
some of the all-time great suffered from it. Like Roberto Duran,

86
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:29.400
after he beat sugar, Ray, Leonard, and sugar,

87
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:34.110
I knew it capitalized on it and forced a quick rematch when he knew that

88
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:37.710
Duran was fat. Duran is partying and drinking and yeah,

89
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.600
a guy like Floyd Mayweather never did that. Nah, never got out of shape.

90
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.190
<v 0>Man. He would, you know,</v>

91
00:05:44.191 --> 00:05:48.960
Florida was a type of fighter that would party with everybody, but no drinking,

92
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.700
no smoking. You sit back and watch and observe the whole movement.

93
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.030
<v 1>I remember watching a video of him leaving a club in Vegas.</v>

94
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.570
It showed him at the club hanging out with everybody,

95
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.520
leaving the club at two in the morning running.

96
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.530
<v 0>Oh yeah. We used to do that all the time. Yeah. Regular pants on.</v>

97
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.630
We would watch fights together. And right after the fight, he was ready to run.

98
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:11.590
Yo Jay, yo,

99
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.070
ain't nobody gonna kiss me slipping on the way they can beat you as catch you

100
00:06:15.071 --> 00:06:17.200
out of shape. They ain't gonna catch me slipping,

101
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.150
take off running down the strip.

102
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:20.643
<v 1>It's amazing.</v>

103
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.780
And having his brother or having his uncle Roger and

104
00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:27.580
having his father, you know,

105
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.660
two world-class fighters and having grown up,

106
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:33.010
seeing these guys,

107
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.360
seeing his uncle when Roger Mayweather was a champion,

108
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.520
he had a vicious style.

109
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.770
He was his right hand was a thing of beauty. I mean, people forgot.

110
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:47.260
Like I was watching some Roger Mayweather fights the other day.

111
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.770
And to have his father, a guy who gave sugar, Ray Leonard,

112
00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:53.620
a hell of a fight yet there's so much talent,

113
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.700
so much knowledge and understanding of boxing in that family to grow up with

114
00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:58.030
that.

115
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.020
And to have that mindset like Floyd has always observing and watching everything

116
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.050
that dude just absorbed everything.

117
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.500
<v 0>Well. Yeah. And not only watching, he had to spar with Roger.</v>

118
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.050
So you talking about, you know,

119
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:15.310
having to learn how to protect yourself against the best as a kid.

120
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.830
So, you know, he had access to a lot of power and evidently, you know,

121
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.800
there's no doubt about it. It benefited him in a major way.

122
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.860
<v 1>When you met Floyd, who was the 130 pound champion.</v>

123
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.700
And did you just immediately started working with him?

124
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.660
<v 0>Um, yeah, but it was a process and it was, um,</v>

125
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.570
it wasn't easy because I came into a situation where his

126
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:45.130
father and his uncle was his manager and I wasn't embraced,

127
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.340
uh, you know, with, with love, you know,

128
00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:53.320
because they kind of felt like I was imposing on

129
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:54.010
a situation.

130
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:58.930
He had a $12 million contract on the table at the time I came in that

131
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.480
everybody wanted him to sign and a flaw called a contract,

132
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:08.320
a slave contract before I came, but they blame me,

133
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.430
but him calling him the contract, a slave contract. So.

134
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.640
<v 1>The provisions in the contract that he didn't like.</v>

135
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.530
<v 0>Well, he, he just thought 12 million wasn't enough. You know what I mean?</v>

136
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.950
And uh, you know, ultimately I had to, uh,

137
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.070
go in and do some damage control.

138
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.420
And one of the things that I told him when, you know, when I met him, I said,

139
00:08:31.421 --> 00:08:32.740
if I can't make this better,

140
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.570
I don't want to eat off of your 12 million that already been offered to you.

141
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:42.430
So I had an opportunity to have a meeting with said, Abraham, you know,

142
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:46.330
at the time was the, uh, the president of, uh, HBO.

143
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.420
And I pretty much just asked the guy, you know,

144
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:54.100
how could we get around this $12 million contract?

145
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.810
How can I, uh, make this a bigger contract?

146
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:02.520
And at the time he told me about the fighter named Diego Corellis.

147
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:07.980
He was like, you know, if you all would be willing to fight Diego Corollas,

148
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.170
then this could jump up to 35 million or so if y'all was able to beat Diego

149
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.610
Corrales. And, um, you know, that was interesting to me. You know,

150
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:22.110
I went home and done some due diligence on Diego Corvallis at the time.

151
00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:25.860
And at that particular time, Diego had, uh,

152
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.450
jumped on his ex wife and kind of beat up.

153
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.680
He had charges, you know, uh, kind of done her pretty bad,

154
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.520
but bad to the extent where he was facing jail time. And,

155
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.900
and I saw that and I went back to Florida. I say, flawed. I said,

156
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:47.670
it's a perfect time to fight da go corral. As I said, I even have a,

157
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.870
a marketing tool.

158
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:52.410
We can whip him for every battle woman in the United States of America.

159
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.870
So he heard me out, but he wasn't embracing it. No, no, no, no, no, no,

160
00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:01.120
no. Jay, anytime to do that right now. No, no, no, no.

161
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.790
So he didn't want to fight Diego because Diego skillset, well, you know,

162
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.060
I don't want to say flaw was scared, but at the time, you know,

163
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:11.760
everybody thought Diego could beat Florida.

164
00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:16.650
He was like 30 and over 29 knockouts jail was a wild man. Yeah. Diego was,

165
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.480
he was a knockout artist and he just felt like it wasn't the time I

166
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.810
talked to him for like four hours and couldn't convince him.

167
00:10:24.811 --> 00:10:29.490
So I decided to go home and I went home about six in the morning

168
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:34.660
and I woke up about 11 in the morning with a message from him. Yo,

169
00:10:34.661 --> 00:10:39.660
yo Jay a to you, you know, as my manager and uh, you think I should fight him.

170
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:44.430
I fight him. So it was Dan where, you know, I was celebrating, come like,

171
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.650
Whoa, we finna get Diego.

172
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.510
So I called the people at HBO and they told me they didn't

173
00:10:51.511 --> 00:10:56.310
have a date. They wouldn't have a date to a next year or something like that.

174
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.090
And it was then I decided to use, uh,

175
00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:04.470
some of my record label, uh, talent. You know,

176
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:08.910
I had to build my record company without having video without having

177
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:12.120
radio, you know, just pulling publicity stunts.

178
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.080
So I told Florida, I say, here's what we're gonna do. Uh,

179
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:20.760
Lennox Lewis and David tool was fighting at the, at the Mandalay Bay.

180
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.040
I say during the press conference, um, here in Diego's post cognitive fight,

181
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.240
I say, during the press conference, we're going to surround Diego.

182
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.700
My head of home is the surround Diego.

183
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.590
And I want you to come and just push him and, and we're going to stop the fight,

184
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.930
right? We just, ain't going to end. Ain't gonna be no free fight,

185
00:11:39.931 --> 00:11:43.050
but you go and get your push in on him. We're going to stop it.

186
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.950
We're going to steal the show. That was my objective. And, um,

187
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.620
that came to fruition. You know,

188
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:54.190
we went and stole the show at the press conference. That was night, Sunday.

189
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:59.110
We was on the front page of the, uh, Las Vegas time. And you know,

190
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:02.080
Monday or Tuesday I'll call them and they say, Oh, we got a date for you.

191
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.240
<v 1>Uh, I love that you telling me this because I always wonder,</v>

192
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.820
I always wonder when I see those kinds of altercations,

193
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.290
how many of those are coordinated by a wise man who understands

194
00:12:13.291 --> 00:12:17.970
publicity? Quite a few. Wouldn't you?

195
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:19.830
