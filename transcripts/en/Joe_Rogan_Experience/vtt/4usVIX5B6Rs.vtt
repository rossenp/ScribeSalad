00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience matter.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 1>Now, I don't know either vaccines, you know? Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.190
<v 2>I'm excited. Um, I like the vaccines. I,</v>

4
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.590
I am vaccinated. Um,

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.540
the problem that a lot of people have is that this was

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.550
fast tracked and they get nervous about they do

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.840
possible potential side effects and we don't know what those are going to be.

8
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:29.240
And then there's a lot of people that are very uncomfortable with the idea of

9
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.250
getting very sick after they take the vaccine,

10
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:34.190
which seems to happen with 80% of the people that take it.

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.340
And so they're concerned about that, right?

12
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.180
<v 1>80% Of people who are taking this vaccine, that's not what I heard. Well,</v>

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.750
that's what bill Gates has said. Bill Gates. Yeah. I don't know. I mean,

14
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:49.100
I don't know. I don't know if we can look it up, pull it off of, I know. Yeah.

15
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.130
<v 2>It's weird when people say that people like, wait, what? Um,</v>

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.150
it's on my Instagram,

17
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.580
there's a interview with bill Gates where he's talking about,

18
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.770
I believe this is the Madonna vaccine.

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.690
The Pfizer vaccine has a very similar effect because it's, um, the way this,

20
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.120
uh, M RNA vaccine works,

21
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.830
they've taken the common cold vaccine and added this to it.

22
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.250
So your body develops these proteins to fight off, but you get sick.

23
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.660
<v 1>I mean, well, I can say, I don't know, you know, I mean,</v>

24
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:22.490
I I've read the sort of report the readout from Pfizer and Madonna BioNTech.

25
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.210
Um, and they said there were very few serious side effects. I mean,

26
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:30.320
I don't know if it's a serious or not. I mean, I got the flu shot, you know, um,

27
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.900
whenever it was a couple of months ago and you know,

28
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:36.110
my arm hurt for a couple of days. And then that was the shot site.

29
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.130
I wouldn't do it just for,

30
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.860
that's just the injections that your body didn't feel bad. Right.

31
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:43.280
But it was fine, you know, I felt, okay, this is different than that. Um,

32
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.143
this is different.

33
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.980
<v 2>And there's, uh, there's consequences to taking this.</v>

34
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:50.060
And I'm not saying that I won't take it. I will, if it's safe,

35
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.710
I will encourage other people to take it too.

36
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.930
But there's a reality of taking this particular vaccine that it's going

37
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.370
to make a lot of people feel like. And it'll last a couple of days. And look,

38
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.720
you can play, play that video. Oh, okay.

39
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.130
But it's in the, it's in the feed. It's in the, I G T V.

40
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:13.250
But if you just go to my Instagram feed from the last time, uh,

41
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.870
the Dylan Jones episode, um, it's,

42
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.090
uh, it's, that's just what it is.

43
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.690
<v 0>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.650
<v 2>Hold up. You went way too far. Go, go way up, way up.</v>

45
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.380
Hold on, keep going.

46
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.960
<v 0>Wait a minute. Did they remove it? I didn't see it.</v>

47
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.640
<v 2>Oh my God. Did they remove it from my Instagram? Is that real?</v>

48
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.620
Holy, dude. That is crazy. Hold on. Let me check.

49
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.030
Cause that's kind of crazy if they removed it from my Instagram,

50
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:51.560
that's kind of crazy because this was a,

51
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.730
I believe it was an NBC interview.

52
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.010
<v 0>Oh, they removed it. Wow.</v>

53
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 1>Okay. Well, here, here, I got, I got an article from.</v>

54
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.680
<v 2>From science. It says, uh,</v>

55
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.730
there's fever and aches that are intense in some cases,

56
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.320
but not dangerous. It found. Okay. Okay. It hasn't been removed that. Okay,

57
00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:17.250
here we go. Here's why don't I find it? I don't know. It was a month ago.

58
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.520
She says October 28th. Right? Okay. But

59
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.240
this video is edited though. Remember how so? No, no,

60
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.760
no, no, no, no, no. That's a totally different video.

61
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:31.140
That's a totally different video.

62
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.670
That video was the video where people were talking about, uh,

63
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:40.500
that bill Gates is concerned with the profit margin from vaccines,

64
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.680
but that is, we should talk about that too, because that's actually important.

65
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.800
That's actually important because that's really distorted and that's not what he

66
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:49.280
was saying at all. He was not talking about profits.

67
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.290
<v 3>Turning. We looked after the second dose,</v>

68
00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:56.970
at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side

69
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:00.480
effect ranging from severe chills to fevers.

70
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.620
So are these vaccines safe?

71
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.650
<v 1>Well, the, uh,</v>

72
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.230
the FDA not being pressured will look

73
00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:17.490
hard at that. The FDA is the gold standard of regulators, uh,

74
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.530
and their current guidance on this. If they stick with that is, is very,

75
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:27.240
very appropriate. Uh, and you know, it,

76
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.350
that the, the, the side effects were not super severe. That is,

77
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:35.250
it didn't cause permanent health problems for, uh,

78
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.840
the things that they, you know, Madrona did have to go with a fairly high dose.

79
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:43.680
And so, uh, you know, to get the antibodies,

80
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.050
some of the other vaccines, uh,

81
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.460
are going able to go with lower doses to get, uh,

82
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.380
responses that are, are pretty high, including the J and J and the Pfizer.

83
00:04:55.381 --> 00:05:00.300
And so there's a lot of characteristics of these vaccines. Um,

84
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.300
it's great that we have multiple of them, uh,

85
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.730
that are going out there and you got a site.

86
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.380
<v 3>You know, the data better than I do,</v>

87
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.030
but the bill bill that the data that everybody with a high dose had a side

88
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:12.864
effect.

89
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.570
<v 1>Yeah. But some of that is, is not dramatic where, you know, it's just, you know,</v>

90
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.610
super painful, but yes, there,

91
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.320
we need to make sure there's not severe side effects the FDA. Uh,

92
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.120
I, I, I think we'll do a good job of that. Uh, despite the pressure.

93
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.150
<v 3>How many doses of the vaccine will we need?</v>

94
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.940
<v 1>Well,</v>

95
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.870
none of the vaccines at this point appear like they'll work with a single dose.

96
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:44.340
That was the, the hope at the very beginning. Uh,

97
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.730
maybe one of them, particularly in the second generation won't surprise us.

98
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:52.590
We hope just too, although in the elderly sometimes, uh, it,

99
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.030
it takes more. And,

100
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.070
and so making sure we have lots of elderly people in trial will.

101
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 2>Give us that data. No. So that is still on the second. Yeah.</v>

102
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.920
If that is all it is, it's just, you,

103
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.220
you have severe chills and you feel like for a couple of days,

104
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.140
that is way better than getting the Corona virus and risking the potential death

105
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.070
and side effects and, you know,

106
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.310
long haul people experiencing blood clots. And if it's better than that.

107
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:21.110
Yeah. But it's just not, it's not a free ride.

108
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:23.590
<v 1>So I should, I just, I just want to get the numbers of what I see here from,</v>

109
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.400
from science is that, uh, the, the sort of fatigue, you know,

110
00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:29.590
that you were talking about feel shift for two days,

111
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.650
they did about 10% of people had had the side effects.

112
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.710
<v 2>Hold on a second, but why is bill Gates saying 80%?</v>

113
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.540
<v 1>I, she was saying, it's some side effect comes in 80%. Right.</v>

114
00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:44.770
But like what you were talking about, isn't a subset of the people. Get it.

115
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.180
<v 2>Well, well, hold on internet,</v>

116
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:51.010
I don't know if that's true because there's many articles about the side effects

117
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.780
of this vaccine.

118
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.530
I've never seen one of them that relegated it to 10% of the population that took

119
00:06:56.531 --> 00:07:00.100
the vaccine. I mean, obviously typically the second dose,

120
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.070
the other thing about this is you have to take to the second dose seems to be

121
00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:04.330
the doozy for people. Right.

122
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.990
<v 1>I guess that's the, that's a tough one. Um, there's something about,</v>

123
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.280
so this is something that's interesting is I have like one set of conversations

124
00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:16.000
with people and they're saying, who's going to be able to get the vaccine, like,

125
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:19.150
how are we going to roll this out? You know, healthcare workers,

126
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:21.160
essential workers, all this other kind of stuff.

127
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.500
And then there's another conversation where people are like,

128
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.370
maybe you're not going to want to get it. Right. And me, I'm like,

129
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.150
I'm really eager, you know, give it to me tomorrow.

130
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.570
I don't even care that the FDA has not done. Why is that? Um,

131
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.690
you're not worried about side effects. Hey, I'm not worried about side effects.

132
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.630
You're not worried about side effects cause fever for a couple of days.

133
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.390
<v 2>I mean, that's what if that's all we know of now? Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:45.490
But look long haul COVID survivors.

135
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:48.040
One of the things they're finding is these people have blood clots, like many,

136
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:50.710
many months later, no serious, serious.

137
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.400
<v 1>Like I, I would really like to not get COVID. Yeah.</v>

138
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:58.960
<v 2>So what if this similar situation with the vaccine,</v>

139
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.430
what does the vaccine,

140
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.940
and this is not outside of the realm of possibility that the vaccine gives some

141
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.490
sort of a side effect that that's unintended.

142
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.260
<v 1>I have a lot of confidence in the basic process here, uh,</v>

143
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.123
with the vaccine develop.

144
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.010
<v 2>This isn't the basic process. This is a completely new process,</v>

145
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.600
much faster than any process that will usually rapid development event.

146
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.430
<v 1>I mean, it's an unusually rapid development because they have this MNR, M R N a.</v>

147
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.360
I don't know what that means. I mean, it's, it's messenger RNA,

148
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.040
but I don't know what it means. Um.

149
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.890
<v 2>Well, it just means that it's trick. It's not giving you, uh, uh,</v>

150
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.330
like a dormant version.

151
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.700
<v 1>There's no virus, right? There's a particle that's specially designed it,</v>

152
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:42.220
triggers antibody is we create them. Um,

153
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.230
and so I think the basic antibody immune response situation is fairly well

154
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:48.820
understood scientifically.

155
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.000
It's why we're pretty confident that the people who've recovered, you know,

156
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:53.410
are immune that, you know,

157
00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:58.260
younger and healthier people in cases are okay. If they get sick,

158
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.490
they get better. Um, so to me, like, it's a good thing.

159
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.960
I'm all for it. I'll take it, I'll get the fever, but I'm also not.

160
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.700
I want to walk the line. Like I want to encourage people to take vaccines,

161
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.260
like as a responsible person, but also knowing that the supplies will be short.

162
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.080
If somebody doesn't want it, like somebody else will take that dose.

163
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.350
<v 2>But you know, one of the best things, uh,</v>

164
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:28.250
in terms of outcomes is vitamin D

165
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.800
vitamin D deficiencies are a huge part of negative COVID outcomes.

166
00:09:33.801 --> 00:09:34.940
And that one.

167
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.280
<v 1>In one study, some people, some studies.</v>

168
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.540
<v 2>About that. Yeah. One study,</v>

169
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:42.320
84% of the people that were in the ICU had deficient levels of vitamin C and

170
00:09:42.321 --> 00:09:45.230
only 4% had sufficient levels of vitamin D.

171
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.910
Vitamin D is a huge problem. And it's not just a vitamin, it's a hormone.

172
00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:52.250
You know, when, when Jay Mackey was on the other day,

173
00:09:52.251 --> 00:09:54.520
he was trying to say that it's a precursor to hormones.

174
00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:56.630
So I'd have to look it up. That's not true. It's a hormone.

175
00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.350
Vitamin D is actually a hormone. And it's weird cause we call it a vitamin,

176
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:01.940
but it regulates so many things in the body.

177
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:04.040
And it has a significant impact on the immune system.

178
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.490
But you never hear anybody telling you to supplement with vitamin D.

179
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.350
You're not seeing this from any of the leaders,

180
00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:11.180
any of these politicians that are shutting things down,

181
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.190
even Fowchee has said it recently that vitamin D does seem to have a pretty

182
00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:17.060
significant impact,

183
00:10:17.061 --> 00:10:21.650
but health experts like people that study like the mechanisms of

184
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.940
disease and vitamin supplementation, like particularly Dr.

185
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.880
Rhonda Patrick had a thing on her Twitter,

186
00:10:28.881 --> 00:10:33.800
we should publish a study that showed positive outcomes and COVID vitamin D is

187
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:38.150
a huge factor. Catch new episodes of the Joe Rogan experience for free.
