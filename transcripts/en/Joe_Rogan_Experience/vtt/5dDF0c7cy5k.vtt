<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.900
What is your perspective on the big bang D D D there's a lot of people's

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.560
views vary depending upon like what,

4
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:12.840
what the most recent theories are. Yeah.

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
But some people believe that the universe started with the big bang and some

6
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:20.340
people believe that it's always existed and there's,

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.320
it's a continuing cycle of big bangs, endless expansion,

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.010
and then ultimately contraction. And then it starts all over again.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
And that there's infinite numbers of big bangs that are occurring through

10
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:36.760
multiverses, various universes, all over the world or all over the.

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.720
<v 1>Right.</v>

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.930
So I'm reading this book right now called the end of everything by a friend of

13
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:44.120
mine, Katie Mac wrote it. It's about the end of the universe.

14
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.250
And that's really cool. It talks about exactly what you're saying.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.270
So there was a big bang. You can see it actually in the cosmic background,

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.650
radiation, there's this microwave and isotropy, it's like,

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.790
everything's not uniform. And you can see that it's like two or three degrees.

18
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.750
Calvin it's really cold. So the question is, does it, does it explode?

19
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:07.550
And then does it shrink the big crunch, you know, does it come back? And, um,

20
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.030
they think there's this stuff called dark energy. So does it continue expanding?

21
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.390
And she calls it heat decay or this other,

22
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.270
one's the big rip where it just keeps on expanding, accelerating,

23
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:22.040
and like even electrons can't everything just disintegrates into nothing.

24
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.820
Um, and no one knows what's going to happen, but the really cool thing,

25
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:29.840
I was just reading the chapter about as it expands super fast,

26
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.860
um, I forgot the name of it. It's Boltzmann's brain or something.

27
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:37.730
There's some weird thing where, because of quantum physics,

28
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.680
which is completely not understandable,

29
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:42.650
if you say you understand quantum mechanics, you don't, um,

30
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.440
things can just randomly appear. So if you're,

31
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.150
if the universe is going to be around for trillions of years, like in theory,

32
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.630
at some 0.2 trillion years from now,

33
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.560
Joe Rogan could just suddenly create itself out of nothing in the universe.

34
00:01:57.561 --> 00:01:59.210
And you'd like, look around and go, wow, what's going on?

35
00:01:59.211 --> 00:02:02.090
And then you'd disappear instantly because of quantum mechanics. So that's,

36
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.050
it's a really what, yeah, it's explain that again. So the,

37
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.130
the theory is you could have an entire universe just because of quantum

38
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.020
mechanics, which is, um, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, right? You don't,

39
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.450
you can't know position and velocity.

40
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.980
You can only know one or the other and an extension of that. Again, man,

41
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.410
I'm just a fighter pilot. I'm not a physicist, but you can,

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.510
things can just suddenly appear somewhere. And so given enough time,

43
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.280
even though it's highly unlikely,

44
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.420
this water bottle could create itself out of nothing, just because of physics.

45
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.710
The quantum mechanics. I remember my, uh, teacher at the air force Academy.

46
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.570
We'll use the example of all of the electrons and protons and stuff could

47
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:49.070
suddenly move themselves. And you could just fall through the floor. Now,

48
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.220
the odds of that happening, it ain't going to happen for a trillion years,

49
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.230
but these weird things can happen. And so she, she uses this kind of cheeky,

50
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.030
funny example of, you know,

51
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.390
your brain could just suddenly create itself out of nothing.

52
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.060
And given enough time, the probability would be that.

53
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:08.050
So some people say the whole universe is just this temporary thing that created

54
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:10.930
itself. But I don't know, it was very disconcerting.

55
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.820
<v 0>When you hear them talk about quantum mechanics.</v>

56
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.490
<v 1>That is, you know what I figured relativity.</v>

57
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.900
<v 0>And you started going, wait, what? Exactly?</v>

58
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.420
Two things can exist simultaneously in different places.

59
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.930
And one of them could be in motion. The other one could be still,

60
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.350
and they're the same thing and they appear and disappear. And yeah.

61
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.280
<v 1>What I mean now there's quantum computers. Yeah. That's weird. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.820
Do you understand that? No, I don't think no. I,

63
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.500
I spoke at a conference and I followed the quantum computing guy. So,

64
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.380
um, it's cool stuff. Right. You know,

65
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.200
I had guys like Sean Carroll tried to explain it to me on the podcast.

66
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.760
<v 0>It just goes in one of my champions.</v>

67
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.310
<v 1>You and me both, man. I'm like I said, I'm a fighter. I love it.</v>

68
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:55.260
It's cool to learn about it. But, um.

69
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.590
<v 0>It, it does make things,</v>

70
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.820
seem a lot more mystical than, um,

71
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.900
just the standard sort of Newtonian physics

72
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.980
perspective of life and gravity and matter,

73
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:13.260
and carbon based life forms. When you,

74
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:16.500
when you start getting into just listening to what they're talking about when

75
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:20.010
they're talking about quantum weirdness and entanglements and things in

76
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:24.210
superposition, and you're like, wait, w what is the world made of, right? Like,

77
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.980
can you get down to the smallest possible measurement

78
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:30.180
of life?

79
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.320
The S the smallest things that you can measure the world becomes magic yeah.

80
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.980
<v 1>On the smallest scale, and also on the biggest scale. Right.</v>

81
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.230
<v 0>Well, that's the weirdest part about the universe is that I'm</v>

82
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:45.360
inclined, especially as I get older.

83
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:50.310
And I think about things more to think that everything is kind of fractal

84
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.310
and what the universe is probably is,

85
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.540
it's probably a part of some other organism,

86
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.050
some immense organism that's in a universe.

87
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.010
That's impossible for us to comprehend the vastness of it. When, you know,

88
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.850
there was a thing they just did recently where they mapped out, uh, the human,

89
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.140
uh, they're talking about human brain cells and the universe.

90
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.860
And they were talking about the way the universe functions and the universe

91
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:21.750
functions the way it looks like if you do a scan of the universe, right? Like,

92
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:25.740
it looks far too similar to a human brain cell.

93
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.880
<v 1>This is a talk I want to do, Joe. So I saw these patterns from space.</v>

94
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.960
There's this one picture of a river in Indonesia. I took it.

95
00:05:32.961 --> 00:05:35.730
It looks like arteries, like all these blood vessels coming out.

96
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.260
And I remember thinking there's all these patterns that repeat the seashells,

97
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.000
there's these spiral elliptical seashells, and then there's hurricanes. Yeah.

98
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.280
And then there's galaxies. And these,

99
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.570
these patterns repeat from the microscopic to the macroscopic. It's really cool.

100
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.540
It's amazing. Yeah. And I don't understand them all, but they, in images,

101
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:58.160
they they're really cool. Have you seen videos.

102
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.390
<v 0>On fractals where they show you things like the Mandelbrot set and how the, the,</v>

103
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.350
the closer you get to these fractals,

104
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.880
the same sort of pattern repeats itself over and over and over again.

105
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:14.030
And when people, it is one thing to comprehend it,

106
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.510
if someone's explaining it to you in a lecture, but as another thing now,

107
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.370
with the advent of CGI technology,

108
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:23.870
you can see these fractals be repeated over and over and over again. Right.

109
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.990
And the Mandelbrot set is a particularly interesting one because it's so

110
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:31.760
beautiful and weird. And, uh, each, each part of that,

111
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:34.040
as they go deeper in it, see if you can find a video on it.

112
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.780
Cause it's pretty bad Mandel brought, set fractal demonstration.

113
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.760
Um, I know it's on YouTube, but that these, these patterns,

114
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:48.710
if the universe really is a part of an atom, that's in a being right,

115
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.660
or a part of a cell that's in a being that exists in, uh, an, you know,

116
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.230
the idea of infinity too, right. We think of the universe as being massive.

117
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.130
It's 14 billion light. That's not infinite. Right. That's not even close. Right.

118
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.230
14 billion years is like nothing.

119
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.600
<v 1>It's not infinite. No. At all. Um.</v>

120
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.070
<v 0>So this is the Mandelbrot set. Right?</v>

121
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:12.380
And so what these artists have done is as they zoom in the Mandelbrot set,

122
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:15.650
repeats itself over and over and over and over again. And it just,

123
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.240
it becomes the same exact thing at the lowest possible

124
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:24.980
levels of, uh, of, of comprehension. Oh. Or of illustration.

125
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.850
They keep getting closer and closer to it. That's amazing. That's yeah.

126
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:33.880
<v 1>I needed that. I was a math major in college and I learned about fractals,</v>

127
00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:35.350
but they didn't have videos back.

128
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.260
<v 0>Right. But this video to sell this, this would blow you away. Right.</v>

129
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:42.760
Because it shows it to you that in a way that appeals to the brain. Right.

130
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.470
And it's,

131
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:48.880
it's so hard for us to comprehend or to try to illustrate it ourselves.

132
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.090
This is the kind of that you see when you're on psychedelic drugs too.

133
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.720
This is another reason why it makes me worried the mushroom. Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.120
Like if you go on a super trip,

135
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.470
like a real trip where you can't come back for four or five hours,

136
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.890
this is the kind of that you'll see. And it makes you wonder, like,

137
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.440
are you looking at the,

138
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:12.070
the very fabric of the cosmos itself?

139
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.890
<v 1>So I think there's a theory.</v>

140
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.930
String theory is kind of popular for small stuff at what electrons are made out

141
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:23.710
of and in the smallest subatomic level. And if I remember right,

142
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:26.440
10 to the minus 33rd meters, which is pretty small,

143
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.800
but I think that's as small as you can get, like, there's a, there's a,

144
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.150
there is a smallest particle. You can't just keep on going infinitely smaller,

145
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.120
just like you can't go infinitely bigger because the universe is only so big.

146
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.260
So there it is bounded that can't happen forever. Um,

147
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.550
which is pretty well allegedly, but, you know, right. But you know,

148
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:48.460
10 years from now, everything we think we know is going to be disproven.
