00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.040
<v 1>If you ever want to feel what it's like to be like three again,</v>

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.110
make your thumb, wrestle your pinkie, your pinkies, like.

3
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.550
You have no power in the pink, your pinky. So weak.

4
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.550
That's what it's like to be like a three-year-old straining against your older

5
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.560
brother. That's me get off me.

6
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.800
You got a pinky. That's right. This is what a little digit.

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.800
What does that thing get used for? Don't you like?

8
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.010
I hurt my pinky doing that wrestling with my thumb.

9
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.610
Like legitimately it hurts now so weak, but I do so much with my.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.600
<v 0>Chin ups. There's some reason for it.</v>

11
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.390
<v 1>So many kettlebell grips. And it's mostly these other fingers.</v>

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.770
Even when you draw back a bow, my release doesn't even have a pinky thing.

13
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.100
I draw back with these fingers. His just hangs around for the ride.

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.430
<v 0>You're so mean to your pinkie. Why do you do that?</v>

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.930
<v 1>It's weird how weak it is compared to all the other digits.</v>

16
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.090
<v 0>Pinky. It's a, it is a very like, you know.</v>

17
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.580
<v 1>We'll you up with this finger. This finger right here is strong as.</v>

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.530
This finger gets a hold of. This is a strong finger. This is a finger.

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.200
This not hurting anybody we got on the same hand.

20
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.440
<v 0>Listen, everyone belongs in the hand like we have.</v>

21
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.470
<v 1>If you were as strong, physically as your small toe. Wow,</v>

22
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.790
that's great. That's life. Just, everything can you up.

23
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:30.470
Every pebble is murderous.

24
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.840
Every jumping off stairs to Broadway, you stub your toe. You want to die,

25
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.970
but your little baby toe has zero power.

26
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.150
Grab your little baby toe and like wrestle with it quick.

27
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.700
It has nothing to mess. It's a baby. Yeah.

28
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.640
Babies are stronger than your baby toe. Yeah. Well that's a.

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.090
<v 0>Yeah, that would,</v>

30
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.770
that's the funny thing about the human sentience projection and the time it's

31
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:58.700
like, we're probably like the little toe of the universe.
