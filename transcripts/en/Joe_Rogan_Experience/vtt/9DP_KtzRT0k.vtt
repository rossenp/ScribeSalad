00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.780
<v 1>We're here to talk about what the is happening to the restaurant industry during</v>

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:09.690
this pandemic and how crazy it is. Um, you know,

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.370
I I've talked about this before, but having you guys on,

5
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:19.290
so you could say firsthand what it's been like to you and what this experience

6
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:23.520
has been like and how poorly it's been handled. Just,

7
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:25.590
I want to give people a sense of this at home.

8
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.360
What it's like from two men who have made their living in the hospitality and

9
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:34.020
restaurant industry. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you want to.

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.450
<v 0>Well, no, the funny thing is it's like, we're the rule followers.</v>

11
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.420
We're the ones that are used to handling the health department.

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.980
We're the ones that are used to, you know, doing everything that, you know,

13
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:47.510
from a safety standpoint, right.

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.490
And now we're the ones that are being crushed or being picked on.

15
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.420
So to speak by that's the way a lot of people in the industry feel because we're

16
00:00:56.421 --> 00:01:01.280
the ones that are being shut down in a city where a lot of other businesses

17
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.360
are remaining open, like malls, distribution centers,

18
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.590
Markus stores. I mean, you can go to a mall and go shopping.

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.840
You can go on an airplane from LA to New York,

20
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.110
take your mask off and eat and that's okay,

21
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.730
but you can't eat outdoors in a restaurant in LA that's following

22
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.170
social, distancing, all the health guidelines. I mean, we know our business.

23
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.210
And so it's been really hard since what it started, March 15th.

24
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.460
We, we shut down. Um, we were then told to put glass in between our,

25
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.540
our boots. So we did that. We opened for about 10 days. Um,

26
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.810
we did UV lights in the, in the, in the air conditioning systems.

27
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.830
Absolutely. And then we built patios. Um,

28
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.870
I've personally spent $250,000 abiding by the rules that were set forth by

29
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:56.750
the state, by the County, by the governors, by by everybody.

30
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.800
And then it just kind of be shut down is really, really difficult.

31
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.400
And it's not about me and it's not about my restaurant and it's not about John.

32
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.560
It's not about it's about the employees.

33
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.390
It's about the dishwashers and the busboys and the servers that live day to day

34
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.250
on the money that they make at the restaurant. It's their livelihood.

35
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.540
It's how they feed their families.

36
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.500
They send money back to the countries that they came from. You know,

37
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.350
this is a larger issue.

38
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.090
And the reason it's a larger issue is one little restaurant. Like Craig's,

39
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.220
we have 90 employees, a furniture store might have five or six.

40
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.740
So when you shut down an industry like that,

41
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.530
it really has a huge economic impact.

42
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.950
And then it has a social impact because we all love to eat.

43
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.780
It's the one thing we have in common. We like to get together as people.

44
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.670
<v 1>Giant fan of restaurants. I mean,</v>

45
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.180
that's one of my favorite things to do is to go out, to eat and living in LA.

46
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.260
It was so frustrating. It was, it was bizarre. It doesn't make sense.

47
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.630
Now when you guys get the, when they tell you what's shutdown or what's open,

48
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.820
is there anyone you communicate with there?

49
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:07.510
Is there anyone that's involved in government that you have conversations with?

50
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.030
<v 2>That's the biggest issue that we have is they refuse to communicate to any of</v>

51
00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:16.710
us. And I can't quite figure out why we hear about it on the news.

52
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:20.580
We've we've joined with about 40, 30,

53
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:24.480
40 other like main owners. You know, that that are all in the area.

54
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.220
And I think it's the one thing that's kind of a silver lining in all.

55
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:32.280
This is that we've all teamed up to kind of like try to figure out what's going

56
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:36.540
on. But we find out about it from the news and we have to just make these moves

57
00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:40.470
within 24 hours. It's, it's absolutely absurd. And we've reached out.

58
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:43.890
I reached out to Newsome. I reached out to Garcetti and they do nothing.

59
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.220
You know, they, they put you on phony task force. They lie, you know, they,

60
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.720
they, they have no idea how serious this is.

61
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.570
And I commend you for having us on. No one else wants to speak about it.

62
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.040
Everyone's too scared of backlash.

63
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.080
<v 1>Well, what backlash, what?</v>

64
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.200
I don't think they understand it at that level is crumbling.

65
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.360
<v 2>Yeah. I think people are thinking it's black and white.</v>

66
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.820
If you say anything somewhat negative,

67
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.700
they view you as you're anti COVID you're you're,

68
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.490
you're wanting to kill everybody. And that's not the case, right? Yeah.

69
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.150
<v 0>But that's not the issue. So we're not denying that there's an issue.</v>

70
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.890
We're not denying that people are getting sick.

71
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.790
We're not denying that there are, we all are in this together.

72
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:23.700
So how do you do it? Well, how do you do it? Smartly?

73
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.310
Where should we be spending money? Um,

74
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.730
a perfect example is they're doing rapid testing in certain areas.

75
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.420
So instead of losing all of this revenue,

76
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.430
why don't they invest in smart technology that has rapid testing

77
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.690
that allows people to go to a restaurant, get a rapid test, your positive,

78
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.640
your negative. And then you get to go into the restaurant.

79
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.850
<v 1>We did hear today. Exactly. We got rapid test takes a day.</v>

80
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.550
Everyone's a fine where we can sit down and have a conversation.

81
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.130
Have no paranoia. You could do that at a restaurant.

82
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:56.790
You could have the one I was telling you about Stubb's barbecue here in Austin,

83
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:01.590
where Dave Chappelle and I have been doing, we do 400 seats. We test everyone.

84
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:05.520
People get their way in advance. They test them, they get a COVID test,

85
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:07.980
which gives them a nice peace of mind, like, Oh great. I don't have it.

86
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.520
Then you get to sit down and enjoy a show and the place is packed.

87
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.090
And so the business is making money. Everyone's having a good time.

88
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.380
It's it's possible.

89
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.480
<v 0>Well, that's what, that's what a lot of people are doing in LA. Right?</v>

90
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:21.690
So they're having parties in LA and a lot of them are doing rapid testing

91
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:25.980
beforehand. So everybody gets a wristband that everybody in the party knows that

92
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:26.814
everybody's.

93
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.600
<v 1>But this isn't the mayor threatening to shut those kinds of parties down.</v>

94
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.930
<v 2>You started to shut water off, like, like, and by the way, he's done it. Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:36.690
Water and power, which we're living in like a dictatorship.

96
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.330
I literally feel like LA is like a third world country right now.

97
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:40.643
Never seen anyone.

98
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.520
<v 1>Well, if you go to Venice or you go to downtown LA and you see the encampments,</v>

99
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:48.480
it's bananas. I mean, third world countries wouldn't allow that.

100
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.730
<v 2>Worse. This is some sort of dictatorship happening that, uh, we, we,</v>

101
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.490
to me is a bigger picture. If, if, if other, uh,

102
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.010
governments, if other States counties,

103
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:03.770
cities see that they can just shut an industry down so easily,

104
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.170
get a name for themselves, get their name out there.

105
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.870
What's stopping everyone else from doing this.

106
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.480
