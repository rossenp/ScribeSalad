00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>The general gonna experience when things get, you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.900
someone's in my face barking about something, or, you know,

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:10.350
you get in the art world, you get these people that are really big pants,

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.770
but they would cower and she stood up. What do you mean in the art world?

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.690
Publishers, you get gallery owners.

6
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.210
So there's going to bark at you and tell you a way it is and you're going to do

7
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.740
this. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Really? Oh, telling you, man.

8
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:23.790
Tell me just,

9
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.230
I've dealt with gallery owners who are like super bullies who were like,

10
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:30.600
you're going to do this. I need this now. And you're gonna get it today,

11
00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:34.560
tomorrow. And you're talk to you all the time and you go, Hmm.

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.800
I'm probably not going to do any of that. And the thing is, I like to,

13
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.180
I like to be super calm and it's almost like mind you Jitsu or where I go,

14
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.810
all that huffing and puffing you're doing doesn't affect me one bit.

15
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.990
If you want to go to sleep, I can accommodate that.

16
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.730
But we're not going to go down that road. And, and you know, I mean.

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.380
<v 1>That's interesting. Yeah. And it would never have bothered the art world.</v>

18
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.900
<v 0>It can be a dirty world. I've had galleries that, uh,</v>

19
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.610
knocked me off my own galleries.

20
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.810
Start ripping me off and producing work of mine out the back door and signing my

21
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:07.790
name, like making prints of your shirt. Right?

22
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.830
<v 2>Wow. One fake signing your name.</v>

23
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.950
<v 0>Yup. Yup. Yup. Caught them, caught them. And then they said,</v>

24
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.790
Oh no, we got that from China. And we're suing you.

25
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.630
And they come after me. They got it from China. They would make up.

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.930
It was all made up. Right. We caught them. And where was this gallery?

27
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.400
It was in, uh, Huntington beach really. And, uh,

28
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.920
we, uh, we caught him and uh,

29
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.660
we shut it down hard and then they flip the script and that's when, uh,

30
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.930
it was interesting because we were getting calls from a lot of media and press

31
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.470
and they were asking me like, Oh, you've been referred to as a,

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.220
you and your band of thugs went down, took all your art. Right.

33
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.060
So what I did is I flipped it. I said, I liked that title.

34
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.100
I'm going to do a painting called band of thugs.

35
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.380
Then I did this like old mobster, thirties,

36
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.660
painting of all these dudes and thugs band thugs.

37
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.380
And I'm going to make money off that. And, and, uh, you know, it.

38
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.660
<v 1>Was a, is you have to go down there and get your art.</v>

39
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.540
<v 0>I went and took everything. I got my art back.</v>

40
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.610
And while I'm taking all of it out of here, you're, you're,

41
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.040
you're no longer a Todd white gallery you're done.

42
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.680
And it soon withered and died after that. But, uh, it, it,

43
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.130
it drug out illegal problems and legal cases.

44
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:20.990
And how long did it last about eight?

45
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.510
<v 1>Look at that. Look at the guy missing an eye. Oh,</v>

46
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.880
just the.

47
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.410
<v 0>And the thugs. Right? You want abandoned thugs? There it is. That's great.</v>

48
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.220
And uh.

49
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.140
<v 1>That's like some, uh, what's that guy? Uh, the butcher. Oh yeah.</v>

50
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.910
Bill the butcher bill. The butcher from brings in New York, New York,

51
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.440
New York go to that big Hill. The butcher. I mean,

52
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:50.270
that is kind of how they're they're, they're they're painted like old timey,

53
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:51.260
bad people. Yeah.

54
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.000
<v 0>Yeah. It was funny because uh, the Spanish hair did an article on it and, uh,</v>

55
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.411
and, and they totally,

56
00:02:57.411 --> 00:03:01.420
it's funny because vanity fair an article on what the whole scam and the whole.

57
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.230
Yeah. Cause it was, it made a lot of, you know,

58
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.280
she sold a couple hundred thousand dollars in fake art out there.

59
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.450
She sold it across international as a woman. Yeah.

60
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:14.780
It was a woman in international lines and, and it, it, it, it went on.

61
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.850
<v 1>So she ripped you off to the tune of a couple hundred thousand bucks.</v>

62
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.140
<v 0>Oh yeah. Yeah. Wow. And it was funny because, uh, you know,</v>

63
00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:25.320
when it all came out and it was all court cases and stuff, I had,

64
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.810
I had galleries calling me cause I got scared. Like, Oh no,

65
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.140
I had galleries calling me in. They're like, Hey, we want to carry you.

66

This is 2012. Hey, we want to carry you. We to,

67
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.380

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.260
So the guy calls me back up, art publisher calls me and he goes,

You're asking me how come you guys want to carry you when this is going on.

71
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.840
She made you dinero and a Scorsese movie. And you're wondering why.
