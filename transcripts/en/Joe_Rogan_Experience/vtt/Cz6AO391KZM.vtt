00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.430
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. And if you look at the bill that was passed, I mean,</v>

2
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:08.790
I went over it last night and it's, there's a lot of weird in there.

3
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:12.060
Like why are we giving all this aid to foreign countries in this bill?

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.110
Why is there a part of this aid bill that, uh,

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.880
makes it a felony to illegally stream? Like, how does this,

6
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:25.530
how they sneak things into these bills? These people are monsters.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.020
They really are like, this should have been a real clear cut thing,

8
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.410
aid to people that have lost all their income because of this.

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.500
They need a stimulus. The fact that they, they added in a,

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.720
a felony provision for people who stream movies

11
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.930
and profit from them, like what the is going on? Like,

12
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.570
how is your you're not going to hear me disagree? Look,

13
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.040
why is Pakistan getting money? Why is Israel getting, did you see it? Jamie?

14
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.880
It's bizarre. I don't understand the logic behind it.

15
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:55.560
I don't understand how this got agreed to.

16
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.530
<v 1>Happens is the idea is this thing's going to pass anyway. So you,</v>

17
00:00:58.531 --> 00:01:01.670
you help out your favorite lobbyist, whether you're a Democrat or Republican,

18
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:02.510
you sneak something in.

19
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.330
<v 0>Is that what it is? That's clearly PB.</v>

20
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.160
<v 1>Here. Here's what I'll say. Okay.</v>

21
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.910
This is why tell your children actually matters in this debate. Okay.

22
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.390
I wrote this book and you can, and you can say that.

23
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.810
<v 0>In the pot book. Yeah. You.</v>

24
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.400
<v 1>Can say like this guy,</v>

25
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.760
like he doesn't understand a lot of people just like to get high and they can

26
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.790
handle it. It shouldn't be criminal. Um, and you know,

27
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.350
minorities bear the burden here. It's wrong. Let's legalize. Okay.

28
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.920
Totally reasonable. And by the way, alcohol kills a whole lot of people.

29
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:38.210
It's legal. It's advertised on TV. It's legal. The rules should be the same.

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.230
I totally get that. Okay. If you read the book,

31
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.750
it's about something else it's about,

32
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.860
this is psychiatrically harmful to a lot of people and we're not talking about

33
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.040
it. And by the way, there's a downstream violence that comes from that.

34
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:56.240
Sometimes that we're not talking about either. Okay. To me, those things,

35
00:01:56.241 --> 00:02:00.020
if you read the book with an open mind or pretty factual and inarguable,

36
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.360
it doesn't mean by the way that you can't then say cannabis should still be

37
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.360
illegal. You can read the book and agree with it and say,

38
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.480
but you know what should still be legal for those other reasons. Fine.

39
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.100
That is not the way the book was treated last year. Okay. It was,

40
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.150
you hate black people. You don't understand science.

41
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.420
You're cherry picking go to hell. Okay.

42
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.250
So when I saw this happening this year with COVID and I saw the New York

43
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:28.910
times where I used to work and you know what? People can yell at me for saying,

44
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:29.571
I used to work there,

45
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:32.390
but I worked there for 10 years and I was a really good reporter there.

46
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.620
And I'm not going to back down from my credentials. Cause I am a good reporter.

47
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.450
You can say, you can say, you know what,

48
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.980
like lockdowns are necessary and we need to protect these old people.

49
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.100
And you know what? We can't let the hospitals get overrun.

50
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.820
But if I present evidence to you, that's contrary,

51
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.360
don't you shout at me that I'm an idiot and don't know what I'm talking about.

52
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.820
Okay. It's not going to work. It didn't work with tell your,

53
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.500
and it's not going to work this time. Okay. So,

54
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.110
and what I recognized was that unfortunately,

55
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.230
and it sort of the elite levels of the media, you know,

56
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:11.920
the times Washington post and PR CNN,

57
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.240
the group think is overwhelming. It's overwhelming on cannabis.

58
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.000
And it's overwhelming on all these woke progressive issues.

59
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.240
And it's gotten much, much worse since I left the times 10 years ago.

60
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.850
And I don't know what's going to turn it around. Okay. And, and,

61
00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:28.390
and it has terrible effects. Let me give you one example, okay.

62
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.730
We should all want to know where this virus came from.

63
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.420
I don't care whether you're public and or Democrat, liberal, conservative.

64
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.860
I don't care what country you live in.

65
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.280
You should want to know if this is the result of a Chinese lamb accident.

66
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.010
And there's some evidence that we can talk about that later. Okay.

67
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.850
And you should at least want to know that there's been a complete independent

68
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.740
investigation into this. Okay.

69
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.790
This thing has messed up the world in a mammoth way this year. Okay.

70
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.370
And at the least we should want to know where it came from.

71
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:56.140
If it did come from some kind of accident,

72
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.180
I'm not saying the Chinese released it intentionally,

73
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.850
I'm saying there might be evidence that there was an accident.

74
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.620
Because if that happened, we better make sure it never, ever,

75
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.580
ever happens. Again.

76
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.050
<v 0>Not a very strange thing to me that people don't want to even investigate.</v>

77
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.050
They don't want to look at it. And they're, they're,

78
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.030
I think they're afraid of racism or something.

79
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.290
There seems to be some sort of indication that there's a victim blaming thing.

80
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.070
There's a, there's an aspect to it. That also is anti-Trump that's it?

81
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 1>Yeah. It's anti-Trump okay. What happened in March was the progressive media.</v>

82
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.910
First of all, they were terrified because what was happening in New York,

83
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:31.350
what seemed to be happening in New York.

84
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.060
And they all thought they were going to die.

85
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.490
And then once they realized they weren't all going to die,

86
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:38.790
they realized that they could beat Donald Trump over the head with this and he

87
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:41.610
would lose the election and they did. And he did. And look,

88
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.880
I I'm neither a Republican nor Democrat. What are you?

89
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.240
I'm an independent basically. I basically, as I've said,

90
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.020
my politics are that it's impossible to be too cynical. Just like you said,

91
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:53.820
with the, with the bill that they just passed,

92
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:56.430
it's impossible to be too cynical about the way these people behave.

93
00:04:56.431 --> 00:04:59.820
They behave, they behave, behave terribly. Okay. But,

94
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:04.380
so why is it that the New York times won't even write stories about the fact

95
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:06.870
that there's real questions about where this virus came from?

96
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:11.070
Forget the ventilators, forget the U S response. Forget, you know, Donald Trump.

97
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.310
We should be asking that question. The group think is so serious.

98
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.740
That basic questions don't get asked right now.

99
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.830
<v 0>Were criticized on the podcast because I had Bret Weinstein.</v>

100
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:23.580
Who's a evolutionary biologist who discussed all the reasons,

101
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:26.160
scientific reasons why it's,

102
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.120
there's there's evidence that indicates that this is not a virus that naturally

103
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:34.500
occurs. Right. And also just by coincidence,

104
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.000
there happens to be a level four lab.

105
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.280
<v 1>In wool hands, right? What are the odds?</v>

106
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.500
<v 0>Right? Like you would think that people would want to put those two together,</v>

107
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:45.090
but it was something from the beginning that this group think was

108
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:47.220
established, that you are not to question that.

109
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.220
And there was a whole article written about I'm promoting this dangerous

110
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:54.600
conspiracy theory that the, that this came from a lab that's been disproven,

111
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.010
but it hasn't been, has not been disproven at all. No, it hasn't been disproven.

112
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:58.760
There's there's,

113
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.440
there's never been a real solid proof of where this has come from right here,

114
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.030
nor there.

115
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.810
<v 1>That's right. And,</v>

116
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.280
and actually you'd say the evidence is sort of going the other way now. I mean,

117
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.290
in favor of this be, and here's why,

118
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.300
if this thing is originally came from some animal, right.

119
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.530
We know that there was a virus that was 96% similar to it that they had at that

120
00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:24.220
lab. Okay. But we've never found the virus.

121
00:06:24.221 --> 00:06:28.930
That's 99% similar in an animal, which is what we would expect to find. Okay.

122
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.770
That there'd be something really close that then made the jump from whether it's

123
00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:36.550
a civic cat or a bat or a mink or whatever, to a human.

124
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.880
They've never been able to find that why was the connection with penguins?

125
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.980
They think it was so, so the virus is 96%, uh,

126
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.200
bat. It looks like very, very similar.

127
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.530
And then near the most important part of it.

128
00:06:50.531 --> 00:06:54.100
The part of it that binds to this receptor on your cells that enables it to get

129
00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:58.630
in it's called the receptor binding domain is pangolin. Okay.

130
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.360
So it just happens that it's a perfect cut of mostly this

131
00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:08.800
virus that we know was in this lab, this Baton virus with a pangolin virus,

132
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.210
with a tiny addition that it, that enables, um,

133
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.100
it enables the spike to attach more efficiently. Okay.

134
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.130
It's called the foreign cleavage. And, and again,

135
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.390
we're at sort of the limits of my knowledge.

136
00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:24.160
I don't want to talk too specifically about it,

137
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.380
but somehow this virus just happens to be mostly

138
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.180
bat a little bit pangolin,

139
00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.250
and we can't find any evidence of a virus that's like that to

140
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:40.360
a 99 percentile in the wild. And believe me,

141
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.800
don't you think the Chinese have looked in the last year or wouldn't they have

142
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:46.900
looked if they thought they could find something.

143
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.260
When SARS came the original SARS, not SARS, cov two,

144
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.150
they had found the viral host within a matter of months. I mean, the, the,

145
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:56.740
the zoonotic one, the,

146
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.430
the animal viral host in a matter of months and they published a paper on it.

147
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:01.960
There's been nothing like that.

148
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.810
Now you can choose to believe that's because you know what,

149
00:08:04.811 --> 00:08:07.930
it's just in some cave in China that they haven't found the real thing yet.

150
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.510
Or you can choose to question, as you said,

151
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:15.370
there's this level four BSL lab in [inaudible] where it happens,

152
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.280
where this thing happens to seemingly have emerged from coincidence,

153
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:21.790
coincidence, crazy coincidence. Yeah. But we're not allowed to talk about that.

154
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.920
Yeah. If you talk about it, you're a Trump supporter.
