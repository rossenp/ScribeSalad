00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Let's let's, uh, establish your position, Alex, on,</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.860
on, on COVID. What is your position on that?

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.870
<v 1>Sure. So people accuse me of being a COVID denialist or I, you know,</v>

4
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:13.970
I don't think it's real. I don't think anyone dies from it.

5
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:17.960
That's that's all nonsense. Joe COVID is real. It, uh, you know,

6
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.440
it emerged from, we can talk about where it might have emerged from, uh,

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.420
earlier this year, maybe in late 2019, it's killed a lot of people. Um,

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.910
it's contagious. And, uh, and, and, you know, it's been a problem this year.

9
00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:33.320
It's been a significant problem. Yeah.

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.730
It is not worthy of the response that we have had to it.

11
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.060
I believe lockdowns have been a mistake and we can go into all of it, but,

12
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.600
but we have overreacted in an extremely dangerous way this year.

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.090
<v 0>I believe we've overreacted as well. And I think that in particular,</v>

14
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:54.770
one of the things that disturbs me the most is that there has been no accounting

15
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:58.760
for the damage that has been done by forcing people to shut down their

16
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:01.130
businesses. And they're only,

17
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.990
the only thought has been making sure that the ICU

18
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:08.840
beds are open and that, you know,

19
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:12.290
somehow or another people are able to get treatment for this.

20
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.870
There's been I've openly criticized.

21
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:19.010
The fact there's been no discussion whatsoever about getting healthy like this.

22
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.400
None.

23
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.210
No one's encouraging you because they're worried about being called a fat shamer

24
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:25.370
or some other nonsensical term.

25
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.800
<v 1>I mean, I think it's much worse than that, because if,</v>

26
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:32.030
if you remember back in may or may back in March, we were told 15 days,

27
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:35.480
15 days to slow the spread. Let's not have the hospitals be overrun.

28
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.130
And at some point maybe it was in April. Maybe it was in may.

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.510
Somehow this became no one can ever get sick and die from COVID.

30
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.320
It is wrong that this disease exists and we have to do everything to stop it,

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.000
no matter what the consequences.

32
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:52.940
And you mentioned businesses business that are important, but to me,

33
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:55.190
what's even more important is what we're doing to our kids.

34
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.670
What we've done with school closures, what we've done with normalizing,

35
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:02.840
the idea that being outside with your friends is dangerous. We are, we are,

36
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.600
we are screwing over our kids in the worst part.

37
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.590
<v 0>Well, I think we had an idea of what COVID was going to be.</v>

38
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.470
I know I certainly did for the first few weeks, I was like,

39
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:13.460
this is going to kill everybody.

40
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.220
I thought I was going to kill a 10% of the population.

41
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:17.390
I was really worried about it. Yeah.

42
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.190
I remember being in the supermarket stocking up and thinking Jesus Christ like

43
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.600
this, this feels so crazy.

44
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.120
But I also remember thinking it was going to last two weeks. Yep.

45
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.660
And now here we are still reacting this way.

46
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.580
We're now deep in a January or deep into December, almost in a January. Yep. Um,

47
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.720
a lot of my friends were caught including young Jamie over here and Jamie beat

48
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.330
it in a day. Uh, Tony Hinchcliffe has it now.

49
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.820
He was sick yesterday and today feels good.

50
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.430
And this is the case with so many people. Whereas if they got the flu, I knew,

51
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.800
I know a lot of the same people that have got the flu.

52
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:55.670
They were knocked down into the dirt for three or four days, maybe a week,

53
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.710
maybe two weeks. Um, it's different than we thought was going to be,

54
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.670
but we're still reacting. Like it was the same thing. And then there's this,

55
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.050
this fear porn that everybody likes to pedal.

56
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.350
It's this weird thing where everybody wants to think that, you know,

57
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.090
if you catch it, you have a 10% chance of dying or the sky is falling. And.

58
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.150
<v 1>It's just, it's weird.</v>

59
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.650
<v 0>How, uh, people want to pretend that it's still what it used to be.</v>

60
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.260
And they want to say, you know, you should think about this.

61
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.980
Cause 300,000 Americans have died and you want to go stop. No,

62
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.760
300,000 Americans have died from COVID.

63
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.160
That also had a lot of other stuff.

64
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.990
How many people have died just from COVID and it's a relatively small number in

65
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.300
comparison. It's like a bad flu year.

66
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.640
<v 1>All right. Um, so it's complicated. Here's, here's the thing. And, and, um,</v>

67
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.310
and I don't know if you, if you, and you know, this is,

68
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.540
as I said about all this stuff for you, but the, the booklets, I,

69
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.380
especially the first one, which is about ha uh, death, counting how we go,

70
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.860
how we count a COVID death, go. I go into this in detail. Okay. Well,

71
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:05.490
let's talk about that right away. So, okay. There's,

72
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.860
here's the most fundamental fact about COVID that the media doesn't report

73
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:15.480
accurately, how stratified the risk is by age. So you mentioned,

74
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.220
you mentioned, you know, people who are, who are,

75
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:21.180
might be overweight or have diabetes, all that stuff does add to your risk.

76
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.800
What really adds to your risk is age and people and people don't really,

77
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.420
I think this is true of almost everybody.

78
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:31.410
People don't really have a good idea of what, what risk is. Right. So if I say,

79
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.450
you know, like it's riskier to be old and have COVID than to be young,

80
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.810
you might think, okay, it's like two to one or three to one or five to one,

81
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:41.040
it's kind of like normal risks.

82
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:45.120
Like what are the odds that the jets are going to beat the Rams, like one in 10,

83
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.870
you know, last week. And that happened, the jets beat the Rams. Um,

84
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.570
this risk is not like that.

85
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.070
It's like somewhere between 110,000 times,

86
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:58.260
the risk of in what age.

87
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.940
So maybe 75 versus 25,

88
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.300
80 versus 25. If you look at who dies from this,

89
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.530
it is overwhelmingly people over 65,

90
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:14.970
75, 85. Okay. The, uh, the median age of death in,

91
00:05:14.971 --> 00:05:15.930
in European countries,

92
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.440
or which are a little bit healthier than the U S is in the low eighties.

93
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.260
But that doesn't really tell you the real risk,

94
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:26.580
because what you need to understand is that only two or 3% of the population is

95
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:28.290
over 82 or 83.

96
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.980
<v 0>Now what about people? Like there was that guy, who's a Broadway actor.</v>

97
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.880
So it was a young, healthy looking guy who got sick and wound up dying from it.

98
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.910
<v 1>So th that's going to happen. So there's two issues. First of all,</v>

99
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.140
that happens to people with the flu. I can point you to stories from 2018, what,

100
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:45.270
you know, young, healthy teacher dies of the flu.

101
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:48.990
It just was never reported nationally this way, right? That's a, B is,

102
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.730
if you look at those cases,

103
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.450
oftentimes there's weird idiosyncratic stuff happening of which the number one

104
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:57.680
thing is a lot of those people were put on ventilators very early.

105
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.780
You're put on ventilators and they never came off.

106
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.810
We're not having that as much anymore. And if you look,

107
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:07.520
the average age of death is actually creeping up. Now, it looks like, and okay,

108
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:09.070
so that's one, is that the risk?

109
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.430
<v 0>We talk about that. Yes. The ventilators. Yep. So what happened.</v>

110
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.780
<v 1>What happened was in March, especially back when everybody was terrified,</v>

111
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.200
there's there, there there's something called a nebulizing procedure.

112
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.370
So there are procedures that re that we're inserting tubes into people,

113
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:28.030
and it releases a lot of, um, you know, aerosols from them.

114
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.100
And the fear was this is going to get aerosolized and the nurses and the doctors

115
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.490
are all going to get sick and die.

116
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.470
And we're going to have no medical staff ventilator avoids that problem. Okay.

117
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.100
So the F the feeling was let's ventilate very early.

118
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.300
This is a really serious disease. Let's get everybody we can on ventilators.

119
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.090
That's when, remember when we needed a hundred thousand ventilators,

120
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:52.090
200,000 ventilators, that was the idea, okay,

121
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.780
we're going to ventilate really early. It turns out that was a terrible idea.

122
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.700
It turns out that as, as Elon Musk likes to say, you know, your lungs,

123
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.670
if you, if you ventilate too early, it's just like a meat bellows,

124
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.130
and you can blow out people's lungs if you over ventilate.

125
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.550
And it looks like that happened. I will tell you not that we're not,

126
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.330
not that we don't use ventilators for COVID, but right now in the United States,

127
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:16.330
I believe there were about 8,000 people on ventilators. Can I.

128
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.070
<v 0>Can I stop you for a second meet bellows, like bellows, like fireplace bellows,</v>

129
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.380
right?

130
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.990
<v 1>So you're just finishing this Erin and you're. And like,</v>

131
00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:25.090
if you push it in a pressure, that's too high,

132
00:07:25.091 --> 00:07:26.650
you can just blow out people's lungs.

133
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.690
<v 0>So you re literally destroy their lungs.</v>

134
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.020
<v 1>Yes, yes. We did that with people and, and, and it became clear.</v>

135
00:07:32.021 --> 00:07:34.220
It became pretty clear, pretty early on. And,

136
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.360
and they S and they tried to stop doing it, and they have stopped doing it.

137
00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:37.640
You know.

138
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.480
<v 0>That's why they were saying that 80% of the people they put on ventilators wound</v>

139
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.230
up dying.

140
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.170
It's not just that they were so sick by the time they got to ventilators,

141
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.630
they were dying. That's right. And they couldn't save them.

142
00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:49.600
It was just that the ventilators themselves.

143
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.100
<v 1>Did damage. That's wow. That,</v>

144
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.300
and I don't think that actually too many people would argue that even in

145
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:58.060
hospitals, I can point you to stories that have been written about this.

146
00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:02.590
And I can point you to sort of in-hospital discussion of this. Um, again,

147
00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:04.120
there is a role for ventilators,

148
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:06.490
for people who really cannot breathe on their own,

149
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.560
but this early ventilation that we,

150
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.470
that we used back in March and April killed people,

151
00:08:11.471 --> 00:08:13.840
and some of the people killed our people who were younger,

152
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:15.130
who probably would have survived.

153
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.330
<v 0>My friend, Michael yo was young when he got it. And he was really beaten down.</v>

154
00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:22.900
He did a lot of traveling. He flew to New York, he did morning radio.

155
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:26.630
The whole deal flew back, drove to Vegas, visited his family,

156
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.970
and then drove home that night and then did a bunch of auditions in LA and then

157
00:08:30.971 --> 00:08:34.600
got sick, real sick. His doctor didn't put him on a ventilator because he said,

158
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:35.590
if I put you on a ventilator,

159
00:08:35.591 --> 00:08:37.870
your lung is going to stop working and you're going to die.

160
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.640
And he's okay today because of that. But he's a young,

161
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.350
healthy, robust guy. And he got it and almost died. I mean, he was really,

162
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:48.680
really sick for about two weeks.

163
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.840
<v 1>So, but he recovered. Right. So again, we're not saying this disease,</v>

164
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:55.240
isn't real. And we're not saying that some people, unfortunately,

165
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.340
aren't going to have these bad reactions to it, but, but you know,

166
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:02.910
back in March, maybe he gets put on a ventilator and maybe he dies. Well,

167
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.390
he got it very, very early. So that was so his, so he was fortunate.

168
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:07.800
He had a doctor who was smart.

169
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.390
