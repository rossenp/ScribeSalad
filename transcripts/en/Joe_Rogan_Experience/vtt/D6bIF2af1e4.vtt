00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.150
<v 1>So here's Venice beach. Look at this video. This is a, I mean,</v>

3
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:09.450
this is very mild in comparison to some of the videos that I've seen,

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.700
but there's one from downtown LA that literally shows this. So Venice beach,

5
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:18.210
all the boardwalk, that whole area is now just encampments.

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.630
<v 0>Yeah. Like Wilsher and, uh, San Francisco.</v>

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.610
<v 1>Right? It's terrible. Yeah. I've seen terrible Wilshire in San Francisco is bad.</v>

8
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:27.890
Downtown LA is absolutely the worst.

9
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:32.000
Downtown LA is bananas thousands and thousands of tents.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.790
And I don't know how they're going to put that genie back in the bottle.

11
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.430
And now you've got, they were trying to clean up. Cause they're trying to leave.

12
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:41.000
The oldest is a health hazard. You've got like human in the streets.

13
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.460
Like how do we clean this? So they're trying to clean up right now.

14
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.610
Activists are stopping them from cleaning up. They're like,

15
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:50.600
your actions are violence and they're holding hands and blocking cleanup crews.

16
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:51.434
Like.

17
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.330
<v 0>But think about how many more people you've just added to the homeless</v>

18
00:00:56.331 --> 00:01:00.740
roles because of all the industries that have been shut down and people that

19
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:04.790
can't feed their families. Yeah. That's the hard part. It's like, you know,

20
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.310
John, we all know the same people. And I actually, um, I actually,

21
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.090
in my heart of hearts think that they are,

22
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.050
they believe that they're helping that. That's my, that's my, my belief.

23
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.710
<v 2>That's cute. And I just [inaudible]</v>

24
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.543
. I know that, but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt. That doesn't mean I agree.

25
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.520
<v 0>With them or agree with what they're doing in the least,</v>

26
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.570
but I will give a shout out to like the city of West Hollywood, the mayor,

27
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:35.450
Lindsay, her breath, um, uh, Paul Arrevallo.

28
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.710
They have been so business friendly. They're trying to help as much as they can.

29
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.020
They, the permits, the ability for me to, to, to get my patio up and running,

30
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.440
they, they moved in lightening speed, but I'll give you an example.

31
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.640
I got the front patio built it finished on a Friday and on Saturday I got shut

32
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:55.850
down. It's worthless. So what did I just spend six weeks.

33
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.740
<v 1>Right? There's no evidence that shows that outdoor dining is contributing</v>

34
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.200
significantly to the COVID spread. There's no evidence.

35
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.930
<v 2>I actually had to admit that finally, in the, in court,</v>

36
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.910
the County has no evidence of a nexus between any sort of outbreak, uh,

37
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.080
with outdoor dining.

38
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.210
<v 1>I know how is, so how do they make this arbitrary,</v>

39
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:19.160
distinct distinction between outdoor dining and going to Walmart or what they're

40
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:21.380
calling essential? It doesn't matter.

41
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.060
<v 0>There isn't.</v>

42
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.870
So the County health officials shut us down right.

43
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:30.650
For three weeks, uh, right around. But was it Thanksgiving? Yes.

44
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.600
And um, some friends of ours took them to court and said,

45
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.010
you know, how can you just shut down an industry with no evidence?

46
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:42.950
And they said, Oh, we have plenty of evidence. We have six studies in blah,

47
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:43.784
blah, blah, blah, blah.

48
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.790
And then they actually got to court and they had nothing. Nothing.

49
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.360
<v 2>No, all the evidence is from indoor dining, not one piece of paper to admit it.</v>

50
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.080
<v 1>So when they admit it, then what happens. But now they're appealing it.</v>

51
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.970
<v 2>Now they're appealing by the way, they've hired an outside.</v>

52
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.990
And you think these people have some of our best intentions.

53
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.140
Come on these guys too nice.

54
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.770
This guy Newsome wants a name for himself and no one's calling them out.

55
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.360
And it's absolutely insane to me.

56
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.960
<v 0>Okay. Here's the number one thing that boggles my mind.</v>

57
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.790
You have a problem. We all agree. There's an illness. Okay?

58
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.080
The rates of hospitalizations are going up. Infections are going up,

59
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.040
but the rates of death are going down. Okay? So we have an issue.

60
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.950
Why not get together as a community and say, you know what?

61
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.380
We're going to grab a couple of restaurant people.

62
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.340
We're going to grab some doctors in the field and have people that have

63
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.650
real-world experience, not PhDs, not theoretical people,

64
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.100
people that have real experience in the industry, grab them,

65
00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:47.970
grab a round table and say, okay, we have this problem. How do we mitigate it?

66
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:50.550
And how do we move forward? Smartly? I've never been asked.

67
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.960
John's never been asked no doctor that I know in the wide variety of people that

68
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:59.460
I take care of has ever been asked their opinion by the County state

69
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.623
on any level.

70
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.000
<v 2>He's right. It's it's, that's the problem. And I reached out directly. I have,</v>

71
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.010
uh, Garcetti's email. I emailed this mayor, puts me on with some,

72
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.150
some random person from the office then puts me on with the County and I say,

73
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:19.140
Hey, get us together. Why don't you actually talk to real restaurant owners?

74
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.300
This is when they were thinking about this was when they were going to do the

75
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:25.110
curfew, right. There was a 10:00 PM curfew. And I said, w where's the,

76
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.740
where's the 10:00 PM curfew come from? Oh, well, when people get inebriated,

77
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.550
they get looser. And then they're super spreaders at restaurants. And I'm like,

78
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.690
okay, why 10:00 PM? So that's, that's the time when people really start,

79
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.150
start getting an abbreviated. And I was like,

80
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.540
but you realize you could at least say, Hey, close up.

81
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.100
Let people make sure they get out to get their check paid and be out the door by

82
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.480
midnight, 1130,

83
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:53.220
whatever it might be rather than everyone out the door by 10:00 PM. And he said,

84
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:56.550
well, you could seat someone at nine and then kick them out at nine 50.

85
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.400
And I was like, have you any,

86
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.920
do you have any understanding of the restaurant industry at all?

87
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.400
Not one had not contacted any, any restaurant tour.

88
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.780
They went to a 10:00 PM curfew. Three days later, shut it all down.

89
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.880
They just said, you know what? We're we're just shutting everything down.

90
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.660
<v 0>No reason. They've never heard no from anybody you want to do, uh,</v>

91
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.800
six people or less. Okay. You want tables? Six feet apart. Okay.

92
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.510
You want to do, uh, uh, an 11 o'clock curfew. Okay. A 10 o'clock curfew. Okay.

93
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.370
We we've said yes to everything they've wanted and yet they still find a way

94
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.900
to shut the industry. Then.

95
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.740
<v 2>This is what I understand why who's making the decisions.</v>

96
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.080
I personally think again, I don't think Craig wants, wants to say this.

97
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.110
I personally think it is politicians trying to make a name for themselves.

98
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.850
That it doesn't make a name for yourself.

99
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.890
<v 0>I think it's through. I honestly think it's fear.</v>

100
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.620
I think it's fear that they're going to,

101
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.650
that they're going to be seen as not having done something I,

102
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.540
people are being killed.

103
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.180
<v 2>Oh, Newsome is on the news almost every day. So much so that people get, get,</v>

104
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.110
get off, get off the news man. Like this guy is speaking Everett left and right.

105
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.940
He really thinks that he's the savior situation. And I think that is where it's,

106
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.500
it's some sort of political gain situation in his mind and its

107
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:15.620
control. Like, look there, there clin, by the way,

108
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.900
I just found out recently and we've been,

109
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.880
I've been in this business for 15 years.

110
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.340
I had no idea that our India were we're considered independent restaurants,

111
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.940
not franchise. We had no representation. We had no lobbyists. The re the,

112
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.520
the representation for the restaurant community is driven by big,

113
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.300
fast food chains. Well, they have no incentive to help independent restaurants,

114
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.210
you know, McDonald's and all these people, which God bless them,

115
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:42.470
but they're thriving in COVID.

116
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.720
So we just get bullied around essentially because there's no lobbyists.

117
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.770
And so we're kind of like sitting ducks in this situation.

118
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:55.730
And I kind of feel like we're somewhat trying to be a voice here for the

119
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:56.900
independent restaurant world.

120
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.020
<v 0>And it's not just LA I mean, think,</v>

121
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.820
think about New York and LA were we trendsetters?

122
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.060
Right? The country watched what happened in LA, in New York.

123
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.710
And they followed and now LA and New York have just completely dropped the ball

124
00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.380
and everybody else has kind of rising up.

125
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.510
<v 1>Well, there are examples of government overreach.</v>

126
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.560
They're examples of government overreach without any thought whatsoever to these

127
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:21.580
independent businesses.

128
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.510
<v 2>Slippery slope. Yeah. How much more is that going to happen? That is a big fear.</v>

129
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.630
<v 1>It's also a slippery slope because what happens if it doesn't come back?</v>

130
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.870
What happens if you drive down Melrose and those things stay boarded up?

131
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.520
What happens if downtown LA stays filled with tents? Yup. What do you do? Well.

132
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.860
<v 0>How many restaurants are going to be able to come back? I mean,</v>

133
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:42.400
like I said before, we'll, we'll manage, we'll figure out a way. And,

134
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:46.970
and John's point like governor Newsome actually did help with something that I

135
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.880
was trying to get, you know, a back patio done.

136
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.530
And there were a couple of health department rules and,

137
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.830
and his office did step in and said, that's ridiculous.

138
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.060
You should allow that and make that happen. And they changed the rule, um, that,

139
00:07:58.061 --> 00:08:02.380
that benefited, not just my restaurant, but all restaurants fan over here. No,

140
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.550
no, I'm just trying to, like.

141
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.590
<v 1>I'm trying to, I'm trying to balance it out.</v>

142
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.180
<v 0>Want, I want it to be an honest conversation of,</v>

143
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.430
I think your policies are wrong. I don't dislike you as a person. Right.

144
00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:18.400
That there's a big distinction. Sure. Okay. So that's,

145
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.480
that's all I'm trying to say, but I will say that, uh, you know,

146
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.850
on the reservation list, um,

147
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.110
somebody's name that Ryan would spaghetti will not get a reservation. Okay.

148
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.490
We'll do well. I'll, I'll, I'll do that. I will say I've spoken.

149
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.680
<v 2>Out about him and we got targeted pretty hardcore.</v>

150
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.180
<v 1>Openly. They targeted you.</v>

151
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.250
<v 2>Health came every night when I finally could wear the permits for Alfresco.</v>

152
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.370
Whereas this every single night, I'm like you were here last night. Well,

153
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.400
you know, we, we were instructed to come every night. I said, okay, that makes.

154
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:53.050
<v 1>Every night because he talks out against Garcetti and Newsome, correct. Jesus.</v>

155
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.080
<v 2>Christ. And my my is I agree. It's nothing personal. I it's,</v>

156
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.980
it's their policies, their arbitrary policies. How does it make sense that,

157
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.710
you know, there's a million people passing through TSA a day.

158
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.000
I looked up all the stats. How does it make sense that we can fly here?

159
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.700
For example, anywhere Austin, New York,

160
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:15.510
wherever it might be and go right back in the same day with zero,

161
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.590
zero issues, zero checks, zero, anything yet?

162
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.990
Outdoor dining is completely shut down.

163
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.980
<v 0>The way. This is the first time in nine months. I've left that way. Yeah.</v>

164
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.550
And the only reason, the way I got down here through jet edge, by the way,

165
00:09:28.551 --> 00:09:32.150
thank you for a great ride and cool. And you guys are the best you should.

166
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:34.640
You're a big baller. You should use jet edge. Um,

167
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.760
but I'm flying back United tonight. And, and, you know,

168
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:41.480
it's the first time in nine months that I've left LA. Um,

169
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.000
and I'm not a science than I are.

170
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.450
And I take precautions and I'm around a lot of people. When the,

171
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.510
when the patio was open, I was around 150, 180 people at night,

172
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.170
but you can go from LA to New York.

173
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:59.600
You can take your mass down and eat. You can land in LA, you can go in a hotel,

174
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.700
you can then go to a mall and go shopping. Okay. You can grab some food to go.

175
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.570
We could sit together and eat outdoors in the mall,

176
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.120
but I can't go outdoor and eat at a restaurant at that employees

177
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.710
90 to a hundred people and keep a business afloat.

178
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.800
We're not thriving, you know, outdoor dining. Doesn't,

179
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.470
doesn't it isn't blowing the doors off of the revenue.

180
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.590
It allows us to keep all of the people employed.

181
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:32.120
It allows employees to make some money. We're paying payroll taxes,

182
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.600
we're paying sales taxes. And we're just one little place.

183
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.810
There's 30,000 restaurants in Los Angeles. Now,

184
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:43.490
one of the reasons they decided for shutting it down was they found that 10% of

185
00:10:43.491 --> 00:10:47.510
the restaurants weren't abiding by the rules. So, well,

186
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.460
I would say then why don't you go to those 10% or restaurants and shut them down

187
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.760
or give them warnings to the point where they do come into line.

188
00:10:55.761 --> 00:11:00.710
So if they're not social distancing and they are not wearing masks and

189
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:01.221
shields,

190
00:11:01.221 --> 00:11:03.830
and they're not wearing gloves and they're not doing all the things that you've

191
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:08.480
asked restaurants to do well, then you can target them. But to shoot,

192
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.460
to shut down an entire industry,

193
00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.850
because you feel like you have a couple of bad actors makes no sense.
