00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. So how did you learn how to do all this stuff?</v>

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:09.570
Was it trial by fire when you're learning how to use all this? I mean,

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.920
I don't want to call it ancient equipment,

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.350
but mechanical equipment to figure out how to yeah.

5
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.530
<v 1>Yeah. Secret is to begin. Just start. Yeah. I mean, so.</v>

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.120
<v 0>[Inaudible] where the does one learn how to operate a sextant and</v>

7
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:27.980
then navigate in the ocean?

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.140
<v 1>Uh, yeah, just, I would, you know, I started, uh, you know,</v>

9
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:35.240
me and some friends got a boat and, um,

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390
we started fixing it up and making a lot of mistakes. And then, you know,

11
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:42.350
I started taking some trips and then lost. Yeah, I got lost a bunch.

12
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:47.210
I took a solo trip from San Francisco to Mexico and back, uh,

13
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.420
on a little 27 foot boat with no engine. And.

14
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.640
<v 0>So when did that take a few months? Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.180
And the way you did it, did you stay close so I can see the there's the shore.

16
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.090
So if everything up, I can kind of swim.

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.590
<v 1>Yeah, well, no, you can answer them. Uh, I learned that lesson to know why it's,</v>

18
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.080
um, I mean the closest I ever came to death in my life,

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.330
uh, was just in the Bay, in the San Francisco Bay.

20
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:16.640
I was on a boat that capsized and, um,

21
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.750
I was probably 2000 yards away from shore and, uh,

22
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.140
I almost drowned and I, I mean, I didn't make it. Sure. And, um, yeah,

23
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.700
it's just the motor so cold, you know, didn't make it to shore. No, yeah.

24
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.850
It's a long story. I was like, um, I,

25
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.300
a friend of mine was living in San Francisco and he wanted to learn how to sail.

26
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.261
And I was like, you know,

27
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:40.850
what you should do is you should get like a little boat,

28
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.520
like a little sailing di you know, and then you can just anchor it,

29
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:46.850
like off the shore in this area that no one cares about. And, you know,

30
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:48.320
you can just sort of experiment with this little boat.

31
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.170
And so he started looking on Craigslist and he found this boat it's for sale for

32
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:55.370
500 bucks up in, uh, up in the North Bay. And, uh,

33
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.370
every time we called the phone number, we got done an answering machine.

34
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.910
It was like, hello, you've reached Dr. Ken Thompson honorary.

35
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.250
I'm unable to take your call, you know? And we were like,

36
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:09.230
what is that like honorary fake doctor? Is he like a judge? You know,

37
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:12.440
like, what is it? Yeah. And so finally we got in touch with this guy.

38
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.020
We go out there and it's this, this is the kind of situation where like,

39
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:17.540
we pull up and there's like the trailer that the boat's supposed to go on.

40
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:21.560
And it just full of scrap metal. And, you know, and you know, this guy comes in,

41
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:25.190
he's like, Oh yeah, this is the trailer. Um, we were going to do a metal run,

42
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:28.040
but if you want the boat, you know, we'll take the metal off, you know?

43
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.620
And we're like, okay, you know, and he's like taking us around he's he's like,

44
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:33.290
okay, the masters over here. And it's like, under symbol leaves, you know,

45
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.440
it was like, and then, you know, that the hole is in the water here and it's,

46
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.100
he has like a dock behind his house. And the tide is all the way out the books,

47
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.960
just sitting in the mud, you know? And I'm like, well,

48
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.160
how would we get this out of here? He's like, Oh,

49
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.620
you'd have to come back at a different time. Uh, you know,

50
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.230
and then you take it over there and we're like, you told us to come now,

51
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:51.230
like at this time, you know, anyway. So we go through all of the thing,

52
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.170
you know, and, and you know, my friend who knows nothing about boats, it's like,

53
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.820
all right, Moxie, like, what do you think? You know, should I get this?

54
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.070
And I was like, okay. Oh. And we were like, so what's it you doctor of what?

55
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.080
He's like, Oh, self-declared, you know, we're like, Oh.

56
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.630
<v 0>He's a self-declared doctor, honorary, honorary. Self-declared doctor.</v>

57
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.470
You can do that.

58
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.110
<v 2>I guess. Why not? It's just an answer, Jamie.</v>

59
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.100
<v 0>Yes. Yes. I think we should become doctors. Right.</v>

60
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.050
<v 2>It just became one. I tried that for a while,</v>

61
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:21.540
actually. Yeah. Did you really, I don't know. I mean,

62
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.650
I never went to college though.

63
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.100
<v 0>Does Thompson ever get an honorary degree or did he just call himself Dr.</v>

64
00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:30.960
Hunter S Thompson, because he was calling himself Dr. Hunter S Thompson.

65
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.630
Oh, bill Cosby became a doctor for a little bit. They took it back though.

66
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.070
How'd she know he up. Yeah. Yeah. He'd take back your fake doctor degree. Yeah.

67
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.490
<v 1>So this guy was like, you know, my friends, like, what do you think Mexican?</v>

68
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:47.880
I'm like, all right, Dr. Ken, I would have to consider it.

69
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.050
I'm not sure that I would do it, but I would consider taking this boat for free.

70
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.470
I'd have to think about it, but I would consider that, you know, and he's like,

71
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.280
I might be a minimal to that, you know? So we've gone from like, you know,

72
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.750
$500 to free. Uh, and so we got this boat, you know,

73
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:06.990
and it was something we had to deal with the metal and all the stuff we got the

74
00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:11.520
boat. And, um, we were just trying to do like a little, um,

75
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.720
we're just trying to anchor it all. Did you bring life vests? Yeah,

76
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:20.430
I was wearing a, uh, a PFD, uh, type type two PFD.

77
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.130
And, um, uh, we took it,

78
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:25.380
we took it to this boat ramp and it was the end of the day.

79
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.560
And the wind was blowing kind of hard and the conditions weren't that good,

80
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:30.630
but I was like, Oh, we're just doing this little thing, this little maneuver.

81
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.830
And we were in two boats, I built this little wooden, uh, rowing boat. Uh,

82
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.230
and my friend was going to go out in that with one anchor and I was going to

83
00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:42.120
sail out this whole tip yeah. Of, uh, plywood, a stitching glue. Uh, but yeah.

84
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.430
Uh, and, but it, you know, not the sturdiest vessel. So,

85
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.631
uh, and so, you know,

86
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:52.260
he's going to go out in this little rowboat and I was going to sail out this,

87
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.400
uh, this little catamaran and we had two anchors and we're gonna anchor and they

88
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.040
were going to get in the rowboat and row back. And, um,

89
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.810
it seemed a little windy. And, you know,

90
00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:04.800
I got in the boat first and I got out around this pier and was hit by the full

91
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:07.830
force of the wind and realized that it was blowing like 20 knots is way,

92
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.510
way too much for what we were trying to do,

93
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.340
but I had missed rigged part of the boat.

94
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.190
So it took me a while to get it turned around. Um,

95
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.760
and by the time I got it turned around, my friend had wrote out, um,

96
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.820
around the pier and he got hit by the force of the wind and just got blown out

97
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:21.654
into the Bay.

98
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.360
So he's rowing directly into the wind and moving backwards out of the Bay.

99
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:30.720
And I was like. And I'm on this little Hoby cat. And it was moving so fast.

100
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.890
It was way too windy to be sailing this thing. I've got just my clothes on.

101
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.360
I don't have a wetsuit on or anything like that.

102
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:40.110
I have a life jacket and just my clothes and we don't have a radio. We don't,

103
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:42.930
you know, we're unprepared, it's starting to get dark. We don't have a light.

104
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.480
Um, and I'm sailing back and forth trying to like help my friend. Uh,

105
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.340
and it got to the point where I was like, all right,

106
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.610
I'm just going to tack over. I'm going to sail up, uh,

107
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.970
to this boat that was called the sea Laos, sail up to the sea.

108
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.320
I'm going to get my friend off of it. We're just going to abandon it.

109
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.770
And then we're going to sail this Hoby cat back if we can.

110
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.570
And so I go to turn around and right, as I'm turning around a gust of wind,

111
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.740
hit the boat and capsized it before I could even know that it was, you know,

112
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:16.940
just, it's just like you just, it's one moment. You're on the button.

113
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.080
The next moment you're in the water, you know?

114
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.760
And the water was like 50 degrees, um, like super, uh, it, like,

115
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.070
it was a shock, you know,

116
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.060
it hits you and the boat was a little messed up in a way where

117
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.370
it, I couldn't write it. Uh, it, it, it capsized. And then the whole, it,

118
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:37.760
it capsized all the way and then sink. And so it was floating like, like,

119
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:41.780
you know, three feet underwater basically. Um, and so I'm in the water,

120
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.820
but I'm like still, I'm like a little bit out of the water,

121
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:46.100
but like in the water. And, you know,

122
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.460
I had a cell phone that just immediately was busted. Um,

123
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.630
and I look at my friend and he's always away now and he didn't see me.

124
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.750
And I was, you know, yelling as loud as I could,

125
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:59.210
but the wind is blowing 20 knots. And it just, you know,

126
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.250
you can't hear each other, you know, just takes your, takes her voice away.

127
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.590
And, um, he just, I mean, I was screaming, I was waving,

128
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.950
he wasn't wearing his glasses and he just very slowly wrote away.

129
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.080
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

130
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.170
<v 1>And so then I was just like floating there. I was starting to get dark. Um,</v>

131
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.890
you know, I wrote.

132
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:21.200
<v 0>Away, did he notice that your boated capsize?</v>

133
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.230
<v 1>No. He didn't even see me. He, he thought that I had just sailed somewhere else,</v>

134
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.400
you know? Cause in his mind he was, I was the person with the experience.

135
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.970
You still talk to this dude? Yeah. All the time. Yeah. I feel.

136
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.290
<v 0>Like you. I don't blame.</v>

137
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.830
<v 1>Him in his mind. He was the person that was in trouble. Right. You know, and,</v>

138
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.720
and he thought I just sailed somewhere else.

139
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.580
<v 0>That's crazy. Yeah. Sierra a of vision.</v>

140
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.840
<v 1>Yeah. And then, you know, it, it basically, it got dark. I could see the shore.</v>

141
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.260
It wasn't far away. There was nobody on shore. There's nobody around. And, um,

142
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.140
the wind was blowing directly off shore. So you have to swim, you know,

143
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:58.030
swim into the wind, uh, in, into the wind wave and all that stuff. And um,

144
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.900
eventually I tried swimming and I swam, you know, directly upwind. And I was,

145
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.160
cause I was, I was like, okay,

146
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:07.150
like if I get separated from this boat and I don't make it to shore,

147
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.050
then I'm definitely dead. You know? Like there's just no saving me. Uh,

148
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:12.460
so I was trying to go directly up when,

149
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:13.570
so that if I felt like I couldn't make it,

150
00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:17.020
I would float back down when it hit the boat again. And so I tried, you know,

151
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.290
I swam for probably like 20 minutes up point and made no progress.

152
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.550
It didn't feel like any progress. You know, my, you know,

153
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.670
in 50 degrees you have 30 to 60 minutes before you black out. My arms were just,

154
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.630
you know, it's like, I consider myself a strong swimmer. Like I free dive,

155
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:34.600
you know, all this stuff. And I just, you know,

156
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:39.310
it's like you read these stories about, uh, how people die, you know,

157
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.640
of just like they succumb to hypothermia on a local hike or they drown in the

158
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:45.640
Bay, you know? And the story is always like, well, Timmy was a strong swimmer,

159
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.280
but he drove in and you're like really was Timmy really a strong swimmer because

160
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.040
he'd drown in the bed, you know? And like floating there, you know,

161
00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:54.490
it just all came to me. I'm like, wow, this is how this happens. You know,

162
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.550
you just make a series of pretty dumb,

163
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.140
small decisions until you find yourself like floating in the dark in the Bay.

164
00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:05.130
There's no one around and it's a really slow process too. You know? It's like.

165
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.260
<v 3>It's not like, you know, you.</v>

166
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.720
<v 1>Just come to terms with the idea that like, you're not gonna make it.</v>

167
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.060
And it's not, it's not sudden,

168
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:14.760
it's not like someone shot you or you got hit by a bus or something like that.

169
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:19.710
It's like this hour long thing that you're getting dragged through all alone and

170
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:24.300
you, and you realize like no one will ever even know what this was,

171
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.230
you know how this happened.

172
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.720
And you think about all the people like Joshua Slocum, Jim gray,

173
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.490
people who were lost at sea and you realize they all had this thing that they

174
00:09:32.491 --> 00:09:35.610
went through, you know, this hour long ordeal of just floating alone.

175
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:39.330
And no one will even ever know what that was or what that was like, you know?

176
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.200
And, uh, eventually I realized I was going to make sure I looked back,

177
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.950
the boat was like way far away from me. I started drifting back towards it.

178
00:09:46.951 --> 00:09:49.080
I was still trying to swim. I,

179
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.240
I realized at some point that I wasn't going to hit it.

180
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.310
I wasn't going to hit the boat on the way back down wind.

181
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.350
And I had to just give it all that.

182
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:59.520
I had to try to connect with the boat, you know, to,

183
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:04.170
to stop myself from getting blown past it. And in that moment too,

184
00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:09.060
you realize that like uncertainty is the most unendurable condition,

185
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.480
you know, that like you imagine yourself making it to shore and relaxing,

186
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:16.440
you know, just knowing that it's resolved. Right. And in that moment of like,

187
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.270
I might not make it back to this boat. You're,

188
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:23.280
you're like tempted to give up because it's the same resolution, you know,

189
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:26.020
it's the feeling of just knowing, you know, the, the,

190
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.750
the uncertainties have been resolved, you know,

191
00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.690
and you have to really remind yourself that it's not the same, you know,

192
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:33.840
that like you have to give it everything you have in order to survive, you know?

193
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:34.051
And that,

194
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:37.740
that feeling that you're sort of longing for is not actually the feeling that

195
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.990
you want, you know? Uh, and I just barely got the,

196
00:10:40.991 --> 00:10:43.830
the end of a rope that was trailing off of the back of the hole,

197
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.730
pull myself back on it almost threw up. Um, then I had to,

198
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.390
then I was just floating there with the, with the, the whole, you know,

199
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:54.690
three feet under water. I tied myself to it. Um,

200
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.830
I started to get tunnel vision and really at the last minute, um,

201
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.250
I S a tugboat, uh, started, uh,

202
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.750
coming through the area and it was coming straight at me actually. And I,

203
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.300
I realized that it probably just wouldn't even see me.

204
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:13.710
It would just run me over and not even know that I had been there, you know,

205
00:11:13.711 --> 00:11:17.640
it's totally possible. Um, and I was just, you know, I was trying to like wave.

206
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:19.260
I could barely lift my arm. I was trying to scream.

207
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:23.100
I could barely make any noise. And somehow they saw me. And, uh.

208
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.990
<v 3>They.</v>

209
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.860
<v 1>They, like, it took them like 15 minutes to like, get a rope around me.</v>

210
00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:30.270
And they started pulling me off the side of the boat.

211
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.310
And it was like lining every tugboat is, um, tires, like tires usually,

212
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.930
um, as like a fender, you know,

213
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:41.160
and I got like wedged in the tires as they were pulling me up and I knew what

214
00:11:41.161 --> 00:11:42.270
was happening, you know? And I was like,

215
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.620
all I have to do is stick my leg out and push against the whole of the boat,

216
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.430
you know, to like go around the tires and I couldn't do it. Wow. Uh,

217
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.500
and I knew I could barely see, and they like swung me around.

218
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.270
It eventually pulled me up. They like put me in, uh,

219
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.970
next to the engines and the engine room. I couldn't, you know,

220
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.490
I couldn't even feel the heat. Uh,

221
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.430
and they called the coast guard and the coast guard came and got me.

222
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.310
It was like really embarrassing. And the coast guard, like, you know,

223
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.300
th th the coast guard guys, like, you know, he's like, God,

224
00:12:09.301 --> 00:12:11.440
these blankets over me. And he's like trying to like talk to me to like,

225
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:16.150
keep me like alert, you know? And, uh, and you know, he's like, so is this,

226
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.040
is this your first time sailing?

227
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:24.490
And I'm like a commercial, like a 250 ton, like masters license, you know, like,

228
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.750
it's like, you need 600 days at sea to get this license, you know? Uh,

229
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.140
and I was like, no, I, I have a master's license. And he was like, what?

230
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.800
He's like, you're a idiot, man. You know, like everything changed.

231
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:39.580
The tone totally changed. Oh God dude, that's insane.
