00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.420
<v 1>I remember the first day that, uh, I was at Twitter, um,</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
the, at the time, uh,

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:13.620
the most popular person on Twitter was Justin Bieber.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.840
He had more followers than any other person, you know.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.460
<v 2>Was that when you guys were trying to rig it so that he wasn't, uh,</v>

7
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.270
trending number one, always. Cause they did do that. Right.

8
00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:26.180
I don't remember that. I was, Oh, I don't remember conveniently.

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.910
<v 0>They.</v>

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.000
<v 2>Me and I were talking about that one day because they had to do something</v>

11
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.260
because they didn't do something.

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.350
Justin Bieber would be the number one topic every day,

13
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300
no matter what was happening in the world.

14
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.560
<v 1>I believe that they wanted to change that because the pro the problem was at the</v>

15
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:44.540
time Twitter was held together with like, you know,

16
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.390
bubble gum and like dental floss or whatever, you know?

17
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:50.450
So it's like every time Bieber would tweet, like, you know,

18
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:53.570
the lights would dim and like the building, like kind of shake a little bit.

19
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.100
<v 2>There it goes. So they block me from trending. This is 2010.</v>

20
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.070
I'm actually honored. Not even Matt. He's also 12.

21
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.600
Then I get on and see yet again, my fans are unstoppable. Love you. Okay.

22
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.720
<v 1>But, okay. So there's, you know, people talk about like invisible labor,</v>

23
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.730
like the invisible labor behind that tweet.

24
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.110
It was just kind of comical because it's like, when he did that, you know,

25
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.590
people like, you know, it's like my first day there, you know, it's like he,

26
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.110
he tweeted something and, you know, the building's like kind of shaking it.

27
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.900
Like alarms are going off. People are like scrambling around, you know?

28
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.730
And it was just this, you know,

29
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:28.130
it's like this realization where you're just like, never in my life.

30
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.870
Did I think that anything Justin Bieber did would like really affect me in any

31
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.620
like deep way, you know? And then here I am just like scrambling around to like,

32
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:37.130
facilitate that.

33
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.620
<v 2>What are your thoughts on curating?</v>

34
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.510
What trends and what doesn't trend and whether or not social media should

35
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.380
have any sort of obligation in terms of

36
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.840
how things,

37
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.850
whether or not people see things like shadow banning and things along those

38
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:59.840
lines. Like, I I'm very torn on this stuff cause I, I,

39
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.990
I think that things should just be,

40
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.040
and if you have a situation where Justin is the most popular thing on the

41
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:09.920
internet, that's just what it is. It is what it is.

42
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.090
But I also get it. I get how you would say, well,

43
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.460
this is going to up our whole program.

44
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.170
Like what we're trying to do with this thing.

45
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.110
<v 1>What do you mean up our whole program?</v>

46
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.280
<v 2>Well, what you're trying to do with Twitter, I mean,</v>

47
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:30.140
I would assume what you're trying to do is give people a place where they could

48
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:34.760
share important information and, uh, you know, have people,

49
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.900
you know, I mean,

50
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:40.550
Twitter has been used successfully to overturn governments.

51
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:41.840
I mean, there there's,

52
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.580
there's Twitter has been used to break news on very important events and

53
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.680
alert people to danger. And there's,

54
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.140
there's so many positive things about Twitter. And if,

55
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.030
if it's overwhelmed by Justin Bieber and Justin Bieber fan accounts,

56
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:56.990
and just to be repo,

57
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.570
if it's overwhelmed and the top 10 that are trending are all

58
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:02.404
nonsense.

59
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.480
I could see how someone would think we're going to do a good thing

60
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.710
by suppressing that. Yeah,

61
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.430
I see what you're saying. Well, why do you think they did suppress that?

62
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.570
What do you think you work there? Why do you think they kept him from trending?

63
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.460
<v 1>Um, well, I mean, I don't know about that specific situation.</v>

64
00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:30.060
I mean, I think, I think, you know, looking at the larger picture, right? Like,

65
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.030
um, in a way, you know, it's like, if you think about like 20 years ago,

66
00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:39.600
whenever anybody talked about like society, you know, um,

67
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.330
everyone would always say like, the problem is the media.

68
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.630
It's like the media man. Yeah. If only we could change the media.

69
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.120
And a lot of people in who were interested in like

70
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.210
a better and brighter future were really focused on self-publishing their whole

71
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:56.430
conferences about it on ground underground publishing conference.

72
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:59.760
Now the allied media conference, people were writing scenes. Uh, people were,

73
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.980
you know, getting their own printing presses, uh, people, you know, we,

74
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.040
we were convinced that if we, um,

75
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.490
made publishing more equitable,

76
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.030
if everybody had the equal ability to like produce and consume content that the

77
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:16.320
world would change. And in some ways,

78
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.940
like what we have today is like the fantasy of,

79
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.030
you know, those dreams from 20 years ago. Um,

80
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.720
but in a couple of ways, you know, like, uh, one, you know,

81
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:33.270
it was, it was, it was the dream that if, you know,

82
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.510
a cop kill some random person in the suburbs of St.

83
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:41.370
Louis that like everyone would know about it, you know, um, just,

84
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.320
you know, everyone knows. Um,

85
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.160
and also that anybody could share their weird ideas about the world, you know?

86
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.320
And I think in some ways, um, we were wrong, you know,

87
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:56.700
that we thought, uh, like, you know, the, what we got today is like, yeah,

88
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.030
like if a cop kills somebody in the suburbs of St. Louis,

89
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:00.990
like everybody knows about it.

90
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.110
I think we overestimated how much that would matter. Uh,

91
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.030
and I think we also believed that the things that everyone would be sharing

92
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.880
for like our weird ideas about the world. And instead we got like, you know,

93
00:05:11.881 --> 00:05:16.740
flat earth then like, you know, uh anti-vax and like, you know, all this stuff.

94
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:19.320
Right. Uh, and so it's like, in a sense, like,

95
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:21.810
I'm glad that those things exist because they're like,

96
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.120
they're sort of what we wanted, you know? Uh, but I think what we did,

97
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.840
what we underestimated is like how, uh, important the medium is,

98
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:32.910
like the medium is the message kind of thing. And that,

99
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:36.120
like what we were doing at the time of like, you know,

100
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:37.500
writing scenes and sharing information,

101
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.490
I don't think we understood how much that was predicated on like actually

102
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:45.540
building community and like relationships with each other. And that like, just,

103
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.360
um, like what we didn't want was just like more channels on the television and

104
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:54.260
that's sort of what we got, you know? Uh, and so I think, you know,

105
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:56.700
it's like everyone is like on YouTube trying to monetize their content,

106
00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:59.200
whatever know, and that it's the same thing,

107
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.480
like bad business models produce like bad technology and bad outcomes.

108
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.470
And so I think there's concern about that, but I think,

109
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.240
um, I think like, you know,

110
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.060
now that there's, there's like, you know,

111
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.060
these two simultaneous truths that everyone seems to believe that are in

112
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.880
contradiction with each other, you know, like one is that like, um,

113
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.810
everything's relative, uh, everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

114
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.140
All opinions are equally valid. And to like, um,

115
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.480
our democracy is impossible without a shared understanding of what is true and

116
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:33.314
what is false,

117
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.520
the information that we share needs to be verified by our most trusted

118
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:38.354
institutions. You know,

119
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.170
like people seem to simultaneously believe both of these things and, um,

120
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.900
they are in direct contradiction with each other. Um,

121
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.230
and so in some ways I think most of the questions about, you know,

122
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.500
social media in our time are about like trying to resolve those contradictions.

123
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.010
And, but I think, you know, um,

124
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.630
I think it's way more complicated than the way, uh,

125
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.580
that the social media companies are trying to portray.
