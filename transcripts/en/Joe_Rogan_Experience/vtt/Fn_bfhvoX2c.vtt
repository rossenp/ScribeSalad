00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. What are you telling me about acid?</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.990
Talk to me right into that, because it was very.

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.800
<v 1>And I stopped you because it was too good. It was like, it was very interesting.</v>

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.250
When you were saying that you did it once and you,

5
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.240
you were in a bathtub and it was interesting, but then you did it.

6
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.130
Where were you the second time he did it.

7
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.020
<v 2>Well, the first time I did it, I was with, uh, three other people and we like,</v>

8
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.680
you know,

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.520
it was celebrating someone's birthday and all my friends are like pretty

10
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:33.200
spiritual in that way, like meditative and you know, no, it's good stuff.

11
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.810
<v 0>I love it. I'm kidding.</v>

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.350
<v 2>Can be annoying. I agree that can be really people.</v>

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.880
<v 1>100% When it's inauthentic. It's super noisy.</v>

14
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.940
<v 2>Yeah. No, I, I think there's,</v>

15
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.290
it's like any other area of you pick up on and you're like, mm, no.

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.650
<v 1>I had two different yoga teachers that did the same thing. And with one of them,</v>

17
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:52.940
it was amazing. When the other one,

18
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.710
it was so annoying whether the guy would like chant and class and he would sing

19
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.760
and I'd be like, let get me away from this. It was just a artist.

20
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.940
It was like a fake spiritual guy. But then another guy who did it,

21
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.460
his classes were all donation-based.

22
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.990
You didn't have to pay to come see ladies pull up in Mercedes and not pay a

23
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.943
bill. Like you'd tear it.

24
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.380
<v 0>Oh, they just wouldn't pay.</v>

25
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.550
<v 1>One or the bad, the good one, the good ones. He did the exact same thing.</v>

26
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:21.590
But you can tell there was no pretense. It was all.

27
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.160
<v 2>No, I'm I'm with you though. I feel the same way.</v>

28
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.220
I have spiritual friends and it was more of like a weed.

29
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.750
I laughed for like eight hours.

30
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:34.280
It was just like laugh therapy and just surround like wonderful

31
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:39.200
people. Just good, energetic. And I was so I was high for like two days,

32
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.320
but I found myself wanting to like go in and I kept going into his bathtub and

33
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.830
like, he had like this glass door. So when you shut it,

34
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:53.480
the sound was really warm. And that's what I wanted. And,

35
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.210
but I didn't really get to go there cause everyone's like, come back.

36
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.570
Let's all like, hang out. You know? And so, uh,

37
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.430
last week I went with my best girlfriend to celebrate her mother's

38
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:09.110
birthday and her mom passed away five years ago and we went out to Joshua tree.

39
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.400
It was beautiful. I mean, first and foremost,

40
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.320
that the thing that I admire most about the

41
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:23.000
process is like setting an intention when you want to heal from it, you know,

42
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:26.510
like you can party. Like I did the week before we were just like hanging out,

43
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.870
but I wanted to go somewhere else. And we did.

44
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.220
And you know, there was this moment too,

45
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.210
where we were sitting just the two of us were sitting around a fire and my

46
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:42.530
friend's been through some crazy, crazy in her life, like dark stuff.

47
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.780
And there's this like space of sacred pain where like she

48
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:50.240
told me things that no one she doesn't talk about and she's like,

49
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.630
it comes out and vice versa. And it was just this, like,

50
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.790
that's the place where we put it.

51
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.370
That's the place where we had love for each other and was like, I see you.

52
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.070
I respect all your you've been through.

53
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.640
And then we went to like the next phase of it, of the trip.

54
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.460
And at one point, you know,

55
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.030
we were laughing too going in and out of like laughing hysterically and having

56
00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:16.780
like the best time and then having this like intense spiritual moments and, and,

57
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.740
and therapeutic as such. Like, that's why I love it.

58
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.900
But at one point I don't know how to describe it.

59
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.830
Like we, first of all, the stars like were,

60
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.290
there was like galactic geometry. Like,

61
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.640
you can just see all this crazy in the sky and it feels alive.

62
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.920
And at one point we went up, it was like this cabin.

63
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.380
And then you had to walk up the Hill for the bathroom in the kitchen.

64
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:46.150
So you're really in the middle of nowhere.

65
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.830
And at one point like the frequency changed and it went

66
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.400
and the only other time I'd experienced,

67
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:58.960
that was when I smoked DMT like a decade ago. And it scared me.

68
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.870
Cause I was like, there is, there is something, there was like,

69
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.770
there is an energy that just presented itself and,

70
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.740
and my friend and I experienced it at the same time,

71
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.360
which I don't think is a thing that happens for people often. I don't know,

72
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:16.930
like I've never had, like, we were visited by like,

73
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.710
it felt like another star system mean, it sounds like Hocus Pocus, but I.

74
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.090
<v 1>I think it's hard to just poke. It was amazing.</v>

75
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:27.450
That's why I wanted you to talk about it. I think, I think we're, uh,

76
00:04:27.451 --> 00:04:32.220
we have a limited idea of what's possible in terms of like what

77
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.900
reality is. And when you do psychedelic drugs, you,

78
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:39.810
you experienced this thing that you can't experience naturally, right?

79
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.673
You have this,

80
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.210
these wild visualizations and you feel like you're being visited by

81
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.140
entities and things are communicating with you. And so people say, well,

82
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:51.630
it's hallucinations. Your mind is playing tricks on you and all these things.

83
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.270
It might be that for sure.

84
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.370
But also it might be possible that there's a frequency that you can tap into

85
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:01.650
with these things that's not available to you.

86
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.770
And that these things are always here. So like,

87
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.510
there's a lot of people that think when,

88
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:10.590
when we're talking about like the UFO phenomenon, there's a lot,

89
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.200
there's a lot of people that think these things aren't just visiting from other

90
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:14.130
star systems,

91
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.640
they're visiting from other dimensions and that they're there all the time and

92
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:21.900
they can come in and out and they can go. And we were like, Oh,

93
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.120
we're like trying to grab ghosts. Like, we're like,

94
00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.150
I just need to bring it home and show everybody at proof that you're never

95
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.610
gonna, you're never gonna have proof. It's like, it's not,

96
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.800
it's not available in this plane,

97
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.910
but when you do mushrooms or when you do acid or when you do DMT,

98
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.050
you get these windows into like what's around you all the time.

99
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.640
<v 2>Yeah. I think if you pay more attention to energy in that way too, it's like,</v>

100
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.830
this is going to sound super weird, but I, I it's, it is the truth. Like my,

101
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:50.880
my friend, you know,

102
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:55.620
her mother was this like incredibly like spiritual mystic woman.

103
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.290
And she collected, uh, gemstones from all over the world and jewels.

104
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.580
And one day, uh, KP, my friend was like, she's like, sous,

105
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.560
I really want you to have some of my mother's jewelry.

106
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:10.580
And it was like a great honor. And I was like, well, yeah,

107
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:14.630
I would love that. And I'm wearing some of it right now. And, um,

108
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.640
I started having dreams about her mom and it felt very like visited

109
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.830
and it wasn't like, it was really beautiful. So like that stuff,

110
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.870
when you are taking psychedelics and you have an intention of

111
00:06:29.871 --> 00:06:34.850
like settling things, you know, it, I believe in that,

112
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:38.840
like the fact that we both experienced this frequency change at the same time.

113
00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:41.270
And I was like, are you, are you hearing that? And are you seeing that?

114
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.980
Because it was like, it was like the, the whole sky,

115
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.520
like it flipped, it was like a photo negative.

116
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.103
It was so crazy.

117
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.140
<v 3>I'm missing out, man. I haven't, I haven't done LSD DMT.</v>

118
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.640
I've done mushrooms and I don't know how you can like hang out and be with

119
00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.140
people. I always kind of,

120
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.100
I started laughing a little bit and then I started to find myself disappear and

121
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.050
I'll be like hanging out with a tree or some.

122
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.320
<v 2>That's awesome. That's great. That's the best part.</v>

123
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.070
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, that's the best part of mushrooms is nature, right? Yeah.</v>

124
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.090
<v 3>Yeah. But there's some you definitely get from that, you know,</v>

125
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.030
feeling re-energized and, you know, kind of like a reset.

126
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:23.230
That's kinda what I get from that.

127
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.370
<v 1>It's phenomenal for people with PTSD, people with PTSD,</v>

128
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:32.230
a lot of soldiers experience these mushroom trips and just relaxes and relieves

129
00:07:32.231 --> 00:07:35.230
them of a lot of the pressure that they have, you know.

130
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.710
<v 2>It's um, but like per year point, like,</v>

131
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.670
it is important to make sure you're in good hands with whoever you're doing it

132
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:46.450
with. Like, and it could be like one of your good buds, but like sometimes like,

133
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:50.110
you know, when some, some folks don't quite have a handle on their darkness,

134
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.980
you probably don't want to do acid for the first time with somebody like that,

135
00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:57.910
you know? And that's no disrespect to people, you know, that have to deal with.

136
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.440
It's just like, because there's no, um, there's no seatbelt, you know,

137
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:03.730
like you're just going.

138
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.391
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

139
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:07.570
that was my first kind of first trip was hanging with a bunch of folks and we

140
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:11.850
hadn't done it before. All of a sudden the guy's house we were that he was like,

141
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.150
y'all need to get the out of my house right now. I'm in high school.

142
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:19.150
I was skipping high school. I'm like, I'm skipping high school.

143
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.460
So we spent the whole day with like tripping balls. Right.

144
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.710
And then all of a sudden he freaks out.

145
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:28.210
And so I got to go home and I'm skipping. So I just kind of standing out,

146
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:32.050
walking around my neighborhood, staring sign and with nowhere to go.

147
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:35.410
I finally go back to my house, tripping ball. My mom's there,

148
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.110
my little sister's there, my grandma's there. Nah,

149
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.600
I just went up to my room and just curled into a ball from them.

150
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.570
<v 1>I remember one time tripping and it's only happened to me once,</v>

151
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:47.230
but one time trip and where I felt like I could see

152
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.990
the patterns of existence that aren't available

153
00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.430
with the naked eye.

154
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:58.850
Like I could see that there's like some weird like grid, everything.

155
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.770
<v 2>Yes. The grid you've seen the grid. I've seen the grid. It's like the matrix.</v>

156
00:09:03.771 --> 00:09:06.170
It's so weird. You kind of like.

157
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.690
<v 1>It's like what? You can almost step through it. Sometimes.</v>
