00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.360
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.720
<v 2>So what's happening with your show, man? What are you doing? What's the latest,</v>

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.480
oh. You're.

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.440
<v 0>Just gonna go right for the big.</v>

5
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.120
<v 1>One. Let's get in there, man. All right. First of all, I love your show.</v>

6
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.880
I've been loving it for years. It's fun and I'm a giant muscle car fan,

7
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.520
so it's right up my alley, but, uh, what's the latest, well.

8
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.430
<v 0>Everybody holding onto your hat out there fast and loud is no more.</v>

9
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.310
Uh, I have exited discovery and, uh, I'm a free agent.

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.870
What we're gonna be doing some cool things in 2021. And, uh, it just was, uh,

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.150
a perfect storm. So to speak. It was time for me to, uh, uh,

12
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:36.070
expand and grow a little bit.

13
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.470
And I'd kind of gotten to the top of that mountain, uh, being discovery.

14
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:43.780
And there, there wasn't anything else for me to do there. So, wow. I used to,

15
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580
you know, this year, uh, to kind of rethink and, uh,

16
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:51.060
reshape what I wanna do in the future. And, uh, so, uh, fast and loud,

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.620
no ma jeez Louise man, eight years though. And that's a long run, you know,

18
00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:01.380
that's very hundred-ish episodes and, uh, you know, that's,

19
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.050
there's only so many times you can buy a car, fix a car, sell a car,

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.850
and it was time to make some changes, make it more fun. And uh,

21
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:11.810
so the stuff we've got coming out in 2021 is gonna be quite a blast. What.

22
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.843
<v 1>You.</v>

23
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.130
<v 0>You know, I want let the cat outta the bag. So to speak.</v>

24
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.890
<v 1>A wonder woman bracelets. Yeah. &lt;laugh&gt; shaking off bullets with those.</v>

25
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.360
<v 0>Yeah. Lady asked me one touch. She goes, don't those bother you?</v>

26
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:27.600
When they make noise, they only make noise when I do this.

27
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.800
<v 1>Did you tell that to her? Yeah.</v>

28
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.080
<v 0>&lt;Laugh&gt;, it's.</v>

29
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.640
<v 1>A good joke. Uncomfortable conversation. Uh, she thought it was funny.</v>

30
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.360
<v 0>Oh, you know, that was the back of my single days. Right? Person. Well,</v>

31
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.720
I'm married now. Right? Person. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, yeah, we're gonna,

32
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.070
I think I'm gonna end up doing a podcast cuz there's not a whole lot going on in

33
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:45.590
my genre, in the podcast world. I mean,

34
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.150
I know some guys are doing it and they're doing well,

35
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.470
but I've never been allowed to before, you know? So you gotta,

36
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.870
you gotta realize that when I signed my deal with, uh,

37
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:56.910
disco was almost 10 years ago, you.

38
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.863
<v 1>Call it disco. Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.910
<v 0>So disco, so discovery didn't, you know, social media didn't even exist hard.</v>

40
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.740
Yeah. Yeah. So I signed off on all media.

41
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.540
So up to this point until literally.

42
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.420
<v 1>You know, a couple of all media, including social media.</v>

43
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.540
<v 0>It wasn't even social media back then. I mean,</v>

44
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.060
what is it like MySpace or something?

45
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.820
<v 1>Well, I was doing something on, uh,</v>

46
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:22.020
another network back in the day and they wanted to get control of my social

47
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:23.970
media. That was like part of the deal.

48
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.570
And they thought it was just like an easy, yes, no, it's not. And I was like,

49
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:31.610
you can eat. There's no way you could pay for it. But well, it was ridiculous.

50
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:34.690
They wanted to use it to promote other shows on their network. Correct.

51
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.210
I'm like, what are you talking about? And they're like, well,

52
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:40.730
everybody else lets us do it. I go, I have millions of followers.

53
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:44.960
Like there's no chance. You're just gonna get access to that free. Now.

54
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.720
<v 0>I had the same conversation several times. They wanted.</v>

55
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.960
<v 1>It's weird conversation. Right? It's like that, you know, they're being,</v>

56
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.040
weasely like, you know, this is a valuable thing, you know, Hey, no big deal,

57
00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:56.920
Richard. We'd just like to use your entire social media to, uh,

58
00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:59.640
promote a lot of other discovery programs. No big deal. Yeah. No big deal.

59
00:02:59.641 --> 00:03:01.480
You're cool with that. Right. Okay. Good sign here.

60
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.880
<v 0>Well, see they try that. But uh, I couldn't post myself.</v>

61
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.520
I couldn't do things like of myself for a lot of the time.

62
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:13.240
Like if I went out and bought a car and my camera crew wasn't with me and so I

63
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:16.120
took my camera phone and whatever, and I wanted to post about it.

64
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.950
I wasn't able to do that. You weren't allowed no who? Yeah,

65
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.630
it was pretty rough, but that's ridiculous.

66
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.270
<v 1>But that would just boost up your social media, which would boost up the show.</v>

67
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.630
You.

68
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.951
<v 0>Would think.</v>

69
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.750
So you would think that that would be the thought that I'm going to, uh,

70
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.430
you know, help boost the show. Help walk.

71
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.790
<v 1>Me through a conversation with one of these knuckleheads. I can't well,</v>

72
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.350
a fake conversation. Pretend I can't let's pretend it's not discovery channel.

73
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.220
<v 0>Let me tell you it's uh, it's called the HHA network. Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:46.940
It's let me tell you it's so it's so bad. You know, the question would be how,

75
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.740
how was my tenure there? You know, and how, how well was I treated? And uh,

76
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.660
so the answer is, um,

77
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.940
there's a piece of the contract of the contract when I exited.

78
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.220
<v 1>Oh, that you can't talk that I can't.</v>

79
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.250
<v 0>Talk it's up to the $25,000.</v>

80
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.810
Fine per occurrence of you per occurrence of you talking of me talking. Oh well,

81
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:05.930
can I talk? You can talk as much as you want. I love.

82
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.570
<v 1>The discovery channel. &lt;laugh&gt; I would talk, but I watched their.</v>

83
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.850
<v 0>Programs. I like it time. I like it too.</v>

84
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.290
I think the automotive programming could have been a little stronger and we

85
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:17.490
wanted to make some changes, but we were just kind of stuck in a rut.

86
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.423
The problem is.

87
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.920
<v 1>They are business and businesses will get away with whatever they can get away</v>

88
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:22.121
with.

89
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.320
There's a reason why we had to make regulations to make sure that companies

90
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:27.120
don't dump chemicals into rivers. Yeah.

91
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.880
It's cuz there's certain people that when they can get away with something,

92
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:33.640
they'll get away with something. So anybody that's telling you,

93
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.480
but the problem is it's so shortsighted,

94
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:39.520
anybody that's telling you that you can't post something on your social media

95
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.870
without out a camera crew there, the representing discovery channel.

96
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.990
It's so silly because it would boost your social media. The more you post,

97
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.830
the more interesting you put particularly about muscle cars, right? The more,

98
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.310
the more it boosts your social media, the more people are gonna watch your show.

99
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.670
It's just, it's math. It's like the, the rising tide lifts all boats.

100
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.940
<v 0>Uh, I agree with you a hundred percent, but uh, the hours that be,</v>

101
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.380
they were not having it.

102
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:08.180
It took me five years of literally begging to do a crossover with, uh,

103
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.460
chip Fuze. No,

104
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.460
and of course that episode did so well that they all think they're, uh,

105
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:16.740
genius geniuses now. But, uh, you know, so I, I had a good run with discovery.

106
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.540
I'm ready for the next thing, which, uh, by the way, if you're a,

107
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.810
if you're a producer or a, or a net work or a streamer out there,

108
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.010
I'm a free agent. And I would have to say, I might be a very big free agent.

109
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.410
