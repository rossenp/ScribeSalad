00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience who knew who Michael Keaton was when beetle juice came</v>

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:06.080
out.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.490
<v 1>He was a comic and he was on a television show before that. Really? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.790
Michael Keith was on a sitcom. I'm trying to think of what it was. Mr.

5
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.510
Something, right? Hmm. Mr. Big, is that a thing?

6
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:25.100
God it. I don't remember. But it was a sitcom working, working.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.190
What was it about stiffs working stiffs?

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.050
<v 2>He also did a little, uh, Tony Randall show.</v>

9
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.210
Tony Randall just pop up as this.

10
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.920
<v 1>Um, he was a standup. He was on evening at the improv.</v>

11
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.400
<v 0>Yeah, his is, he's got a big neon at the comedy store.</v>

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.670
<v 2>All's fair. In the Mary Tyler Moore hour. It says.</v>

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.760
<v 1>Yeah, he was around for awhile. And you know,</v>

14
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:54.500
there's a lot of people that really reluctant to accept him as

15
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:59.240
Batman. Hilarious. This is kinda like this thin guy. He doesn't,

16
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.350
it's not jacked. Might've been the best Batman.

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.330
<v 0>Without a doubt. Might've been the best Batman. No question about it.</v>

18
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.230
That's including Christian bale. Yeah. Not only was he the best Batman.

19
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.590
He was also the best. Bruce Wayne believable glasses.

20
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:17.810
Tip of his nose researching.

21
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.570
<v 1>Stupid fake voice though. There he is. Oh, Batman.</v>

22
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.380
<v 0>Fake voice. Did you see the founder is.</v>

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.630
<v 1>Being considered for a Batman role? There's a.</v>

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.120
<v 2>TV. I think he was going to be on the TV show.</v>

25
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.160
What was he going to be like Batman? There's like a TV show. Uh,

26
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.080
the flag here is going to pop up in the flash, I think is wired.

27
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.210
<v 1>Wow. He's in, he is in talks to play Batman. That's crazy.</v>

28
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.380
It was in the summer. They talked about it.

29
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.880
<v 2>You're using an ad blocker champion.</v>

30
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.850
<v 0>Ah, backup.</v>

31
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.100
<v 1>Slash um, who was the worst? Batman to the least believable Clooney.</v>

32
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.290
Ben Affleck. Yeah.

33
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.890
<v 2>Ben Affleck. Affleck. Nah. Well, yeah. Okay. Both of them.</v>

34
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.100
<v 0>I think Aflac has to take it, but I don't even know.</v>

35
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.160
<v 1>Athletes doing it still. That's the problem. Really? Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.000
They're doing a new movie now. Netflix, Batman again, the justice league.

37
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.620
He's been Affleck. He's not Batman. He's been Affleck.

38
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.850
I don't not like Ben Affleck. I like Ben Affleck, but that's bad.

39
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.720
That's not bad.

40
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.290
<v 2>We'll have the, uh, guy from, uh, Twilight is going to be him too.</v>

41
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.080
<v 1>Oh yes. Pattinson. Yeah. Yeah. Again, that's the guy from Twilight. Oh,</v>

42
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.943
that's not Batman.

43
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.190
<v 2>Because taking a Michael Keaton spot and the flash.</v>

44
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:44.180
So like a month later they announced Affleck's going to be him. So who knows?

45
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.070
<v 1>They need a new guy. He needed a new guy. Who's jacked.</v>

46
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.660
Right?

47
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.620
<v 0>Me after I get on testosterone, you're going to need a few years.</v>

48
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.180
I could be Robin. Now though.

49
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.790
<v 1>Could do the original one.</v>

50
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.290
It's so funny because the bat there was like the Batman comic books that were

51
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.890
very 1950s. Right. That, that sort of style.

52
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.870
And then there was, uh, the Batman, um,

53
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.250
those illustrated books. What do they call those graphic novels?

54
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.540
The graphic novels are very different because then the graphic novels novels,

55
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.630
it was very dark and very like really cool,

56
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.400
really well drawn and like heavy duty, like different Batman,

57
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.860
like Batman was jacked. And you know, there's like a lot of like serious, um,

58
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.140
storylines and a lot of heavy duty.

59
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.990
Now that was the Batman that sort of existed in th that was

60
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:47.800
the dark night. That was, uh, like the Christian bale, Batman.

61
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.720
That kind of made sense. But the original Batman for TV was ridiculous.

62
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.930
Look at him like, look how he's dressed to get that. It looks everything.

63
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.650
<v 0>Jeremiah. After the weight gain challenge.</v>

64
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.780
<v 1>The dude looked like he never worked out. He had this ridiculous belt on,</v>

65
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.100
he had silly shorts on the Cape.

66
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.380
Like the show was so dumb, like look at his muscle. They're non-existent wow.

67
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.250
He's li the, even the suit it's like, so campy and corny,

68
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.920
but it was that way on purpose. Like when you punch guys,

69
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:22.950
you'd see like a bam in front of the screen. Do you remember Batman?

70
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.873
You're too young.

71
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 0>Yeah. Did you watch it at all? I would like play on the adults.</v>

72
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.890
<v 1>[Inaudible] Batman. Yeah, it was so, so corny.</v>

73
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.080
Jeez. It was so campy and corny, but that's what it was.

74
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.100
And then when they went to Michael Keaton, like the movie was very different.

75
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:47.700
Like it was like brooding. And then when you get to Keith Heath ledger,

76
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.300
when he's ledgers playing Batman, he was the joke. Excuse me. The joker.

77
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.870
When he was playing the joker against Batman, rather you're getting this, uh,

78
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.490
like violent,

79
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.440
weird sort of character that is interacting with

80
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.200
Batman and taken over the city. There's half face,

81
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.290
literally half his face is seared off.

82
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.050
<v 0>Incredible. Hans Zimmer. Stepped it up on that one too.</v>

83
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:13.110
The music with the fleas. Wow.

84
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.270
<v 1>Wow. Who is he supposed to be with me? Yeah. It's Mr. Freeze. That's the name?</v>

85
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.980
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Those are terrible. That was the Clooney one, right? Yes.

86
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.680
That was like, let's get as many famous people as we can in a movie.

87
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.390
Let's just throw as much against the walls. We can see what sticks there.

88
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:33.060
Actually. Jim Carrey. Wasn't Michelle Pfeiffer in that too.

89
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.940
<v 2>Yeah, she was pleased. No,</v>

90
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.800
that was the one before she was in the Michael Keaton.

91
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.920
One where she was a fat cat woman member.

92
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.840
<v 1>Is that George Clooney? Yes, he looks good. Mostly good Batman. It's weird.</v>

93
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.160
He's got it. They totally redid the, the suit, like the game, some fake abs

94
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.523
fake.

95
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.210
