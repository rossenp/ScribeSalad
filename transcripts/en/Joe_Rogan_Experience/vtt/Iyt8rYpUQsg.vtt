00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.340
<v 0>The general can experience or gyms open out here. Yes. Okay. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:08.880
You can work it out. You definitely can't. You haven't been to digital in LA.

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.120
Haven't been able to work out in since the original thing.

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.570
<v 1>It's going to be over a year. They're going to,</v>

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.940
they're treating everybody like babies. This is what it is, man.

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.640
They're treating everybody like you're not allowed to make your own decisions,

7
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:22.400
including business owners that have spent a ton of money opening up these

8
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.800
outdoor cafes and outdoor restaurants.

9
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.730
And then they don't even supply any science. There's there's not even,

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.090
they're essentially autocrats, right? They're a dictator.

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.850
They come and they tell you what they're gonna close with.

12
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:36.410
They're not going to close. They don't have to show.

13
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.520
There's an overwhelming body of evidence that shows that all this is spreading

14
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:43.160
from yoga studios. We have to stop yoga. Right.

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.480
And even then it'd be like, okay, inside. Yoga's bad.

16
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:52.160
But what about park yoga? Is that okay? Is it okay to do parking lot yoga?

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.110
I think there's just no data.

18
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.970
So you have these people that are idiots. They're so dumb.

19
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:02.810
They keep getting busted going on vacation when they're telling everybody to

20
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:03.830
stay home. Yeah.

21
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.510
The mayor of Austin told people it's not time to relax while he was in

22
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:11.990
Cabo. Crazy.

23
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:16.220
That is to go to Cabo and be in a condo in Cabo and go, listen,

24
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.540
we can't relax. Like don't travel. Stay away from people. All right. Take care.

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.010
Shuts off assault. Dat dat, dat they're partying.

26
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.210
Gavin Newsome.

27
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.250
He didn't dinner at a fancy restaurant in Napa with his friends.

28
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.470
No social distancing, no masks.

29
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.940
Right on top of each other doors closed in doors. There's a roof.

30
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.670
There's a door shut. There's a glass window. I mean,

31
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.820
maybe there was like a part of that door where you could open up and you can go

32
00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:47.540
outside. That's not an endorsed or that's not outdoors.

33
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.520
Outdoors is no roof over your head.

34
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.440
You don't have a chandelier outdoors, outdoors.

35
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.960
Did you see sky? That's outdoors? You.

36
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.370
You can't have a roof and chandelier and say, I'm eating outdoors.

37
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.410
That's a lie. You're lying. But look out the window, bro.

38
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.680
The mayor of Chicago, same thing gets bused to getting their haircut.

39
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.680
These people are gross. They're gross.

40
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.000
They keep getting busted doing the things they're trying to tell people not to

41
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.000
do. And I don't know why they don't think they're going to get caught.

42
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.050
They keep getting caught. And it's, it's crazy that you,

43
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.680
I don't understand it. I don't understand it. I, I,

44
00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:28.370
there's gotta be a better way to do this.

45
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:31.820
That allows people to keep their businesses, keep their businesses open,

46
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.290
stay healthy, go out.

47
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.330
<v 0>I eat 100% of my meals out. I have a weird,</v>

48
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.290
you know, lifestyle. I don't eat at home. Um, and

49
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.780
we made friends with some of these people these past few months, you know,

50
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.020
I found some new restaurants and things like that.

51
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:55.070
And once you make friends with them and you talk to them a bit,

52
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.860
you end up, they end up sharing with you like, Oh yeah, this, but we're,

53
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.140
you know, we're really struggling. We're on our last leg.

54
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.710
My father who's owned arrest who owned a restaurant for 30 years.

55
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:07.660
Closed it in June.

56
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:12.220
It's already some other like corporate janky.

57
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.330
Someone tagged me in a picture. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

58
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.080
Closed this Italian restaurant restaurant for almost 30 years.

59
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.550
It was his entire life.

60
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:26.260
He would hang out with people at the bar until at his bar until,

61
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.920
you know, one, two, 3:00 AM. And he would start, uh,

62
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.670
making the sauce and stuff at five or six,

63
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.450
he would sleep for a couple of few hours and then start another day of his

64
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:41.080
entire everything was that. Um,

65
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.520
and I, I hope to check on him, see how he's doing. But uh,

66
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.850
but I can't imagine him doing anything else.

67
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:52.990
I always assumed he was going to do that absolutely forever. But this is,

68
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.550
this is the story for almost all restaurant owners, man.

69
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:58.420
They just don't have that.

70
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.780
They're more like comedians or artists or something like they spend the money

71
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:04.810
that they make. You know, it's sort of just a different,

72
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.930
you take care of so many people you sorta want to be taken care of.

73
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:11.110
So they like vacationing and they liked doing this and they liked doing that.

74
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.240
So, so many of them, and it costs a lot of money.

75
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.860
<v 1>And for a lot of restaurant owners, it almost is like an art form. Like,</v>

76
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.440
or almost like a source of entertainment too,

77
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.010
because you're not just providing a delicious meal.

78
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.670
You're also giving them a nice environment. You're welcoming them.

79
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.890
It's hospitality is a big part of it.

80
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.290
<v 0>So many of these places, you know,</v>

81
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.180
we found this one place driving around one night. Um, we drove by this,

82
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.950
uh, Italian restaurant. We were starving and like everything was closed, close,

83
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:44.550
close, close, close. It was like a Wednesday at nine. Right? We were,

84
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:48.630
it was a long shot. We drove by this one place and we ended up the kid worked.

85
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:51.420
There was the grandson, the grandfather's the owner,

86
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:55.200
the grandma's inside answering the phone, unloading wine or whatever.

87
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.070
Like you would see her if you use the restroom. My point is like they were,

88
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.390
they had, he was honest, you know, he was just, they're just open people again.

89
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.830
We bought these heat lamps. Uh, you know, this is crazy.

90
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:10.200
What do we have to do? It's like an app. It was an alleyway.

91
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.980
And I know for a fact, even though we didn't say it, that there, they weren't,

92
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.090
they just, weren't having a good year to say the least. Um,

93
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.493
and uh,

94
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.370
and it's just frightening to think that all these places with all these good

95
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:25.200
people in LA,

96
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.680
aren't going to have a chance that opening up after they spend money on the heat

97
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:32.820
lamps, after they completely reorganized their entire structure.

98
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.330
<v 1>I see.</v>

99
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.070
Has there been any big cities that decided to just try to stay open

100
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.250
most of the pandemic? I don't think so. Right.

101
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.880
I don't think there's any big cities that are run by Republicans. Are there.

102
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.220
<v 0>Uh, big cities run by Republicans?</v>

103
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.500
<v 1>They just left everything open.</v>

104
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.540
<v 0>Basically. I mean like mayors. Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.970
<v 1>Like what about Miami? Just Googling me. I was like.</v>

106
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.080
Miami might be Miami. I think Miami,

107
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.880
I think Florida as a whole, the governor of Florida has basically said, listen,

108
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.930
the cure can't be worse than the disease. And it's killing our businesses.

109
00:06:11.931 --> 00:06:15.380
It's killing our people. It's like a lot of people are committing suicide.

110
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:17.750
A lot of people are getting addicted to drugs and you know,

111
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:21.710
and he took a pragmatic approach and you could disagree or, or agree.

112
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.590
And a lot of people disagree and I understand it. There,

113
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.760
there is an issue though that a lot of people who disagree with him,

114
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:31.750
being able to him being able to do this and opening things up there,

115
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.350
they're financially capable of surviving a year or even

116
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:41.210
longer without work. And many of them are actually in the middle of work.

117
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.860
And, uh, I don't want to cast any aspersions. I don't want to cast any blame.

118
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:47.420
I don't know. I don't want to point any fingers.

119
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.410
That's not what I'm trying to do.

120
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.970
But what I want to say is that it's really difficult

121
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.350
to even imagine. And this is coming from someone who doesn't have to imagine it.

122
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.850
So I know how ridiculous this sounds,

123
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.040
but it's difficult to imagine the mindset of someone who's losing

124
00:07:04.041 --> 00:07:07.940
everything. If you're not losing anything, if your life is basically the same,

125
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.060
and this is the problem with some of the politicians, they,

126
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.900
they didn't get punished financially for their cities shutting down.

127
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.010
They didn't get punished financially for 40% of the businesses going under.

128
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.040
I mean, sure, it's going to be tough for them to get reelected,

129
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:25.640
but they can say, listen, we were in a pandemic. We did, we could,

130
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.820
we saved lives. That'll be, that'll be the propaganda.

131
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.560
That'll be what they put the pitch that they saved lives by doing this.

132
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:34.723
But they don't,

133
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.740
they don't act the way a person would act if their

134
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.010
entire life's work was on the line,

135
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.900
like your dad and his restaurant,

136
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.800
they don't act like that person where they find a way to keep things open and

137
00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:52.580
keep things reasonably safe, where they find a way, look, there's a,

138
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.380
there's a better solution here.

139
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.740
What we've got to do is like keep people healthier and that'll lower the numbers

140
00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:00.980
of cases. And that will also lower the severity of cases.

141
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.850
And that allow us to open places up to a reasonable extent. You know,

142
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.890
how about we do this? How about we do that? How about,

143
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.850
is there a better way to protect people than handkerchiefs?

144
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.180
Like what's better handkerchiefs and 95 masks. Can we just get everybody?

145
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:17.630
And then 95 mask, it seems like that's a better way to go. Those things.

146
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.180
Like nothing gets through those, but handkerchiefs, he could blow.

147
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.770
You ever see demonstrations,

148
00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:25.340
people do with a handkerchief and a mask as a mask rather. And they,

149
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.490
they let a lighter and go and blow the lighter out.

150
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.570
And then they do the same thing with like a cloth mask, little more difficult.

151
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.370
Then they go to an N 95 mask and nothing happens, nothing. It doesn't get out.

152
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.590
So that thing acts as Soho's hopefully some sort of a filter to keep

153
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.770
most of the viral load or whatever. I don't I'm, I don't know.

154
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.400
I don't know how it works, but when you look at the effectiveness of that mask,

155
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.300
let's say that if everybody had an awareness of 95 mask,

156
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:58.260
it cut infections down X amount percent. Let's do that. Let's do that.

157
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.770
And if you, if you're talking about Corona virus, like in LA,

158
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.900
there were saying 3%. I think it was three point.

159
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:08.790
1% was coming from restaurants would, if those people were wearing N 95 masks,

160
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.640
would that drop that 3.1 down to nothing?

161
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.900
Would it be one like is one acceptable where people can keep their living?

162
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.080
Like you got to look at these people. You got, first of all, you got to look.

163
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.100
Government's never been able to tell you, you can't work. This is unprecedented.

164
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.000
This is completely new.

165
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.490
Government has never been able to tell like everyone in an industry

166
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.930
I'm in the indoor dining industry, everyone in your industry can't work.

167
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.800
Government has never had that kind of power. Government has never,

168
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.490
ever in the history of the United States of America had the power to shuttle the

169
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.620
gyms down. So you can't say, Hey,

170
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.570
all you healthy studs and stud debts and stud exes. You,

171
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:52.830
you, you can't go work out. It's not up to you.

172
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.650
It's not the people who own that business. Sorry.

173
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.480
I know you've worked your whole life.

174
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.920
Maybe you did construction for 15 years and saved up half your pay and put it

175
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:03.930
all away with this dream of one day,

176
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:07.590
opening of this amazing gym and making your living off your own business.

177
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:12.360
You created yourself in the community that you live in, but no, no,

178
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:14.190
the government knows better than you.

179
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.700
And they get to decide whether or not you can work.

180
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.550
They get to decide whether or not you take chances,

181
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.390
whether or not you feel like you've adequately protected yourself from the

182
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:27.300
virus, whether you test enough, they get to this.

183
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.760
<v 0>And a curfew, the psychological effect of knowing. And by the way,</v>

184
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:34.850
they're not enforcing it. They're not cops. Aren't pulling you over and going,

185
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.541
what are you doing?

186
00:10:35.541 --> 00:10:39.770
But they don't need to the fact that you know that you're supposed to have a 10,

187
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.850
10:00 PM.

188
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.460
<v 1>Dude, you know what they should do. They should have a,</v>

189
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.910
a loud siren that plays throughout the city at 10,

190
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.360
just to freak you out. Like war of world style.

191
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.810
[inaudible] imagine tornado sirens in Ohio, where they have that. I could just,

192
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.060
just like that, like a tornado siren.

193
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.590
<v 0>We went from Texas back to California. It was like, uh,</v>

194
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.340
being on vacation and then going to boarding school psychologically.

195
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.880
It was like that it didn't, you know, there was no one enforcing the rules.

196
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.060
<v 1>Boarding school. It's more like juvenile detention. Yeah. Yeah. You're,</v>

197
00:11:17.061 --> 00:11:19.130
you're not, you're going to a book.

198
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.520
<v 0>Except juvenile detention. At least they feed you more.</v>

199
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.910
<v 1>Then you with a bunch of other ups, you get to have a good time. Yeah.</v>
