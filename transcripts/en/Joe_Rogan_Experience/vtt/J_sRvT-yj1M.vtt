00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I kind of wish I had that with like a wife.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.820
That's why I'm so scared of marriage because you change so much from just high

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.610
school to now or college to now, and then you get, um,

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.440
you get married and then you change again.

5
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:18.330
Maybe when you're 62 and then just stuck with this a plus size

6
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.380
lady, and you don't know what the hell to do and how to get out.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.370
And you can't meet anybody new because you're 62.

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.450
<v 1>That's the problem with the contract of marriage, right?</v>

9
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.250
That's the problem as it is a legal contract. And if it goes great antiquated,

10
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.840
it is in a lot of ways. Um, it's very good for, uh,

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.440
ensuring that there's like, uh, there's a bond.

12
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:42.620
That's not just your word. Yeah. You know, it's legal.

13
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:44.990
So if you do try to leave,

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.560
the woman at least has some sort of financial recourse in some case,

15
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:52.820
the men every now and then one of us we've we put one on the board. Right.

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.190
<v 0>Right, right. LeBron money.</v>

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.500
<v 1>From divorces. He's the goat.</v>

18
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.930
<v 0>Yeah. I think it's like when a black cop shoots a white guy,</v>

19
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.200
I'm sure it's the same with the black community. Or like when OJ one,

20
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:09.770
I lived in a black neighborhood and I could hear the yelling and people were

21
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:11.090
going nuts. Yeah.

22
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.370
<v 1>Every now and then a guy wins. Who else do we know of that is made money off a,</v>

23
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920
like a high profile divorce where the woman had all the money.

24
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.970
<v 0>New one that just came out with the actress that just divorced a guy.</v>

25
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:26.840
And he was a nobody. And he's cleaning up. But I can't think of who it is. Yeah.

26
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.650
Give him that a goop, JMO. I don't know how you would look that up, but yeah.

27
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.000
Guy killing it with hot actress. Wife. Yeah. I don't know.

28
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:38.360
But there is no better line. Yes. Oh.

29
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.540
<v 1>Kevin got fat. Like he just.</v>

30
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.070
<v 0>He was hot. He was a hunk. Some hot, sorry.</v>

31
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.550
<v 1>Hunka burning. Love. You had a six pack and look great. Yeah. Hot.</v>

32
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.040
What is that would look like now? I don't know. Now we got very big.

33
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.670
<v 0>Oh, there he is. The bottom, right? Yeah. He's a chubster. He got very busy.</v>

34
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.900
Not so bad though.

35
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.600
<v 1>Got a little gut there. [inaudible] scare. Oh Jesus. That's crasher. Never.</v>

36
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.520
Oh my God. He's got big clothing. He got big. But also, you know,

37
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:12.890
he's taken care of the kids under low stress.

38
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.240
<v 0>True. True. It's funny how all that stuff rolls, rolls out the window.</v>

39
00:02:17.241 --> 00:02:20.120
When it's like, when the tables flip, you know, it's like, Hey,

40
00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:22.430
women need their money to, and then when the guys like, I need my money.

41
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.200
It's like, Oh, what are you doing? And you're like, well,

42
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:27.920
that's what you've been doing. You know? It's like outcome. When it flips.

43
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.490
Now you're mad. Ah, I'm a.

44
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.450
You see what I'm saying? But I don't want to, we don't have to get into it.

45
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.030
<v 1>Great GFI. Do you think that, uh, I mean,</v>

46
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.750
it's just the non-traditional roles, right?

47
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:46.340
And when a woman is killing it and she's making that money, there's a,

48
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:49.880
an understanding that more women have been up.

49
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.330
<v 0>Wow. Okay. Well that, that's probably true. It is.</v>

50
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.100
It has to be the beatings and it seems natural. Right? When you think about it,

51
00:02:58.101 --> 00:02:59.830
like the woman gets the money, like, yup.

52
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.790
<v 1>Yeah. It seems natural. But if you think about the man gets the money like you,</v>

53
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:05.050
like, what, why does he.

54
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.200
<v 0>It doesn't feel right. It feels wrong,</v>

55
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.410
which is so cool about comedy because those things are imprinted in people.

56
00:03:10.411 --> 00:03:13.770
So when you make a joke, the wrong way, you make a fat guy joke.

57
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:17.880
Ha ha make a fat lady joke. No, no. And the audience will tell you that.

58
00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:22.080
And so all the PC, all the tweets, all the. You can tell me this all day,

59
00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:23.070
but I got to focus group.

60
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.971
<v 1>Right here, dude.</v>

61
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:28.890
I saved a body positivity meme that someone tried to get

62
00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:32.610
out there. A pot for men with guts. Yeah.

63
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.520
Like a fat man. Your body's beautiful. Like, like get the out of it.

64
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.383
They were trying it.

65
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.090
<v 0>It's not gonna work. Not gonna work. Yeah. It only works on females. It's true.</v>

66
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.850
It's true. Big is beautiful. It's never about Chris Christie.

67
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.670
You know it's about Lena Dunham or whoever the.

68
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.120
<v 1>Exactly. Exactly. Well, there's, you know, it's it's and it,</v>

69
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.190
the feeling that they're getting from,

70
00:03:56.191 --> 00:04:00.210
this is a supportive feeling from other females, men. Right?

71
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.950
Never support you for being a fat. Never, never, never. They never like, yeah,

72
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:08.940
bro. Who cares, man? You look awesome with your fat gut.

73
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.960
Like never.

74
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.930
<v 0>She healthier. I mean, it's a little meaner out of the gate,</v>

75
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:16.320
but at least we're being honest. We're keeping it real.

76
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.120
<v 1>Uh, yeah. Or would not letting them get away with something. Yeah. There you go.</v>

77
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.370
I mean, that's what I'm saying, friends. If they love you,

78
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:25.050
they're not going to let you get away with that. And I'm like, bro,

79
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:28.770
you are fat as. You're like, no, really? Like.

80
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.130
<v 0>Exactly. Yeah. And that's a friendly thing. You know,</v>

81
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:36.540
like if I had a fat son and Corona was hitting, I would be like, Hey man,

82
00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:38.010
like I don't care what you look like.

83
00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.800
You can do your thing and eat all the chocolate you want, but I'm worried.

84
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:44.370
You'll get hit with the COVID more because you're fat and you will,

85
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.380
and you will statistic. And then people are like, Hey,

86
00:04:46.381 --> 00:04:49.200
you can't talk to him like that. That's why I'm like, I'm worried about my son.

87
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:50.303
you.

88
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.730
<v 1>If it's, if it's a woman, you'd be body shaming.</v>

89
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.070
But when they tried body shingled, they tried to say,

90
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:59.370
it's body shaming on a man. It doesn't really stick. Right.

91
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:03.150
It doesn't doesn't stick it. Doesn't stick. Stick. Yeah. What's going on here,

92
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.571
Kelly.

93
00:05:03.571 --> 00:05:08.490
Clarkson's the one that was the random Blackstock seeking six figure monthly

94
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:12.180
payments. Pow. Wow. How long were they married?

95
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.420
He wants 5.2 million a year. A year. He's got a year.

96
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.340
He also requested Clarkson cover $2 million in attorney's fees.

97
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.240
Oh my God. Wow. Oh my God.

98
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.590
That's insane. Killing it. That's insane Lex duck.

99
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.070
But here's the thing. The difference there's there's a great difference.

100
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.970
Seven year marriage. That's great in a year, but here's the,

101
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.050
is he taking care of the children? Do they have children together?

102
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.973
That is the question.

103
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.280
<v 2>35 Of the four 36 was for child support.</v>

104
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.480
He needs child support money from her on top of the 301 and spousal,

105
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.890
probably on the road a lot, you know, she's.

106
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.640
<v 1>Was he like the manager or some? Was it one of those deals?</v>

107
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.560
Because those deals get real tricky when the man becomes the manager and it's

108
00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:05.870
very difficult for the woman to get away from the manager. That's in boyfriend,

109
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:10.580
girlfriend deals with girlfriends, the singer or husband, wife, or the dad.

110
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.450
<v 0>What's equal says he is an American talent manager. So</v>

111
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.630
[inaudible].

112
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.190
<v 1>There was any question that some of those are Weasley.</v>

113
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:22.500
Those numbers. Yeah.

114
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.910
<v 0>Yeah, definitely. Just to request that, Oh my God,</v>

115
00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:30.970
you want how much I know all that management,

116
00:06:30.971 --> 00:06:35.140
Joe Jackson was a psycho and I think Jessica Simpson's dad was a real weird,

117
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:39.120
I never obtained a license to legally operate as a talent agent. According to.

118
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.480
<v 1>Of course not. He was the client. He didn't have to. Yeah, there you go.</v>
