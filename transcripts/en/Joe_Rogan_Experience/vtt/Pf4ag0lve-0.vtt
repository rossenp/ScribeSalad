WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.580
<v 0>The general Hogan experience. I went down a pathway with Queens gambit,</v>

2
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.480
where I was like, is this a true story? Because if this is true,

3
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:13.890
that there was this beautiful young flawed woman.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.740
That's very interesting to me. It's not a true story.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.620
I there's a lot of people on the internet who think that it is a true story.

6
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.480
Uh it's based off a book, but just sales are through the roof.

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.720
You couldn't get a chess board when that thing came out. Really? Yeah.

8
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.630
Isn't that hilarious? Like, like chess sales were going crazy,

9
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.680
which Jess is a beautiful sport and um,

10
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.600
much like long form conversation we have here long form game. Yeah. I mean,

11
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:43.050
months you could really play. They, they, they get into speed chess in that, uh,

12
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.830
in that show, but you can play chess forever, man. Yeah.

13
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.790
<v 1>I'm scared of chess. I'm terrible at chess.</v>

14
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:51.620
And I don't want to get good at it because, uh,

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.290
I think it's something that I would get absorbed with.

16
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.060
I remember there was a time where Howard stern got obsessed with chess and he

17
00:00:56.061 --> 00:01:00.440
was taking chess lessons when he was talking about, on the show. Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.710
And I, I remember thinking, Oh, he's an obsessive, like heel heel,

19
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.760
and then eventually bailed and stuff stopped doing it. But, um,

20
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.150
I've had problems with video games. I've had problems with pool.

21
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.890
I used to play pool competitively and I get,

22
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.830
I get real obsessed with games and chess seems to be like the most

23
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:21.000
intensive, all intellectual games.

24
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.660
<v 0>Trigger the out of your intellectual. What,</v>

25
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.600
what kind of billiards would we play? Nine ball. Yeah.

26
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.230
<v 1>Nine ball, 10 ball, straight pool. I played a lot of all those games,</v>

27
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:33.260
but I played a lot of pool a lot. I played a lot of tournaments. Yeah.

28
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.920
To the point where, um, I have, I have a table in my old studio.

29
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.390
I have a table at home. Um, I collect pool cues. I have a bunch of pool cues.

30
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.890
These are cool. Oh yeah.

31
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.780
<v 0>Actually when they unscrew and you take you out to the briefcase and you know,</v>

32
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.460
a dollar money color, money's just in the case in here, dude,

33
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.220
that's let, it's such a good movie.

34
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.140
My brother Todd got obsessed with pool and we had a pool table in our basement,

35
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.560
but it was like classic Midwest basement in that it couldn't,

36
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.280
it wasn't fully unobstructed. So we had this,

37
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.000
we had this like weight bearing pole right here.

38
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.860
If you ever had to go like in the, in the, uh, the middle, you know,

39
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.980
you had to do all this creative, short stick. We saw one down,

40
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.290
but Todd got really into poor.

41
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:25.430
My dad took us to the nine ball championships one year down in like West

42
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.570
Virginia. And we're like, you know, these guys are like excellent at pool.

43
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:33.290
I mean, they'll run racks after racks. And it was like wild,

44
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:36.800
how the brain is not how my brain works, but my brother's brain,

45
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.890
what we call like one ball there, two ball there is going to move it off here.

46
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.820
And that's like, geometry, chess. It's all like that. Yeah.

47
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.930
<v 1>It is. And it's also finesse and touch and feel. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.760
And it sounds, yeah. It's also a sport that thrives on drugs.

49
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.310
<v 0>Really like an Adderall type.</v>

50
00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.000
<v 1>Situation because they would gamble and they would play for hours, 15,</v>

51
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.940
16 hours.

52
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.050
The thing about pool was that they would play until someone quit.

53
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.843
And so.

54
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.010
<v 0>Guys like the gentlemen, you would never.</v>

55
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.190
<v 1>Quit on somebody when you were ahead. So like, if you, if you quit on someone,</v>

56
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.870
when you're ahead, people would be mad at you.

57
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.840
And they didn't like if you played like for two hours and you won like a

58
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.690
thousand dollars in New Zealand, uh, we'll play again tomorrow. They'd be like,

59
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.080
you stay. And people get mad at you. They would really get upset.

60
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:25.690
And you would have a hard time getting a game because you'd be a guy.

61
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.000
<v 0>Wipe out your opponent until they say, I can't do this anymore.</v>

62
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.820
It's like to the death, to the death.

63
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 1>Yeah. It's like amongst top players in less,</v>

64
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.860
there was an agreement like you could make an agreement and you can make an

65
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:44.670
agreement. We will play two sets. I'll play you two sets,

66
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.120
race to 20 for X amount of dollars per set.

67
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:50.490
But we're going to make an agreement right now. Two sets, right?

68
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.390
That's rare though.

69
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.200
Most of the time they would post up and they would play until guys went broke,

70
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.160
like the hustler, the hustler with Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman.

71
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.990
That was the theme of the movie is that Paul Newman's winning for like 15,

72
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:04.980
16 hours.

73
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.060
And then Jackie Gleason has character and Paul Newman is self destructive.

74
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.220
And eventually Jackie Gleason overcomes him.

75
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.330
<v 0>Ever seen the hustler. But obviously that great is helped.</v>

76
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.500
Paul Newman get cast in color money. Oh, that was like short.

77
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.920
That was the color of, yeah, that's what I went through.

78
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.980
The color of money was the sequel. Okay. I didn't realize that.

79
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.510
<v 1>Yeah. They were both written by, I think Walter Tevis is the guy who wrote it,</v>

80
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.800
but I've read the books too. They're pretty similar. Um, the, the,

81
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.900
the character in the second movie is different. Like,

82
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.580
there's a lot of things in the color of money.

83
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:42.300
They're different than made for Tom cruise. And, but in the hustler,

84
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.460
Paul Newman, uh, retires, because like, he's,

85
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.080
he makes a deal with this mob guy. And at the end of it, he quits playing.

86
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.840
And so he's, he's retired from pool.

87
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.680
And then he meets Tom cruise many decades later.

88
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.130
So the hustler is takes the hostel takes place. I think in,

89
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.870
I want to say 63, somewhere around then. That's when that movie came out.

90
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:12.030
And so the color money is like 1984 color, muddy,

91
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:15.330
gray that, that made pool go through the roof.

92
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.410
People started playing pool crazy. And people pool people, the pool world,

93
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.120
I've always said they need a movie,

94
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.920
like the color of money and the pool hall junkies. Some people liked,

95
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:30.060
but it never really had the same impact. It wasn't that good. It was okay.

96
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.450
Like some people liked it, but they couldn't really play. Right.

97
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.740
If a person who plays pool, like I watched it,

98
00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:38.670
it would be very frustrating for me. Cause like,

99
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.080
if you were watching someone play tennis.

100
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.980
<v 0>It's it infuriates me any commercial with tennis,</v>

101
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.070
they're holding the racket wrong. It's like,

102
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.390
just get anyone that plays tennis to quickly advise you on the right grip.

103
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.030
And now I'm like, but all I can focus on is that,

104
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.770
and I believe color money. I,

105
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.910
I remember reading about it that they like lock Tom cruise in a room for three

106
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:03.080
months and taught them how to shoot.

107
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.680
<v 1>And the crews worked with Mike seagull and Mike Siegel is one of the greatest</v>

108
00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:12.490
pool players that's ever lived. Multiple time world champion,

109
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.170
like literally one of the all-time greats.

110
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.840
I've had the opportunity to play Mike Siegel. I played him. I hung out with him.

111
00:06:16.841 --> 00:06:20.240
He's a great guy. Um, and he was also, left-handed just like Tom.

112
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.960
And he taught Tom cruise and Tom cruise looks like a guy who can play a little

113
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.310
Paul Newman in the hustler does not really look like a guy can play.

114
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.730
He does a lot of goofy. Right. But Jackie Gleason could play.

115
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.350
Jackie Gleason literally plays like a professional.

116
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.390
You watch Jackie Gleason in the hustler.

117
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.840
Like he spent a lot of time playing pool when he was a kid like, look,

118
00:06:43.841 --> 00:06:46.840
Jackie Gleason was a guy who drank and smoked and hung out in pool halls.

119
00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:49.270
He was a man's man. He was a, he was a, you know,

120
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:53.770
a wild dude and he could play like really play.

121
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.950
How did you get introduced to pool? I hurt my ACL.

122
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.870
I tore my ACL ligament. I couldn't work out for awhile. And, uh,

123
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.350
when I couldn't work out, me and my friend, John star, he was a comic as well.

124
00:07:05.351 --> 00:07:09.040
We started going to this pool hall in white Plains, New York. And, uh,

125
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.060
I just stumbled upon one of the great pool halls in that area.

126
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.710
It's one of the reasons why I moved to new Rochelle,

127
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.590
because I could be close to white Plains because I was addicted to this pool.

128
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.100
<v 0>We'll get addicted to pool sound. My brother was right.</v>

129
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.240
<v 1>What does it say? Yeah. The video game doom got its name from the film. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.020
The video game doom got its name from Tom cruise opening up that, uh,

131
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.030
because they want to know that. Yeah.

132
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.970
Because when he opened up the case and he goes, what's in the case, he goes,

133
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.960
get here.

134
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.040
<v 0>Doom. I remember that with his dumb accent. Yes, he was.</v>

135
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.350
He was excellent in that film. That's what Johnny.

136
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.800
<v 1>Yeah. That's what they wanted to, uh,</v>

137
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.670
John Carmack wanted to say to the video game world, when they,

138
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:51.550
when they released doom, what's in their doom. Is it like,

139
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.760
because this game is so crazy in comparison to everything else. Yeah.

140
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.710
So that's where it came up with. We came up with the name.

141
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.350
<v 0>Yeah. It's something like the, the,</v>

142
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.730
I forget the character's name and queen Queen's gambit,

143
00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:07.450
but when she kind of lays in bed, it looks up and watches the world.

144
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:10.870
You kind of see like pool players look at the, at the, um,

145
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.460
table that way to debt, to debt. This goes here to Digita and.

146
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.000
<v 1>There's with pool there's execution, right?</v>

147
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:22.930
The differences you could miss a shot where you're in perfect position.

148
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.600
Whereas the chess, you just move the thing,

149
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.570
you don't have to think about your physical hand-eye coordination and skill.

150
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:32.680
So nerves don't play a factor as much in terms of your ability to move your

151
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:34.300
body. So with pool,

152
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:39.490
the thing that excited me about it was it was about controlling yourself

153
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.353
under pressure.

154
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.160
And you're literally applying a certain amount of pressure to a ball.

155
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.290
And you want to control the revolutions that the ball makes over a

156
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:54.010
long period. So it's all touch and feel. And the more you play,

157
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:58.020
the more and you in what they call dead punch or dead stroke,

158
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:03.000
where you understand exactly how much impact and exactly

159
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:06.270
how hard to touch that cue. Exactly how much,

160
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.040
how much impact it has on the ball to just perfectly place that ball in position

161
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.874
for the next shot.

162
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.320
<v 0>It is a, it's a great game.</v>

163
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.020
My brother had a book called how to hustle your friends at Poole.

164
00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:19.730
And he used to read it and, uh,

165
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.280
we'd have friends come over and they would always get mad that he was reading

166
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.850
the book. But, but he loved it. It's a great gambling sport. Yeah. It's cool.

167
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.050
<v 1>It's a game where people get mad. If you pretend you're not good. Right.</v>

168
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.820
And it turns out you are good. And that's what the hustle is. Yeah. Right.

169
00:09:34.821 --> 00:09:38.930
But what's interesting about it is it's also a game where people lie about how

170
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:43.310
good they are. Like men always want to pretend. They're really good at pool.

171
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.880
It's a weird thing. Like if guys don't know you play, like,

172
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.560
I play pretty good. Like I'm a B player, which means like,

173
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.520
I'm not a pro,

174
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:57.260
but if I practice for six months and really dedicated myself to be excellent,

175
00:09:57.261 --> 00:10:00.530
I can run racks. I've, I've run out three, four racks in a row.

176
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:03.620
I can play a little. Yeah. And if I played a lot, I could, I could,

177
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.780
I could play on a very high level,

178
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.730
but most people can't like I played for years, eight hours a day.

179
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.450
I played every day. I always played,

180
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.410
I took a cue on the road with me everywhere. I went, when I,

181
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.500
when I would go on the road and do do gigs, I find pool halls.

182
00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:22.730
And I play pool all night long. That's what I always did. Most men lie.

183
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.480
Like they tell you, like you say, do you play pool? Oh yeah. Are you good? Yeah.

184
00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:29.750
I'm pretty good. Like, are you really like, how good are you? I'm good.

185
00:10:29.751 --> 00:10:33.350
I always beat my friends. Pretty good. You're like, do, are you really good?

186
00:10:33.351 --> 00:10:34.670
Like if you ever played in tournaments,

187
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.950
the lie and then you play them and they suck.

188
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.670
<v 0>Golf is like this, what do you shoot a about a hundred.</v>

189
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:42.680
You go out there and you're like, you lie.

190
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.920
Or you cheat everybody cheats a golf.

191
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.610
Everybody gets so surprised when they asked me if I'm good at golf. And I say,

192
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.820
Oh, I'm okay. And they say, what do you shoot? And I say, one 10. They got no,

193
00:10:52.821 --> 00:10:53.960
there's no chance I get out there.

194
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.480
And you really count my strokes in the time that I moved the ball.

195
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:59.540
And the time that it like followed the rules shot at one 10. But everybody.

196
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:04.100
<v 1>Is that a good number? No. No. What, what, what's a good number.</v>

197
00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:08.240
<v 0>Yeah. Par is 72, but I guarantee you,</v>

198
00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:10.640
he's going to say he shoots in the nineties and when we go out there and we

199
00:11:10.641 --> 00:11:13.520
actually play, he's going to shoot like 125, like a typical

200
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.890
[inaudible] is probably a good number. Yeah. Number I could get there, but,

201
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.820
but you would need a lot of time in some time and, and you don't cheat,

202
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.370
but everybody, life is fun. It's true. People lie about,

203
00:11:25.371 --> 00:11:26.390
but we'll do it the worst.

204
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.720
If you're a single guy trying to like pick up girls and you got to play pool

205
00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:34.490
with them and they're like garbage, they beat you for girl beats your pool.

206
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:37.730
Good luck, good luck. They don't want to you. If they can beat you a pool.
