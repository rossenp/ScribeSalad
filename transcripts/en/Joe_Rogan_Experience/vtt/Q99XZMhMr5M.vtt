00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.260
<v 1>You do real boots on the ground,</v>

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:10.680
investigative journalism. You are a gangster woman,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.670
the that you did in Peru and in Columbia,

5
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.620
I was watching that episode on cocaine. I,

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
my hands were sweating watching you do this. It's like you were,

7
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.500
you went to the places where they are growing it to the

8
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:29.520
places where they make it. Yeah.

9
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.020
That was you marched with the people that carry it through the route when

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.470
they're carrying it in their backpacks. Yeah. I was like, Oh my God,

11
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:40.800
like you're risking your life. Like genuinely risking your life.

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.110
<v 0>I don't like to see it that way. You know, no story is worth a life. So I hate,</v>

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.010
I hate, you know, we minimize the risk, but you know, there's,

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.640
these are important stories to tell these black markets are happening all around

15
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.740
us. They're super widespread.

16
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:58.310
I think we have this idea that they're happening in sort of far away lands and

17
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:00.530
deep and secret locations, but they're not,

18
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.230
and they have a real impact on our lives. Um,

19
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.950
so there is a reason why we do the kind of reporting and you're right. You know,

20
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:10.340
boots on the ground. Uh, old-school journalism, I think,

21
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.870
is more important now than ever. And we are seeing less of it nowadays.

22
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.900
<v 1>So hard to do. I mean,</v>

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.540
to find someone willing to do what you did for that cocaine episode.

24
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.860
I watched it last night. I was, I was sweating. I was like, nervous.

25
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:28.070
I was riveted it's, it's such a,

26
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.170
it's such a dangerous,

27
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:34.730
but yet it's so much more illuminating

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.580
than any other kind of journalism you could say, Oh,

29
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:41.180
this is happening in Columbia. Oh, this is happening in Peru.

30
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.120
And I'll just sit at home going, Oh, I guess that's happening in Columbia.

31
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.310
But to see you who I know they're going there and to see

32
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.540
all the stuff that you had to go through to meet with these people and to gain

33
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:54.374
their trust.

34
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.120
<v 0>Yeah. I would say also adapt to that, that, you know,</v>

35
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:03.680
we did Mexico with fentanyl. We did guns here in the us going to Mexico.

36
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:08.540
We did tigers in Asia and all these different scams in Jamaica and Israel.

37
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:12.980
And I think a big, important reason or goal for us with this show. Uh,

38
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.180
and for me in particular,

39
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:19.070
because it's the way that I approach my job and my career as a journalist is to

40
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.570
not only be there to inform of what's happening like you were saying,

41
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.050
but also I think it's important for people to connect to people in these far

42
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.590
away lands that at first glance, we have nothing in common, right?

43
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:34.160
These are the bad guys operating in far distant lands,

44
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:37.880
or maybe sometimes around us, but they're considered the bad people. Uh,

45
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:39.830
the people that we have nothing in common with,

46
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.100
but if you actually sit down with them and listen to their stories,

47
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.770
and this is the big shocker of this show,

48
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:50.150
and I think it rubs people the wrong way sometimes when you admit, or,

49
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.480
or when somebody tells you that, uh, look,

50
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:58.220
actually there is not a lot that differentiates you from the guy smuggling

51
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:03.040
cocaine out of the Peru, the rain Valley in Peru, uh, you both have the same,

52
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.610
are motivated by the same goals, which is, you know, happiness, uh,

53
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.740
an opportunity in life, a chance for, you know, to reach your dreams.

54
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.610
Um,

55
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.260
and unless you actually look at it this way and start realizing that that is

56
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.080
more often than not the case, of course, there's a lot of bad people.

57
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.980
They're doing it for greed and solely greed that also happens.

58
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.870
And I spent a lot of time with those people as well.

59
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.350
But unless you start understanding sort of the root causes of what leads people

60
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.550
into these lives, you're never going to be able to address black markets.

61
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.370
<v 1>Well, you really did a fantastic job of getting close to these people and</v>

62
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.210
talking to them like, you know, they were talking about their family,

63
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.550
they were talking about their children. Um,

64
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.120
the one guy who was the chemist who wants to get out because he wants to go to

65
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:52.350
school and I'm like, this is my last year. Yeah. It's, it's it's yeah.

66
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.620
<v 0>Horrible. That story alone. We spent the night with these modulators,</v>

67
00:03:55.621 --> 00:04:00.000
these backpackers as teenagers who carry the loads of cocaine on their back out

68
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.300
of the Valley and spending time with them and, uh, you know,

69
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.830
really dangerous work.

70
00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:08.880
They tell us stories about how they hike for days on end out of the Amazon, uh,

71
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.530
the brain Valley, um, to a place where then it's sent out into,

72
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:16.050
outside of the country to Europe and to the United States.

73
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.010
And you spend time with these guys and you listen to them and, and,

74
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.240
and it's incredibly dangerous work too.

75
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.690
They've seen their best friends being killed in front of them. And I asked them,

76
00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:28.350
so why would you ever want to do something like this? You know, and he's like,

77
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.080
look very simple. I grew up in a very poor family.

78
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.000
I always wanted to go to college. I knew that the only job opportunities,

79
00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:39.570
the whole economy is essentially sustained by the growing of Coca leaves,

80
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.760
production of cocaine and smuggling of cocaine.

81
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.180
So the only job opportunity here I had was this. And I asked him,

82
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.990
why do you want to go to college so badly, perhaps a stupid question.

83
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.960
But he said, you know, because I want to be a dentist. And I said,

84
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:54.960
why a dentist? Because I want to meet me, make people smile.

85
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.520
And this just is like,

86
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:59.490
these are the moments that I think will really stay with me.

87
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.110
<v 1>And it, and it was so genuine. Like the, the experience was so raw,</v>

88
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.850
like all of it from showing the families growing the Coca leaves.

89
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:10.530
And yeah, I learned something from it.

90
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:15.420
I always assumed that it was the organized crime cartels that were

91
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:19.260
growing the Coca leaves. But no, it's these families,

92
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:23.910
these very poor families that are growing these leaves and drying them

93
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.500
out by the road where everyone can see. So you have, uh,

94
00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:29.880
children playing,

95
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.360
you have these very poor people that are growing this,

96
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:35.250
this crop.

97
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.020
And the vast majority of it is sold to the cartels.

98
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.200
And they, they're not selling it for a lot of money, either.

99
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.110
<v 0>None at all. And it's never the people at the bottom that are making money.</v>

100
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.150
It's always the people at the top, but it's crazy.

101
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.220
<v 1>That these are the people that are growing it. Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.720
<v 0>It has holes. Valley has been growing Coca for thousands of years.</v>

103
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.220
It's what they do. And it's also crazy that the thing.

104
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 1>Itself, the Coca leaf,</v>

105
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.970
like there's actually been people that have made a really good argument that not

106
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:07.610
only should that stuff be legal, but it's probably good for you.

107
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.190
<v 0>Yeah. The Coca leaf a lot, if L alone, if it is not, uh, made into cocaine,</v>

108
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:16.180
it's, uh, if you, they chew it, you know, you go to the Andes and all around,

109
00:06:16.181 --> 00:06:19.330
they actually chew the Coca leaf. I had an opportunity to do that.

110
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:21.670
There was a moment where one of them, I mean, you do it,

111
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.790
it helps you without high altitude sickness and it helps you gain more,

112
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.420
an energy. And a one we were filming with a group.

113
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.090
They actually wanted me to try some, I had tried some before,

114
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:34.810
but I did it as well then. And, uh, and it tastes, it's actually,

115
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.410
doesn't take it sat. It kind of tastes like a leaf, quite frankly. Uh,

116
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:41.440
but you do feel a little bit more energy and there's nothing,

117
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:43.060
there's nothing illegal about that, by the way,

118
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:45.460
that's completely something that's been doing. They've been,

119
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.330
it's been the tradition in this area for, you know, thousands of years.

120
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.100
<v 1>And when you did it, like, what gave you energy? Like, what did it feel like?</v>

121
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.540
<v 0>It's not like a bump of cocaine. I actually have not, you know,</v>

122
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:01.630
it's so funny because I spent my entire life reporting on drugs and drug,

123
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.740
the drug trade, and I am, and I'm, you know, people, you know,

124
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.210
like do crazy for a living. And yet I am terrified of drugs,

125
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:12.370
I think partly because I've seen how they're done.

126
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.770
<v 1>After the Oxycontin express and seeing how many people's lives are destroyed by</v>

127
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.290
illegal drug. Uh, I could,

128
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.740
I could imagine why you would want to avoid the ones that are illegal.

129
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.790
I've never done Coke either.

130
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.170
<v 0>Oh, you haven't? Yeah. I think were some of the only two people.</v>

131
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.400
<v 1>I took tea once Mati to cocoa tea. Have you ever had that?</v>

132
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.670
Yeah. And I couldn't shut the up, which is the problem.

133
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.490
<v 0>That's a problem with me too. That's exactly.</v>

134
00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:43.930
My problem is that I am high energy all the time. If I were to do cocaine,

135
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:45.100
then I don't think anyone could.

136
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.340
<v 1>Exactly. I, I, my friend Jimmy and high school, when we were, uh, we were young,</v>

137
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.660
uh, one of his buddies was, uh, was selling Coke and, and goes,

138
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.930
he just looked at me. He goes, you should never do this stuff. I go why he goes,

139
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.360
because I think you'd love it. And I'm like, okay.

140
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.880
<v 0>That's probably my problem too. I'm afraid that I'm ready.</v>

141
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.420
<v 1>Everybody loves it. I think it makes you feel amazing. I mean,</v>

142
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:09.130
