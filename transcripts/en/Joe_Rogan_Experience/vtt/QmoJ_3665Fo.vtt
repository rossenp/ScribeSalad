00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.270
<v 1>When you're talking about China and the NBA and Hollywood movies,</v>

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.110
a lot of people think of those things, those,

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.240
the interactions that Hollywood has that in the NBA has with China as being

5
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:17.820
insidious. They don't, they don't think it's a good thing at all,

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:21.780
that China has that kind of an influence. And they also think it's embarrassing.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.920
Like a lot of people think that it's embarrassing for the NBA to when the

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.960
negative tweets, uh, when they're in supportive Hong Kong. And then,

9
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.380
uh,

10
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.610
all of a sudden there was some pushback and the NBA was removed from viewership

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.930
and China.

12
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:41.400
And there was a lot of sponsorships being pulled and it became a giant issue.

13
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.170
And then all of a sudden you saw the NBA kind of backtrack and kind of kowtow.

14
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.330
And a lot of people found that to be pretty disgusting.

15
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.510
We don't want the United States to ever be a country.

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.990
That's doing that to China, right? If China has a bunch of,

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.060
I don't know what they're really into over there, ping pong players,

18
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.630
like what's their, what's their primary sport. You have a lot of basketball.

19
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.010
They like basketball.

20
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.510
So imagine if Chinese basketball becomes super popular in the United States and

21
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:10.140
then the Chinese basketball players in the United States start talking about how

22
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:14.190
Apple uses slave labor. And, uh, we'd go, Hey, Hey,

23
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.230
watch your mouth, bro. We won't,

24
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.200
we won't pay for your Chinese basketball anymore.

25
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.850
And then all of a sudden China backs off.

26
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.600
Like we would think of that as being pretty gross by the United States of

27
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.360
ignoring some human rights violations or,

28
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:32.820
or trying to whitewash them and trying to economically attacking other

29
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.650
countries. So like the saying that it's a positive that China has all these

30
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:39.630
people and using as an example,

31
00:01:39.631 --> 00:01:44.430
the fact they strong arm Hollywood and they strong arm, the NBA,

32
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.150
a lot of people think that's moving in the wrong direction. Me included,

33
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:48.984
like I don't want.

34
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.270
<v 0>Yeah. I don't think it's positive.</v>

35
00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:53.570
I'm saying we need to be in a position to level the playing.

36
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.030
<v 1>Is that leveling the playing field or will we just look we're corporations</v>

37
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.640
have a giant problem with infinite growth, right? Yep.

38
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.390
This is a thing that seems completely, totally preposterous,

39
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.270
but it's the norm and the standard in the business world,

40
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.230
you want your growth to increase every year,

41
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.320
no matter what. And God knows where that goes.

42
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:17.090
I'm not a mathematician or an economist,

43
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:20.810
but if you extrapolate and keep going with that,

44
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.970
it leads to preposterous outcomes. Right?

45
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.480
That's what people would be worried about 10 fold.

46
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.640
If there's a billion people here, they'd be like,

47
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.730
Oh my God would be even more ruthless and more cutthroat. And,

48
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.850
and more like maybe more competitive with the rest of the world.

49
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:36.260
But in what way?

50
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.510
<v 0>Well, it's only here. Let's talk about the China thing, right?</v>

51
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:43.280
So the NBA is under China's thumb because they need

52
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:44.540
access to that market.

53
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.690
<v 1>Well, they think they do, are they rich as?</v>

54
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.670
<v 0>So we could say right, maybe we need to have a rule that says like, well,</v>

55
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.580
you know, you, you can't let the Chinese censor your. Right.

56
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.640
But the S the relative size of the markets is going to matter, right.

57
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:05.050
So we're, we're on Spotify here, right? So that's a Swedish Swedish company,

58
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:09.160
I think. Um, so, you know, great meatballs out here. Absolutely.

59
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.640
It's a lovely country. Right. But, so, so Sweden's a little country, right?

60
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:17.410
Yeah. All their companies, you know, you're talking Volvo Scania, Spotify,

61
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.560
they're dependent on a global marketplace. They need access, right.

62
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.350
If China is the biggest market in the world,

63
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.490
ultimately they're going to find themselves playing by China's rules.

64
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.530
If America stays the biggest market in the world, then we can play by our rules.

65
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.830
And not that we should use the, the way China does, right.

66
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.460
We shouldn't say like, no, nobody can say bad stuff about America, America.

67
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.810
We've got a great tradition of free speech here. Uh, despite some tensions, uh,

68
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.610
it's a world of difference from China.

69
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.960
And we carry so many other countries,

70
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.800
smaller countries from Europe, Canada, Australia, on our backs,

71
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.720
in that regard as creating a sort of cornerstone of openness as

72
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.980
a leading market in the world.

73
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.080
That's how it's been for so long that people don't even think about.

74
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.520
But if we go into a world where China's the number one economy,

75
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.960
where that's the number one market,

76
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.830
where that's what every company cares most about China's rules,

77
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.170
then we're going to be in trouble. We're going to be in trouble here.

78
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.520
The Swedes are going to be in trouble.

79
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.830
And I don't think that's a world we should look forward to. I mean,

80
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.060
I started talking about, you know, China is trying to use their,

81
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:25.720
their market power to sort of sensor Americans and nobody in

82
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.950
America thinks that's good. Right? Like there's, nobody is like, yeah,

83
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.210
I think it's great that like,

84
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.740
Marvel had to take a Tibetan character out of a Dr.

85
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.630
Strange, isn't that crazy? Like,

86
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.160
that's not the biggest deal in the world is kind of a big deal though. BS,

87
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.320
like what, like what, what is that right?

88
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.040
And it puts in perspective,

89
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.390
like what our disagreements actually amount to that,

90
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:56.620
like when you compare us to China,

91
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.440
this is Gulf, right? And like, don't, we want to stay number one.

92
00:05:02.441 --> 00:05:07.300
Don't we want to have the biggest market, the biggest economy. So you.

93
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.000
<v 1>You can't that it's ever possible though, to, if we got big enough,</v>

94
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.040
we could ignore the influence of China.

95
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.860
Do you think they would put that money aside because China is always going to be

96
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:17.130
big?

97
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.600
<v 0>Well, I don't think you ignore it, but you are able to have the upper hand.</v>

98
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.480
<v 1>Do you really think that we could ever get to a point where Marvel would say,</v>

99
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:26.700
you know what, China, we're putting it to bed and guy in there,

100
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.170
that's supposed to beat Tibetans.

101
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.690
<v 0>In a place where you can say to them, you've got to, we don't wanna.</v>

102
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.620
<v 1>Have to make it a white woman with a bald head. Let's make it a Tibetan guy.</v>

103
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:37.140
Like it is in the comic book. I think in the comic book, it's a guy, right?

104
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.020
I think so. Yeah. Well, either way it's to Tibet and it's definitely.

105
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.910
<v 0>Tibet. The ancient one. Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.830
<v 1>I don't think it's a woman either. I think they went full diversity. They, they,</v>

107
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.810
they,

108
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.090
maybe it's a good move going with a bald lady and people will say less than if

109
00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:51.924
you go with.

110
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 0>I think that that's right. You, you, you gender bend it. So then it it's like,</v>

111
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:01.910
well, maybe you shouldn't criticize that. Right. Because it's good.

112
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:06.350
But it's like, no, we know what actually is motivating this.

113
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.090
And it's, it sucks.

114
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.140
<v 1>We could ever get to a point where China wouldn't have an influence because</v>

115
00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:13.600
China is still going to be a billion people in a huge market.

116
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.950
<v 0>They're big. But I think we can be number one. I mean, there's beyond growth.</v>

117
00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:22.540
Like I think that we have to be more forceful government wise in

118
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:25.630
how we treat our own.

119
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:27.940
Company's willingness to cater into that. Like,

120
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:31.900
I think that we need to put some social pressure,

121
00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:36.760
if nothing else on Hollywood to not do that.

122
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.470
<v 1>Yeah. But see,</v>

123
00:06:38.471 --> 00:06:42.910
they did hedge their bets by making it a woman was like very clever,

124
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.880
clever with a way of being a. Um,

125
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.880
do you remember when the world health organization, there was a,

126
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.240
a spokesperson for the world health organization being interviewed by this

127
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:56.830
woman? And she kept asking them about Taiwan and the, he hung up the phone,

128
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.910
hung up the show, the camera. And then when he came back on, she was like, uh,

129
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.510
so we were talking about Taiwan. It's like, well, China's done an amazing job.

130
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.480
And I think we've kind of covered that. And she's like, well,

131
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.830
and everybody's like, look at this.

132
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.870
He won't even mention Taiwan because Taiwan is not a recognized entity by the

133
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:16.540
people's Republic of China or whatever the they call it.

134
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.130
<v 0>I mean, you know, the, who is there like a unique, uh,</v>

135
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.910
bind in that regard, but it's, you know, it's troubling, right?

136
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.140
Like when you see the Olympics right on

137
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.130
NBC,

138
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.510
like the broadcast was referring to Taiwan is Chinese Taipei,

139
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.710
which was like some kind of international. Yeah. And he watching, like,

140
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:39.910
this is BS, you know, like,

141
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:43.780
it's fine if the IOC itself,

142
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.590
cause like you want to have China in the Olympics, it's a big country. And so,

143
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.720
you know, they want to be a pain in the about it. I dunno.

144
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:54.610
Maybe you got to give it, but like an American television broadcaster,

145
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.800
it's a capsule. Self-respect it's called Taiwan. I don't know.

146
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.460
I don't know what Taiwan means or I was just like, that's what it's called.

147
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.740
Yeah. You know, a lot of students, I'm not going to pretend.

148
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.770
<v 1>Is that amazing though, they're willing to capitulate.</v>

149
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.410
<v 0>But that's what people do. But.</v>

150
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.920
<v 1>You know, it's so weird. Like the Dr. Strange thing is weird,</v>

151
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:17.680
but there's a lot of instances, the NBA things weird.

152
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.350
There's so many of these things that are weird. You're like, what really?

153
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:25.420
But you just realize how much money is coming from China. And that, you know,

154
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.340
they've worked very hard to expand that influence and reinforce that

155
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:31.090
influence.

156
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.950
<v 0>They're very deliberate about it.</v>

157
00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:37.840
And I think it's something America needs to be more serious about,

158
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:42.550
you know? And I think people just like people in culture and society,

159
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:47.350
you need to be more outspoken that like kiddo cause each little

160
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:51.430
compromise. I'm sure whoever in the script meeting was like,

161
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.090
can we just make this a white lady? Yeah. Was like, well, what's the big deal.

162
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.250
Right. Okay.

163
00:08:56.251 --> 00:09:00.120
But we're like completely erasing the doctors,

164
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.910
Tibetans Tibetan culture, right?

165
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.770
Like Tibetan culture is not that big a deal in the United States of course,

166
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.370
because we're the United States, but this is one of its footprints. Right.

167
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.660
And to just snuff it out like that because of Chinese money,

168
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:20.550
because you want the Chinese market and like, that's that sucks.

169
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.051
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:25.130
There was a video about all the different things they've done to films to cater

171
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:28.850
to Chinese markets and how different they make these movies it's and it was

172
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:32.960
really bizarre. Yup. Um, would that change at all?

173
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.183
If there was a billion?

174
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.630
<v 0>I mean, I think it would. I think that the more America has clout,</v>

175
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.630
the more we can say, look,

176
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:44.930
you have to say no to Chinese censorship.

177
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.610
If you want to be in the American market.

178
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.960
I don't think that's going to be a realistic approach if we slip and fall

179
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:52.070
further and further behind.

180
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.311
<v 1>Two,</v>

181
00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:56.390
but they don't know that there's Chinese censorship until after the fact we find

182
00:09:56.391 --> 00:09:59.960
out, well, Dr. Strange, his mentor was actually supposed to be a Tibet man.

183
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.790
They turned it into a bald lady.

184
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.430
<v 0>Well, no. I mean with like with the movies, there's a whole process,</v>

185
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:06.770
a Penn America did a good report about this,

186
00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:11.360
but like where Hollywood films are submitted to the Chinese censors and

187
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.420
you know, we ought to say, I mean, I'll hold a billion thing aside.

188
00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:18.530
Like I think we ought to say like, no, like you can't, you can't do that.

189
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.380
Did, uh, you know, if the Chinese don't want to you.

190
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.660
<v 1>And you're saying no to that, didn't did,</v>

191
00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:26.690
Terentino's say no to the editing of scenes.

192
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.170
I think there was a thing they wanted edited out.

193
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:33.320
It might have been about Bruce Lee. Hmm. Cause you know,

194
00:10:33.321 --> 00:10:38.270
there's this which I found distasteful, even though I'm a giant Tarantino fan,

195
00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:41.690
his portrayal of Bruce Lee is just not accurate.

196
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.620
He made him look like a buffoon. Oh. And uh, once upon a time in Hollywood.

197
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:49.850
Yeah. I think they resisted the changing. Is that true? Here?

198
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.410
It is a Tarantino. Uh,

199
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.620
one of the rare directors with the power to demand final cut on his relatively

200
00:10:54.621 --> 00:10:58.160
expensive films. Reportedly has no intention of re-editing the picture.

201
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.580
Not for Shannon Lee, not for Chinese censors squeamish about the films,

202
00:11:01.581 --> 00:11:04.250
graphic violence. Not for any reason. Yeah.

203
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.440
He refuses to recut for the Chinese market.

204
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:11.030
<v 0>Yeah. And I mean, you know, I don't know. I mean that, that Bruce Lee was not.</v>

205
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.860
<v 1>You scroll down on it. Fair to him. Okay. Look at that.</v>

206
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.580
The film will not be released in China. Wow.

207
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.910
