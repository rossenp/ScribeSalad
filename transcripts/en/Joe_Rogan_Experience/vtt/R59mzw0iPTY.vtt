1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The general Hogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 1>I don't know how it wasn't China,</v>

3
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.320
w w and we'll hand where all the businesses doing the same thing,

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.290
where they building little heaters and like, and potted plants.

5
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.590
So you could have outdoor dining, or was this a capitalistic thing?

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.370
<v 2>I think the government shut them the down. I mean,</v>

7
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:18.260
they were bolting people inside their houses.

8
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.900
<v 1>With like the evidence tape across the door.</v>

9
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.930
<v 2>Good. I mean, the way they handled it is scary.</v>

10
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:25.700
I don't think we should handle it the way they handled it.

11
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:29.000
But even that didn't necessarily work. I mean, didn't, they have a,

12
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.660
another surge, like one of the things they were pointing to like Japan,

13
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.750
they were pointed Japan as being a virus, success story.

14
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.940
They just social distancing.

15
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:40.730
The weather mass went back to work and everybody's fine. Not true.

16
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.830
They have a huge surge there right now.

17
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.690
The problem is this virus is weird and I don't think there's a real

18
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:49.580
way that you can contain it.

19
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:54.080
Los Angeles contained it in terms of like the strictness of their

20
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.900
lockdowns bet. More than anybody. Right there, there,

21
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.540
they were stricter than anybody. They have the most cases. Now.

22
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.430
<v 1>They're fine. I know you were saying that.</v>

23
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.790
And it seems like it affects everybody differently. Yeah.

24
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.740
You ask a doctor a question, you know, they don't know the answer. Yeah.

25
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.880
And our isn't our human brain trying to find patterns so we can go, okay,

26
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:16.820
that's what this sickness is. But this thing seems to be all over the place.

27
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.410
<v 2>Yeah. It doesn't have good patterns.</v>

28
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.470
And it affects people very differently in terms of like what it does to them.

29
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.020
Some people it's like a sinus infection. Some people,

30
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:28.100
it really knocks them for a loop. Some people don't recover and they die.

31
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.160
I mean, it doesn't make, it does. There's no pattern that makes sense.

32
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.110
Like the flu, we understand the flu is dangerous kills people really does.

33
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:40.220
But we also understand what to do. Get a flu shot, you know,

34
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.200
boost your immune system. Here's, here's some medication you can take with this.

35
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.130
This is so new and so scary that no one knows what to do.

36
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.340
<v 1>I tried to find comfort in reading about this,</v>

37
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.150
the pandemic of 1918. Cause that the Spanish flu,

38
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.150
cause that was supposedly two years. And I was like, okay, well,

39
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.310
how did we get through that? Did the economy recover? You know,

40
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:04.070
I was trying to like use history as a way to predict the future.

41
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:08.120
But when you read about it, at least the Wikipedia page of the pandemic of 1918,

42
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.340
we never really fixed it. Or it, it,

43
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.770
it like possibly is still around that virus.

44
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:18.110
And it was, I thought, well, maybe a vaccine fixed it. No it didn't.

45
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:21.560
I don't know what the happened. It's the Spanish flu. Was it hurt immunity?

46
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.090
I don't know. I don't probably, but you know, you'll find it.

47
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.920
It's estimated that that's killed like 50 million people. Yeah. Uh,

48
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.140
so I hope a hundred years later, we're better at this stuff. Um,

49
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.600
never really ended after affecting millions here.

50
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.610
<v 2>The 1918 flu strain shifted and then stuck around. Oh, great.</v>

51
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.660
Well, there's a new version. That's.

52
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.450
<v 1>December 11th software update. There's a new version.</v>

53
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.890
<v 2>Of COVID that's in,</v>

54
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:56.600
that's hit London now it's 70% more trans miserable. Yeah,

55
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.810
fun times. What we, and what we don't about the UK coronavirus variant.

56
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.010
And they think there might've been a,

57
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.450
a similar variant or the same variant in Brazil a few months ago.

58
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.460
Crazy. Not good.

59
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.760
<v 1>So do we live in fear? Do we?</v>

60
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.660
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. We just hit our pants and hide or worry.</v>

61
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.710
You take care of your immune system and you allow people to open up businesses.

62
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.160
Here's the thing, these, these people that are making these decisions for us,

63
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.400
like the mayor of LA and the governor of California. Right.

64
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:28.170
Which is the worst examples. They,

65
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.120
they are not experts in the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do because

66
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.320
what they've done has worked terribly. It's been the worst response.

67
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.910
And I don't think you can do something and not

68
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:44.280
have a consideration for the consequences,

69
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.020
the negative consequences of what you're doing.

70
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.710
Like telling people they can't work and shut down their businesses when the

71
00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:52.920
economy collapses, because all these things are shut down.

72
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.200
And yet you still don't have a significant decrease in the cases.

73
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.880
Like what you're showing is you have this one idea you're sticking with it.

74
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.900
And you're not,

75
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.010
there's no indication that you have any respect for the negative consequences.

76
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.720
Not only that you don't have a plan,

77
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.820
like how are you going to bring everybody back up? How are you gonna,

78
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.260
how you gonna bring back these restaurants?

79
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.090
What are you going to do about these comedy clubs that are dead?

80
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.980
What are you going to do about these bars that are going under?

81
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.530
What are you going to do with these mom and pop shops that are never going to be

82
00:04:19.531 --> 00:04:20.364
around anymore?

83
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.520
<v 1>I don't know how it is in your life, but in my life,</v>

84
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.800
numerous friends of mine in what appeared to be

85
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:33.390
healthy, strong relationships, toast. Yeah.

86
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.370
Like pandemic is divorced. A lot of people, yeah. Domestic violence is up.

87
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.920
Suicides. Suicides are up.

88
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.340
So there is a different consequence to all this.

89
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:48.840
Now I also find it entertaining that we elect these officials and then now they

90
00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:50.880
have to be in charge of a health crisis.

91
00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:54.240
I would much rather we elect them off of popularity or whatever it is.

92
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.280
And then when a health crisis strikes,

93
00:04:56.281 --> 00:05:00.210
we have a health minister who kind of comes in and just like drops the heat on

94
00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:00.810
us. And what's that.

95
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.780
<v 2>So with these health ministers is in a situation like this.</v>

96
00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.670
They don't even take into account the economic consequences

97
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.830
and that the economic consequences are also going to bring with them, suicide,

98
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.440
drug addiction, domestic violence, child abuse,

99
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.190
all those things are gonna happen and they're dead.

100
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.610
They don't take into account that they take into account the health elements.

101
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.730
And here's the other thing,

102
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.140
these governors and these mayors that shut everything down, still get paid,

103
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.480
right? That's a, that's a real problem.

104
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.870
They are not incentivized to keep businesses open. If they were,

105
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.420
if their pay was indirect,

106
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.860
like if they were like the CEO of a company where the more money the company

107
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:41.970
makes, the more money they make,

108
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.680
they would be incentivized to make sure these businesses stay open.

109
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:48.630
And these people can keep paying taxes.

110
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.600
These keep getting paid no matter what happens.

111
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.450
<v 1>But they have a term limit. They do. But yeah.</v>

112
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 2>So what, look by the time gets out.</v>

113
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.900
He will have destroyed that state and also destroyed people's faith in

114
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.300
government because people are so frustrated with him.

115
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.960
And then you see him at that French laundry place sitting around mask lists

116
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.260
right next to people indoors. Oh, it was outdoor dining.

117
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.440
There's a chandelier above your head. Not stars.

118
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.940
There's not stars above your head. There's walls. Yeah. That's indoors.

119
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.680
I don't want to hear your. You are a hypocrite and this is nonsense.

120
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.180
You should not be getting paid.

121
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.040
If you let your economy collapse due to these decisions that are not based on

122
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.460
science, like particularly outdoor dining, that's not based on science.

123
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.600
There's no data. They can't show. We have overwhelming data that, you know,

124
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:41.450
50% of the transmission to due to people leaving outside. Right.

125
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:45.470
That's not the case. So we're fortunate in LA that you have very good weather.

126
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.330
So keep the restaurants open that can open outside, help them,

127
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.740
accommodate them, give them some sort of a bridge to let them get through this.

128
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.940
So that on the other side,

129
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:59.030
after the vaccines and after herd immunity or whatever happens,

130
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.680
these people will still have businesses catch new episodes of the Joe Rogan
