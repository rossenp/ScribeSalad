00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The general gonna experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.970
<v 1>The worst thing that could happen to a common cause he get real soft because</v>

3
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.940
everybody loves you and they go to see you and they laugh at anything.

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:11.880
You say that's one of the reasons why Steve Martin said he stopped touring.

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.300
Right? Cause Steve Martin, when I was a kid, uh,

6
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.590
let's get small was out and he would come out with the bunny ears on and like

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.580
play the banjo. He was so good. These kids today,

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.360
these kids today, they don't know that Steve Martin was a monster.

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.240
<v 0>No, they don't know about that, but they know they don't want hell rooms.</v>

10
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.990
So we just shows up at the comedy.

11
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.340
<v 1>I mean, they don't know how good Steve Martin was.</v>

12
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.370
Like people forgot when Steve Barton was doing a re wasn't doing,

13
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:37.910
I dunno if it was.

14
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.880
<v 0>No, he did. He did like the Nassau Coliseum. He got that big.</v>

15
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.830
<v 1>What he was doing, his albums,</v>

16
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.540
like they were so silly and so fun and so differently.

17
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:51.020
He had his own unique style, you know? And, uh,

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.220
when he just felt like anything he did,

19
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.670
they laughed at and he lost track of whether or not it was good or not.

20
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.110
And he just stopped doing it.

21
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.690
And I remember thinking when I was first starting doing common,

22
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:07.310
I can't imagine a way that that could ever happen or B that you can't,

23
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.590
there's not a work around Steve. You're the.

24
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.540
<v 0>Man. I think it really was.</v>

25
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:16.190
He also had all these ideas for film and all this stuff that he did. Yeah. Um,

26
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.750
but you know, it's kind of interesting, like where he, where he,

27
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.760
what he used to say about, uh,

28
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.020
like I was such a serious time that he was coming out of all, like, you know,

29
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.380
the previous decade, all the assassinations, the Vietnam war,

30
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:31.700
the gas crisis and all that.

31
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.370
And all these comics were talking about all this heavy.

32
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.990
And he was just super silly. They just was like a mental break.

33
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.420
Um, somebody came to us, uh, with, uh, um, a pilot idea for something.

34
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.530
And it was over the top, like absurd and silly. And like, that was my reference.

35
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.341
I'm going through,

36
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.700
this is like the Steve Martin bunny here thing everybody's like going with Trump

37
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:56.690
and, and the virus and on and on. And it's like, this thing is just silly.

38
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.790
This knows no me to cancel called does nothing in here.

39
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.960
You can just sit down like that dumb and dumber type of thing.

40
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.460
That type of stuff that I love.

41
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.980
<v 1>John tell you people, people today,</v>

42
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.690
it's hard to appreciate how big he was. And I was a kid. Right. So that when,

43
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:17.600
when Steve Martin was huge, I mean, what year was it?

44
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.520
<v 0>Late 74. But y'all, this is probably before that too. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.070
Was he still doing comic comedy in 84? I thought he,

46
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.000
I found a video that said it was a standard performance from 84.

47
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.320
<v 1>Oh, that's probably right around the time when he stopped.</v>

48
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.670
I thought he stopped before that.

49
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.040
But when I was in high school was when Steve Martin was born, standing up.

50
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.600
He's got a great book.

51
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.250
<v 0>That's the book born, standing up,</v>

52
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.830
you know what kills me is I loaned that to somebody, you know, gave it up.

53
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.933
I never got a baby.

54
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.050
<v 1>Won. So he gave it up when I was a freshman in high school. The book is great.</v>

55
00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:51.510
Red band gave me the book for Christmas one year. It's really good. It's,

56
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.460
it's really interesting too, because like I said, I don't,

57
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.790
I think when you talk about like great comics of all these generations,

58
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.690
for whatever reason, people just think of him as a great movie star.

59
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:02.590
They think the jerk,

60
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.640
which is unbelievably funny movie and all those amazing movies that he did.

61
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.000
<v 0>Was it like these kids.</v>

62
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.450
<v 1>So good. He was so sick. What was the mafia movie he played? What was that one?</v>

63
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.313
When he.

64
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.500
<v 0>Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And he goes into the supermarket and he just,</v>

65
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.050
he gets the price gun and everything's like 99 cents.

66
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.720
I'm just kinda standing there and he's scanning all this filet minions and

67
00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:29.100
everything. What was that? Yeah. Yeah. Rick, Rick was man.

68
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.270
<v 1>That was a great flux. The bit that you did on Saturday night live about Rick.</v>

69
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.800
Miranda's getting punched in the face. I was.

70
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.160
<v 0>Do you know? I thought that if anything, I thought, cause everybody loves Rick,</v>

71
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:41.100
which I do too. Of course I was just, you know, was the postage.
