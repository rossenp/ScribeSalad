<v 0>The general Hogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.230
I was doing my first documentary back in 1997,

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:10.080
when I was just naive enough to think I can get an interview with Steven

4
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.290
Spielberg. We had a mutual friend involved, uh, this woman, Janet,

5
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.500
and she gets back to me and she's like, yeah. So, uh,

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.150
Spielberg's definitely not going to meet with you,

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.880
but he knows you're working on this UFO documentary.

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.940
He thinks you should look into this landing case that happened in Africa at the

9
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:27.600
school. And I said to myself at the time and remind, you know,

10
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:32.250
remind you guys that I was making a film on UFO's and I dismissed it so

11
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:36.690
quickly because I thought there's no way that a mass

12
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.100
landing with the sheer volume of eyewitness testimony at a

13
00:00:41.101 --> 00:00:45.630
school in broad daylight could happen in the whole world, not know about it.

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.770
So I just walked away from that story for about 10 years, 10 years later,

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.360
I'm doing an event at the national press club with, with Leslie cane who, uh,

16
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.030
was, um, part of the article in New York times.

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.020
It came out in 2017 and she introduced me to this guy, uh,

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.270
Randall Nickerson. And she's like, Oh,

19
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:07.050
he's working on this landing case in Africa, long story short, uh,

20
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.120
he's working on a film. Uh, now I think it's coming out next year,

21
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.020
specifically on just that case. Uh,

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.440
Dan Farrah is producing it and he said, um,

23
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.550
I'm working on the case. And if you want to do something with me on it,

24
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.220
a small piece, I could. So I got back into it.

25
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
I licensed some of the footage that Dr. John Mack,

26
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:30.150
the Harvard psychiatrist that came and interviewed the school children on camera

27
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:33.910
within a week of it happening. He unfortunately looked the wrong way in London,

28
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.520
got run down by a car and died.

29
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.450
So I contacted the Institute with the help of Randall Nickerson.

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.980
I licensed the archival footage. We tracked down the witnesses today.

31
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.970
We flew them in from all different corners of the world, brought them together.

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.620
A lot of them were standing right next to each other.

33
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.060
These they came face to face.

34
00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:54.210
And one of the things I realized was that there were roughly a hundred kids in

35
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:58.020
the playground, broad daylight, Ariel school ruse and Bob way,

36
00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.430
1994.

37
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.770
And they got within arms re armed some of them within an arm's length of these

38
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.760
beans and brought these witnesses together for the first time in 20 years.

39
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.090
And a lot of them hadn't even told their, their, you know,

40
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:15.900
significant others just because they said they were tired of having to defend

41
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:20.850
this. And I myself didn't believe it when I first heard about it back in 1997.

42
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.770
And that segment of the film is the most, in my opinion,

43
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.350
is the most powerful segment, because very compelling.

44
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.590
You've got all these children's saying what they saw on camera after it

45
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:33.960
happened. And then you see them 20 years later.

46
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.930
And then we go to Africa and we meet with the headmistress,

47
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.380
or she was a teacher at the time we went with other witnesses.

48
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.660
We go to the landing site. We talked to people at the school.

49
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.550
That case is absolutely.

50
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.820
And it was witnessed by lots of other people in and around the area for several

51
00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:50.220
days before it chose a school to land.

52
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.570
<v 1>It's so compelling because the children are all clearly, they're not actors.</v>

53
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.420
So as they're adults later, they're all talking about this moment.

54
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.150
And it's like, they had a religious experience together.

55
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.690
Like they're all sharing it and talking about it. And you could tell it's like,

56
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:11.980
it's a deeply moving experience. If they were actors,

57
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.630
they wouldn't have been able to do such a good job because it's it to convey the

58
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:19.990
reality of that moment to them, to, to, to,

59
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.370
to be able to have this interpretation of this event,

60
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.500
where they're all consistent in the story.

61
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.270
And they're all clearly still shook by this moment.

62
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.890
It's really interesting because if you had that scene in a movie,

63
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:38.650
it would take like a really good actor to pull it off.

64
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.680
And they'd probably need multiple takes. It'd probably want to get the best one,

65
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.791
but those kids,

66
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.890
the way they were talking about it and the way they were drawing it,

67
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:47.830
you're like, wow, it really does seem like something happened.

68
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.640
<v 0>I,</v>

69
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.340
I know how credible that the testimony of the children is because my partner,

70
00:03:53.341 --> 00:03:54.174
Rebecca,

71
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.530
she's never had much of an interest in what I do making documentaries on UFO's.

72
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:02.790
I do other things as well. But when I was reviewing in the studio,

73
00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.610
uh, the archival interview of the children,

74
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:10.410
she just dropped off a cup of coffee and she stopped and he went, Oh my God,

75
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.710
those children are not line. This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen,

76
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.880
because look, I ask your audience to, don't take it for me.

77
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.370
Just suspend judgment for a moment.

78
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.030
And imagine hypothetically,

79
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.100
if a UFO or several UFO's landed at a school

80
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.600
in broad daylight in ruin Zimbabwe Africa and interacted

81
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:36.870
telepathically with nearly a hundred school children,

82
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.710
not all of them had telepathic, but it seen the incident.

83
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.630
How significant of a story would you give them?

84
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.360
<v 1>Well, not only that they had the same message. Yes.</v>

85
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.830
But the telepathic message was that technology is a real problem.

86
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.950
And there's things that people are doing with technology that are going to ruin

87
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:56.490
the earth. Yes. And they were trying to relay this to children,

88
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.130
which is very strange, you know, I mean,

89
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:02.760
maybe they just thought they were adults because they were the same sizes of the

90
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.490
aliens. I mean, do you think they knew that they were children?

91
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.080
Do you think they understood that it was a school? I mean,

92
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:08.100
this is all speculation, right.

93
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.410
<v 0>But I know, I definitely had to ask myself,</v>

94
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.510
look during the production of the film,

95
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.990
Paula Harris actually turned me on to another landing case that happened in

96
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:19.290
Australia in 1966 at a school.

97
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:23.580
And this time there were roughly 300 witnesses that saw a disc

98
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.110
land, uh, right outside of a playground in Australia.

99
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.500
And we went to Australia and investigated that case, went to the landing site,

100
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.250
talk to eyewitness testimony that people that jumped the fence at the school

101
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.650
playground and ran over to where this thing landed.

102
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.040
And then we even interviewed a guy who snapped a photograph of a desk,

103
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.570
a Polaroid back in 1966, two days prior to the incident.

104
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:50.520
So it's very, uh, probably that we have a photo.

105
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.730
We have photographic evidence. We have, uh, eye witness testimony.

106
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:56.730
And for the first time we've got testimony from a science teacher.

107
00:05:56.731 --> 00:06:00.950
So why do these things land at schools?

108
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.420
It seems like, and I'm just totally speculating here, but it seems like if,

109
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.560
if I were going to do that, it seems like a pretty benign environment.

110
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.210
When we've had testimony for military guys that we take a fairly hostile

111
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:18.650
position towards, uh, things that penetrate sensitive military installations.

112
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.240
And, um, you know, so maybe I'm just saying maybe,

113
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.280
maybe they save you.

114
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.710
<v 2>Yeah. We have to stop reacting to, uh, you know,</v>

115
00:06:29.711 --> 00:06:33.400
intrusions by UFO's as a threat. I mean,

116
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:37.900
that's the whole thing behind this new task for us. And as much as I respect,

117
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.360
you know, the task force, uh,

118
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.040
my colleagues and I want to cooperate with them to the extent that we can bring

119
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.580
information or resources to what they do,

120
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.400
but there is more, this is not,

121
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.170
should not be looked at specifically as a threat. I mean, with,

122
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.810
with the phenomena that we observe, I mean,

123
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.680
if they wanted to blow up those FAA teams, I could do it. Okay.

124
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.670
Obviously that's, that's not what it's all about.

125
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.500
And this idea of just labeling it all as a, as a threat,

126
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:14.920
because it's unknown that that's a wrong idea.

127
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.390
90% of the information comes from the public comes from children,

128
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:23.950
comes in very, very little of it is made up, you know,

129
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:27.370
in France. I mean, the data we get, you know,

130
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.500
we had the French space agency comes through channels where if people

131
00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:34.960
reported something that's found to be untrue,

132
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.870
they are going to be called by the police.
