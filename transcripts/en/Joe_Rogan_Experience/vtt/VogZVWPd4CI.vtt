00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.760
One of the things about Chappelle that's fascinating is he doesn't use any

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:09.660
social media. He doesn't use anything. You know, he, uh,

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.250
he consumes, right? Like, he'll go on YouTube and watch videos. He'll,

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.690
he's interested in things,

6
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:19.140
but he doesn't around with anything that has anything to do with him.

7
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.520
And he doesn't, he doesn't post things. He does. He's not showing you his life.

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.630
<v 1>But he's got accounts. Yeah. We've got logins. He's only got one.</v>

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.050
<v 0>One. And he re recently started, it was for, uh,</v>

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.440
Instagram to let people know that, um,

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.240
HBO max was using the Chappelle show and he wasn't getting paid for it.

12
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.820
Yeah. And that worked.

13
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.240
So they pulled it off of Netflix and they pulled it off at HBO max now.

14
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.640
And now that's wild. Wild. I mean.

15
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.850
<v 1>I can do that. I mean, that to me was like, I mean, I,</v>

16
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.960
I get tweets because I work on comedy central. I get tweets. Like,

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.290
I don't support you because you guys haven't paid Chappelle as if I have any

18
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.320
thing. Right. It's like tweet Twitter. People are attacking me.

19
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.880
It's like when people attack me,

20
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.390
cause I was playing a club that Louie had played that, you know,

21
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:06.530
a week or something, it's like, well,

22
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.640
that's the thing I own levity live in West Nyack, New York. Yeah. But,

23
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.990
um, but I was just thinking what talent, like Chappelle can just say,

24
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:19.010
pull this off. And they, and they pull it off. I love that.

25
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.190
He just moved to Ohio out of the whole deal.

26
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:25.310
He's been in Ohio for a long time as a Michigander. I'm like, wait,

27
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:27.020
you can have a career in showbiz. And this is,

28
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:29.050
what's fascinating about what's happening right now.

29
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.900
You guys can have a career in showbiz and not be in New York and LA. Yeah.

30
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.890
<v 0>He did it on purpose because he wants to be in a place where people are normal.</v>

31
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.370
He lives in a small town. He knows everybody at his grocery store.

32
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:44.360
He knows everybody at the coffee shop and he's like a normal resident.

33
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.410
<v 1>I love it. And he's taken a number asking for sliced Turkey breast.</v>

34
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:52.820
And some was like, that's the greatest comedy ever lived.

35
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.430
<v 0>She lives right down the street. He lives in a farm. Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.120
He's a fascinating character. I love him. I love him.

37
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.100
I love hanging out with him. He's just so fat.

38
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.780
<v 1>Understanding. Comics always say that,</v>

39
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.100
that know him and interact with him and uh, that's. That's awesome.

40
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.160
<v 0>Yeah. No, he's great. He's always been great too. I mean,</v>

41
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.360
I met him when he was 19.

42
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.010
<v 1>So did he not then get really well paid from the Chappelle show?</v>

43
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.260
<v 0>You must've? No, he didn't. No, he didn't. Well,</v>

44
00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.410
he walked away from a big part of a big chunk of money. Right.

45
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.690
And that the thing that he walked away for,

46
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.140
I was dealing with the same people at comedy central at the time,

47
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.140
because that's when Stan hope and I were doing the handshake, the man show,

48
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.390
and it was rough. Like the,

49
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.750
there was a bunch of people that were not comedians and th they were not

50
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:39.110
creative, but they wanted to put all this creative input into the show,

51
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.710
particularly because they had the chance to put their greasy little fingers all

52
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:46.940
over it because Adam and Jimmy had left. And then they're like, okay,

53
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:51.320
