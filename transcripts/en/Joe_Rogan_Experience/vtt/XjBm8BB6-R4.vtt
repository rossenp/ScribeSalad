00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.180
<v 1>How many years would have to go by before people were doing commercial space</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:10.350
flight. Before you decided to just take a, take a shot, see what's up.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.850
<v 0>I think it could happen tomorrow.</v>

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.930
<v 1>If somebody like comes to you with a solid concept,</v>

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.290
we're going to put you in space, bring you right back down.

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.730
<v 0>I don't think space as big a deal right now. I think that it's a big business.</v>

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.310
Uh, and the fact that, uh,

9
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.510
all the richest people in the world are in it prove it. You know,

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.080
that'd be like saying, Oh my gosh, you can't ship this package.

11
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.800
It's going to be $5,000 on FedEx.

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.910
Nah, the fact that the richest guys in the world they're in,

13
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:45.850
it means it's very cheap and you can get the hell out of here. And.

14
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.790
<v 1>It means,</v>

15
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.350
I think it means there's a lot of like benefit is being one of the people that

16
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.880
innovates in space travel.

17
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.070
If you could come up with a thing where you send people into space and every

18
00:00:58.071 --> 00:00:58.850
time you do it,

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.020
you could charge someone a hundred grand and you get like a million people a

20
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:07.120
year to give up a hundred grand and go flying into space. That's a lot of money.

21
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.600
<v 0>Only a hundred million dollars.</v>

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 1>A million people. Yeah, it's right.</v>

23
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.980
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I don't want to talk about your past or anything.</v>

24
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.550
<v 1>It's not a hundred. It's a hundred thousand.</v>

25
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.850
Yeah. It's a, it's not a hundred million. That's a a hundred billion.

26
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.940
<v 0>Well, that's where you start moving commas and not zeros.</v>

27
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.070
Well that's when you do math. Yeah.

28
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.140
<v 1>So like if you're Jeff Bezos and you can make a hundred billion</v>

29
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.060
doing that, I mean, you wouldn't make a hundred billion.

30
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:44.030
What if you make 50 every year just putting people in the space.

31
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.260
That seems very.

32
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.960
<v 0>It's going to become a commodity very quickly.</v>

33
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.000
<v 1>Yeah. Putting people in space.</v>

34
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.600
<v 0>But space is just a high flying airplane. Right.</v>

35
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.100
<v 1>But if people were willing to spend a lot of money doing it and then if you can</v>

36
00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:02.360
figure out a way to escape, Earth's gravity and land on the moon,

37
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.280
on Mars or land on, you know, Europa I, one of the moons.

38
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.780
Yeah. But what if you could figure out a way to fly around

39
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.310
Venus and come back home? What the is the point?

40
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.050
The point is the experience just like the point of going to Everest is the point

41
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:26.270
being at the highest spot. Like what, who gives a.

42
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.710
If you enter the highest spot, nobody gives a. But the point is the experience,

43
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:34.250
the experience of going there and knowing that it's a difficult thing to do.

44
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:37.460
And then it's a, it gives you a, an unusual vision,

45
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.760
an unusual perspective and experience it.

46
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.600
Few people rarely see ad blocking

47
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.340
kind of disable ad-blocker sun. It gives you an option.

48
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.630
Tickets tomorrows will eventually cost less than $500,000. Elon Musk says, well,

49
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:00.790
thank you, Elan. What a bargain. Only a half.

50
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.710
<v 0>A million can fly all the way around the earth and stop 72 times from</v>

51
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:07.360
500 grand. But if they really do.

52
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.470
<v 1>You get to that point and they probably will look,</v>

53
00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:14.940
if you go back to the invention of the first automobile in like the 18

54
00:03:14.941 --> 00:03:18.540
hundreds, and then you look at what they can do today with like a,

55
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.910
Jamie has a Tesla model X, they go shut the up, bro. They're great.

56
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.990
It goes, that goes zero to 60. So fast. It doesn't seem right.

57
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.630
And it's a SUV there. So.

58
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.700
<v 0>Did you driven one ludicrous mode? Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.550
<v 1>Driven one like that. Yeah. They're preposterous insane.</v>

60
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.480
So you go from that old car that was like, you know,

61
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.930
20 horsepower to what he's got. It's insane.

62
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.210
Now go a thousand years from now. You, you, there's no way you can guess.

63
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.610
And if you look at what we can do right now,

64
00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:57.690
if commercial space flight is a real thing and they're flying people into orbit,

65
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.690
there is no doubt in my mind that what, whatever, the amount of time it is,

66
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:06.450
whether it's 50 years or a hundred years from now,

67
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.400
they're going to absolutely have space flight to Mars and bring people

68
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:15.510
home. They'll probably come up with some new propulsion system, some,

69
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.350
some wild, crazy that we haven't even thought of before.

70
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.660
<v 0>It's not everything it's not going to happen with this giant go straight up.</v>

71
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.740
It's going to have to be something that circumnavigates in gain billion and

72
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:31.320
technology. Nah, I don't know about any of the technology,

73
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:34.380
but it's going to have to be something that circumnavigates and gain speed.

74
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:35.214
As long as you say.

75
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.550
<v 1>[Inaudible] I, I think you know what you're talking about.</v>

76
00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.630
<v 0>Circle.</v>

77
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.220
<v 1>Imagine being like at NASA, what you guys needed to do was circums.</v>

78
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:51.330
Navigates. Exactly. Get it around. It's not going to go straight up.

79
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.260
Boys never go straight up. Earth spins. You gotta go with the spin of the year.

80
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.680
Never.

81
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.630
<v 0>Go straight, go forward. It doesn't go straight.</v>

82
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.890
<v 1>It looks like it's going straight.</v>

83
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.180
But it goes straight in relationship to where you're standing,

84
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.170
but not in relationship to the way the earth spinning and the way the planets

85
00:05:07.171 --> 00:05:10.860
are aligned. So complicated. Another ad popups.

86
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.990
<v 0>That's just doesn't even work anymore.</v>

87
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.570
I thought you were supposed to be really good at this. He's the best.

88
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.480
<v 1>That's not the problem problems. Pop up ads.</v>

89
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.590
NASA is launching a 4g mobile network on the moon. Yeah. Well,

90
00:05:22.591 --> 00:05:25.710
when I have six G I'm not going to settle for 4g on the moon. You.

91
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.090
That's like getting like one ax in the end.

92
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.320
<v 0>Who the getting in on the moon.</v>

93
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.220
How many customers are on the moon phases? It's going to be with that.

94
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.590
<v 1>Girl that you don't even like on the moon. I just.</v>

95
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.860
<v 0>Wasn't impressed and Martinez. I mean, if I was worth, you know,</v>

96
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.200
hundreds of billions of dollars, I think I could do better.

97
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.980
<v 1>You got a P too. So we can either wrap this up or I could pay and we keep going.</v>

98
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.760
<v 0>Well, I don't care. I'll be right back. Oh yeah. You're going to dare me.</v>

99
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.540
What do you got your notes? Oh, just pick it up. My, uh.

100
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.360
<v 1>Have you thought about what I said about space travel? Yes. And I'm not sure.</v>

101
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.780
<v 0>Green. What I'm telling you is</v>

102
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.440
as a race we take over.

103
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.740
<v 1>We try, we go and grab.</v>

104
00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.390
<v 0>We take over it. We fight about it. We say, this is our land. This is your land.</v>

105
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.890
Right. If we'd have been in the moon, wood would be up there.

106
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.540
<v 1>The argument is that every single technological achievement from</v>

107
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:24.970
1969 is easier, cheaper,

108
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:29.440
and faster to reproduce today except going to the moon.

109
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.630
That's the argument I say, right?

110
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.660
<v 0>Because I was born in 69 and that was cheap.</v>

111
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.190
<v 1>The argument is that everything from then you could do cheaper today and easier</v>

112
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.080
like televisions. Well,

113
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.780
they didn't work at it. That's the problem.

114
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.040
It's the only thing that didn't work at.

115
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.470
The only other things they didn't work at is like

116
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.010
how much innovation has there been an air flight in a like commercial air

117
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:04.450
travel? Not much propellers. It's been a hundred years. Right?

118
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.430
They were already flying jets. When did they start flying jets? Yeah. Oh,

119
00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:11.110
I guess, yeah. What was in the concrete? They stopped sort of, I guess,

120
00:07:11.111 --> 00:07:14.860
with the Concord and then let that go or that thing, or they're not telling us,

121
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.320
or they're not telling us how far they made it into a space.

122
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.730
The cardboard killed people that they can't kill. Like that was, uh,

123
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.720
what was that? Getting you to France and like two hours or something,

124
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.800
something crazy. You couldn't have gone faster. They just kept it there or no,

125
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.000
I dunno. I think the thing that happened to them was on the runway.

126
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.390
I think it lost a wheel or something on the runway and killed a bunch of rich

127
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:39.270
people or ran into a tire.

128
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.730
It says low passenger numbers and rising maintenance costs,

129
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.030
Migos kind of expensive. Wasn't it? Wasn't sure.

130
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.070
I mean, it's super Sonic speeds. You know, man,

131
00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:58.420
how the does it not break? It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that bad.

132
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.010
The price. I thought, for some reason in my head,

133
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:03.830
I thought it was like a ticket thousands and thousands of dollars ticket,

134
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.820
just a Ferris about 500 bucks or just over a thousand dollars with today.

135
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.870
One year when I stopped 90, 99, I was kind of wondering,

136
00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.500
I was stopped in 2000. That's kind of crazy.

137
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.600
If you think about progression,

138
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.920
like in 2000 you could fly at

139
00:08:20.921 --> 00:08:24.070
supersonic speeds commercially. You can't do that now.

140
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.700
So that kind of throws a monkey wrench into the idea that things always get

141
00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:30.370
better because they don't always, when they cost too much money,

142
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:31.360
they don't always get better.

143
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.400
<v 0>I don't think it cost too much money.</v>

144
00:08:33.401 --> 00:08:37.660
They were complaining about the sound and the Sonic boom.

145
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:43.150
<v 1>Oh yeah. That too, right? Yeah. Yeah. But I think there was also a danger of,</v>

146
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:46.180
it was like people, a bunch of the last flight.

147
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:49.690
I think a bunch of people die that were very wealthy. Is that true?

148
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.280
Well only 13. Oh yeah. That's a little more than 13.

149
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.120
That's serious. Yeah. And a lot of them were very wealthy.

150
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.820
And I think when you get hit with those lawsuits, like,

151
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:10.020
so that's one of those things that from 2000 to 2020 did not get better,

152
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.450
but actually stopped. You know, it's,

153
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.790
it's a lot of money to get people on the moon.

154
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.660
It's just one of those things where I think eventually they'll get to space

155
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:21.930
tourism and it will expand past the moon.

156
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.850
It'll go to Mars and it's going to happen,

157
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.400
but it might happen a hundred years from now. You know,

158
00:09:26.401 --> 00:09:30.390
it might happen 200 years from now. We might be shocked at how long it takes.

159
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.840
<v 0>And you're pleading my case right there. Why am I playing your case?</v>

160
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:36.973
Cause we hadn't been there.

161
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.610
<v 1>I did it once. Yeah. It might've did it once in a bunch of Cowboys.</v>

162
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.990
<v 0>I went to high school in the,</v>

163
00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:45.590
in the ER or even elementary school in the seventies. Right.

164
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.510
And you studied history. Have you ever seen a picture of the flag on the moon?

165
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.290
Of course I have no through a telescope.

166
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:59.270
<v 1>Oh me. Do you know? They don't have telescopes that can actually see that.</v>

167
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.430
<v 0>Clearly they can really? Yes. Do you know the hell? Tell him you seen him.</v>

168
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.940
<v 1>They don't work that way. They don't like the, there's a, there's a,</v>

169
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:12.260
like a long distance thing. And then there's a close distance thing.

170
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.540
Like you could use magnifying things like binoculars and telescopes that are

171
00:10:17.541 --> 00:10:21.800
like low magnification and you can get like a good image of something's not too

172
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:25.820
far away. But then when they started getting too far away, yes.

173
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.200
<v 0>The flag is still on the moon, but [inaudible].</v>

174
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.950
<v 1>The Hubble is not pointed at the flag here. It goes to the Hubble space.</v>

175
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.060
Telescope telescope is only 2.4 meters in diameter,

176
00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:42.620
much too small resolving the larger lunar

177
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:47.180
Rover, which has a length of 3.1 meters would still require a telescope,

178
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:48.350
75 meters.

179
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.010
<v 0>Diameter.</v>

180
00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.900
So whether it was bad-ass country in the world and we put a man on the moon and

181
00:10:53.901 --> 00:10:55.850
he planted a flag

182
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.250
and we ain't showing that off. Right. But do you mean cause we're as a country,

183
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:04.700
we're like Burt, Reynolds, what are you going to do? We're going to show off.

184
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.610
<v 1>That's what we do. But did you read what that thing just said? I,</v>

185
00:11:09.611 --> 00:11:13.190
I get your like country wisdom where you're looking at it. And you're like,

186
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.160
if we had this, we would have that. But if you look at that thing,

187
00:11:16.161 --> 00:11:20.060
it's saying that the huddle only has a thing.

188
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:24.050
That's 2.4 meters and you'd need something much larger. Was it 75,

189
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.370
75 meters,

190
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:30.530
which is like almost a football field size to be able to see what's on the

191
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:33.410
moon. Like they didn't have the Hubble before. Right.

192
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:35.630
They didn't have the ability to take these high definition,

193
00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:38.870
images of things that were like wait far away. Now they do.

194
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:42.320
But to have something that gets really close to things,

195
00:11:42.321 --> 00:11:46.700
you need something that's even more potent salt for people.

196
00:11:46.701 --> 00:11:49.850
Not like you or me. We're arguing about that we don't study. That's fine.

197
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.090
<v 0>I'm not even, I don't even care about it. Tell you the I'm just telling you.</v>

198
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.110
<v 1>You brought it up on a podcast. Millions of people.</v>

199
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.800
<v 0>I'm totally screwed now. Uh, whatever.</v>

200
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.510
<v 1>You can borrow a real God that you're in a argument with.</v>

201
00:12:03.511 --> 00:12:07.260
He's gonna bring that to court. What? this guy's crazy.

202
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.290
He thinks Neil Armstrong's a liar.

203
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.333
<v 2>Mm.</v>

204
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:18.920
<v 0>So what's next there aliens. I don't care about anything.</v>

205
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.380
I think they're paying attention personally. Yeah.

206
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.680
<v 1>If you were an alien, wouldn't you be fascinated by hot rod culture?</v>

207
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.270
<v 0>Well, uh,</v>

208
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:32.910
I way I met an old guy a long time ago and he put it to

209
00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:37.020
me the right way. He goes. What if you're just

210
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.350
a experiment in a young kids school project?

211
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.240
What if all of this that you built is basically an ant form that you have in

212
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:51.300
your head and you're just an ant farm in somebody else's head.

213
00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:53.160
And somebody else's at is kind of like the matrix.

214
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.110
I don't know if that defends us or defines us,

215
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.740
but it is kind of interesting. I mean,

216
00:13:01.741 --> 00:13:05.490
you can't think that you're the only thing out there or we're the only thing out

217
00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:06.324
here.

218
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.550
<v 1>If we are an ant farm and we don't know that we're in an farm</v>

219
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.420
and we're living and we understand how the ant farm works.

220
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.820
The real problem is if the owner of the ant farm shows up

221
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.390
up until then we're just living. You know,

222
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.860
if this really is like some complex and farm for people, we're having fun.

223
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.350
It's all good. Yeah, no problem.

224
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.980
<v 0>We got some weed. We had some drinks where I'm fun. We're making money,</v>

225
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.873
not making money.

226
00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.060
<v 1>Your. Everything's fine.</v>

227
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.740
The real problem is if the ant farm owner shows up,

228
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.030
that's the problem with these UFO's that keep showing up the ones that eat the

229
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:51.480
New York times puts on the front page of their newspaper.

230
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:53.790
And is that a real newspaper? Yeah, it's a real paper.

231
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.780
It's they do it in New York state. It's a city called Manhattan.

232
00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.030
<v 0>I've been there. And I know about it.</v>

233
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.490
I just don't know about New York times being in a paper.

234
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.000
<v 1>Well, they're more off of a paper than they are.</v>

235
00:14:06.001 --> 00:14:10.680
Not sometimes they things up, but they're more often accurate than not.

236
00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:15.510
Hmm. Yeah. They were more accurate in the past and they are now,

237
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:20.160
now they're ideologically, ideologically driven. They tend to be a bit woke,

238
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:25.050
but they're still probably the best newspaper on earth woke, woke,

239
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:26.040
you know, woke.

240
00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.093
<v 2>This rules.</v>

241
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.680
<v 1>You know, to work woke.</v>

242
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.513
<v 2>Rules.</v>

243
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.780
<v 1>You don't give a about those, right. I to not mean either. Um,</v>

244
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.720
but do you think that aliens have visited?

245
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.770
<v 0>I'm going to give it a 50, 50, I'm going to probably lean towards yes.</v>

246
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.190
Is this anything that you about on a regular.

247
