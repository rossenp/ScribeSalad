<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 1>But there's some sports like let's look at a power lifting or let's look</v>

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.130
at bodybuilding. Bodybuilding is the best one. Yeah. That's doesn't exist.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.210
It doesn't exist. Bodybuilding doesn't exist.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.370
Bodybuilding with steroids exists by regular bodybuilding. Like, um,

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.740
I had a friend, uh, my friend Brian, uh,

7
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.380
who lived in Boston was a natural bodybuilder.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.150
And he was very dedicated and he was like legitimate, natural bodybuilder.

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:34.500
He worked out very hard. He was, uh, he ate very clean and he was like super,

10
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.010
super dedicated. And you would swear he was on steroids. He was big.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.720
I mean like big, giant arms, like really thick guy, but just really dedicated.

12
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.180
He is nothing like those giants that you see at the

13
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.450
gym that are on steroids. There are people that walk around.

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.900
Like if you go to like a Gold's gym in Venice, in the heyday,

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.820
when all the elite bodybuilders would go there,

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.330
they don't even look like humans. They look like walls with feet.

17
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.341
<v 0>I saw it.</v>

18
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.100
I went to a bodybuilding competition in Vegas for the show where we were

19
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.660
following this kid who was mostly not doing steroids at this time.

20
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.481
Like your friend,

21
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:12.440
he was trying to see if he could make it into this competition without ha the

22
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:16.760
heavy use of, uh, or heavily using steroids and other, uh, PDs.

23
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.380
And, uh, it was,

24
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:21.350
he went on stage and you could see the difference between him and the other

25
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:25.910
guys. I mean, everybody else there was heavily using PDs and then you'd see him.

26
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:29.030
We actually followed him. We were with this guy called Tony, huge.

27
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.120
Who calls himself, Tony, have you heard of this guy?

28
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.930
He's pretty incredible because he has a huge following, a huge following.

29
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.410
And he calls himself Dr. Tony, huge, even though he's not a doctor,

30
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:41.900
but he is a lawyer. Uh, and he's,

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.600
if anyone wants is interested in,

32
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.210
he's basically a spokesperson for steroids. He's, uh, uh,

33
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.720
people who are bodybuilders.

34
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.480
He's also a bodybuilder himself and goes to gyms and competitions.

35
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.420
And he was with this kid and little kids adore him. I mean,

36
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.490
we spoke to teenagers who look up to Tony,

37
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:01.520
huge and want to do everything he does, which is mostly PDs.

38
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.900
And this kid wanted to be, he went to Vegas to help this kid out.

39
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.740
And in the middle of it, he was like, 19.

40
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.630
I believe his name is Zach from Florida. Super nice kid met his mom, all of it.

41
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.801
Uh, but had, had,

42
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.530
had tried steroids had had sort of a bad experience with steroids,

43
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:21.620
decided he was going to try and do it with other things, but not steroids,

44
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:25.280
not testosterone itself, but other substances, Tony huge was helping him out.

45
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.900
He gets there day of the competition. He goes on stage. And again, he dealt,

46
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:32.420
looks like the others around him who have been doing steroids look so much

47
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:36.500
stronger than him. And he comes out yet. You know, again, super dedicated kid.

48
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.280
Like this is his life spent most of his time at the gym and eats right and all

49
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:43.400
that. And in the middle of the competition, Tony huge says, okay,

50
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:46.640
it's time for us to go back to your apartment and get you ready for round two.

51
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.780
They go back and we filmed all of this and he opens up a big suitcase.

52
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:52.190
And inside the suitcase,

53
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:57.020
it's like the Mary Poppins suitcase that more and more coming out, you know,

54
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.530
and, and starts him injections of insulin and all sorts. I don't know,

55
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.870
half of the things that he was giving and the kid's like,

56
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:07.900
are you sure this is okay? Are you sure this is okay? And, uh,

57
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.240
and I'm worried for him. And he says, okay,

58
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.500
I'm starting to feel my heart beating really fast. Uh, you know, you don't,

59
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:15.340
don't don't you worry.

60
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:19.090
And then he goes back and you can actually see the transformation in this kid's

61
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:22.210
body within an hour of him taking these drugs. I am not just,

62
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.840
what is the transformation? His, uh, uh, vessels,

63
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:29.440
his blood veins. Yes. We're popping his veins.

64
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.300
So that's something good apparently for these kinds of competitions. Uh,

65
00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.030
that's something good. Apparently

66
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.090
that was my first time at a party. I should reassure. It's weird. It's so weird,

67
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.250
but so fascinating real life. Yeah.

68
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.130
I love think worlds look nothing like what I'm used to. I like,

69
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.740
I'm so fascinated by them.

70
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.590
<v 1>I was watching a video last night on vice of a woman who, uh,</v>

71
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.520
does, uh, bodybuilding. She's my height and my weight.

72
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.260
She weighed 196 pounds. And so,

73
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.280
and she has like, her neck is like my neck,

74
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.770
but her traps are even bigger than mine. They start like,

75
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.550
here they go straight down. Her shoulders were massive.

76
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.960
And she was talking like this, this is what I eat. Yeah. This is, uh,

77
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.710
every morning I have to consume 6,000 couch time. Like the rock. Yeah.

78
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.370
Like it was bizarre. It was so bizarre.

79
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.020
It was so strange to see this weird obsessed it's they're like

80
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.690
sculptors. Right. And in a way it is kind of an art form,

81
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.680
but what they're doing is freakish, but they're all into it.

82
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.970
They'll all love it.

83
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.080
<v 0>Yeah. This Tony huge guy. Um, I actually kind of grew very fond of him. Uh,</v>

84
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.700
just because he's so honest about what he does.

85
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:51.720
I don't think his message is very safe for kids, you know, especially, and,

86
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.160
you know, taking steroids, you know,

87
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.430
the side effects and you have to be careful, but yet him saying, you know,

88
00:04:56.431 --> 00:05:01.350
I am basically a human experiment on myself and I'm trying all these things

89
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:02.184
and some things.

90
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.590
<v 1>Because of him. Can we see what he looks like? This Tony huge fail, right?</v>

91
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.980
These look ridiculous. She's going to love this. Oh, Tony.

92
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.120
<v 0>Oh, no. He actually doesn't look ridiculous. He's a Tony Tony here.</v>

93
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.630
<v 1>There's a guy who's, uh, who died recently,</v>

94
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.340
who was famous for looking ridiculous. His name is rich piano.

95
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.950
Do you know who that is? I remember when I was doing research for this story.

96
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.450
Yeah. Hearing about that. Um,

97
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.850
they don't exactly know if steroids killed them, but it's like,

98
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:32.430
you know, if you see a body and then there's a gun right next to the body,

99
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:36.450
like in the gun, the body has a bullet hole. Oh, it's pretty big. Yeah.

100
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.560
Hispanic. Yeah. But he's tiny compared to rich Piana. No. Yeah. Yeah. Oh,

101
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.710
he looks very good. Yeah. See, he doesn't look preposterous.

102
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.490
He looks like a very big strong guy,

103
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.110
like right there with the shirt off picture. Yeah. So it looks great.

104
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.940
Like that's, that is a guy who's in very good shape. Yeah. Doctor. So he says,

105
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.210
okay, this is a, I used to be handsome.

106
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.820
This was maybe six or seven years ago when I was 31 or 32.

107
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.210
I was still full-time and Laura were in a suit going to court, meaning clients,

108
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:09.200
dah, dah, dah. So, yeah. So that is decided, start taking steroids.

109
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.200
That's when he decided, is that what it says? Okay. So that,

110
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.530
that can be achieved naturally. That absolutely can be achieved naturally,

111
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:19.340
especially with good genetics. And that's one of the things that I had.

112
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.230
Do you know who Ronnie Coleman is? No.

113
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.240
Ronnie Coleman's if there's a Mount Rushmore of bodybuilding, he's on it.

114
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.250
A hundred percent. It's like Arnold Franco Colombo, uh, Lee Haney.

115
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.270
I mean, how many Mount Rushmore doesn't have enough heads, right?

116
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.650
Dorian Yates. But Ronnie Coleman is without doubt on there.

117
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.280
He used a multiple time. Mr. Olympia, enormous guy with,

118
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.750
with spectacular genetics, spectacular genetics.

119
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.610
And Ronnie did the podcast.

120
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:54.530
And he said that when he was he's really in rough shape now,

121
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.650
like he can barely walk. His back is really up. He's had many,

122
00:06:57.651 --> 00:06:59.420
many surgeries and, uh,

123
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.980
he's basically had every disc in his back fused except for one and, uh,

124
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.540
has a really hard time walking and even standing up. Um, but when,

125
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.880
but that's because, you know, he pushed himself so hard,

126
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:14.480
so it wasn't just the steroids. He pushed himself through pain.

127
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.280
So when he got injured, he didn't give a.

128
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.910
He just kept working out hard and stacking weights and, you know,

129
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.060
squatting spectacular amounts of weight.

130
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.590
But he was, I believe he said he was 30 before he took steroids.

131
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.970
So he was a full-time cop. And, uh, he was competing just like,

132
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.810
I mean, perfect genetics, just perfect. I mean,

133
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.330
he's just a stud and then realize he couldn't beat.

134
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:41.840
These guys started getting his kicked. And so then he got on, like,

135
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.600
he had a that's what he went when he.

136
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.370
<v 2>It was a cop pulled over by that guy. Yes, sir. Licensed,</v>

137
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:51.730
sir, sir, sir. Don't squeeze my head like a zit.

138
00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.050
<v 1>He's uh, just a really sweet guy, too. An awesome guy.</v>

139
00:07:56.051 --> 00:07:59.830
But he was very honest about it. He's like I couldn't compete.

140
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:01.930
I was tired of getting my butt, my butt kicked. Right.

141
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.400
Then he started taking it.

142
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.490
<v 2>No, no, no, no, no, no.</v>

143
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.740
<v 1>No. A lot of people get busted. They get busted for trace amounts that are, um,</v>
