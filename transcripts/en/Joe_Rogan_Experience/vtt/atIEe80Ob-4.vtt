00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 1>Well, it's crazy to watch the method.</v>

3
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.550
When you see the method of how they cut the cocaine on your show,

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.520
where they're pouring cement into it, you're like what?

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.890
And then gasoline just giant Jew.

6
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.270
And then like all the other that they're all the different chemicals acid like,

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.110
Oh my God, this is crazy. I had no idea. I had no idea. That's how they make it.

8
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.023
<v 0>Yeah. It's so,</v>

9
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.900
so another episode that we filmed recently was here in Austin was actually meth

10
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.450
in Austin. And we were on my way driving here to the show.

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.980
I passed by the place where I had filmed just three weeks ago, actually this,

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.030
uh, this guy in his hotel room, a dealer and meth dealer,

13
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.210
but he was washing one of the things he did before he started getting clients.

14
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.060
And the clients are not the people that you think are meth users at all.

15
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.670
By the way we filmed, we interviewed a lawyer,

16
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.630
we interviewed a mom with kids at home. It was an entrepreneur,

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.460
not at all the people that you think are meth users.

18
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.840
And this guy before he started, he's washing the meth. Um,

19
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.070
and that's because he says he prides himself on selling good quality meth,

20
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:07.430
but he had purchased it from a Mexico. And he wasn't sure about the quality.

21
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.430
So he washes it. I can't remember what it is, the product that he puts in,

22
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:14.630
but it's to see all the other stuff that comes up and, uh, and him, you know,

23
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:15.080
you can tell,

24
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.100
and then you can see just sort of all this other chemicals that are put in there

25
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:22.640
and you sort of realize, and when I was filming in the cocaine lab,

26
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:27.050
the same thing and the fentanyl lab to the amount of that goes into these drugs,

27
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.820
if that alone is not going to dissuade you from doing them. Yeah.

28
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.750
It's chemicals. It's gasoline it's. Yeah.

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.100
Lime lime is something that goes into a lot of these. Yeah.

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.170
<v 1>They use lime to get rid of bodies.</v>

31
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.300
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.560
<v 1>The, this, um, meth guy, um, was he a big breaking bad fan?</v>

33
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.850
Was it Brian Cranston fan wanted to, he wanted to be the guy.

34
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.870
<v 0>It was actually, uh, my younger, I don't, I'm sure. You know,</v>

35
00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:01.010
one guy that we filmed for the fentanyl episode, it was a cartel chemist.

36
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:04.520
So this, this guy was a bio engineer, um,

37
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.250
and incredibly smart and knowledgeable.

38
00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:11.300
And we met him in this abandoned location where he's basically making fentanyl

39
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.690
and pressing it into the M 30 pills, which are fake. Um,

40
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.450
it goes round back to the beginning of the opiod crisis.

41
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.370
Cause they make them to look like Oxycontin,

42
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:24.290
like the 30 milligram pills that Purdue pharma and, and so,

43
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.840
but it's pure fentanyl essentially. And, uh,

44
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.780
and they're becoming really popular on the streets of American park, you know,

45
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.040
really deadly stuff.

46
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.000
And so we saw him making it and you never know what these guys, like.

47
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:39.500
I spent time in some of these illicit labs where you kind of get a sense that

48
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.220
could go wrong very fast, because they have no idea what they're dealing with.

49
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.340
And these are very potent chemicals. But in this case, you know,

50
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.630
it's not easy to make. I mean,

51
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:50.300
it is because it's cheap and once you know how to do it, you know, to do it,

52
00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:53.450
but it's no, I can't show up and try to make that the,

53
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.690
the whole thing could explode just because of the chemicals are so potent.

54
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.310
And yet here he was,

55
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:01.390
and we were wearing our hazmat suits and our masks and everything.

56
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.750
And I started talking to him and he was, I mean,

57
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.040
I suddenly thought I was talking to Walter White from breaking that he was

58
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:10.270
exactly that daycare,

59
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.570
a geek when it came to chemistry and had always loved chemistry and, you know,

60
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.730
had worked in chemistry for a while and then was approached by the Sinaloa

61
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:22.000
cartel. And they needed a guy who knew, who knew how to make this stuff. And,

62
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.960
and he's decided why not? I can make a lot more money and making this.

63
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:29.080
And now he's like one of the biggest chemists for the Sinaloa cartel.

64
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.800
<v 1>Yeah. So when you talk to the people that did the meth,</v>

65
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.530
did they have a reason, the people that,

66
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.540
that actually consume it when you said you talked to the mom and

67
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:43.374
the lawyers? Yeah.

68
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.180
<v 0>It's a good party. Um, drug. It's a good, uh, it's a good it's, uh,</v>

69
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.220
it helps with inhibition for people. Yeah. And apparently it really helps with,

70
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.320
uh, sex, especially it's a very consumed in the gay community as well.

71
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.820
Um, it helps. Yeah. Just, um, having a good time and.

72
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.180
<v 1>It's getting wild. Yeah. Getting wild. Yeah. Yeah. Um,</v>

73
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.590
have you done Adderall? I have not good for you.

74
