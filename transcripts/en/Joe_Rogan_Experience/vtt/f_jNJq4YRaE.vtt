00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>The general good experience. It's so funny to me,</v>

2
00:00:03.901 --> 00:00:06.570
how people just get so caught up in East coast and West coast.

3
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.930
Cause it really only happened at rap. It never happened with rock and roll.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.300
Right. You know, it never happened with sports. I mean,

5
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:16.590
it did a little bit with sports in some teams, but with the big thing with,

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.610
with rap music was always East coast versus West coast until you guys came here.

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.370
<v 1>Right? Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.630
I'm like really familiar with that beef. Uh,

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.580
I wrote about it in my book of how me and puffy,

10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.480
you know, had a meeting and uh,

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.520
they wanted me to mediate a meeting with him and shook was concerned,

12
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.620
you know, with that was after Tupac and all of these people,

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.660
you know, had got killed and, uh,

14
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.780
it was something that I wanted to do, but I couldn't really get, you know, uh,

15
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.160
between it because you know, things just didn't add up properly.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.110
And I don't believe in stepping in between something and when I don't have all

17
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.033
the information.

18
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.430
<v 0>Mm yeah. That's gotta be extremely difficult. Right.</v>

19
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:11.690
You were in the middle of like a legitimate war where

20
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.710
two of the all time greats yeah. Were murdered.

21
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.110
<v 1>Yeah. I was asked to, uh, be in the middle of it. And then,</v>

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.340
um, after Tupac was murdered, um,

23
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.560
one of the things I'd done was I heard puffy and biggie was in LA

24
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:35.120
shooting a video. So I was on my tour bus and I turned it all the way around.

25
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:40.040
I think I was close to Phoenix and I turned it around just to go and have a

26
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:44.990
conversation with big and puffy to alert them that they were in a place

27
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.460
that I didn't feel that they should have been in. And, you know,

28
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:54.320
I went there and had a conversation with both of them just to kind of put them

29
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:58.100
on, notice that, you know, this ain't the place to be. Right.

30
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.290
<v 0>No, that was before biggie was killed. Yeah. How long before it was.</v>

31
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.120
<v 1>I think a few weeks, like a few weeks before and uh,</v>

32
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.610
you know, sometimes, and I know puff, it meant well, and I know biggie mean,

33
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:18.590
well, sometimes a lot of individuals are what I call surface deep

34
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.400
where the streets are concerned, which simply mean you don't,

35
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.650
you understand them to a certain depth, you know what I mean?

36
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:31.460
But I understood that that wasn't definite LA,

37
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.350
that wasn't a good place to be because my ears was to the street

38
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.710
and you know, I just wanted to echo it.

39
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.610
It was on my spirit to let them know and I did.

40
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.770
And uh, unfortunately, you know, it didn't save him,

41
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:53.300
but everybody can learn from those mistakes moving forward.

42
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.940
<v 0>The devastating loss, the both of them. Yeah.</v>

43
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.970
I mean what they left behind, you know, to this day. Yeah.

44
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.630
If you got a Mount Rushmore of hip hop, those two dudes are on there. Right.

45
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.580
There's no doubt about it. Oh yeah. Two brilliant guys. Brilliant. Yeah.

46
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.690
There's a video of biggie on the street that I watch all the time when he was 17

47
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:20.650
years old piece of paper in his hand was lyrics. Yeah.

48
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.750
Rapping his off at 17 years old. Yeah. It's incredible.

49
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.020
When you watch the video, he was like, what talent? Yeah.
