00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, but jock valet,</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.370
you have been studying this most of your life too long, too long.

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.070
We, we discussed it last night at dinner that your interest in this came

4
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.300
from an experience that you actually had as a child. You actually saw a UFO.

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.580
<v 1>As a, as a teenager with two other witnesses. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.150
one of the witnesses was half a mile away with binoculars.

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.820
So I'm pretty sure that, um,

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.190
that that object was real and it was a classic disk middle of

9
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.780
the afternoon clear sky,

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.880
absolutely clear at the time I became convinced that it might be

11
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.460
a prototype of something that would be coming out later. And, uh,

12
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.540
you know,

13
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.400
we're here many years later and we still don't have anything like that.

14
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:54.950
It was just hovering and it was fair.

15
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.260
<v 0>And you've been studying this for so long.</v>

16
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:00.560
And this was something you guys talked about in the film that you were actually

17
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.670
the character that the French UFO researcher and close encounters of the first

18
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:09.320
kind of the third kind rather was modeled after the Steven Spielberg films.

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.760
<v 1>Yeah. Ellberg was intrigued with the idea of,</v>

20
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.490
of a character that was not quite as weird as, you know,

21
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:20.390
the ETS, but it was a lot weirder than, you know, the,

22
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.800
the people on the ground in the U S trying to make sense of this and the

23
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:29.780
military and so on. So he needed this intermediate character. He felt,

24
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.290
you know, Frenchman was, was the right thing to do.

25
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.340
<v 0>And so did you talk to him about the film? Did you talk to him about when,</v>

26
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:38.900
when he was putting it together and.

27
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.730
<v 1>Uh, I, a</v>

28
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.190
journalist put us together when about halfway through the, you know, the,

29
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.680
the final, final shooting of the film, and there were,

30
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.430
there were gaps in the movie at that point. And we, uh,

31
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.560
so we had lunch twice together and, uh, it was, was a lot of fun.

32
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.570
He was at the time he was looking for a transition between the

33
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:10.280
time when they, they know that, you know, the big thing is coming,

34
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.550
the mother ship is coming and they don't know where,

35
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.220
and the mothership is sending signals,

36
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:20.990
but they can't decipher the signals. And I, he said, you know,

37
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.490
he had spent the morning at the jet propulsion laboratory and he said,

38
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.330
he couldn't make any sense of all the mathematics they had.

39
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.840
And I said, well, maybe you get to have, you know,

40
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.510
two screens that give you an angle.

41
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:39.530
And the angle tells you where the thing is. And he said, no,

42
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:42.860
that's too complicated, you know, and takes too long. Right.

43
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.710
It got to be just a few minutes in the film.

44
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.170
And then I thought of a photograph that was on the desk of Dr. Hynek,

45
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.000
you know, Dr. Jane Hynek,

46
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.720
who was the air force consultant on UFO's at the time.

47
00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:01.450
And I was working with him building databases and so on and

48
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.170
on that photograph, there were three guys, you know,

49
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.610
really well-dressed on ladders, around a huge,

50
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.280
um, sphere of the earth in the lobby of some buildings,

51
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.470
somewhere with pieces of string that they were,

52
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.960
they were putting the string over the earth.

53
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.550
And I told Dr. Heinrick. I said, you know,

54
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.840
what's the story behind this? And, and he said, well, the,

55
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.710
when the first Sputnik was launched, you know, October 57,

56
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.760
nobody had a computer program to compute an orbit,

57
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.240
but they knew where the Sputnik had been seen.

58
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.540
Nobody expected the Russians to come up with this,

59
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.950
and they needed to know where it was going next. So they,

60
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.260
the New York times called the director of Harvard observatory

61
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.460
saying, um, can you give us a comment on the Russian satellite?

62
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:00.880
And the guy said, Hey, it's three o'clock in the morning. You know what,

63
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:05.390
Russian satellite. And so they got dressed in a hurry and they,

64
00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:09.940
they were trying to compute the orbit by putting a string around the,

65
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.230
uh, around the model of the earth, in the lobby of the, of Harvard.

66
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.090
And I thought it was so funny and, and Spielberg said, that's it, you know,

67
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.910
that said, the general says, come on. Uh, you know, you know, the,

68
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.260
the geographer who is, uh,

69
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.700
the interpreter of the French of a French guy, uh, says, well,

70
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.900
it looks like it's somewhere in Wyoming, you know, but where in Wyoming,

71
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:38.920
you know, where should we go? And the, the general says, you mean,

72
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.810
we've got $10 billion worth of radar and cameras and everything

73
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:48.610
else. Nobody's got a map of Wyoming and they break into the lobby of the

74
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:52.640
building next door. And they come back with this globe and, you know,

75
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.030
they've got the globe and they, they look at it,

76
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.020
look at it and get they're called in eights. And because the, the,

77
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.710
it turns out the geography, it tells them, you know, those signals,

78
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.810
they look like a longitudinal attitudes. So they, they, they, you know,

79
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.170
they, they get the point where it's going to be and that's,

80
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.890
that was a piece that was missing in, in the movie.

81
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:19.420
So that was really proud of that. You know, it was, it was really fun. Well,

82
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:21.850
so it's the, one's funny part in the movie.

83
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.390
<v 0>It's a great movie. And it's a,</v>

84
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.440
it is probably the movie that got me most excited about UFO's when I was a kid.

85
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.610
And I remember thinking if you have folks were coming here from another planet,

86
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.670
one thing that I remember thinking is why would they even bother talking to the

87
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:39.390
government? Like what, what do they care who the government is? Like, if,

88
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.380
if I was looking at an ant colony, um, I'm not going to ask the ant colony,

89
00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:47.130
which one's the, the elected official that's in charge of all the other ants.

90
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.980
You don't give a. You're just like trying to study the ants.

91
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.420
And I felt like if something was coming here from another planet that was so

92
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.260
sophisticated,

93
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:59.390
it could either travel from another or travel from another galaxy.

94
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.590
Why would it care like who the president is or who the generals are?

95
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.900
<v 1>You know, not only that, but the witnesses don't talk to the government either.</v>

96
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.240
You know, by now the witnesses are tired of being ridiculed by scientists

97
00:06:13.241 --> 00:06:17.620
and, you know, by and told that those things don't exist. So they don't,

98
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:22.570
they don't talk. So they'll talk to, you know, uh, people like you,

99
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.100
people like me, uh, because I trust, you know, they, they trust me.

100
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.680
And in Silicon Valley, you know,

101
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:33.400
you wouldn't believe the number of people who come to me, you know,

102
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.800
including CEOs of companies that I've worked with would tell me about sightings

103
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.720
that people in their family have had or sightings they had, including,

104
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.540
you know, sightings in Vietnam, for example.

105
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:51.250
And so on when they were in the military that have never been reported.

106
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.500
And the government isn't getting that.
