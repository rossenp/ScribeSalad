00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.150
<v 1>So that's one issue with the death County is that so many of the people. So,</v>

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.070
so let's say you're and I urge people.

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:09.810
One of the things that I've done a couple of times on Twitter,

5
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.980
that always gets an interesting responses. You can go look at coroner's reports,

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.280
especially in Milwaukee, where they put them all online of people who've died.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.170
So you can actually see the people who have died of COVID and you'll see how

8
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.700
sick they are. For the most part.

9
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:27.210
I'm talking about people in their eighties and nineties who have multiple severe

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.960
comorbidities. So in that case, it's really hard to tell,

11
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.290
did this person die with COVID or from COVID? You know,

12
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.700
if my heart is failing and my kidneys are failing and I get this thing and I

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.830
died the next day, okay, I died. Did I die? Did I die with COVID?

14
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.530
Or did I die two weeks before I would have died anyway.

15
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:47.550
And we're counting that as from.

16
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.330
<v 0>COVID or maybe even a year before you would have died anyway,</v>

17
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.990
but the 2.6 comorbidity factors,

18
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.780
that's the average for people that died of COVID. That's correct.

19
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.850
That's with COVID. Well, it's a good way to say.

20
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.150
<v 1>Again. It's very, very hard to distinguish with,</v>

21
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:04.190
and from in these cases of people who are really sick now,

22
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:06.440
sometimes it's not that way. Sometimes you can say again,

23
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.620
a 50 year old who is relatively healthy, gets COVID. They died,

24
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.190
they died from COVID, COVID killed them. We can agree about that.

25
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.450
But at the many of the cases are hard to, hard to understand,

26
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.250
or not hard to understand, but hard to distinguish.

27
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.770
And I'll make one more point about deaths. Very.

28
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.180
<v 0>Very, very important point.</v>

29
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.830
<v 1>PCR testing you, you, you know, you, I know, I know, you know,</v>

30
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.400
you know what this is, yes, you, you know, you,

31
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.630
you look for a sample of the virus in, you know,

32
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:39.620
usually it's in the nose, you multiply it. Uh,

33
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.120
and you run a cycle where doubles over and over and over again.

34
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:47.410
And when it gets to a certain point, uh, they actually it's,

35
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:50.450
it's actually incredible technology. It's sort of, it's sort of magical,

36
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:54.860
but they add a fluorescent marker to it. And at some point,

37
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:58.040
if you can see the fluorescence, it's considered a positive sample. Okay.

38
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.503
Here's the thing,

39
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.390
a 40 cycle PCR test means that you are multiplying the

40
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:10.070
original, any original viral material in that sample by 1 trillion times.

41
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.960
Okay. So a single viral particle that you pick up becomes

42
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:18.860
1 trillion particles. It is very,

43
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:23.750
very easy to find virus in people when you're

44
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:26.800
running a PCR cycle at that, at that level. Okay.

45
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.660
Does not mean necessarily that they're very sick at the time.

46
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:32.900
It doesn't even mean that they have active virus in their bodies at the time.

47
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:36.680
They could have a piece of virus that, uh, that, that the,

48
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:39.920
that the original samples picking up and multiplying by 40 X. Okay.

49
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.260
It's clear. By the way, when people have a low threshold, let's say 20 times,

50
00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:48.290
let's say it only takes 20 cycles. That's a million multiplications.

51
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.290
If you're positive at 20 cycles, you're pretty sick.

52
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.770
If you're positive at 25 cycles, you're probably pretty sick.

53
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.120
If you're positive at 30 cycles, maybe not 40 cycles,

54
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.500
it doesn't really mean anything. It means that you have, you know,

55
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.350
you have this one bit of virus in you that they've managed.

56
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.300
<v 0>To find. It doesn't mean you're contagious. It.</v>

57
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.160
<v 1>Probably doesn't mean you're contagious.</v>

58
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.320
<v 0>Well, what that word? Probably well around grandma?</v>

59
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:18.240
<v 1>Uh, I don't like to say never unless I'm sure.</v>

60
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.750
Okay. Right. So when I say probably it usually means.

61
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 0>Never, but I just don't like saying.</v>

62
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.380
<v 1>I understand. Okay. When we count deaths,</v>

63
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.910
the States have a procedure.

64
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:34.800
Most States they look at positive tests and they match

65
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:36.840
them with death certificates. Okay.

66
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.680
So let's say you had a positive test okay.

67
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.790
In tomorrow. Okay. And let's say it was 38 cycles.

68
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.250
They're not going to tell you that, but it was 38 cycles. Okay.

69
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.270
You are not very sick at all with COVID. Okay.

70
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.560
But you're in a registry somewhere.

71
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:56.370
Your names in a registry a month and a half later, you die.

72
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.920
Let's say you get hit by a car that will still initially come up as a positive

73
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:06.570
COVID death because you had a positive test and you died within a specific

74
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:08.130
amount of time after having.

75
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.100
<v 0>But they don't distinguish from a violent accident. No.</v>

76
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.860
<v 1>Not initially. Now that some of the States are trying to clear this up,</v>

77
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:16.200
but let's say you died of a heart attack, Joe. Okay.

78
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:19.650
A heart attack is a potential outcome of COVID.

79
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.380
You're always going to be on there if you died of a heart attack.

80
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.310
<v 0>So you're saying that if you have this tiny amount of COVID in your system,</v>

81
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:29.310
you never wind up getting sick, but yet you have a heart attack.

82
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.170
A couple of weeks later, three, four weeks later,

83
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.450
they will still call that a COVID death,

84
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.890
even though you never got sick from COVID 100%, that doesn't seem smart.

85
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.930
<v 1>Uh, the idea is to capture deaths as broadly as possible.</v>

86
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.610
The idea is this is a serious illness and we want to know every possible person

87
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:49.950
who's died from it. We don't do this with any other illness.

88
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.160
<v 0>Is it because they don't have the resources differentiate between the people</v>

89
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.700
that have died from heart attacks where it's clear? Oh, we looked at the person,

90
00:04:56.701 --> 00:05:00.020
they had a very small amount of the virus in their system. Four weeks later.

91
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.330
There's no way they were sick from that. But is that.

92
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.540
<v 1>A function of decisions that have been made along the way?</v>

93
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.080
So they could have sent the PCR threshold at lower.

94
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.610
They could have set it at 30.

95
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.630
They were aware from almost the beginning of this issue that, you know,

96
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:19.650
you can find a comment from Fowchee in July talking about this. Okay. But,

97
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.800
and certainly, and you know, and, and certainly they knew well before this,

98
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.750
the idea was, we want to know sort of as broadly as possible,

99
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:29.970
how many people have this. And then secondarily,

100
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.790
we want to define deaths from COVID as broadly as.

101
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.850
<v 0>Awesome. And what is the, what is it level set up currently?</v>

102
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.670
<v 1>Um, different States have different levels, but in most places,</v>

103
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.500
it's 37 to 40 cycles,

104
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.240
which again means that a lot of those people at the high

105
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:50.220
end are not sick. And they, they certainly had COVID at some point,

106
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.800
but they probably don't have it any more.

107
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.060
Here's here's the other reason to do this show. If you,

108
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.940
if you set it really high,

109
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.690
you're going to capture people on the way in just as they're getting sick.

110
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.550
So if you're truly afraid of, we want to quarantine everybody really early,

111
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:11.210
then you have to set the threshold really high. So, so that,

112
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.240
to the extent there's a logic behind it, that's the logic behind it,

113
00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:17.000
but it has all these negative side effects. Um,

114
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.520
so there was one other point I wanted to make,

115
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:21.350
but I I'll remember it in a second.

116
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.830
<v 0>So the negative side effects would be that the they're inflating the</v>

117
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:29.290
number of people that not just have it,

118
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.880
but die from it because of the fact that they're making sure that these

119
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:37.570
deaths that get linked within a certain time period, what is the time periods?

120
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.480
<v 1>So in some States, it's 30 days in some States at 60 days.</v>

121
00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:43.030
I don't know if it's more than 60 anywhere. Um, but,

122
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.360
but the States are sort of allowed to define it. Oh, here's okay.

123
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:49.360
So there's a negative for the person who's tested positive because you then have

124
00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:53.170
to isolate yourself. You can't work, you know, you're scared. Um,

125
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.380
and then there's this negative for society with the death counts later. Right?

126
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.501
<v 0>Right.</v>

127
00:06:56.501 --> 00:07:00.100
But isn't that negative that you have to isolate yourself and you can't work.

128
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.490
That seems very rational because if you do test, like,

129
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:06.160
let's say you're on the way in you catch it.

130
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:08.290
You have a little tiny bit of it in your system. And then like,

131
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:09.520
you have to isolate. You have COVID.

132
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.820
What if that person just went out and started drinking,

133
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.840
got down the COVID multiplies and then they have a full blown case.

134
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:17.860
And then they start spreading.

135
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.730
<v 1>So that is look, realistically can not happen sometimes. Yes.</v>

136
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.290
That seems like that would happen a lot. Well,

137
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:26.440
it doesn't happen that much because at 37 you're asymptomatic.

138
00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:30.100
So you're not going to know unless you have some reason to be tested. Yeah.

139
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.100
<v 0>Isn't there a significant amount of spread from asymptomatic people.</v>

140
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.890
<v 1>So this is another argument that we don't</v>

141
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.680
there's asymptomatic spread. It looks to be very rare. Although, you know,

142
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:45.040
now Fowchee is saying, it's not so rare. There's presymptomatic spread.

143
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.713
Presymptomatic spread appears to be.

144
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.740
<v 0>More real. We need another person other than Fowchee. That's the one guy we do.</v>

145
00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:54.040
Like everyone says, Fowchee says like we have this guy. Yes.

146
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.570
<v 1>Uh, let me, let me, let me say one more thing about death count. Okay. Okay.</v>

147
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:02.860
Back in March and April people said COVID deaths are being under counted.

148
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.890
We don't, we're not doing enough testing. There's all these people dying.

149
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:07.870
They're being called pneumonia deaths. It's probably COVID.

150
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.410
That was probably true at the time, especially in New York and New Jersey, you,

151
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:16.180
you can look and you can see the number of what are called excess deaths.

152
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:20.080
More people dying than you would expect in a normal year was higher than the

153
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:21.490
number of COVID deaths. Okay.

154
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.690
And a lot of those deaths were in people who had pneumonia. Okay.

155
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:28.390
So that looks like, Hey, we didn't even, you know,

156
00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:31.390
this is even worse than we thought we're capturing. Uh,

157
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:34.930
we're not even capturing everybody who died. Okay. But that was March and April.

158
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:36.700
Let's talk about what's happening. Now.

159
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.980
We know the PCR tests are going to capture a lot of people who aren't sick

160
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.960
anymore and who maybe never were sick.

161
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:49.000
We know that some of those people are going to be classified as COVID deaths.

162
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.560
If they, again, I'm 88. I, I somehow, you know,

163
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:57.030
was asymptomatic a month. I, but I got a positive PCR test.

164
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.600
Now I die because I'm 88. That's a COVID death. Okay.

165
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.390
What we're seeing now in the United States. And certainly in Europe,

166
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.910
we don't have data as good in the U S from the last couple of weeks,

167
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.720
but we have some pretty good data from Europe and the UK is that the number of

168
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:13.770
COVID deaths,

169
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.020
when you add it to the number of non COVID deaths is not as high as the

170
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.000
overall number of deaths you would expect.

171
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.740
So what does that tell you that tells you that some non COVID deaths are

172
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:28.230
probably being classified as COVID deaths these days.

173
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.640
So back in March and April,

174
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.180
there were more people dying than you would have thought based on the number of

175
00:09:33.181 --> 00:09:34.170
COVID deaths. Now,

176
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:38.400
there are fewer people overall dying than you would think based on the number of

177
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:41.400
COVID deaths. And I got to add one more thing. I know this gets complicated,

178
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.470
but it's worth, it's worth thinking about,

179
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.360
we also know that a significant number of people are dying from lockdown. Okay.

180
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.170
There are an, and, and the number one way you can look at that is overdose.

181
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.960
Okay? Overdose deaths in this country have all, you know,

182
00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:56.790
they've been terrible for years. This year,

183
00:09:56.791 --> 00:10:01.470
it looks like they're off the charts. So if 20 or 30,000 people,

184
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:03.990
and that's probably a reasonable estimate,

185
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:08.460
20 or 30,000 extra people are dying this year from overdose

186
00:10:08.461 --> 00:10:13.440
alone. That's that should push up the number of overall deaths.

187
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.800
And yet when you, and then if you'd add the COVID deaths,

188
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.090
it should be even higher.

189
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.420
When you put these three things together right now you're getting fewer deaths

190
00:10:21.421 --> 00:10:23.010
than you would expect. Again,

191
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:26.460
what I'm trying to say is I know that this math can sort of seemed complicated

192
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.900
and stacking can seem complicated,

193
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:32.970
but right now it looks like a significant number of deaths are being classified

194
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:35.430
as COVID would have occurred anyway,

195
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.700
and are just sort of being shifted into the COVID pile.

196
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.190
And that was not so true a few months ago.

197
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.920
So when you see 3000 people died today of COVID,

198
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.480
until we get the true mortality figures for this year for,

199
00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.840
for November and December, we're not going to know if that's really true.
