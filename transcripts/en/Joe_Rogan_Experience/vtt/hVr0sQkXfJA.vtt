1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. I did.</v>

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:06.210
I remember when you lost your job at Nickelodeon,

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.680
we were in the parking lot or John jocks. And this is like, what year was that?

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.350
<v 1>Um, I hadn't been, uh, you know what? It had been 98, 98 because I had a house.</v>

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.810
I just bought a townhome in Belinda.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.970
<v 0>Yeah. And we were talking and you're like, I don't know what to do. Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.590
Like I'm thinking, you know, but just like just, you know, working on my art.

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.540
I remember that conversation, man. And then I remember like years later,

9
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.120
you're balling out of control and your arts and galleries.

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.040
And I had a friend and I went over his house and he had one of your paintings

11
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:41.450
above his kitchen tables. Like, Holy, that's Todd, White's painting. He's like,

12
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:45.200
you know that guy, I go, I do jujitsu with him. I'm like, wow. He goes, yeah,

13
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.460
he's really talented. He's really good.

14
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.590
It was like one of those cocktail party paintings.

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.520
I remember thinking this is nuts, man. I'm at someone else's house.

16
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.410
And Todd White's painting is above his kitchen tables while I love that.

17
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.390
I was telling you the other day, just earlier today,

18
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:03.320
rather that I'm sure the restaurant out here, I go in,

19
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:06.830
had no idea. I just go in me and my wife round date night,

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.790
we walk in and I'm like, this is Todd White's paintings are everywhere. Yeah.

21
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.690
Thank you. It's it's what your style is so distinctive, you know,

22
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:18.920
I could see you're like either someone's ripping you off or it's you.

23
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.100
So like when I walked in there, I'm like I'm 99% sure.

24
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.230
This a Todd white or some Todd white.

25
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.930
<v 1>It's. Uh, so, you know, I had, I had 13 years in animation.</v>

26
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.710
I came out of high school. I got a job at Warner brothers as a carer,

27
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.580
as a production assistant on the first season of tiny Toons. But,

28
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.420
but what I did is I just, I looked at every super talented artist,

29
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.900
every draftsman and I would ask questions and, uh, I was drawing every day.

30
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.410
I had no social life and, uh, they would give me such great advice.

31
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.900
So I looked at it that's my college because I didn't go to school.

32
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.190
My mom was a painter. So I grew up in a painting household. Her mom was as well.

33
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.660
And uh, I just looked at it as I'm going to educate myself through, you know,

34
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.990
the hard work and the grind. And before I knew it,

35
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:06.020
I was just around some of the most talented artists in the industry.

36
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.500
And they were showing me techniques and, and way to,

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.700
to way to put life into character in a way to give a drawing life,

38
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.610
which is the hardest thing. By the way, I look at a lot of paintings in it.

39
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.640
They may be technically great, but there's no life they're dead looking.

40
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.160
The eyes are dead, it's a dead looking painting.

41
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.720
And so I learned through super talented artists to

42
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:31.400
teach me how to put that kind of personality and life into the

43
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.790
drawing, and then translate that into the painting. And, uh,

44
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.780
I was always obsessed with the rat pack and Sinatra and Dean Martin and Sammy

45
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:40.670
Davis Jr. And I just, I would,

46
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.610
I had few HS tapes of them at the summit and everything.

47
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.100
And I used to watch them all the time and try to look like they were having so

48
00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:46.934
much fun.

49
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.900
Men were men and women were Dames and they had the drinks and the cigarettes and

50
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.760
they were blowing smoke in each other's face.

51
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.510
And they weren't worried about masks. It was just amazing time. And, and, uh,

52
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.910
women were Dames. I loved it. You know, games is such a great word. And so, uh,

53
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.210
so I just kind of, I wanted to capture that in painting and I wanted to,

54
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.440
I want to kind of bring some of that timelessness back and, uh, and you know,

55
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.290
I would, uh, I was really good with marker work, uh, marker color comps, uh,

56
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.280
in animation because I quickly after that I became a character designer.

57
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.640
And so I spent the next, you know, 10 years in animation,

58
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:26.170
designing characters for shows. And I ended on SpongeBob and that was like, uh,

59
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.440
Steve Hillenburg a lot of my friends from a previous show said, Hey,

60
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.050
we're going over Nickelodeon. They got this new show they're working on,

61
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.600
it's a pilot SpongeBob. And they need a character guy. And,

62
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.720
and I met with Steven and he said, uh, he gave me Marine biology books.

63
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:42.070
He's like here, make these characters. And uh, I went home Marine biology book.

64
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.210
He was a Marine biologist. He went to Cal arts. He wasn't the best draftsman,

65
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:49.570
but he had good ideas. And, uh, and he was really cool dude, and a surfer.

66
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.140
And so.

67
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.510
<v 0>Why Marine biology was he just cause it was all.</v>

68
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.030
<v 1>About underwater life. I don't know if you've ever seen the show.</v>

69
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.170
<v 0>Well, I've seen a few times in my kids. I never paid attention.</v>

70
00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.850
I just know it was under water.

71
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.470
<v 1>Yeah. It's all bubble. Guppies is underwater.</v>

72
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.660
I don't know what that is. I actually can't stand watching it. I don't,

73
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.700
the kids have so many shows going on and they're also horrible to watch.

74
00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:12.630
So I don't stare at any.

75
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.980
<v 0>Yeah. Bubble guppies was, uh, my daughter's favorite show for like two years.</v>

76
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.700
Um, your style, like go to his website and pull up some of the,

77
00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:23.400
or pull some of the images of it. Your,

78
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.810
are they all like this? Like your you're.

79
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.990
Do you do other kinds of styles or is it most of your work?

80
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.570
Like cocktail party?

81
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.850
<v 1>I, I view my work as a it's all personality and relatable. So in my mind,</v>

82
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.530
uh, I'm gonna, I'm not painting art for your furniture or your living room.

83
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.510
I'm not painting something you want to put in your living room.

84
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:48.720
I'm painting something that you want, that you identify with. And, uh,

85
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.950
I think a lot of people.

86
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.140
<v 0>What do you mean by that? Like if it's not for the living room, like,</v>

87
00:04:52.141 --> 00:04:53.100
whereas if you identify.

88
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.360
<v 1>Yeah. It's it. Wherever you identify, where you identify, see yourself in it,</v>

89
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.930
you see yourself, you see your boys weekend at Vegas.

90
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.290
At time we had the greatest time ever.

91
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.330
The women had girls' night out and they see their new stuff on Instagram at all.

92
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.190
No interest to have my new.

93
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.930
<v 0>Stuff cartoonish. Oh, okay.</v>

94
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.960
<v 1>I hate that word cartoonish.</v>

95
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.810
<v 0>Yeah, really? What's a good word. Cat character, character. But no,</v>

96
00:05:18.811 --> 00:05:19.530
one's going to know what.

97
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.400
<v 1>I know. I know people, there you go. There's some new stuff right there.</v>

98
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.810
That's like the foxes and um, you know,

99
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.720
so I always want to represent someone's life.

100
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:33.360
I want them to see their life and I don't want them to see their personality and

101
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:33.660
their kids.

102
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.010
<v 0>Go back to that picture again. The jokes and foxes,</v>

103
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.000
the blonde, the like from the left-hand side, the third one, she looks like a.

104
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.820
Oh, good, good group of fours.

105
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.240
<v 1>Yeah. Integrates the more that's what you're going to have. Cam, see,</v>

106
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.910
everyone has their own editor. Everyone has their own attitude.

107
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.670
Everyone has their own personality. Like out of those three,

108
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.680
you know why she gets everything she wants.

109
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.040
She far left the one in the white that's my kind of.

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 0>Girl smiling thought seems like she's happy. She saw that. Wow.</v>

111
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.360
That one you got to work for that one. That's holding that wine glass too low.

112
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.223
She's just too much.

113
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.920
<v 1>What do we like? We like to throw the hunt, not the thrill of the kill.</v>

114
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.210
<v 0>I like nice people. I get my thrills and other places.</v>

115
00:06:13.211 --> 00:06:17.440
I don't want them in relationships. I look for conflict and relationships.

116
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:22.210
I just look for nice people, man. I liked the one you got lucky I did too.

117
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.580
I liked the one in the white. That's my kind of girl, but that one,

118
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.700
the one with the low wine glass, I'd tell my friends, bro, please,

119
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.820
please don't burn the house. Sure. Shat.

120
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.180
So those three I've no problem with any of those girls are fine.

121
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.940
Those are fun things. The one that James get the cursor over,

122
00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:39.640
she's going to be the most problems. She's going to overdose at your house.

123
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.080
She's going to.

124
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.940
<v 1>What are we doing? We're having conversations about stupid art, right? Like, so,</v>

125
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.130
you know, art should be a conversation piece.

126
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.040
<v 0>The one on the far, right. She's going to your friends, my friends.</v>

127
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:51.993
You're going to love me.

128
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.260
She's going to text your friend move and then she's going to all your friends.

129
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.900
<v 1>Yeah. So it should be a conversation piece.</v>

130
00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:00.820
You should have it in an area where friends come over and they go,

131
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:04.690
what's going on here? And it represents you. It represents your personality.

132
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.180
They can say, well, this is how you know, we love our life.

133
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.260
<v 0>I know you got to a point where you were like really in demand.</v>

134
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.990
I can remember I was talking to Eddie about it. And he was like, God,

135
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.350
Todd is so busy. Like he's like constantly working. Does it,

136
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.210
does it ever get to a point where it seemed like labor or like a T

137
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.860
does a dope Hendrick shirts on what you got there hidden by your gay

138
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.370
bandana. I'm sorry. It's more like a rancher's.

139
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.380
<v 1>Band down. There you go. We're in Texas. Yeah.</v>

140
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.920
<v 0>Yeah. Those guys would have sequence in or something. I like that.</v>

141
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:36.783
That's dope shirt.

142
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.120
<v 1>You can help. It really I'll give it to you. That's the coolest.</v>

143
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:43.210
One of the coolest shows I ever did. I have the greatest fans of any artist,

144
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:45.280
period living. They're just, they're awesome people.

145
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:48.100
And they show up in droves and we were doing a show one time and this,

146
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.280
this client in England came up and he goes, eh, and I said, dude,

147
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:55.130
that's the greatest jacket I've ever seen. And he goes, you like it? I go, yeah.

148
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.850
And he goes, it's yours. And I go, I'm not gonna take your jacket.

149
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.080
And in my mind, I go, I'm taking his jacket. He goes, he goes, no man.

150
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.140
Try it on. If it fits you, it's yours. And I thought, that's a fair, fair.

151
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.250
I try it on. I'm like, Oh buddy, perfect. He goes, I've got to fix it. He goes,

152
00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:13.270
it's yours. Wow. Thank you. And the cool thing is about 10 years later,

153
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:17.080
I was in Toronto doing a show and an a kid came up, uh, artists,

154
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:21.070
kidney showed me his work briefly, which I find a bit hard to look at.

155
00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:23.410
People's work in the middle of my show. And I'm like, Oh, that's awesome, dude.

156
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.950
And he goes, man, that's a great jacket. And I go, he was about my size. I go,

157
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.030
Hey, see if this fits you and it fit him. And I go, it's yours. Wow.

158
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.800
I can't believe it. And then other people were like, dude,

159
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.300
I just bought $60,000 painting. You gave him a jacket and he's like, Hey,
