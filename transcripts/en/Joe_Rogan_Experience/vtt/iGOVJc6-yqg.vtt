00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 1>Gilbert Godfrey is a legit comedy legend.</v>

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.070
Is he still in New York city during all this crazy? I'm sure he is. Yeah.

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.930
Has he caught the COVID yet? I don't think so. How do you live in New York city?

5
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:14.580
Stacked on top of people and not catch it.

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.870
<v 2>That's crazy, but they also seem to have a really hunkered down and sort of,</v>

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.580
sort of, you know, done a good job at closing it in.

8
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:28.250
I think they got the scared out of them in the beginning,

9
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.380
because they were sort of embarrassed, right.

10
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.850
Because New York was the first one to really get it. Right.

11
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 0>Well, you know, it's a lot of it was those nursing home cases. That's,</v>

12
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.370
that's a horrific story, man.

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.260
<v 2>Again, people don't even talk about this. It's so bizarre. It was like a,</v>

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.230
almost like a mini genocide, what they did.

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.190
<v 1>Well, they didn't know any better or they didn't know what to do.</v>

16
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:55.010
Or what's weird is when like Cuomo goes on.

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.290
<v 0>CNN and talks to his brother, they don't even bring it up.</v>

18
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.530
<v 2>Creepy. Um, uh, I'm going to tell you,</v>

19
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.210
I'm a proud Italian guy and I can't stand those two guys. I mean, I really,

20
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:08.960
really truly dislike them. The Cuomo brothers.

21
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.750
And I hate that people like them. Oh, but they're chemistry.

22
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.920
They're good together. It makes me mad. What makes you mad about it?

23
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.100
<v 0>They just are such faith.</v>

24
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.950
<v 2>Phony fricking just,</v>

25
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.100
it just exudes fakeness to me.

26
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.080
<v 1>Well, if you have to be, if you're going to be on CNN,</v>

27
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.630
there's is a certain amount of what you do. That's coordinated and programmed.

28
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.580
It's just how it is. There's just a certain amount of it, you know?

29
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:41.270
But I, it seems like, uh, Andrew is, uh,

30
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.350
over time is having a hard time deal dealing with, uh,

31
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.660
the questions and. Andrew's a big guy.

32
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.640
Cause Chris is like six, two.

33
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.160
<v 2>Chris is the one I dislike the most. Yeah. Well, you know, you,</v>

34
00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:02.240
you know about him going out with the Corona virus and all that or not having it

35
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:03.200
or whatever he did.

36
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.981
<v 1>Well,</v>

37
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.820
he went to look at property that he was developing and some guy yelled at him.

38
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.690
You're supposed to be quarantined. He's like, you. They got into it.

39
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.580
<v 2>On the live show. He's in his basement.</v>

40
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.800
<v 1>Well, that was fake. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:21.560
Like I'm finally coming out of the basement for the first time.

42
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.820
But in his defense, that is what they would ask you to do.

43
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:28.430
They would make you do something like that. If you want to work at CNN,

44
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.230
like if you want to work, forget CNN.

45
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.530
If you want to work on a television show and they know that this is an

46
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.980
opportunity to film you coming out of the basement, they go, come on Chris.

47
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.230
I was like, well, make it like it. Like, he's like,

48
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:42.770
I've been out of the basement the whole time. There he is ready?

49
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.270
No back down again. Okay. We'll try it again. One more time, Chris.

50
00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:50.900
I'd like you to come up, but this time just a little less enthusiastic.

51
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.360
Kris Krohn returns to basement from his basement. Quarantine play the video.

52
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.520
No, don't what a doofus it's. It's so phony.

53
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.190
He gets up there and his whole family has to play along with it. Like,

54
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.190
Oh, here it is. Finally. It's over.

55
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.290
I finally made it. Please stop. Stop shaming. Don't make me.

56
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.330
It's unbelievable. Don't make me.

57
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.290
<v 2>It's supposed to be an honest news network.</v>

58
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.780
<v 1>Well, it's, it's a program. It's a,</v>

59
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:28.110
it's an entertainment program about the news. That's really what it is.

60
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.480
And it's an opinion program about the news.

61
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.650
It's not like just like the AP. Okay.

62
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.130
Like associated press. You can read stories in the associated press.

63
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.450
They're generally like their tone is very, um,

64
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.860
it's neutral. They're just explaining facts. You know, that's what I,

65
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:50.850
I try to read stuff. That's just the facts.

66
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.600
And then I'll read opinions on both sides to try to mess my head.

67
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.940
<v 2>Yeah. It's crazy.</v>

68
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.740
CNN has gone haywire though, man. I mean, they are just,

69
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.280
death is coming to all of us 24, seven a day.

70
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:07.770
