1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The general good experience. Do you think you can still throw down,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.370
like if it had to happen, like Jake, Paul called you out.

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.110
<v 1>You probably me up. Really good boxer.</v>

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.850
<v 0>Good boxer. What if it was kickboxing? He does it.</v>

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.640
<v 1>Well, I know how to Kickbox younger, man. And I had good knees.</v>

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.990
I could be kickboxing people,

7
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:23.540
but I could barely get through a workout without being in pain.

8
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:26.570
Now there's a reality of knees and backs.

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.850
<v 0>Have you tried the PBC to peptide that too is also a good one. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.200
<v 1>It helps you maintain,</v>

11
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:36.650
but there's a big difference between maintaining and working out and then

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.080
getting, being able to train for a fight. Yeah.

13
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.290
So you think just being able to train for a fight, your body would break down.

14
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.150
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Jake is interesting, man. He is excellent at truly brother.</v>

15
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.680
<v 1>His brothers. There's a, we played a video of his brother wrestling, uh, Paulo,</v>

16
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.700
Kosta brother is legit. I think he's legit athlete.

17
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.730
I think he wrestled back in the day. Yeah. Yeah. He did wrestling college.

18
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.890
Jamie tried to shut it down. So it was like junior college.

19
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.450
That was actually a real college.

20
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.070
<v 0>That's that Ohio rivalry right there. That's a dentist. No good.</v>

21
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.490
<v 1>Man. You gotta give credit where credit's due. I know those guys like to troll,</v>

22
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.110
but he's Jake and his brother are both legitimate tough guys.

23
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.430
<v 0>They're tough. Do you think that you need trolling now for fight sports?</v>

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.240
Are we at a point where like, that's the only thing that engages the casual fan?

25
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.170
<v 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.000
Khabib Nurmagomedov is the biggest draw in combat sports and he doesn't do

27
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:29.834
any trash talk.

28
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.630
<v 0>But is that a reflection of dominance? It's like,</v>

29
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:36.680
are we kind of watching to see if he'll lose? Like the Mayweather effect? Well,

30
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.320
like how many people are rooting for like,

31
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.050
Khabib seems like incredibly like sweet guy and he's like a consummate

32
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.801
professional,

33
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:47.000
but I feel like the way you market the fight is not in the way that when we were

34
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:50.210
younger watching Roy Jones where like Roy is going to do some crazy thing where

35
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.670
like put his hand behind his back and he just knocks a dude out.

36
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.610
Like we were rooting for Roy to win even his most dominant time.

37
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.920
I feel like now the way you promote the fight is, Oh,

38
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:00.650
this is the perfect guy to take out. Could be, you know,

39
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:03.590
like Justin's the perfect, Oh look. Yeah. You know, he's got striking,

40
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:04.660
but he has a wrestling background.

41
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.970
We're kind of like thinking of different ways we take them down. Whereas like,

42
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.240
yeah. I don't know. I don't know if like, I don't know if we're, if we're,

43
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:14.360
if we're rooting for him to win in that way. Um, well,

44
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.540
if you're a fan of his from the West shore and I'm sure if you're from Dagestan

45
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.930
yeah.

46
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.250
<v 1>So you have a guy who's, uh,</v>

47
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.570
could be a 28 or 29 and O and really a smashed everybody in front of them.

48
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.070
You always wonder, like,

49
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:28.670
who's going to be the guy that solves that riddle and Justin came real close

50
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:32.820
with those leg kicks. He was, he was really up his leg and,

51
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.910
but could be figured out a way to get the fight to the ground.

52
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.330
Almost finished it at the beginning or the end rather the first round and then

53
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.230
got him in the second round. He's just, he's on another level. Yeah.

54
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.810
And that's one of the things that happens when you're, I mean,

55
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.220
you gotta realize that guy is supremely disciplined. Primly dedicated,

56
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.980
like doesn't drink, doesn't smoke. Doesn't around doesn't abuse.

57
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:56.510
His body always fit, always in shape, always training and lives like a champion.

58
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.450
And it's like very religious, like very devout Muslim. Like doesn't,

59
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.160
doesn't suck. Oh yeah. He's so disciplined. No partying. He's not partying.

60
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.560
He's not doing Coke and banging hoes. He has none of that.

61
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.900
He's just smashing people, you know?

62
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.390
But I think he's there trying to talk him into having more fights. Right.

63
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.540
He told his mother that he was gonna retire after he kg. I remember seeing that,

64
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.711
but you know what, man,

65
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.280
he's in his prime and you only get one prime and you know,

66
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.430
and as little more can the most dominant man in the.

67
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.660
<v 2>Yeah, what's going on here that way. Cut. He had there.</v>

68
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.770
It was going around again from his last fight. Oh,

69
00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:38.070
he always cuts a lot of weight, but it was apparently very brutal war. Yeah.

70
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.180
<v 1>That's brutal. But one more throw. He's not really 155 pounds.</v>

71
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.030
Th there's a thing in, in mixed martial arts that we all just accept. And it's,

72
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.470
it's sanctioned form of cheating. Like you're pretending you're 155 pounds.

73
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.420
So you draw your body out. You dry out to one 55 and then you balloon back up,

74
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.170
eat a lot of spaghetti and balloon back up to 200 pounds after the weight cut

75
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.460
