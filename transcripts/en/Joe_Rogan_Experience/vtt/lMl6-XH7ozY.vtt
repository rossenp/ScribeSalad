00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 1>He's the re I've told this story before, but I'll tell it to you.</v>

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.070
He's the reason why this table is this wide. Oh, you were just nervous.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.710
This table was going to be sh I was going to make it more narrow.

5
00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:13.770
I even had a smaller table that we were working with as a guide.

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.790
Then we're still doing the shows back in LA, more setting up this studio.

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.660
I did an interview with Tyson and he was so amped up for this Roy Jones fight

8
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:25.350
that I got nervous. I'm like, I like that extra six inches.

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.030
That's hilarious space between us because he was so ramped up. Oh man.

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.510
When he left, Jamie goes, that's a totally different person. Yeah,

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.410
because he went from being Mike Tyson, pot grower,

12
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.960
not working out at all to get ready to go to combat again,

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.640
getting ready to throw hands. Yeah. Yeah. That's so amped up.

14
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.850
And we've all watched the video where he calls that photographer out and he's

15
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:52.470
like, I'll, you beat your. You pitch on make you love me. Yeah. I watched that.

16
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:56.100
I'm like, ah, I said, I'll you until you love me. Wow.

17
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.610
Where does that come from? That's demon. That's letting the dude. No,

18
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:03.960
he's going to be him for a long time. Yeah. But it's a weird jump.

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.210
Cause he's not actually going to the guy. Who's going to beat the out of him.

20
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:10.800
He might, he might. If he decides to that's his call,

21
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.560
that's what it, that's what it is. Yeah. That's what it is.

22
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.550
Dominating that at you. He's letting you know if I decide to yeah.

23
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.360
I'll you until you love me. That is like one of the deepest,

24
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.110
darkest things a person's ever said to somebody that haunts me at night.

25
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.500
Terrifying. But us back then, I mean,

26
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.760
he was in his prime. Oh yeah. It was. That was, you know,

27
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.880
post-prison I think that was the Lennox Lewis fight.

28
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.270
I believe that was the press conference for the Lennox Lewis fight.

29
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.110
So then wasn't exactly prime, but we didn't know that yet.

30
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.120
He was kind of still in the area of like, you'd already lost a Buster Douglas,

31
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.740
right? He might've already lost two Evander Holyfield. I think he did it.

32
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.520
I don't know. Just amazing to this people on this planet who are like, Oh,

33
00:01:56.521 --> 00:02:00.810
I'll fight that guy. They're looking at video footage of this killer.

34
00:02:00.811 --> 00:02:03.480
And they're like, yeah, I'll take them. There's a lot of killers out there.

35
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.260
And they always want to be the man who beats the man. That's what it is.

36
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:07.981
That gives me hope.

37
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:10.740
I know we call it toxic masculinity or whatever the hell evil men.

38
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:15.390
But it it's amazing that somebody would want to go toe to toe with this,

39
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.770
what is this about? This is a different, I know it is. I'll eat your children.

40
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.190
Oh, this is a different one. Play this, play this.

41
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.713
<v 0>Plane.</v>

42
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.930
<v 1>Uh, JMO. Jamie, the COVID has really hurt yet. It's I've been slacking since.</v>

43
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.410
Yeah. I don't know something's wrong by the way. Quite a hog on Jaymo.

44
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:40.820
I saw it in the sweat pants. Yeah. Quite a piece you got there. There you go,

45
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.680
man. He's not denying it either. He's smiling. He's all red. Now look,

46
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.480
Oh my God. You look like the walls. No, get it up there. Get it up.

47
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:53.780
Tell them that they come up with a, with a hog employee.

48
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.910
Legitimate, legitimate, like good to go.

49
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.930
Universally accepted the way fake boobs are accepted. Yeah,

50
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.070
because fake boobs are basically normal. No one says, listen,

51
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.670
you got a great personality, but this is. Girls in high school are doing that.

52
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.920
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. How was that? Well, you know, you hit 18 or whatever.

53
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.810
Oh God. But yeah. I feel like it should be 21 before you do something like that.

54
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.800
Yeah. But man, when I killed her a huge Dawn, how big would you want? Well,

55
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.900
your, your, your there's rumors about your, uh, your and balls there. But uh,

56
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.860
I used to have a bit about big Dick pills. Yeah. There was big Dick pills.

57
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:36.970
It would take about 30 seconds for the first guy diving overdose. No,

58
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.640
one's going to take just one. If a pill makes your Dick bigger,

59
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.520
we'd be thinking like, how many do I take before I get a stroke?

60
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.760
Give me one less. Right. And let's do this. I'm like,

61
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.000
it would change the shape of vaginas because there would be no regular Dixon

62
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.070
anymore. Within here we go. Here we go.

63
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.490
<v 2>With Mike Tyson. Who's standing by with Jim gray, Jim. Yeah. Okay. Thank you,</v>

64
00:03:56.491 --> 00:03:59.280
Steve. Mike was that your shortest fight ever. I've been winning.

65
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.770
If there's only one God and Muhammad blessings and peace.

66
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:05.280
Be upon him as a prophet. I dedicate this vital. My brother,

67
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.660
Darryl bond who died. I'll be there to see you. I love you with all my heart.

68
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.850
All praise. Be to my children. I love you. Oh God, our man.

69
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.100
What is this? Your shortest fight.

70
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.480
<v 1>Anytime. Amateur professional. I'm great. Hanging in there. Yeah.</v>

71
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.180
<v 2>Um, I don't know, man. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

72
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.000
Lennox Lewis Linux. I'm coming for you.

73
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.540
Like is it frustrating to train like you did and then have this as seven or

74
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:34.170
eight seconds.

75
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.500
But if I only trained probably two weeks or three weeks for this fight,

76
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.890
I had to bury my best friend and I dedicated this fight.

77
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:42.870
I wasn't going to fight. I dedicated this. Fight them.

78
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.270
I was going to rip his heart out. I'm the best ever.

79
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.230
I'm the most brutal and Michigan most ruthless champion has ever been there's no

80
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:53.340
one could stop me legs to the conquer. No, I'm Alexander. He's no Alexander.

81
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.930
I'm the best ever. They've never been anybody lifted. I'm Jack Dempsey.

82
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:01.080
There's no one like me. I'm from their cloth. There's no one that can match me.

83
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.520
My style is impetuous. My defense is impregnable and I'm just from brochures.

84
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.670
I want your heart. I want to eat your children. Praise be to our law.

85
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.770
<v 1>Whoa.</v>

86
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.380
The craziest post-fight speech of all time is

87
00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:20.880
no second place. No, he's got great writers. Holy come on.

88
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.650
And even the waves, my style's impetuous, my defense is impregnable. Yeah.

89
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:30.150
It was just bam. I am Sonny Liston. I'm Jack Dempsey. I'm from their cloth.

90
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.990
Woo. He got to there from the easiest question. That was a yes or no quiz.

91
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:36.210
Is this the shortest fight only to say what?

92
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.010
And he just went all the way to left field. That was amazing. Yeah.

93
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:44.520
That was heavy. That was heavy. I would, I mean, could you be in his entourage?

94
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.850
Because he seems like a guy who just flip on a dime and you just like, Hey,

95
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:51.150
you want the Funyuns? I kill ya. You're like, Oh, I'm sorry.

96
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.000
We've been best friends for 30 years. I don't know if he would be like that. Uh,

97
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.190
when I've met him, he's been very nice, very friendly to everybody.

98
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.110
But I think when you're a dude,

99
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:05.060
that's that driven and that maniacal when you're at your best,

100
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.940
I mean, he was, you got to realize like throughout his life,

101
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.530
all of his great success came from his ability to be

102
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:14.930
ferocious. All of it. Right?

103
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.980
I mean the whole success of his fighting career came from his skill,

104
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.600
his technique and his ability in the heat of the moment to be ferocious.

105
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.990
She was just geared up for that. I know there it is. Right. This is,

106
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:29.660
this is the other one though. The brawl. Yeah.

107
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.110
Oh God, that guy must have been true.

108
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.003
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

109
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.150
<v 1>Heavy. I mean, how do you go back to the green room with that guy? You uh,</v>

110
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.580
you go, uh you're right Mike? Yeah. Good point. Well said,

111
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.360
well said, I think you did everything. Perfect. Let's get out of here.

112
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.070
As I was that week as white boy, I would have been running out the fire exit.

113
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.440
That guy is still to this day. Probably if he's still alive,

114
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.580
probably wakes up in the middle of the night,

115
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.780
thinking of Mike Tyson over his bed. Oh, I love you.

116
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:24.700
I love you punching him in the face. Holy. But again like the,

117
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.370
in the context of a regular life,

118
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.880
that is a outrageous behavior that you would never expect from anybody,

119
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.250
but in the context of a life where you're rewarded for being the most

120
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:41.050
ferocious and your ruthlessly successful

121
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.190
at doing that, like that is normal. This is like you, like,

122
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:50.200
you look at his fights, the stoppage of Trevor Berbick to win the title.

123
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.130
You look at his destruction of Tyrell, Biggs and Marvis Frazier.

124
00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:58.030
And you go through his career and of course he's got that in him.

125
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.780
That's how he can turn it on. But that feels like more, there's more there.

126
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.870
That's why he's one of the greatest ever lace up the gloves.

127
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.820
But it seems like there was some real trauma,

128
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.460
like we don't know about a hundred percent. Yeah.

129
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.960
We'll tell he talked about that trauma,

130
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.460
but that trauma is also what motivated me to be so great. Right.

131
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.160
See the thing about a guy like him, it's like you,

132
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.670
you can't get there any other way. He was not,

133
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.930
it wasn't that it was just skillful and just competitive and just

134
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.030
unbelievably,

135
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.050
technically proficient in the art of smashing people with your fists. Yeah.

136
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.760
He also had an extra gear that other people didn't have. He was, you know,

137
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.650
and he was even hypnotized when he was a young boy. Really? Yeah. Custom motto.

138
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:41.890
Uh,

139
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.430
he was telling me the whole story of it on the podcast that custom motto took

140
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:48.940
him when he was a young boy, you got to realize he's like 13 years old.

141
00:08:48.941 --> 00:08:52.810
He gets adopted by one of the greatest minds in the history of boxing. Right?

142
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.160
Custom motto was a, he was a, he was, he,

143
00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.070
he really understood psychology like deeply.

144
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.000
And he was one of the great boxing trainers trade. He trained Floyd Patterson,

145
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.530
Jose Torres, like world champions. He's in the game forever.

146
00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.100
And he was always looking for that one great fighter.

147
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:13.860
And he found it in his 13 year old kid. And he knew right away.

148
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.640
Cause his 13 year old kid was 190 pounds, 13,

149
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.400
190 jacked at 13 credits just had incredible natural

150
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:27.840
ability and drive was getting praised for doing something finally,

151
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.190
whereas all of his life,

152
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.630
right on and dismissed and locked in jail and all this different stuff. Now,

153
00:09:33.631 --> 00:09:37.290
all of a sudden he's getting praised for it. And then he's getting hypnotized.

154
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.680
It's getting hypnotized by this guy was telling him you don't exist.

155
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.960
Only the task exists.

156
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.830
Don't fill your mind with thoughts of yourself and good or bad,

157
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:49.890
or I'm a bad person. I'm a good brother. You don't exist. You just,

158
00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:54.150
you are the task and you move forward and you attack Jesus.

159
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:55.980
When he was saying that you don't exist.

160
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.380
Like thinking that just the task exists.

161
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.510
So he's got him so focused on going out there and attacking that

162
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:07.050
person while the other person has all these doubts and fears and this and that

163
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.540
in their mind. But he's trained to think like a local motion just to train

164
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.360
coming at you. You're not going to stop him.

165
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.450
He's just gonna figure out he's not, he's not filled with self doubt.

166
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.380
He's filled with confidence. He's filled with knowing at the end of him,

167
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.540
smashing you in the face, you're going to be lying on your back.

168
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:25.860
And he's going to get that amazing,

169
00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:28.110
good feeling that he gets every time he does this. Right?

170
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.600
So every time he smashes people, he gets this incredible feeling.

171
00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.220
So he's dedicated,

172
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:35.850
just like we were talking about lazy comics that lazy comics can become like

173
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.760
actually discipline when they want to get their act together to do stand up.

174
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.580
A fighter is so motivated by that great feeling of winning,

175
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.470
of winning that you just become, the more you feel it, the more you want it.

176
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.470
And the more discipline you get and the more you drive towards it.

177
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.220
And that was him. Plus then yeah,

178
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.330
that guy with all that hypnotic and then fame and then money. I mean,

179
00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:03.770
that's a bad gumbo. It's about gumbo and look, look what happened.

180
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.550
Why he's okay now? Well, on the other side, uh,

181
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:10.970
an interesting person did that's true. Particularly,

182
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.400
particularly before the fight. Um, you know,

183
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.540
like before he signed on to the fight,

184
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.640
the first time I met him and talked to him, I met him before the UFC.

185
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:23.030
But the first time I talked to him on the podcast, he was an interesting guy.

186
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.150
He's like a, a very thoughtful person. He thinks a lot about things,

187
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.280
but daddy's got that switch.

188
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.580
And he turned that switch on before the Roy Jones fight.

189
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:37.400
Or you can tell which I think he won. Yeah. If it was a decision. Yeah,

190
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.380
for sure. But there was no decisions.

191
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.820
I was trying to see if anybody knew who Mike was yelling at the crowd there. Oh.

192
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.500
So I Googled it and look who was in the crowd. Oh,

193
00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.120
live. He was doing it for the tonight show with Jay Leno. He's like a whole

194
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.060
JMR, like talking to tons of people, skinny Davis gig, uh, young,

195
00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:02.580
young days. You got to bring this up. When you see him tonight.

196
00:12:02.581 --> 00:12:03.660
This is amazing Lennox.

197
00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:05.730
I don't think there's a part where he's talking to Mike here at least,

198
00:12:05.731 --> 00:12:10.190
but probably for safety. He may or may not have been the guy yell on that. No,

199
00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.720
no, he's a white boy. Oh, okay. That's okay. Okay. Okay.

200
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.710
Dave would never yell out of snow. No, no, no. I know there's jokes online.

201
00:12:16.711 --> 00:12:19.830
He was yelling to Jim brewer. That's amazing. That's amazing.

202
00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:22.680
It's a lot of people are listening. They're like who you're talking about. Oh,

203
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.510
right, right. A skinny, young, very young Dave Chappelle and they're playing

204
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.930
Jack Lennox. Lewis rock. Remember you were a young comic.

205
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.130
You'd take these weird gigs.

206
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:43.050
