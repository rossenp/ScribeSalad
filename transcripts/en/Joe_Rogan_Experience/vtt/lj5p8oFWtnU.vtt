00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.960
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. There's two deathbed stories that I heard. All right.</v>

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.370
One of them was, uh,

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.960
should I tell the sad one or the cool one first? It's up to you.

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.940
Okay. I'll tell the cool one first. Okay. We'll land in a dark place. Um,

5
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.920
so I remember here in Lou Reed, when Lou Reed was on his deathbed,

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.760
he was just sitting there relaxed, smiling with this look of like wonderment,

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.260
like enjoying this exp like your last experience,

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.700
I'm going to experience death. And he was open to it and,

9
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.610
and had like a little smile on his face. And it's just like, okay,

10
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.350
that's how I would like to go out and not being like, oh. Oh.

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.530
And then there was another one. I almost don't even want to say the name.

12
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.300
I'm not even gonna, it was this famous guy. And he,

13
00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:52.580
he was a child star and I don't think he ever got past that. You know,

14
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:55.370
the ups and downs I was here and now I'm only here,

15
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:59.060
but he's still like doing these huge shows, but he's not as big as he was.

16
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.170
And his, his final words were so much wasted time.

17
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.770
And if you look at his career, it wasn't, he worked his off.

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.340
But then I'm th that's what scares the out of me. I'm like so much wasted time.

19
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.260
Did you played theaters for 40 years selling out and made millions of dollars

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.420
and you came out the other side with the w that was saying so much wasted time.

21
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.190
So that's kind of making me look at like, uh, you know, it's, it's,

22
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.120
there's this weird sort of thing with what we do. Like, oh,

23
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:32.690
this is exciting and stuff, but you know, you kind of also sit back like,

24
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.980
all right, well, I'm doing, if I,

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.400
if I do that too much and something else suffers,

26
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.530
or did I take the time, like, uh, you know, I have a pool I'm gonna,

27
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.373
I'm never in.

28
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.590
<v 1>So it's just, just expensive puddle. Like, what am I doing with this thing?</v>

29
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.460
And it's comes over to maintain your bottle, do it. And that was the dream.

30
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.090
I remember.

31
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.190
<v 0>Living in play New York, no air conditioners,</v>

32
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:59.580
like someday I'm going to get a house and I'm going to have a pool.

33
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.530
And on a day, like this, I'm going to jump into that thing. And, uh, yeah.

34
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:09.060
And on hot days like that, I'm not, I'm sitting in my office, you know,

35
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:10.680
working with this, something to be said about that.

36
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.350
Cause that's what you're supposed to do as a dad and everything. But then, um,

37
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.860
you know, there's also that other thing is like, if you work too much,

38
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.200
you end up being that guy laying there.

39
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.780
<v 2>You probably will. Yeah. You know the thing about those guys? Well,</v>

40
00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:27.800
if you work too much, I'm saying, I think those guys that, uh, that so,

41
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.490
so much wasted time guys, you know, they're, they also,

42
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.550
it's very difficult when you're in a competitive business,

43
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:39.170
like show business to pay attention to just yourself and just like,

44
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.370
enjoy your experience and be in the moment everybody is looking at themselves

45
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.540
through the eyes of the success of other people.

46
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.010
Like I remember when I was on a news radio, um,

47
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.270
th the staff, everybody, uh, the crew, uh, the, uh, the, the cast,

48
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.740
rather everybody else besides me had a background show business.

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.470
All I had to do, I only had a background in stand-up.

50
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.410
I never taken acting classes other than a few private classes.

51
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.660
They made me take when they gave me a development deal.

52
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.660
So I didn't understand the culture of acting.

53
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.930
And I remember I was on the set and they would read variety,

54
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.530
or they would read the, you know, whatever those show Hollywood reporter.

55
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.510
And they would read about people getting deals.

56
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.600
And they would read about how well friends was doing and how well this is doing.

57
00:03:22.601 --> 00:03:27.100
And they get so mad. And I, and I would, I would go, why are you reading that?

58
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.090
Like, you're reading the devil's rag. I go, you guys are upset. I go,

59
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.480
last time I checked, I'm on TV.

60
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.880
I'm a 27 year old kid and online TV, because that.

61
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.530
<v 0>Was such a well-written well-respected show that didn't get</v>

62
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:47.610
quite the shine that it should have. I felt, I felt,

63
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.170
cause that was a really, really,

64
00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:53.550
really good show with like a ridiculous level talented cast and the social,

65
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.413
always those things.

66
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.640
But that's something you have to learn in this business that you just have to

67
00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:59.040
accept that, like, you know, I always,

68
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.380
I quite a lot of things to like music that, you know,

69
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:03.960
you'll have like some pop star, you know,

70
00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:07.470
some young guy or girl's going to come out prime of their life.

71
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.000
Good-looking singing some, you know,

72
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.130
bubblegum is always going to sell more than this other thing.

73
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.530
And you just have to, you gotta be okay with that. Yeah.

74
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.050
Because if you want to sell that, yeah, you gotta,

75
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:21.420
you gotta go do that bubblegum. And if you don't want to do that,

76
00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:24.150
don't sit there and look at it and be upset.

77
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.270
<v 2>The comparison is the thief of joy. It's a famous quote,</v>

78
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:30.960
but it's an awesome one. It really is. It's you can set for a while. Yeah.

79
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.410
A lot of.

80
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.840
<v 1>People do, especially show business.</v>

81
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.280
<v 2>Show business. That's a common thing amongst comics. It's a, you would see it,</v>

82
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.170
this, this gleam of jealousy,

83
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.270
but I think also a part of there's good aspects of jealousy and that you

84
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:48.540
can feel bad that you're not getting something that other people are getting,

85
00:04:48.541 --> 00:04:51.660
and then it makes you work harder. But then once you've achieved,

86
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.700
like a level of success where it's measurable, like where you like, Hey, look,

87
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.860
you're paying your bills. You're going,

88
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:01.950
you're doing shows and people coming to see you, like you're doing great.

89
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.250
Just concentrate on the work. Then concentrate on the work.

90
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:07.620
Don't concentrate on being at your best.

91
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.010
Don't concentrate on how well this guy is doing. And how will that?

92
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.060
I remember when Dan cook was killing it, there was so many haters.

93
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.240
And not just because of all the real reasons to be a hater,

94
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.290
but also just because of his success was so astronomical.

95
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.180
I remember people would just fume thinking about Dane, cook, selling out arenas.

96
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.150
It would drive them crazy. And I remember thinking like,

97
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.170
