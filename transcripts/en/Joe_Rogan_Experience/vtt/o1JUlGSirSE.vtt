00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.790
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Um, how much pushback have you gotten from this idea?</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.860
Cause it seems like a lot of people think that overpopulation is a giant

3
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:11.694
problem.

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.530
And then when you say we should triple plus the amount of people in the

5
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.720
United States, we want to compete with the rest of the world.

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.630
I would imagine a lot of people are like, what are you smoking?

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.933
Matthew Iglesias?

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.400
<v 1>No, the, I mean, the book's really good. So everyone who reads it,</v>

9
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:26.091
it's just like, Oh,

10
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:30.650
you convinced me and there's this there's no pushback at all. Um, no, I, yes.

11
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.360
Uh, there is concern about overpopulation. That's something that, you know,

12
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:37.970
so there's people from the right. They don't like immigrants.

13
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.550
They don't like immigration and they see it through that lens.

14
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.910
<v 0>With that. Wow. Because this is a country of immigrants. It's a,</v>

15
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.110
it's a very strange thing to have a country that is

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.410
entirely comprised of people who came from somewhere else,

17
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.250
other than native Americans. Right. Entirely comprised.

18
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.200
And yet there's a giant population that doesn't like immigrants.

19
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.410
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, look, some of it's a question of taste, you know,</v>

20
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:06.230
people like different places, people like different kinds of things.

21
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.950
I think the best parts of America are places that have a lot of people from

22
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:13.370
different places to me, you know, whether that's that's Austin,

23
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:16.430
where we are in New York, where I'm from, it's like, it's cool.

24
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:20.330
Like that's America at its best. Some people don't like it. Uh,

25
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.730
there's also the legality question though, right?

26
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:25.190
Starting in the 1980s and 1990s,

27
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:29.060
we built up a substantial group of people who were living here illegally.

28
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.780
I'm for, you know, what started in the eighties is that when it really started?

29
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.790
Yeah. I mean that's when it really took off, was it.

30
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.580
<v 0>Because the regulations were made more stringent?</v>

31
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.350
<v 1>Well, so what happened was in 1996, uh, they, they changed the law.</v>

32
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.750
They say era is the acronym for it.

33
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.250
And they made it a lot harder for people who had come here without papers to

34
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:52.490
quote unquote, get legal. So even if you put roots down,

35
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:54.530
even if we were married to an American citizen,

36
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.080
there was no way to obtain legal status.

37
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.990
They also made it harder to cross the border. So it used to be,

38
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.370
people would come over,

39
00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.910
they'd pick vegetables in California for a season and then they just go back,

40
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.330
right? They go back to Mexico, take their money with them, get a nice house.

41
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.000
They made it harder to cross the border. So people would stay.

42
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.900
And people who stayed had no way to get a legal status here.

43
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.710
So unauthorized population, it built up, it built up, it built up.

44
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.870
There's a movement on one side to say, well,

45
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.120
we should create a path to citizenship for those people.

46
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.180
Most of them they're living here peacefully. They're working hard.

47
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:30.230
They're not doing anything. That's where I stand. But there's people who say,

48
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:32.540
look, you know, they broke the rules, we gotta be harsh.

49
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:36.590
So we've been arguing about that. Unauthorized immigration,

50
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.770
so viciously. And I think we've lost sight of the fact that, you know,

51
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:43.520
we can just create legal pathways for people to come. You know,

52
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.400
some people will say, well, my, my grandparents, my parents,

53
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:49.670
whoever they came the right way, they, they didn't want to be illegal easy then.

54
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.240
Exactly. And it is a totally true. So my great grandparents,

55
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.180
they came to this country at a time when there was no restriction.

56
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.190
<v 0>My grandparents as well, they just came over from Italy. Not that hard,</v>

57
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:00.880
so good for them.

58
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.080
<v 1>Right. And so like, yes, like we should have a legal process for people to come.</v>

59
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.670
We can have rules, you know, try to make sure you're like, say you,

60
00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:13.090
you should be working age. Right. You should come here, get a job, pay taxes.

61
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.580
You can't just like come across and collect social security.

62
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.320
<v 0>But obviously you're okay with children coming across as well.</v>

63
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.820
Particularly whether they're adopted once they get here or whether they come

64
00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:27.450
here with their parents or we should make it possible. Right? Yes.

65
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.780
We should make it possible. That's a great way of putting it.

66
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.290
<v 1>That's how you can not have people breaking the worlds that's to me.</v>

67
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.131
But you know,

68
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.710
a lot of people on the right don't see it that way now on the left,

69
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.800
there's some folks, you know, people are concerned about the environment.

70
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.280
I mean, I'm, I'm concerned too. I don't, I don't want to breathe polluted air.

71
00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:46.830
I don't want like cities underwater. Uh,

72
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.390
but there's a strain of sort of eco apocalyptic thinking, you know,

73
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:55.950
where people say, Oh, like we can't handle it. Like only de-growth is gonna,

74
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.430
is going to save us. And I just don't think that's right. You know,

75
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:03.120
I am bullish on technology, right?

76
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.970
We've got more and more clean energy sources.

77
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:07.950
We've got better and better electric cars.

78
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.800
There's more stuff we can do with electrification. We,

79
00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:14.850
we need to take those steps, but we can have a prosperous,

80
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.050
sustainable society that has plenty of people in it that has high living

81
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:22.200
standards, uh, things like that. So w we don't need to worry about that.

82
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.940
A lot of Americans also just overestimate how many people are here.

83
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.530
So a billion sounds like a lot. It's about triple our current population,

84
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.190
but that would give us the population density, France.

85
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.890
It would give us about half the density of Germany,

86
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.820
way less than half the density of the United Kingdom. And you know,

87
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:44.670
if you've ever been to the UK, it's like, it's a nice country.

88
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.720
They've got London, big city, they got countryside, they got rolling Hills.

89
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.730
They got sheep. You go up to Scotland and like this nobody there. Um, so like,

90
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.530
we could have all kinds of places with a billion Americans, countryside,

91
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.600
suburbs, cities, all kinds of stuff.

92
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.410
What's the benefit of having all those people though. Uh, so two benefits,

93
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:06.810
right? So one, I think internationally, you know,

94
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:11.340
the United States has been like the number one country for a hundred years give

95
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:14.970
or take, right. Uh, we're the, the biggest dog out there, you know,

96
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.160
everybody knows better than to mess with us. And we're losing that status.

97
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.280
You know, we're losing that status economically to China,

98
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.620
they're doing more stuff like, you know,

99
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.580
telling NBA coaches like what they can tweet, what they can't tweet.

100
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.590
They're censoring Hollywood movies,

101
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:33.450
because they've got the number one market out there.

102
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.680
You can get into scarier stuff. Eventually, you know, South China,

103
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:41.880
sea Naval battles. I'm not like a war guy, but you don't want that. I think,

104
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.390
I think we want to stay number one and growth has been important to that

105
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:49.770
historically, right? Like why is the United States a big deal country?

106
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.930
And Canada is like, you know,

107
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:55.230
like our cute little brother and it's because a lot of people live here,

108
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.690
you know, Canada's nice, but there's people no real strength there. Second,

109
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.720
I think it'll make us a more prosperous country. Uh,

110
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.640
what we do as modern day Americans is we do stuff for each other, right?

111
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:11.750
Whether that's we make show, we write books. Uh, we, we teach in schools,

112
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:14.450
we run restaurants, we're doing services to each other,

113
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.160
and you get more prosperity when you have more people and more ability to sort

114
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:20.630
of have those interactions.
