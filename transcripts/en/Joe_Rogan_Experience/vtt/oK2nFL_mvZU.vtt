00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>The general Hogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.700
<v 1>Because as a comedian, you have to be on social media. I get, I mean,</v>

3
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:09.300
I don't know way not to be, and it's just like impossible.

4
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.070
Like I am so ridiculously addicted to my phone.

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.220
Like the amount of times that I set it down, going like enough with that.

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.440
And then I'll just sit there and then five seconds later,

7
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.150
I'm just picking it up. And like,

8
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:24.480
you know what it is is it's also like I watch when, even when I'm watching TV,

9
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.720
I'll be like, Oh, look at this old movie. I want to, that guy's still alive.

10
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.040
Right. And I said, look, can I die? Why did he die of high? That's you know, 82.

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.040
No, it's not bad. You know? And just, let's.

12
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.330
<v 0>See if someone's talking about me.</v>

13
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.930
<v 1>I don't do that. I go, let's see what these, uh.</v>

14
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.100
<v 0>I don't know. Hmm. Social media is bad. I mean, it's good. It's bad. Right.</v>

15
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.590
But the bad part is you can get lost in other people's opinions and want to

16
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:52.850
defend yourself. And then, you know,

17
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.060
people misrepresent what you said or distort what you said or take it out of

18
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:58.970
context. And then you're like, Hey, and then you think, well,

19
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:01.960
how many people are reading that? And thinking the wrong thing about me.

20
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.320
<v 1>I never respond to it. I don't either. I just flip out.</v>

21
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.640
<v 0>I would, I do what I call post and ghost. When I make a post,</v>

22
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.940
I make a post and then I put my phone away and I walk out of the room.

23
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.140
I leave my phone.

24
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.570
<v 1>I thought you were going to say, you write what you want to say,</v>

25
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:19.970
and then you delete it. And I'll be like, I've been turned over to accidentally.

26
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.983
No, no.

27
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.390
<v 0>Send I make a post. And then I go away. Right?</v>

28
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.760
Like I don't look at what people are saying about the posts.

29
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.650
I just get the out of there. It's just, it, it never is a good use of time.

30
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.510
There's so many things that I like to do.

31
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.650
And that's one thing that saves me is that I have so many obsessions, right.

32
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.760
Is that I there's so many things. I like to do that, but the phone will get me.

33
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.420
If I'm not, if you know what will get me YouTube,

34
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.150
watching nothing, it'll be an hour. I'll watch a video on how they make watches.

35
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.313
And then I'll watch, uh,

36
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.850
three or four pool matches and then I'll watch a Oh 1970 Chevelle. Oh,

37
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.780
how'd they make that. And then.

38
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.500
<v 1>But all of those is once you click on one thing,</v>

39
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.740
then they just keep you 40 of the same thing. It's like, they don't,

40
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.670
it's almost like they don't want you to progress is like, um,

41
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.910
like I had like some of, uh, like on my watch,

42
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.370
I think I told this story last time I was on here, like on Netflix,

43
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:15.260
I watched all of Narcos. Yeah.

44
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.860
And then everything became like behind the scenes of San Quintin and blah, blah,

45
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.370
blah, blah, blah. So I've been trying to watch these French movies. Right.

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.760
But for some reason it won't because I think I'm here.

47
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.160
They keep giving me like the English speaking ones. It's like,

48
00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:31.520
that's not what I'm trying to do here. I'm trying to watch their. Like,

49
00:02:31.521 --> 00:02:35.310
how do I get out of this kind of keep dragging you back down to.

50
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.050
<v 0>Well, they find what you're injured. I mean, the algorithm's pretty simple.</v>

51
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.370
I mean, it's not simple, it's complicated,

52
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:43.100
but it's as a simple formula in terms of like how it applies,

53
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.300
whatever you're interested in,

54
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:47.090
it's going to show you whatever you're going to spend the most time looking at.

55
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:50.930
It's going to show you whether it's things you hate, like YouTube or Facebook,

56
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.420
that accentuates things that give you the turn.

57
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.640
It's it turns out it's really just what you're responding to and spending time

58
00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:00.130
on, like did an experiment.

59
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.090
Ari's experiment was he only looked up puppies on YouTube.

60
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.110
That's it just puppies. And then all YouTube was showing them was puppies.

61
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.930
He was trying to tell people, look, this isn't insidious.

62
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.450
It's not like the man's trying to keep you angry. Right.

63
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.500
So you're keeping yourself angry. If you just go and look at puppies all day,

64
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.580
that's all it's going to show you.

65
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.910
<v 1>I don't know. I feel like if I look at one puppy video,</v>

66
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:28.050
then they give me a bunch more and it's just like, okay,

67
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:29.850
maybe I've moved past puppies at this point.

68
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.040
<v 0>Yeah. But that's up to you. You, yourself,</v>

69
00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:33.990
you have to search for things that aren't puppy related.

70
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 1>I know, but it's just easier just to click on what they're giving out.</v>

71
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:41.700
More puppy videos is my safe space.
