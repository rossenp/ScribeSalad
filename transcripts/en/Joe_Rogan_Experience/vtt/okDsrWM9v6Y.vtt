WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>The general good experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 1>Even back then,</v>

3
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:08.730
I saw where change was trying to take place in the industry and they

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:11.760
wasn't gone loud. I call it a conspiracy.

5
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.890
I saw it a conspiracy taking place where they wasn't going to allow any more

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.150
masterpiece cash, money. Uh, uh,

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.740
Irv got independent independence. They would like shutting that door.

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.660
So, you know, in my mind, I'm like, okay, I see the mood they make.

9
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:35.400
And let me counter this and create another Avenue for the youth to

10
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:40.260
come in after us. And unfortunately, uh, I think,

11
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.460
uh, they witnessed the same thing and they hit murder, Inc,

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.530
which is Irv Gotti company distraught. It, they hit shook night there for row.

13
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.720
We know what happened with that. And they came at me in a massive way,

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.501
you know,

15
00:00:55.501 --> 00:01:00.210
all the way up to the point where they put a man on me that killed eight

16
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:03.330
people. And I really believe, you know,

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.370
he was trying to kill me.

18
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.170
<v 0>And when you say they put a man on you, like in what way.</v>

19
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.090
<v 1>They assigned a guy by the name of Schumacher, you know,</v>

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.890
on me to arrest me to whatever he was

21
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.640
supposed to do. But he sent death threats at me.

22
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.050
And here's a man that killed eight people. You know, I hired the,

23
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.930
since they was investigating me,

24
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.520
I decided to hire an investigator to investigate them.

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.750
And that's when I found out this guy killed all of those people. You know,

26
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:40.520
I brought the investigating report.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.290
So you can look at it if you choose to showed me outside. So, you know,

28
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:50.030
this was a real life situation that people may hear and

29
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:52.250
thank, you know, this is not true,

30
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.710
but he is confirmation of how true it was in 1999. You know,

31
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:02.390
I reported this with the help of Congresswoman Maxine waters,

32
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.800
Janet Reno,

33
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.600
because they intervene on my behalf because they saw what was

34
00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:13.100
happening. And of course we, they had a, uh, what you call it,

35
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.430
a congressional hearing on me,

36
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.780
all of this is public information on congressional hearing where the

37
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:22.820
DEA and, you know,

38
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:27.770
it reminded me of the time when Clarence Thomas was,

39
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.990
uh, being, uh, a hearing was taking place over his harassment or something.

40
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.180
Then all of those people, Democrat and Republicans was around,

41
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.860
you know what I mean, had him in a circle.

42
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.600
So this is the conversation they was having concerning me, James Prince.

43
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.550
And I'm watching this, you know, on, uh, um, on video.

44
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.600
I'm not invited,

45
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.100
but I'm watching them have this conversation about me or about the congressional

46
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:59.920
hearing. And, uh, I'm just like, wow, you know, these people want pretty bad,

47
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.080
but a long story short, you know,

48
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.340
they were able to speak up on my behalf and you know,

49
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.270
which ultimately, Oh, it's so many connections to this.

50
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.340
Cause even Al Gore, you know,

51
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:17.230
came in a portrait where they tried to sit me up at my church with

52
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:21.130
Al Gore, Al Gore came to visit my church. You know,

53
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.080
which when you running for president,

54
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.320
you visit a lot of black churches and stuff like that.

55
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.550
And my pastor wanted me to meet Al Gore that day.

56
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.470
So when I pull up, you know, I was married at the time. You know,

57
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:37.360
I told my wife, I say,

58
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.310
all these people ain't here with the president because I was watching body

59
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:44.230
language. You know, I saw a black,

60
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.120
black glasses kinda looking my direction. And she said, Oh, come on, boy,

61
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.410
you been leery. You know, people not thinking about you or whatever.

62
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.810
So I went and heard the sermon and before the sermon was over,

63
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.030
I say, let's go. Normally I hang around and socialize. And of course,

64
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.990
pastor wanted me to meet Al Gore. I decided to leave.

65
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.480
And shortly after the Dallas newspaper came

66
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:18.220
out with, uh, a story in all of this, you can confirm and look it up.

67
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.380
James Prince donated a quarter million dollars to Al

68
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.300
Gore at the church to stop an investigation on him.

69
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.870
Oh man. Just a bunch of BS. Unbelievable. You know what I mean?

70
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.590
So I was being set on news. Oh yeah. It's documented.

71
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.800
<v 0>So they created this fake story to make you look bad</v>

72
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.900
and they printed it in the news. So it had to be coordinated at the very top.

73
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.720
Oh yeah. Wow. Yeah.

74
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.190
What was that like to know they were conspiring against you like that, you know,

75
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.510
first of all, you had to feel like, Oh, I must've made it. Well.

76
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.930
<v 1>I didn't quite feel that I had made. I felt like they wanted to hit me.</v>

77
00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.510
You know, because like these,

78
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.040
this guy one night I left my office and a

79
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:13.680
DPS officer stopped me.

80
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.430
He got behind me on the streets when I left out of the office,

81
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.170
but he stopped me on the freeway. And it was the first time I was stopped.

82
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:26.310
One time to be told, to go and stop again.

83
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.380
So he stopped me on the freeway and told me to go and pull in the McDonald's

84
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.890
parking lot. So I say, Oh, okay.

85
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.200
So as I exit the freeway and looked over in the McDonald's parking lot and it

86
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:42.510
was dark and I saw Kara, uh,

87
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.620
cherry key Jeep green and a Cutlass,

88
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.120
and it was a dog. So I'm like, nah,

89
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.360
I'm not pulling in that dog. So I kind of told him,

90
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:58.400
I'm going to pull in the shell station where the lights were so up and I could

91
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:03.350
hear him in the back, poor over on his, on his thing,

92
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.480
make a right. I'm like, I'm going to go over here.

93
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.210
So I went over there and the light,

94
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.670
I had some guys behind me following me because they had been sending me threats.

95
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:17.300
So I'm not stupid. So I understood that, you know,

96
00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:21.260
I need to cover myself until I make it home. And uh,

97
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.520
when I pulled over, you know, the officer got out and he said,

98
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.720
why you didn't pull over? Like I told you, I say, sir,

99
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.410
I didn't want you to think I was trying to hurt you in that dark.

100
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.340
And I didn't want to think you was trying to hurt me. What's the prop,

101
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.680
uh, what, where you were swerving? I say, no,

102
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.740
I say you got the wrong man. I don't drink. I don't smoke.

103
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.350
What no swerving going on with me. Well, uh, where are your guns?

104
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.450
Right? How do he even know I have guns?

105
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.520
I gave him my gun license. Well, how you know, I have gone.

106
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.850
I haven't even given you my license. So I gave him my license, say my hand,

107
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.500
hands on the steering wheel. My guns are under my seat. Well,

108
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:10.540
we'll get out the car, you know? And I say, okay,

109
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.140
I don't have a problem with that. How much money you have?

110
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.630
I say, okay, you want to borrow some money? Or somebody asked me about my money.

111
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.150
So he told me, so I went back there and um,

112
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.100
he went and searching my car. You know, he in there,

113
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:34.570
I see him like moving around with things, but he went on the passenger side.

114
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.280
So I walk around. I say, man, why are you violating my rights search in my car?

115
00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.700
And he jumped it back. I'm looking for the gun. I said,

116
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.420
I told you where the guns are. Clearly, you then pass them up.

117
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.700
You got my clips out. So anyway,

118
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:53.650
he came back and I could see him make an eye contact with the call with the

119
00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:54.910
people across the street.

120
00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:00.130
And eventually one of them drove over and this was an officer

121
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:01.690
by the name of Chad Scott.

122
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.820
He had like black paint on his eyes and an army fatigue

123
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.570
type of a uniform and him, and also,

124
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.240
you know, translated some words. And he came back to me and say, okay,

125
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:20.890
you free to go and gave me a warning ticket, you know, a warning ticket.

126
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.070
And it was then when I got home,

127
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.740
I realized a bullet or two was missing. So red flags like. Yeah.

128
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.680
Like went up. I'm like, why would they keep one of my bullets?

129
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.420
Why were they trying to pull me in the dog? This was before I knew,

130
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.670
you know, Schumacher had killed eight people. You know what I mean?

131
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:47.350
So, you know, I went home and that really caused me to, uh, you know,

132
00:08:47.351 --> 00:08:52.090
want to protect myself and want to document why I wanted to protect

133
00:08:52.091 --> 00:08:52.924
myself.

134
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.250
It's so bizarre that they would take bullets because without the rifling.

135
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.230
<v 0>From your particular gun, like all it's establishing is the same round you use.</v>

136
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.580
Right? It doesn't mean.

137
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.350
<v 1>Yeah, I did not. It's weird. You know, I just counted them. And then.</v>

138
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.320
<v 0>When you said that they were threatening, you like death threats,</v>

139
00:09:09.321 --> 00:09:11.510
like what kind of death, how were you receiving these.

140
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.740
<v 1>What they were doing? And it's in the investigative report.</v>

141
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.380
People that worked for me, you know,

142
00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:22.700
I had a street team that would promote my Rutgers in different clubs at night.

143
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.310
What they had done was jumped on a couple of guys. They pull them over,

144
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.310
they took them down to the station, strip them naked, you know, jumped on him,

145
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.160
took the jewelry, you know, all kinds of stuff and send messages,

146
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.360
let him know, you know, we're going to do this. We're going to do this.

147
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.020
Which eventually when I made my report,

148
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:50.720
they ended up finding the jewelry in different things that I reported

149
00:09:50.721 --> 00:09:55.100
that, you know, I told them, these guys, you got road cops. I say,

150
00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:58.130
y'all put a Hitman on me. You got two road cops.

151
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.270
That's doing this and doing that. And I'm in field in my life. You know,

152
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.160
I just want it to be known because if a situation take place and I come out

153
00:10:07.161 --> 00:10:11.450
on top, then I don't want nobody to be mad at me. Right.

154
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.850
Because I'm going to protect myself. Yeah.

155
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:14.713
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

156
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.180
How long did this period of turmoil last?

157
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.070
Cause it seemed like that would be incredibly stressed.

158
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.090
<v 1>Well, it went on for years, you know? Yeah.</v>

159
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.290
Even before then they stopped me one night and they,

160
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:34.550
they planted a peel on me called ecstasy, you know,

161
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.030
and where they put it, they put it. Here's what happened.

162
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.240
I was in the back seat. First of all, the police stopped me.

163
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.990
And this was officer. I had a run in with,

164
00:10:43.991 --> 00:10:48.530
with a pistol case and I beat the pills to case. So he stopped me on, uh,

165
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.760
Richmond one night and he was like, well, how did you beat that case?

166
00:10:52.761 --> 00:10:55.820
And he knew it was me because I had rap light on my license plate.

167
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.810
How did you be? I say, man, I don't really want to talk about that. I said,

168
00:10:59.811 --> 00:11:03.110
I'm trying to go to a party. You know, why are you stopping me?

169
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:08.000
So made me get up, put me in the back of the police car, kept me there.

170
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.930
You know, talking to people for, you know, quite a long time.

171
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.970
And he decided to take me off the main street to a side

172
00:11:16.971 --> 00:11:17.804
street.

173
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.760
And it was then where he took me out of one car and took me to another car

174
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.090
with two more young, uh, rookie officers.

175
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:31.700
And shortly after he came out with appeal in the back

176
00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:36.230
of the first call, look what we have here. And I'm like,

177
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:41.030
you know, when I seen that taken place, I said to the two officers, I say, man,

178
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.140
I say, I've been in here. Y'all know he's nah, you're not trying to do that.

179
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.410
That's not look what we have here. Look what we have here.

180
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.300
And before I know it,

181
00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:55.060
I was headed to the police station and they charged me with a

182
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.800
PO call ecstasy and I immediately got out of jail,

183
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.510
took a test, a drug test, took a lot of tech to tests just to prove,

184
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.120
you know, I had nothing to do with any of that.

185
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:12.190
So they tried to get me to cop out for probation and cop out. I'm like, no.

186
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:15.490
So the appeal changed from X, X, X,

187
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:19.270
a C to Drent transact, whatever that field is.

188
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:24.130
And it changed again, it was constantly changing as they test the pill.

189
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:26.980
And they was basically trying to get me the cop out for something.

190
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.280
And I wouldn't. And eventually the case was dismissed.

191
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.670
<v 0>So how many years at all this go on for? You said it went on for years.</v>

192
00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:36.510
How many years?

193
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.210
<v 1>I would say 10 years, 10 years of belt. I was a target.</v>

194
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.630
<v 0>Stay calm during that time. Cause that's gotta be incredibly stressed.</v>

195
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:51.300
<v 1>Yeah, it was, you know, because like in the hood where I'm from,</v>

196
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.240
you have to survive the

197
00:12:57.241 --> 00:13:00.900
guys that's in the hood because they trying to get you, you know,

198
00:13:00.901 --> 00:13:02.940
wherever success is concerned,

199
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:08.130
they trying to get you and the police that's supposed to be protecting me.

200
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:12.420
The ones I'm paying all these taxes to have became a,

201
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.980
uh, uh, enemy where they was trying to get me. So it,

202
00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:19.830
it was very stressful.

203
00:13:19.831 --> 00:13:23.940
But after so long I became immune to it.

204
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:25.410
It's almost like, you know,

205
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:30.420
I had a made up mind because I was on a journey to break the poverty curse

206
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:34.530
where my family was concerned. That was my whole drive. I'm like,

207
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.800
I got to get my mother at his house that she always wanted. You know,

208
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.440
I come from the projects.

209
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:45.600
So I was dealing with a power that was greater than the power was from the

210
00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:49.830
streets and from the police. And I was like, you know,

211
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:54.720
no weapon formed against me gonna prosper. So, you know, I had that mentality.

212
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.310
I wrapped it around spirituality. And you know, I say, if God be for me,

213
00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:04.110
the world could be against me. And you know, it just became like a,

214
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.270
a lifestyle dealing with them. People.
