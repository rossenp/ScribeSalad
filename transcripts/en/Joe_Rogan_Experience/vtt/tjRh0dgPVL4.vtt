1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. It's like a boxing, like turning with the punch.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.960
Exactly. As that's all I got left, he said,

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.550
I'm going to turn my jaw as you punch it.

4
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.860
Some guys are masters at that stand right in front of dudes and let them throw

6
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:13.694
punches.

7
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.820
<v 0>Well, it was really improved. God, Sammy doesn't need to see him like,</v>

8
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:20.780
cause I was at the fight where Canelo Mayweather and like, are you,

9
00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:24.530
do you remember that fight? Yeah. And just Mayweather just totally schooled him,

10
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:26.150
man. It was unbelievable.

11
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.260
Truly unbelievable to even just be there in that room and just watch,

12
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:32.480
there was so much confidence behind Canelo. Right.

13
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:35.120
And obviously like 80% of the crowd was Mexican. Right.

14
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:38.600
And you saw like 80% of crowds harshest broken because by the third round,

15
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.750
you know exactly what was going on. And it was just his complete domination.

16
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.380
And man, it was unbelievable to see.

17
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.660
<v 1>Maybe where there's a real master. He's a modern.</v>

18
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.390
<v 0>Master to me. He's the greatest great of all time.</v>

19
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.650
Meaning he's greater at boxing than like Stephen Hawking is at science.

20
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.070
In my opinion. There's a good argument for that because he's come close.

21
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.940
<v 1>Here's the thing, like the sport is hit and not be hit.</v>

22
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.680
Who does that better than Floyd Mayweather.

23
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.860
<v 0>I can name three times in his career where he was hurt.</v>

24
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.920
I can name them. Yeah. Zap, Judah, Shane. Right hook Shane Mosley, DeMarcus,

25
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.220
chop,

26
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.760
chop correlate to Margaret chapter up Corley almost like put them out and was

27
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:17.594
the same.

28
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.180
<v 1>How about my Donna? My Donna.</v>

29
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.910
<v 0>Donna hit him at the end of the, yeah. At the end of the belly,</v>

30
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:23.780
hit him in the right hand.

31
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:26.030
And Floyd didn't know where his corner was for a second. He was out of it.

32
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.890
But he's got a beard. That's the thing about Freud.

33
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:29.660
A lot of people don't realize that he's got the pretty boy,

34
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.740
but he could take a shot. And I remember just like, I'm like,

35
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.660
this guy is impossible to beat.

36
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.590
<v 1>I think it's going to happen when he finds a Logan. Paul, how crazy is that?</v>

37
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.780
<v 0>Dude? I love him, dude. I like Logan.</v>

38
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.640
<v 1>Logan's a big kid.</v>

39
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.600
<v 0>It doesn't matter. It's like Canelo was big. They've all been big.</v>

40
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.030
<v 1>But you know what? Canelo the Floyd.</v>

41
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:51.710
One of the things he did that was really intelligent.

42
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.290
He forced canal to go down to. I believe it was 150, one 54.

43
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.590
<v 0>Pounds. Oh, did they have a catch weight? Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.370
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.930
I think he did that because he knew Cornell had a hard time making one 54.

46
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.100
I mean now can I was at one 68. We fought 75 knocked out. Covelo.

47
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.240
<v 0>I thought that was the one 68. No, that was the light. Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.190
He knocked out COVID yeah. Great left hook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But look at this.

49
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.760
I mean, that's obviously not real, but still Logan's got the size.

50
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:20.594
He's a big guy.

51
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.540
<v 1>But it, it might be close.</v>

52
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.600
<v 0>And Floyd is tiny, but at the same time, it's like,</v>

53
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.620
Logan's not going to hit Floyd with any shot that he hasn't been hit with

54
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:31.130
before.

55
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.840
<v 1>The only way he could is if you got a bad referee and the referee lets them</v>

56
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:40.730
tie up. So if the referee lets him let's Logan tie him up and

57
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.110
Logan can hit Floyd in the clinch. Right. Hurt him.

58
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:46.830
I don't think that.

59
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.600
<v 0>Can you generate that much power? We flinch. You think low? You can. Oh yeah,</v>

60
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.560
yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.670
<v 1>Who's strong. Who can hit hard? Can you up from a clinch.</v>

62
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.320
<v 0>It happens all the time. Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:00.220
But I don't need to see knocked out Steve Bay from the clinch.

64
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 0>Yeah. That was that short right hand. Yeah. Really nice. Yeah. I just,</v>

66
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:06.610
I don't see anybody doing that to Floyd man.

67
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:09.730
Like if you watch the boys sparring stuff, do you ever watch his,

68
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.050
like the Mayweather gyms.

69
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.380
<v 1>Amazing 15 minute rounds.</v>

70
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.670
<v 0>In the gym. He does not on his bicycle. In the gym.</v>

71
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.870
He's in front of you talking. As you miss every single shot you throw at them.

72
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.380
And it's like, there's no way that Logan connects.

73
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.360
What I think could happen is that the fight is boring because

74
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:33.900
maybe Floyd can't inflict enough,

75
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:37.560
like one punch damage on Logan. So maybe it's boring.

76
00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:40.710
And then maybe he wins in like the people's eyes. Cause it's like,

77
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.010
you actually went 10 rounds with Floyd, Mayweather this at the other.

78
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.320
<v 1>If Floyd hurts and what,</v>

79
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:49.950
what Floyd does is wears them out and it makes him fight stiff and uncomfortable

80
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.480
because he's been shot.

81
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.800
He's not going to be nearly as efficient. Yeah.

82
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.500
Logan is going to be much less efficient.

83
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.830
He's going to be trying really hard and he's never done.

84
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.290
I don't know how many rounds are doing, how many rounds are they doing?

85
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.810
<v 0>Know eight maybe or something like that. I don't even know if they've announced,</v>

86
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.680
but it's.

87
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.160
<v 1>If I, if I was Floyd, I'd want it to be 12. Yeah. The longer the drag,</v>

88
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.000
that guy into deep water and then beat the out of him because Floyd can do 12

89
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.330
rounds in his sleep. You can wake him up in the middle of the night. Yeah.

90
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.630
So like, if they were the same size, it wouldn't even be interesting.

91
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.460
And even the Logan's way bigger than him, it's still only mildly interesting.

92
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.671
Yeah.

93
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:30.180
Because you literally have the greatest boxer of all time versus a kid who's

94
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:34.590
like really athletic and really tough who can fight, but it's, you know,

95
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.030
he's not in that league. It's not, no, there's no, no discussion.

96
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.540
It's not a person on earth that thinks he's in the same league boxing.

97
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.400
But Floyd is, he's a true master, master a master. Yeah.

98
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.700
The greatest ever in my opinion, yes, I would.

99
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.850
I would say he's in the running like you sugar Ray Robinson.

100
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.060
<v 0>Well, we just don't know a hundred and something and Oh,</v>

101
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.800
but you would not want a wives for this. Like that's my dad's favorite boxer.

102
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.090
And like my dad's a huge boxing fan. He used to like cover boxing for the news.

103
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:08.700
He would go to Ali's camp. Like he has footage of Lake himself,

104
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:12.000
like shadow boxing with Ali. Yeah. It's unbelievable. And like,

105
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.100
if anybody's a boxing, no, no, no. He was, he worked for NBC. Really? Yeah.

106
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:20.880
He was like a newscaster. Yeah. And like he just, uh, yeah,

107
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.530
he did his wild stories. Like Forrest Gump.

108
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.170
He liked did like the first ever story on like hip hop music.

109
00:05:25.171 --> 00:05:28.530
Like it was kind of crazy stuff, but like he, uh,

110
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.040
he has a video like shadow boxing with Muhammad Ali and the Muhammad Ali stops

111
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:33.990
and goes, uh, what do you box oranges?

112
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.830
<v 0>Well he's the biggest Ali fan in the world. And he saw, you know, sugar,</v>

114
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:41.341
Ray Robinson,

115
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:46.320
I guess when he was a kid and he was like sugar Ray Robinson outside of like

116
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:48.150
him. And I'll leave. Those are the best I've ever seen.

117
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.980
But that's like a generational thing. Obviously.

118
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.290
<v 1>Most boxers like to point to sugar.</v>

119
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:56.190
Ray Robinson is the greatest of all time guys who are in the know of boxing.

120
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.780
He was a, he was also, but he was a different kind of master.

121
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:04.120
He would slugged it out with people. He would get in there if he had to. Yeah.

122
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.210
He fought rough and tumble. But here's my argument against that.

123
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.640
He lost to Jake. Lamata in a decision.

124
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:14.600
I can't imagine a world where Floyd Mayweather loses to Jake Lamata if they're

125
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:15.620
the same size,

126
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.660
I can't imagine a world where Floyd doesn't outbox him because Floyd has this.

127
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.990
He has a more intelligent approach and his,

128
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.940
his approaches to frustrate the out of you and,

129
00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:29.210
and take angles on you and pop you. And then,

130
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.330
and then not let you hit them back. And then you get into fifth, sixth,

131
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.030
seventh round. He started going, Oh my God, this is how this fight is going.

132
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.260
I have to get desperate. Like I can't even hit this guy. I dare you to get done.

133
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.380
Then you start getting down the line and then he catches you.

134
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:45.440
Like he caught Ricky Hatton. That's beautiful. Yeah. Yep.

135
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.970
<v 0>I mean, he's just like watching him just as like a boxing fan,</v>

136
00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:50.950
like watching him take away people's confidence.

137
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.630
Like I've watched him take Shane Mosley's confidence from him, like shame.

138
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.280
It did end up catching him with that, that, that right hand right hand. And uh,

139
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.600
but what happened was when Shane, I think through his like first or second jab,

140
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.880
Floyd had already timed him.

141
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.790
He threw the first chap and the Floyd came right over the top.

142
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:11.470
He has that like amazing kind of like slip.

143
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:14.410
And he comes right at the top of the right hand and he stunned Shane.

144
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.600
And then right after that, Shane was like, I can't even chat.

145
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.020
There's nothing I can do. This guy is on a different level.

146
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:22.870
And then he ended up catching him with that ripe, but still like, yeah,

147
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:24.820
he's just, he's just a great, I don't know what happened. I mean,

148
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.170
I want Logan to get the money.
