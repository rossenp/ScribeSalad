00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>The general good experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.650
<v 1>I was working at a Warner brothers, uh, tiny Toon adventures. And I was, uh,</v>

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.760
I was, uh, I was a PA production assistant at that time.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.090
It was the first job I ever had in LA. And a guy says, uh, Hey,

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:17.220
we're going to have a party tonight. We're going to watch these fights.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.500
They're like cockfights, come on over and let's watch them.

7
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.280
And I went over to his house and I was literally hypnotized watching hoist

8
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.230
Gracie, do what he did. I couldn't believe it.

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.940
Everybody else was talking the three first day, the very first,

10
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.530
the first UFC. It was the first one. Wow. So you,

11
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.730
you watched the first one live. Yeah,

12
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.680
I saw it at a party that I was not supposed to be at and nobody else was paying

13
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:43.320
attention to this. It was just on, it was like two other guys watching it.

14
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.770
And uh, and I'm watching this going. I got to do that.

15
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.340
Like it was speaking to me in a way I've never, you know,

16
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.860
like art speaks to me and I was watching it. And,

17
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.330
and the next day I find Torrance Gracie Academy. Cause they kept saying Torrens,

18
00:00:57.331 --> 00:01:00.370
Gracie. And I knew it worked Torrance was so I, I,

19
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.210
I was living in studio city in the Valley. I drove my huddle,

20
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.350
Honda prelude. I drove all the way on the four Oh five,

21
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:08.400
the worst for you in the world.

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.980
It took him about three hours to get down there on a Saturday morning.

23
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.500
And I walked into that place and it was, they were done,

24
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.120
but I could smell all that sweat and humidity and nastiness. And I was like,

25
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.560
Oh God, this is great. And I walked in and, and they were very nice to me,

26
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.740
but there was like these dudes and they look so intimidating and they were just

27
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.200
ripped up and clot up and dripping wet.

28
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:31.500
And this wasn't the pretty days where everybody has rash guards and designer

29
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.900
Gies. This was like, Croogan's Gies they were yellowed and nasty smelling.

30
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.040
And, and no, there was no, there was chest hair in your mouth.

31
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.060
I remember crew guns. And uh, and,

32
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.660
and they came walking out and I was just like, I felt.

33
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.820
<v 0>Talk a little bit. I was just looking at it. I want to be you. Okay.</v>

34
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.340
<v 1>And he goes, where are you from? You know, and I'll go, Oh,</v>

35
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.660
the Valley in the Valley, this is too far my friend. And he goes to my cousins,

36
00:01:56.661 --> 00:02:00.350
John jock is in the Valley. The Machado's go there. And, uh,

37
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.850
I was kind of like struck and all by everything. Right. So I thought, okay,

38
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.090
I'll go to the Valley, you know? And there was no internet, no understanding.

39
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:09.680
There's no internet. You can't just Google.

40
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.680
So I got the Thomas guide out and I started looking around and,

41
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.150
and I would ask people. And,

42
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.960
and so nobody knew the answer to this because remember, as you know,

43
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:20.210
in the early days presented you just, Sue was like, Oh,

44
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:24.140
you do that karate stuff. Yeah. And so I, uh, I got on my mountain bike.

45
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:27.410
I was a heavy mountain biker then and I got on my bike and I was in studio city

46
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:31.430
and I decided to ride Ventura Boulevard and I'm gonna look at every shop on

47
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:35.690
Ventura Boulevard. And I was driving, I got all the way down to Encino and, uh,

48
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.150
and just, and I see this jujitsu, right. And I go, Oh, that's it.

49
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.260
I walk in.

50
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.850
And this little kind of chubby round guy comes walking up and is tucked into his

51
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.060
geek. And he goes, I kind of help you. And I go, I'm looking to do, uh,

52
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.330
I'm looking to do that ground fighting stuff. And he goes, yeah,

53
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:57.320
we do that here. And I go, okay. Yeah, sign up.

54
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.150
And so I signed up and I'm there a week and I'm there every day.

55
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.290
And not once are we on the ground, we're doing the standup small circle stuff.

56
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.180
And like an I'm looking at my classmates and they're all like horribly out of

57
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.060
shape. And like, they can barely move. And I'm thinking, God,

58
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:17.110
this isn't what I saw. That was the place. It was like motion Rouge, jujitsu.

59
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.020
Right. But I was so out of my head trying to find it.

60
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.850
And so I'm there a week and he's like, Hey, congratulations, you get a belt.

61
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.250
And I'm like, I hardly know anything.

62
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:31.270
And so he gives me a spelt and I'm working out this one guy and he says, Hey,

63
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.190
I think what you want is the Machados. And I was like, Ooh, where am I?

64
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.160
This isn't it, dude. I'm looking in the wrong movie. And so I go,

65
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.050
okay. Uh, he goes, that's down the road, dude, like four stores, four shops,

66
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.820
four shops short. Right.

67
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.210
So I literally at class I'm like curling up and I'm like, Oh, I got to go.

68
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.110
I walked down there and I see them. And it was, this is on Ventura Boulevard.

69
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.140
He wasn't at his place in, in Tarzana yet.

70
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.240
He was getting ready to move that week.

71
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.420
And I walk in and it was a place as big as this studio. I'm not kidding.

72
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.020
And he goes, you know, judge, I spoke very poorly English back then.

73
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:11.820
And he was like, Oh, hello. And I'm like, uh, sign, I sign up now.

74
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.000
You know? And so I signed up and I started going to him,

75
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.240
but I had made like two friends say, I want an Adelaide.

76
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:20.940
I didn't have any friends who was there to work and become my goal.

77
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.930
And so I was still talking to these guys and still going to the other place and

78
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.690
the time worked out where he was early and I would leave and go next door to

79
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:29.850
John jock. Right. So I was there, but yeah,

80
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.210
another week and we're just doing drills at Jean-Jacques,

81
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:36.870
we're doing armbar drills over and over again from our back from open guard

82
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:40.620
drills. And I would go home and I would draw it in my book.

83
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:43.320
I had a sketchbook of everything. So everything we learned, I would draw it.

84
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.230
And I would, you know, I was an animator for a long time,

85
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:51.120
so I could animate the movements and I could see in rolling where we would

86
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:53.910
end up. So if we start here and I did this, this and this,

87
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.660
I knew we would end up over here in this position. In my mind,

88
00:04:57.661 --> 00:04:59.130
it was easy because I had animated.

89
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.940
So I would see rolling like cartoons and they would just kind of roll into it.

90
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.920
And so it came very, I wasn't a wrestler, but it came pretty natural to me,

91
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.990
to the movements. Right. And so, um, so a week later,

92
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.480
the guy at the motion Ruggie, Etsy place was telling me, Oh,

93
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.880
you got to do this because, and I go, but if you did that,

94
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:24.120
you'd get stuck in an arm bar because he's having me like choke right. Reach up.

95
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.990
And he goes, no, you can't get the number from there. And I go, I think,

96
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.160
I think you can. And he's like, you're not going to do it. And so I go,

97
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.950
well watch. And he got in my guard and he like,

98
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.620
he did his little chest slap thing, you know, those little like,

99
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.050
and he like stuck his arm out the little chest. Yeah.

100
00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:45.360
You know how that they like get ready to fight. And they're like, you know,

101
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:46.380
they do the poses

102
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:52.380
in my guard and it was weird and everybody's watching. Right.

103
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.140
And they're standing there watching the instructor, tell me,

104
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:56.970
I didn't know what I was doing. And he did that. And he,

105
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.720
his arm out and I grabbed his arm and I pulled it in and I threw my legs over

106
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:00.140
his face and.

107
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.420
<v 0>I remembered him and he got.</v>

108
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.160
<v 1>Real off. He goes, he got up and he was really perturbed. And he goes,</v>

109
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.320
that wouldn't work in real time.

110
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.450
That only worked because I was letting you get there. And I,

111
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.230
and I was scared and I go, I think it would work, man.

112
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.980
Think it would work. And remember, I had two friends now, right.

113
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:23.750
My two guy friends. Right. And they were going and I hear one of them go, Oh,

114
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:27.710
no, it worked. And I'm looking over at him and he's getting kind of, man.

115
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.370
He's a short guy, but he's real stock. And he goes, uh, he goes, look,

116
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.220
I'm tired of hearing about this Brazilian jujitsu.

117
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.540
So I tell you what you use your jujitsu, which by the way,

118
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:42.500
I had had like two weeks of training. Now, granted, I was there every day,

119
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.840
which on jock, like doing drills. So, you know,

120
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.900
if you got one movement that you do a hundred times,

121
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:52.280
you're going to have an inkling of how to do it. What year is this bro?

122
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.710
So you're talking about 94 right after the first year of see maybe like 93,

123
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.630
two months after the first year of six 93, 93. And so head of the curve.

124
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:07.400
So I'm sitting there and I go, okay. Uh, I think, uh, I think it'll work, dude.

125
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.540
Now I don't know anything about standing. Right? Right.

126
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.490
So he gets up and he goes, okay, I'm gonna attack you. And you attack me.

127
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.110
And I'm like, I don't know how to attack.

128
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.190
<v 0>He goes.</v>

129
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.350
<v 1>He goes ready. And like all of a sudden,</v>

130
00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:24.670
I'm in a video game and I'm standing there. So what do I do? I copy what I saw,

131
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.000
always Gracie. Do I stick my arms up? Like the karate kid.

132
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.940
And I stick my foot in front and he starts like,

133
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.930
like coming at me with his elbows and swinging.

134
00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:37.450
And he looks like a little machine and I just took my foot and kicked him in the

135
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:41.410
front leg. His leg goes down. He lands on me. We fall under the guard.

136
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.380
He starts hitting me with his elbow and the top of the head. Right.

137
00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:48.700
Like I grabbed him, I clenched him. I squeezed him really tight, mostly.

138
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:50.770
So I didn't get punched in the face. Cause I was afraid.

139
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.940
And I picked my head in his chest and he's hitting me on the top of the head.

140
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.773
And I'm like,

141
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.020
and that heat comes up your back from your to your neck and you go here, you

142
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.090
hitting me now. And I go, okay. All right. All right.

143
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.570
Now we're in a new league now. You're not my friend. Now you're fighting me.

144
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.890
And I literally just kind of monkey shimmied up his high guard.

145
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.610
And I just threw him in an arm bar and I cranked as hard as I could on that arm.

146
00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:20.260
And he screams, Oh wow. And I get up. Right.

147
00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:24.100
And I'm like, you got that blood rush. I'm like, my hair messed up.

148
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.200
<v 0>Okay.</v>

149
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.550
<v 1>And I grabbed my bag. I grabbed my bag, my little goofy bag.</v>

150
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.150
I grabbed it and I walk out. Right. I'm like, I don't know what to do.

151
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:38.860
I'm like flustered.

152
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.240
I walk out and mature dudes come running out after me. They're like, bro, bro,

153
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:45.610
I'm coming with you. Where are you going? Where's that school at?

154
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.850
And they came and they trained all the way to purple belt.

155
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:51.450
Both those guys who are the guys that was Jim Lohan, the,

156
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.470
the wood carpenter guy and a guy named Seth.

157
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:54.640
I don't even remember his last name.

158
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.470
They both trained all the way through purple before they kind of faded away.

159
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.480
And uh, and had you fade away.

160
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.940
<v 2>When you're at purple, that's such a shame. You're so close.</v>

161
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:03.691
<v 1>As an instructor.</v>

162
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:07.770
Now it crushes me when I give a blue belt to someone and then I see them fade

163
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.060
and I'm thinking, God, dude, you got past the hardest color. Yeah.

164
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.340
The greatest belt you can get is blue.

165
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.930
I say that it's to this day and I'm fourth black blue, because you're a color.

166
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.270
You're not the white anymore. You're in the club.

167
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.150
<v 2>You're in to the day.</v>

168
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.470
John jock gave me a blue belt was like one of the greatest days of my life.

169
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.190
The day John document, my purple belt. I was like, Oh my God,

170
00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:35.060
I'm close from so close to Brown. Purple is a danger,

171
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.310
but purple volts tap people.

172
00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:41.400
So I remember seeing a lot of purple belts that could tap Brown belts probably

173
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.970
were dangerous. Headlights one really good move. Oh yeah.
