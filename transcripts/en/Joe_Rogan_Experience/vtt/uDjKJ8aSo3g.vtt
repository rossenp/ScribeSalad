00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. Like I want these guys to get the bag and like,</v>

2
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:06.810
there's something about like calling somebody out,

3
00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:09.240
which you immediately respect them a little bit more like willing to put

4
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.060
yourself out there for a fight. He called out Conor McGregor too.

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.630
That's what Jake's doing. That kid is a master troll dude.

6
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.230
He's a master creating hype. Like dude, if I'm Dana white,

7
00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.610
I'm praying that this guy can.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.930
<v 1>Actually, uh, Jake, Paul, Amanda Nunez boxing match.</v>

9
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.130
<v 0>Dana said, uh, Dana said, um, maybe I'll let Amanda news knock them.</v>

10
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.850
<v 2>Um, that's just not good for him.</v>

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.890
<v 1>I hope they don't do that. That's just not good for everybody.</v>

12
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.810
But the question is could can't sleep on that kid? That kid can crack.

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.890
Yeah. When you look at how he knocked Nate Robinson out that short hand,

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.820
that he threw was very skillful, real punch. That was a real punch.

15
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.640
It was perfectly placed and he can hit hard.

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.230
<v 0>Three punches were the same thing. They're a step back overhand, right?</v>

17
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.760
You that's, that's not like got lucky that's Hey, this guy doesn't always do it.

18
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:02.240
So he's going to charge at you just step back and lay right-hand on him. I mean,

19
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.100
he knew exactly what it was skillful.

20
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.700
<v 1>Then that was in the middle of a wild brawl where Nate Robinson was trying to</v>

21
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:12.350
take his head off and it was kind of unorthodox, right? So it's it's dangerous.

22
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.980
Cause Nate is super strong. He's a crazy athlete, unreal athlete,

23
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.880
winging punches at him. And so he's got to figure his way through this,

24
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.100
this maze of bombs headed his way and he clips him. Hmm,

25
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.240
no, here it is. Like, if you look at him, look, look at him, move. Well,

26
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.230
he moves away. Yeah. This is at the beginning. Ties up. Well, boom.

27
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.110
But he's, he's good. Just at tying up and using defense and Nate was dangerous,

28
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:41.540
man. You saw him trying to throw the right right there.

29
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.540
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.400
<v 1>He's a skillful boxer, man. He really is like legitimately.</v>

31
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.620
I mean, he's not world class right now,

32
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:57.500
but he is 23 years old. Yeah.

33
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.940
Ma'am that's one that folded them, but that's not the one that folded them.

34
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.780
Ultimately he got up off of that one and he get killed by the next one. Yeah.

35
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.040
They should have stopped the right there. Well,

36
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.520
he was complained to the referee. They got hit on the head, which is hilarious.

37
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.550
That was so ridiculous. Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:16.280
I think they think he realized at this point in time that this is not,

39
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.470
it's not just athleticism involved here game in boxing that you

40
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:24.950
have to, you have to understand what a fight is. It's it's, you're,

41
00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:28.040
you're a war with yourself. As much as you're at war with another person,

42
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:32.450
you have to keep, keep back it up. Jamie, let's see that punch.

43
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.910
So let this play out. So if you watch how he knocks his dude out,

44
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:41.420
like even the way he was moving, his body came over. I don't think that's it.

45
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.450
No, that's a second one. That's yeah. That's just a knockdown.

46
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.360
<v 2>Yeah, here it is here.</v>

47
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.680
<v 1>That's the one. I mean, when you see a guy face plant like that and bounce.</v>

48
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.820
Yeah. That's a wrap. Yeah. To play it back. Just, just let it play.

49
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.850
But if you watch how he did it, look at this. That's a short punch man.

50
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.720
Yup. He didn't wind that up. He stepped back and put in place.

51
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.380
He's got skill and he's only 23.

52
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.420
If he decides to dedicate himself to actually being a boxer and spends all of

53
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:17.470
his time boxing and then talking and doing podcasts. Yeah. He never know, man.

54
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.340
Yeah. He, he might go a long way. He obviously can perform under pressure.

55
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.030
He obviously has legitimate power. He's got legitimate skill. Yeah.

56
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.431
<v 0>Why not do it?</v>

57
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:31.020
If you're Conor 50 million to beat up the guy that talks some about your wife.

58
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.360
First of all, I was wild. What he said about his wife.

59
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.200
I didn't see what he said about as well. He said he didn't see this video. No.

60
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.280
Oh my God, bro.

61
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.620
<v 1>I don't need to see that. And we didn't need to broadcast that. Okay.</v>

62
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.470
<v 0>Fine. Everybody's seen it by the way. He just called his yeah.</v>

63
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.440
He just called his wife a four. Wow. Yeah.

64
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.210
And it's he only follows one girl on Instagram Connor's wife. Oh my God.

65
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.070
He knows how to play the trolling game. So it's like, it's a,

66
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.550
he's a wild boy. But he understands what he's doing just the other day.

67
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.880
Connor does that, I mean, talk about talking about people's wives.

68
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.400
<v 1>Connor did that to Josie Aldo talked.</v>

69
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.450
<v 0>To me. Yeah. But like it was,</v>

70
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:12.180
it was just wild man. And then recently, yeah.

71
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:15.180
I mean like the guy knows what he's doing. He was in LA and I think,

72
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.780
I think it was at Brendan Schaub show like this Dylan Dannis, you know,

73
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.330
he was like doing the food truck thing and he,

74
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.730
I guess he had some beef with Jake, Paul, Jake wants to fight him.

75
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.420
So he pulls up on the back of a pickup truck with water balloons and wet toilet

76
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:31.440
paper and starts chucking it at him while he's doing the interview. This is it.

77
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.980
The guy knows how to be there while somebody is talking,

78
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880
how did he know he was going to talk it? His brother did it.

79
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.440
<v 1>They sped away and told them where it was or something. But Dylan,</v>

80
00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:46.320
Dan has ran up to him and he sped away. Why didn't he get out and fight him?

81
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.080
<v 0>Yeah. That's what a lot of people are saying that it's kind of soft.</v>

82
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.243
Like he came at you.

83
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.650
<v 1>Dylan, Dan has gets a hold of you, arms broken.</v>

84
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.260
You're getting your neck strangled off as a bad cop, like a zit.

85
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.220
He's gonna rip your knees apart. He's not a chance in the world. Yeah.

86
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.540
Oh D Dylan, Dennis is a world class grappler.

87
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.340
Top of the food chain. Yeah. He's like, I mean he he's the guy who, who,

88
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.830
I'm pretty sure he went to a draw with Gordon Ryan who is the

89
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:17.220
elite.

90
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.840
<v 0>I see him in the Navy.</v>

91
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.020
<v 1>Beat him by decision by white one point or something like that.</v>

92
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.140
T of what's going on in this is this, that 50 million.

93
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.400
He just posted this proof of funds. Got you curious. Huh? Notorious man.

94
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.610
So he's showing the fight who said take the fight.

95
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.790
<v 0>Paul says to Connor, take the fight in a DM.</v>

96
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:39.960
And then he showed that Connor saw the DM, uh,

97
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.200
this kid like, okay. So there's different ways to like build hype,

98
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.790
obviously like you can build hype by just creating, you know, uh, great content.

99
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.760
You can build hype by creating drama and you can build hype by creating like a

100
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.100
villain S attitude. Right? And this guy has no problem being the villain. He,

101
00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:58.160
if he likes to talk about Dylan, Dennis, I think.

102
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.080
<v 1>It would be hilarious if they had, uh, an MMA.</v>

103
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.410
<v 0>Well, I don't think he wants to do MMA one,</v>

104
00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:04.600
but he's trying to get Dylan to do the boxing one.

105
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.500
<v 1>Well, that's why he ran away from Dylan because it is my boxing gloves.</v>

106
00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.380
Dylan grabs, you done. This is a whole different.

107
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.170
<v 0>But could he beat him in a bar? I don't know enough about Dylan,</v>

108
00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:15.610
but could he beat him in a boxing match.

109
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.990
<v 1>Be able to, but if you're not his world, I mean, he's got balls.</v>

110
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.220
Oh God.

111
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.920
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

112
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.170
<v 1>You spoil. You can't really fight dumb.</v>

113
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.130
You're going to end up with your whipped for real, somewhere talking like that.

114
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.260
<v 3>So that you don't want to see this fight, dude.</v>

115
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:36.100
It feels like the nineties rap beef. It's West coast, East coast.

116
00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:38.290
Like they're really doing areas, but tell me,

117
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:40.570
you don't want to see natives can fight. I do.

118
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.390
These guys are trying to make money, let them make some money. I'm just like.

119
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.370
<v 1>How you make money more? What is this?</v>

120
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.710
You said you saw what happened to the other lane.

121
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.310
<v 3>So the kid knows what he's doing.</v>

122
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:54.100
He knows how to build hype and he doesn't mind. I guess, being here.

123
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:57.790
<v 1>No, he doesn't mind. Which is a value add value. That's a fun look.</v>

124
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:00.670
And he's very respectful. After the fights over luck with Nick Robinson,

125
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:02.800
he's very respectful. He was.

126
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.950
<v 0>He is playing the character. I mean, we've seen, you know,</v>

127
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.480
Connor duty seeing Floyd do it.

128
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:09.790
We've seen guys like really lean into it to hype the fight.

129
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.470
Who knows what happens after the fight.

130
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.680
But you got to still keep on playing the character and you can't deny that the

131
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.940
that understand how to troll or garner interest are the guys who are gonna make

132
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:22.120
the most money a hundred percent. Like you see the guy I keep on telling Izzy.

133
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.030
I'm like, bro. I mean, Darren, Till's got to get some wins,

134
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.950
but like a fight between you and Darren,

135
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.720
the lead up on social media is going to be the most fun, nonstop,

136
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:33.070
back and forth. They're making movies.

137
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.360
<v 1>I switched up to light heavyweight, you know, he's fighting Jamba Jehovah. Sure,</v>

138
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.100
sure, sure. But like it's, he's fighting right for the title. Right.

139
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.300
<v 0>Right, right. But still the idea of having those two guys who really understand.</v>

140
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.640
Cause remember when I said he was going to fight y'all and I was like,

141
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.740
stop fighting guys. That don't speak English. We can't do anymore.

142
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.520
It could be a fun fight, but like what's happened was not.

143
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:54.970
But like I want the hype. I want you to make as much money as possible.

144
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.120
You know what I mean? I want people the casual fan to be interested.

145
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.620
How do you get the casual.
