00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience. How much difference is it?</v>

2
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:05.670
Perspective wise when you're,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.620
when you're in space and you're looking down on the earth that has gotta be the

4
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.550
ultimate mindfulness.

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.530
<v 1>It's amazing. So that this is what I'm trying to do in life.</v>

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.670
Like a couple of books, I've written some films I've done. Um,

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.480
seeing the earth. I remember early in my first flight, it was like, okay,

8
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.110
I'm in outer space. And my there's my planet over there. You know,

9
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:31.970
it was this profound thought that, wow, I'm not on the planet anymore.

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.220
And over, uh, over seven months in space, it never got old.

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.450
Like it was always like, man, earth is beautiful. It is this incredible planet.

12
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.690
Um, and so there's, so we could talk for hours about this,

13
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:49.190
but I think for me the biggest perspective change was, um,

14
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.690
I'm less of a black and white person now, like before I went into space,

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.080
I knew right. And wrong. And a lot of you, when you're young, you kind of,

16
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.830
you're black and white. As you get older, you get wiser and seeing the planet,

17
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.900
seeing the planet, it's like, yeah,

18
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.440
this thing's been around for a long time and it's going to be around for a long

19
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:09.710
time. So you probably don't need to get as uptight about, you know,

20
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.880
the day-to-day stress of life. And, um, it's, uh,

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.090
it just kinda put things in perspective. Like,

22
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:21.200
don't get too excited about the Kardashians or whatever the latest political

23
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.990
tweet was or whatever. Um, like, you know,

24
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.340
things are gonna go on for a long time.

25
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:28.670
And so that it helps put that in perspective in a big way.

26
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.050
<v 0>It's interesting that at an actual physical perspective change, just being,</v>

27
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.950
just being in a different place where you're looking down on it from a different

28
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:37.784
vantage point,

29
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.280
all the astronauts seem to say that it has this profound shift in how you think

30
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:45.950
of earth and how you think of humanity in general. Yeah.

31
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
<v 1>You know, one of the interesting things I've been traveling since I was a kid,</v>

32
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:54.170
I did some exchange, uh, programs and Finland and France, and in the air force,

33
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:58.820
I lived all around the world and whenever I would go to France or

34
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.040
Korea or wherever, it was like, all right, I'm in Korea.

35
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.260
And then I get back to this date. So I'm like, all right, I'm back,

36
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.240
back home in America or whatever.

37
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.690
And now when I travel and I've been traveling a lot last couple years,

38
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.620
I don't ever, I always feel like I'm home. Like it was a weird one,

39
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.520
one time I landed in the middle East and I remember thinking, I'm it.

40
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.510
I didn't think anything.

41
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.870
And that really struck me because it used to always be such a big deal wherever

42
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:24.440
I landed. I kind of feel like I'm home no matter where I'm at, which is wow.

43
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.810
<v 0>Interesting. And that's from the space travel.</v>

44
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.600
<v 1>I, it is. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I,</v>

45
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.940
it wasn't conscious. I didn't like expect it or whatever. I just realized that,

46
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:38.270
Hey, I don't ever, I don't ever feel like I'm not at home. And my,

47
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.210
my crew mates, Samantha said something really profound. She said, um,

48
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.310
like you see earth and you can tell it's going around the sun. Like,

49
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:49.340
you can actually see the motion sometimes if you're watching stars and stuff,

50
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.980
and it's like, we're on this spaceship together.

51
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:55.100
So we ought to be crew mates and not just passengers. Yeah.

52
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.120
Like we all have to kind of take care of the planet and ourselves,

53
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.130
each other and stuff. Do.

54
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.720
<v 0>You find that most of the,</v>

55
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:06.490
or many of the astronauts share this similar perspective shift

56
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.380
that once you go up,

57
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:13.150
you do realize how weird it is that there are these tribal differences between

58
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.890
us.

59
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.310
<v 1>Yeah. You're like, what the hell are we doing? I got a story about that.</v>

60
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:22.260
But to be honest, we're probably not the best, um, communicators of emotion,

61
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.590
you know, like, you know, we're not necessarily all touchy, feely people,

62
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:28.590
but some of my close friends that we talk about this, there's a very,

63
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.040
there's a very similar perspective of, you know, we're all here on the,

64
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.120
on the planet together.

65
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.300
I was on my first flight on the shuttle and it was the fifth.

66
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.720
I remember it was the fifth night there. And I looked out,

67
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:43.110
we were going on the Mediterranean at night and you could see there's this like

68
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:47.910
U shape where there's Egypt and the Nile there's Israel and Syria and Lebanon

69
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.620
are right there. And there's Turkey and Greece.

70
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.630
And it's just a little area in Israel is this little thing that's surrounded

71
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:57.150
by Jordan and Lebanon, you know, they're all like right there.

72
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.200
And I remember thinking like, guys, what's the problem. And you're, you're,

73
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.370
you're literally living together on a postage stamp on this big planet. Yeah.

74
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.040
And it wasn't anything about Israel or the middle East specifically.

75
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:11.580
It was more like, why, why can we not get along? Because you all down here.

76
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.940
Yeah.

77
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.210
<v 0>And the crazy thing is if you ask most people, their,</v>

78
00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:19.500
their position is they'll never be pieced in the middle East. So,

79
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.473
which is crazy.

80
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.060
<v 1>Things after my flight. So I, we would,</v>

81
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.670
they'd send us to Congress and we talked to congressmen and senators,

82
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:29.790
and I got the talk at the white house a couple years ago at the national space

83
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:33.690
council. And my message to them is always the same. It's always, you know,

84
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.240
two for a space program. It's not about the rocket science.

85
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:37.680
It's about the political science.

86
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.920
Like we gotta figure out politics to get things working well.

87
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.700
And whenever I go to the American Congress, they're always like, you're right.

88
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.460
It's exactly right. If it wasn't for those other, on the other side,

89
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:48.294
we can get this right.

90
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.270
Republicans Democrats all said that they all totally agreed with me.

91
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.090
And it was always the other guy's fault. There's a, there's a,

92
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.210
there's definitely a problem that is going to be tough to overcome.

93
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.540
<v 0>Benefit. Would there be in getting those people in space?</v>

94
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.850
<v 1>Yeah. You know, people talk about that.</v>

95
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:06.510
If only that leaders could go into space and I think for some of them it would

96
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:09.720
make an impact. And some of them, they wouldn't care. I mean, there's there.

97
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.561
Well,

98
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:14.730
the goal of politics and power is just to keep yourself in power and get more

99
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:19.110
stuff for yourself. And, you know, throughout human history, it's not normally,

100
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:22.830
you know, altruistic democracies that the way we run ourselves. Um,

101
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.880
so which that we need to move in that direction because that's the way life gets

102
00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:30.540
better. But, um, I think som it would benefit in some it wouldn't.

103
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.651
<v 0>Well, the thing is like,</v>

104
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:36.600
nobody really wants the job that is balanced and healthy

105
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:41.340
and intelligent and has a good perspective for perspective, for humanity. Yeah.

106
00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.950
The people that want the job, they want to be the King Poobah.

107
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.780
They want to be an Eagle dog. Yeah.

108
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.200
It's just a weird kind of person that wants that job.

109
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.760
<v 1>It's uh, people are like, why don't you run for office? And, and I always say,</v>

110
00:05:53.761 --> 00:05:55.560
well, do you have, give me a fork, you have a fork.

111
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.310
Cause I want to stick that in mind because that would more fun than, you know,

112
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.880
you try and do something nice. And you're just getting nonstop,

113
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.410
hate mail and yeah.

114
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.790
<v 0>Girlfriends from high school. That's testifying.</v>

115
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.270
<v 1>For Congress. This thing that happened 30 years ago. Yeah, exactly.</v>

116
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.210
<v 0>Some it's fascinating to me.</v>

117
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.130
How many of the astronauts do have this incredibly profound

118
00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:19.180
experience? Again,

119
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.530
just from the physical act of being above earth,

120
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.330
looking down on it where this perspective shift just kind of changes

121
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.021
your,

122
00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:33.730
your overall thoughts about being in space and being a

123
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:37.870
part of humanity on this organic spaceship

124
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.090
in the universe,

125
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.620
rather than being like locked down in Chicago is clouds above use.

126
00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.910
And didn't even think about space. You know,

127
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.810
dude stuck in traffic on your way to work every day, same grind. Every,

128
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.590
he gets stuck in this narrow-minded perspective,

129
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.840
almost every astronaut who discusses this says that it was a profound life

130
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.570
changing moment to look at earth from above.

131
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.620
<v 1>Yeah. It was. And you know, I can close my,</v>

132
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.410
if I'm in one of those like situations, you just close your eyes and it's like,

133
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.540
right now, the sun is rising somewhere.

134
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:13.530
That's the most beautiful thing you can't imagine it. You know, I try,

135
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.410
I took a lot of pictures. I did movies, but unless you see it with your eyes,

136
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:18.790
you know, you can't imagine how awesome it is.

137
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:22.540
So that takes the edge off the traffic you're having to wait on. And, um,

138
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.830
it does help. But the,

139
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.300
the thing is like taking that experience and sharing it with as many people as

140
00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:29.134
possible.
