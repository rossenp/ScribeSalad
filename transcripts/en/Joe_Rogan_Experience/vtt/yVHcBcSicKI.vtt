1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.500
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience, you have something.</v>

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.150
<v 1>As a breaking story and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for</v>

3
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:10.310
intelligence, Christopher Mellon, uh,

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.510
literally sent this to me about 15 minutes ago and he wanted me to read it

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.270
verbatim. So I was going to read this it's pretty startling stuff.

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.320
So I'll read it in the last 48 hours.

7
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.940
The public has learned of two stunning incidents captured on film by

8
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:28.610
us Navy carrier pilots. Earlier this year.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.410
One of the cases features of photo of a bizarre flying

10
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:38.210
sphere and a black cube inside that is identical to dozens of other

11
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:41.660
reports, uh, by Navy pilots. Uh,

12
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:46.580
these strange objects have been shadowing East coast Naval ops since 2015,

13
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.750
they sometimes maneuver in formation and have occasionally been reported

14
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:52.490
achieving supersonic speeds.

15
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.520
The other incident produced a stunning detailed photograph of a

16
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:03.170
massive triangular shaped vehicle that emerged from the ocean and

17
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:06.380
flew vertically straight up and out of sight.

18
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.640
Just past a Navy F 18, operating off the U S uh,

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.660
aircraft carrier.

20
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.270
These iPhone photos taken by the pilots should be released to the public as

21
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:21.800
there are no sources and methods to protect and the national security benefits

22
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.410
of raising awareness regarding this issue,

23
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.120
vastly outweigh any conceivable benefit from concealing the

24
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:29.954
information.

25
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.730
It is hard to believe that in the face of such radical and incredible

26
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:38.780
technology within our vast defense department, the only,

27
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.490
we only have a so-called task force consisting of two individuals with no budget

28
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.410
who are still being off our stiff armed for access to relevant and timely

29
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:52.730
information by the air force and other security organizations

30
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.550
by comparison, 60 years ago,

31
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:59.540
in response to Sputnik America entered the space race,

32
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.100
which led to landing on the moon.

33
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.750
Our government needs to wake up and address the far greater technology gap that

34
00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:08.330
these and many other incidents are revealing.

35
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
There is obviously a glaring strategic mismatch between the current task force

36
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.180
and the technology that has been identified. Why did he send you this?

37
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.470
Because he felt as a developing story and he wants people to be aware that

38
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:23.720
there's really compelling evidence right now,

39
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.760
photographically that needs to be released.

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.630
<v 0>And so you told him you were coming on here and that's when he sent it to you.</v>

41
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.440
<v 1>Yes. And he said that that these people will need to feel some pressure. Um,</v>

42
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.513
they need to,

43
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.620
they need to know that we are requesting not demanding,

44
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.890
but requesting further government transparency on this issue.

45
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.470
And he's very passionate about it. He knows of these photographs,

46
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.220
the governments, we w we got the story. I think it was yesterday.

47
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.040
And the government is refusing to release these photographs.

48
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:54.830
The pilots want these photographs released the people that are involved with the

49
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:58.190
incident, want the photographs released. And so we,

50
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:01.990
he wants the public to know that these photographs exist and that they should be

51
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:02.350
released.

52
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 0>And they're currently in the possession of.</v>

53
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.850
<v 1>Uh, he wouldn't reveal that he knows the person, but, uh,</v>

54
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.070
but he said that the government is not wanting them released.

55
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.860
And he feels that they, that we have a right to these photograph.

56
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.820
<v 0>And there's video that came with this story as well.</v>

57
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.180
<v 1>Well, remember, this comes from the very guy who, uh,</v>

58
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.680
was strategic Christopher melon in getting those videotaped evidence from the

59
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:26.010
cockpits of those F 18 fighter jets off the East coast,

60
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:28.920
as well as off the West coast in 2004, 2015.

61
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.400
And ended up with that big story on the front page of the New York times in

62
00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:33.270
2017.

63
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 0>Yeah. See that that's a new thing,</v>

64
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.870
because if you went to like 24 or 2004,

65
00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:43.830
when this all happened,

66
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.590
no one was really talking about UFO's in a serious manner.

67
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.800
Like it was still something that would be mocked and ridiculed,

68
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.050
but to have it on the front page of the New York times,

69
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.080
and to have this spokesperson for the Pentagon,

70
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:01.770
say that they've recovered off world vehicles,

71
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.320
not from this earth, not made on this earth. Like this is a, this is a change,

72
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.240
right? Uh, really, I mean,

73
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:12.330
even though it doesn't receive that much public attention,

74
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.360
cause it's all happening during a pandemic and everyone's just,

75
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.780
and also the news cycle today is so bizarre.

76
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.500
Something gets into the news cycle and then it's gone tomorrow because the new

77
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:25.740
scandal or people find out Elon's mean or whatever it is.

78
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:29.940
There's always something new that's coming out. And these, these things though,

79
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.901
they seem to,

80
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:34.230
it seems to be there's more of them and more of them coming out and with each

81
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:37.560
new story that comes out, people feel more emboldened to tell their story.

82
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.770
<v 1>You know, I think personally everything changed in December of 20 2017.</v>

83
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:44.880
When that page,

84
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.260
a front page of the New York times revealed that secret a tip program. And, um,

85
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.010
I know personally it could pick as I've gotten ridiculed for decades for the

86
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.860
work, I do a lot less so recently. Um,

87
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.770
people are certainly raising an eyebrow going, wow,

88
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.050
there's clearly something more to this than just, you know,

89
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.260
radar weather balloons and, and misidentified aircraft.

90
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.190
<v 0>Jimmy pull up the video of that in that article. There's a,</v>

91
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.570
there's an actual YouTube video.

92
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.600
<v 1>There's two, one's from 94. One's from 26.</v>

93
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.210
<v 0>Let's go with the 2013 one. Um, but these, uh,</v>

94
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.190
videos are very strange. You see these, this object what's interesting too,

95
00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:27.150
is that okay? This is the one that I didn't see, but that this thing,

96
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.910
the way it moves and behave, the one that's from,

97
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:32.910
I guess it was from the 94 one, this is the 2013 one.

98
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.680
This is the one from Puerto Rico.

99
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.830
So it was just kind of cruising across the sky.

100
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.090
It's hard to track here in this black and white, there it is.

101
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.250
The, does it estimate how fast this thing's supposedly going?

102
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.150
<v 1>It looked like they were near, uh,</v>

103
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.990
some sort of like military base or something and on Agua DIA,

104
00:05:54.991 --> 00:05:56.160
which is like the West coast.

105
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.660
<v 0>So weird to see, like it's not clear what this thing is.</v>

106
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.670
<v 1>So one of the things that I think it's really good to establish.</v>

107
00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.980
<v 0>Go, I'm sorry, but go, go further ahead.</v>

108
00:06:08.981 --> 00:06:12.370
In this video to see if maybe there's a better version of it or a better check.

109
00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.440
The other one has the little clear video.

110
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:24.280
Yeah, there you go. That's much clearer. Like what is that? We'll live it,

111
00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:28.420
that's not a bird like yes. Moving through the clouds.

112
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.870
<v 1>One of the things I wanted to make a distinction of is the technology,</v>

113
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:34.300
the observed technology that these guys are talking about.

114
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:38.680
So you've got objects with no wings,

115
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.510
no visible means of propulsion.

116
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:45.130
The ability to hover accelerate from a standstill to add a site in the blink of

117
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:49.900
an eye, right angle turns at high speed and fly rings around our fastest jets.

118
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.310
That is the technology that cannot be confused or explain the way is something

119
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:57.700
conventional. So anytime you see an object like we're looking at here,

120
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.610
if it performs or exhibits at that technology,

121
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:02.200
maybe it shoots off at a high rate of speed.

122
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.580
Does the right angle turn at high speeds? Um, no wings,

123
00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.030
no tail, no propulsion, no Sonic boom.

124
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.650
Almost no sound.

125
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.330
<v 0>That's. And they're trying to get a closeup on this thing.</v>

126
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.870
So you get a better idea of what the shape is. It's very hard to tell,

127
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.870
but there's these objects also,

128
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:25.660
one of the weird things is it moves around the same way.

129
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.090
Commander Fravor described that thing,

130
00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:30.640
moving around that was hovering over the ocean,

131
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.760
that it kind of darts around left and right, right.

132
00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:38.470
And left almost like it's just not connected to

133
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.390
whatever our atmosphere is. It's like, it's moving into this weird,

134
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.310
zig-zag sort of a way.

135
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:50.530
<v 2>This is an infrared image, right? It's not visible.</v>

136
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.940
It's not a normal camera.

137
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.100
<v 0>I don't know. I don't know what it is. Is that what it.</v>

138
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.770
<v 2>Kids with? Same type of camera that, uh,</v>

139
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.430
has the ones from the Nimitz. So yo, you're looking at the heat signature,

140
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.630
you know, I'm not really looking at a visual picture, right.

141
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.640
So that's why it's not, not, you cannot get a clear definition of it.

142
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.650
<v 0>Well, they need better cameras.</v>

143
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.090
So if you go further along in the video, it does, uh,

144
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.830
they do get a better view of it. There there's. There you go. Like,

145
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:27.820
what the hell is that?

146
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.660
<v 1>You know, that was one of the, uh, more startling, uh,</v>

147
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.050
moments of producing the film of the phenomenon for me was when I met with

148
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:40.810
Senator Harry Reid, who spearheaded the ATP program,

149
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:44.470
the advanced aerospace threat identification program that wound up on the front

150
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:49.030
page of the New York times. Um, I wasn't quite sure when I met with him how,

151
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.410
where his comfort zone was.

152
00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:53.140
And so I was really kind of cautious for the first half an hour of the

153
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:55.030
interview, but then I started,

154
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.750
started to relax and get more comfortable with each other.

155
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.340
And I decided to kind of push it a little bit. And I said, Hey, uh,

156
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.100
Senator I, uh,

157
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.870
met with Gordon Cooper who later became mercury astronauts who

158
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:14.040
told me on camera that there was a landing incident that took place at Edwards

159
00:09:14.041 --> 00:09:16.230
air force base, or could 1957,

160
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.470
where they happen to have a camera crew out of near the dry Lake bed,

161
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:23.760
capturing the installation of a new landing facility for fad six fighter jets.

162
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.170
And it was broad daylight.

163
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.980
And all of a sudden this disc appears out of nowhere and the camera crew turn

164
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.850
their cameras on it.

165
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.800
And they filmed the landing of this flying saucer on the dry Lake bed at Edwards

166
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:39.450
air force base. And I'm telling the story to Senator Reed thinking,

167
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.480
you know, I don't know how he's going to react when I, but this is what I was,

168
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.280
I have them on camera. And uh, I said, he has the film footage developed.

169
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:50.250
It was good footage. He held it up, he looked at it, it was a disk, you know,

170
00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:54.300
blah, blah, blah. And, uh, eventually he gets a courier jet from Washington,

171
00:09:54.301 --> 00:09:58.560
DC that flies in pick up the footage, Senator Murray goes,

172
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.980
and it was never seen or heard from again. And I said, yeah, exactly.

173
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.420
And I said, did you guys uncover stuff like that? He goes, Oh yeah,

174
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.300
it's all there. It's we, we, we have it. It's all there.

175
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:12.300
And then he goes to change the topic and talk about something else. And I said,

176
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:14.460
well, hold on, Senator, uh,

177
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.050
are you saying that there's evidence that hasn't seen the light of day?

178
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.220
And he looked at me and he kind of pauses and he picks up his water bottle.

179
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.820
He drinks a sip of water. And that, that, that moment seemed like an hour,

180
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:30.060
but it was probably just a second or two. And he puts his water bowl down.

181
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.360
And he says, I'm saying that most of the evidence hasn't seen the light of day.

182
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.913
So that,

183
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.650
that for me was such a powerful moment because I'm going look at who this is

184
00:10:40.651 --> 00:10:44.520
coming from. This is the former head of, you know, Senate, majority leader,

185
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.360
Harry Reid saying that the vast majority of evidence hasn't seen the light of

186
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:51.960
day. And if the president of the United States can't get access to it.

187
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.520
As I found out, when I interviewed all the people around president Clinton, uh,

188
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.000
who can, who has the authority to have this stuff released.

189
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.730
And that's something that I would love to know.

190
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.230
And I've been trying to find out.

191
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:10.700
<v 0>So someone does someone in some position of government or some</v>

192
00:11:10.701 --> 00:11:13.430
intelligence agency, someone in the Pentagon,

193
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:17.750
someone or some group at the highest level of clearance

194
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.930
has access to this information and knows about it.

195
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.310
<v 1>Absolutely. Senator Reed said they uncovered all this stuff during the program.</v>

196
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.880
And he said the level of resistance that he got from the intelligence agencies

197
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:30.680
was insane. Like, I mean,

198
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:34.190
they did not want this project going forward at the Pentagon,

199
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.640
but they pushed and they pushed and they pushed and they got it through started

200
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:38.421
in 2007.

201
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:41.480
It went all the way up until it ended up on the front page of the New York times

202
00:11:41.481 --> 00:11:45.710
in 2017. Of course, now we know that there's another project, but jock,

203
00:11:45.711 --> 00:11:50.390
do you know who has the authority to release this stuff to the general public?

204
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.310
No, no, not, not.

205
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.080
<v 2>In, in this particular case.</v>
