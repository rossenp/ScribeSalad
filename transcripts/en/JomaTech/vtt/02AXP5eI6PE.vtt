00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>Welcome to the drama show the show where we talk about tips and tricks on how to</v>

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:08.610
land a successful career in tech. In this show. Sometimes I have guests,

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.580
sometimes I don't like today. I don't have any guests.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.760
Most of the time I will not have any guests because you know,

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.100
Silicon Valley people that are quite busy.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.030
So today we're going to talk about how to land your first internship and how am

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:23.940
I going to talk about this? I'm going to talk about through my lens,

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.880
through my experiences, rather than telling you what to do.

9
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.510
I'll just tell you exactly what I did and not saying that's the best way to do

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.660
it, but I'm sharing my story after this video.

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:36.180
I'm going to talk about all my other internships, like for example,

12
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.570
how to get internship, Citadel, how to get an internship at LinkedIn,

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.990
how to transition into data science at Facebook,

14
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.830
and then how to transition again into PM at Microsoft. So yeah,

15
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:48.360
if you're interested in all those companies,

16
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:51.600
don't forget to press subscribe so that you get notified when those companies

17
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:54.360
come up. So, yeah. Welcome to Joe, Michelle.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.060
I just want to say that, uh, I'm not going to tell you like, Oh yeah,

19
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.330
just work hard, you know, do practice questions and stuff like that.

20
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.920
The way I got things, it's not a hundred percent merit, you know? Uh,

21
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:14.870
I use a lot of my brother's connections. I, you know,

22
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.400
exaggerated my resume a lot. And I also did projects that I'd never completed,

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.020
but said I did. So to be honest, I don't want my friends knowing. And you know,

24
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.570
it's kind of, it's kind of embarrassing, but you know,

25
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:29.150
which is why I'm not promoting this challenge to them, but I'm telling you guys,

26
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.510
cause I want to be fully transparent. Cause our Arles in the end, I'm only,

27
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.820
I'm only going to be talking about like vague, you know?

28
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:36.080
And I don't want to talk about vape shop.

29
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.010
I just want to talk about concrete things on exactly how to get those

30
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:42.920
internships. All right. Okay. So let's get started. I'm going to,

31
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.620
I'm going to look at my old resume for reference,

32
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.240
cause it's been a while and I don't remember what exactly I did. So yeah,

33
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:54.020
as you can see, I have a, uh, I wrote a lot of cover letters.

34
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.940
That's how I started, but I just want to look at my resume.

35
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.080
I think it's this one. I'm not sure. Maybe. Maybe if I, okay. Wait,

36
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.490
it might be this one. Um, yeah, that's it. Okay. So work experience.

37
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:12.200
I still have no work experience. I worked at McDonald's and statistics, Canada.

38
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.970
I just knock on people's doors. Okay. Let's see. Okay.

39
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.920
This sounds about right now, actually I'm going to go longer.

40
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:26.390
One, is it this one? I had multiple resumes.

41
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.290
So yes.

42
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.550
The first thing I learned about getting internship is they told me to make my

43
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.090
resume one page. Cause like they don't have enough time to read all of them.

44
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:39.230
So I have one resume where I just have everything that co co accomplished,

45
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.461
but,

46
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:44.930
and then I shorten it depending on if I want to apply for finance or software.

47
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.970
Okay. Let me just try to remember what I did. Okay, cool.

48
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.190
Okay. I think I remember now, right?

49
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:56.930
So my first exposure into programming was CRC

50
00:02:56.931 --> 00:03:01.390
robotics. This is something I did in high school.

51
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.820
It's not really high school. It's C Jeff, cause I'm from Quebec,

52
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.020
but you don't need to know what that is. CRC robotics. Basically.

53
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.510
We had to build robots and then we compete against each other.

54
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.770
And so for example,

55
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.270
one of the tests was that you had to program your robot to autonomously,

56
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:21.100
do a few things. So that's where programming came along.

57
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.540
So that was my first exposure.

58
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.320
It was called robot C apparently the language,

59
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:30.070
it just looks like C plus plus. And then, um,

60
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.190
my brother was also graduating from Waterloo,

61
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.980
which is the school that was going to go university of Waterloo.

62
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.150
And then he told me about computer science is that, Oh, you know,

63
00:03:40.151 --> 00:03:42.550
you could have this thing called, uh,

64
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.930
code programs where you could write stuff and then you could input stuff and

65
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.930
then output stuff. You know, I thought it was a boring as ever,

66
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.620
but he told me that you could get like pretty sick jobs at Facebook and stuff

67
00:03:53.621 --> 00:03:57.700
like that. So yeah. So then I started learning something called Dr.

68
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.400
Racket or scheme, which is stupid. Cause like I don't think any company uses it.

69
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.950
So I don't know I was learning that, but apparently it does.

70
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.290
The first thing you learn at school,

71
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.440
the first course is called like [inaudible] or something.

72
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.010
And then I dabble into that and then I learned about Python, what Python was.

73
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:18.310
So then I was doing that like Harvard classes, like online,

74
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:22.030
like the really easy ones. Okay. They're not really easy because um,

75
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.130
like I did the first course, I thought it was bomb.

76
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.100
And then when it comes to like object oriented shipment, what the?

77
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.310
And I just couldn't understand. So I didn't even pass that level.

78
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.810
So I had a very basic literacy of Python. Oh yeah. True. Okay.

79
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:39.400
I have to talk about my school because I think that's an important piece. Um,

80
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.120
so I went to university of Waterloo. I could tell you how I got in there,

81
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:46.420
but you probably don't need to because it's super easy to get into. Um,

82
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.980
Waterloo is pretty special in the fact that you have to get,

83
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.780
you have to do five to six internships before you graduate.

84
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.390
So they have this system called job mine,

85
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.130
and you have to apply to jobs using that system like every other semester.

86
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.340
And it makes getting internships a lot easier.

87
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.100
So if you have something like that in school,

88
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.820
make sure you take advantage of it because that's usually how you know,

89
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.130
you'll get your first tech internship.

90
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.240
Your first tech internship is usually the hardest one because you have no

91
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:23.320
experience and you only have side projects. If you have bomb side projects,

92
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:26.680
it's going to be pretty easy for you. If you don't, you should, you know,

93
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.440
do some, you don't need to finish them. To be honest,

94
00:05:29.441 --> 00:05:30.850
you could even lie a little bit,

95
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.080
but just make sure that when you're asked questions about it,

96
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:37.570
you can answer them fully. Yeah.

97
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.400
So fast forward to like a year it's job fair. I mean,

98
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:43.600
we don't call it a job fair.

99
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.710
We have some program called job mine where you just, you know, put your resume,

100
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.700
put your cover letter and send it to companies. Let me show you something.

101
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.280
So here's the folder,

102
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.030
the folder that I use to all of the applications.

103
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.340
So I had a cover letter for each and every company. It was crazy.

104
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.720
It's basically the same thing,

105
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:09.290
but I just changed the name of the company and like the reasons why I'm a good

106
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:13.970
fit. Uh, I think I got about like a few responses, like maybe 10,

107
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.360
10 responses out of 50. And then I'll of those interviews.

108
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:20.360
I only got like one or I think two or three jobs.

109
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.530
I think one knows like QA position at like, um,

110
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.560
some Waterloo company. I don't remember what it was, but it was some basic.

111
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.720
And then I also got a first internship, which is

112
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.980
Scotia bank. So back to my resume, I'm going to tell you how I got that. Well,

113
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:44.030
how I think I got that first job. Cause um, I mean,

114
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:47.120
it's not exactly software engineering, but we did a lot of software engineering.

115
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:51.770
Like I did a lot of C plus Buster. I did some like VBA coding thing, which is,

116
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:56.180
um, not something software people would do, but yeah. So not going to lie.

117
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.570
The first job I got, it's not the best job ever. I mean, Scotiabank,

118
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.970
you probably, you, you probably don't even know what Scotiabank is.

119
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.700
It's a Canadian bank by the way. Uh, not prestigious at all. It's um, yeah,

120
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:10.880
it's crap to be honest, but the position was quite good. It's called credit. No.

121
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:12.920
What was it again? Equity and credit derivatives.

122
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.280
And I'll tell you a little bit about that and how I got into that.

123
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.130
So what credit in derivatives? Oh yeah. True. I forgot to talk about this.

124
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.600
I was in math and business. I wasn't computer science, uh, back then.

125
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.630
So I mean, I actually want to be like an investment banker or something.

126
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:28.850
I didn't even want to be a software engineer. Mostly.

127
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:32.000
I thought I was going to be an investment banker, so, or like a trader.

128
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.080
So I was really into finance stuff and I do two projects.

129
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.810
So the first project is in trade. Um,

130
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.670
so in trade was a website that you could bet on events. So how it works is,

131
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.520
for example, if you thought Obama was going to win the election,

132
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.070
then you have a marketplace for that. For example,

133
00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:53.690
if the price is at nine and you buy at nine and Obama actually wins the

134
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:57.800
election, then it will automatically go to $10. So it's a one to 10 or sorry,

135
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.460
zero to 10. So then you would gain $1. If you've lost the election,

136
00:08:01.461 --> 00:08:03.800
it would go to zero. So that means all the money invested,

137
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:08.330
the $9 invested you'll lose, you'll lose it on. It becomes zero.

138
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.820
So basically it's kind of like a stock market ish.

139
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.200
And then also my brother told me that, Oh, it's actually like a binary option.

140
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.800
I don't want to bore you with details, but basically in a finance world,

141
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:23.210
whatever I was playing with in that website, what were binary options?

142
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.730
And he told me that, Oh, do you want to work on project together?

143
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.780
My brother and I, and then I said, yeah, sure. Why not? So then he told me, Oh,

144
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.670
why don't you write a Python bot that trades these options

145
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.030
automatically? You know, I didn't really know anything about finance,

146
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:41.690
but then I learned, I learned that you could price a binary option.

147
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.210
I just went to Wikipedia. You could Google binary option.

148
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.810
And there's something called a black Sholes model that you can input your

149
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:51.140
numbers and then kind of have a guesstimate on how much it would cost.

150
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:55.560
And usually it'll be pretty accurate. So we did that for a couple of months,

151
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:59.520
I think. And I like, it was actually a really basic bond. It was terrible,

152
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:01.170
actually. It was like, no.

153
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.480
<v 2>You know, like try catch.</v>

154
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.400
<v 0>Errors or whatever. It was pretty,</v>

155
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.770
but I still did it and we still made money ish.

156
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.600
So then now I had like a pretty good fundamental knowledge on options for

157
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:20.310
trading. Yeah. And then the second project I did our ITC,

158
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.460
this is a Rotman international trading competition. It's not,

159
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.970
it's not technical at all. I mean, you, you have like Excel spreadsheets,

160
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.150
you write some VBA code to try to like facilitate your trading.

161
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:35.070
I basically wrote some VBA macros to facilitate in our pricing of the assets so

162
00:09:35.071 --> 00:09:35.904
that we could trade.

163
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.600
I did really well on like a case that was like the options case.

164
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.080
So I understood like calls and puts, Ooh, I like, it's not a lot,

165
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.160
but it's enough to impress them as a freshmen. So I interviewed for Scotia bank.

166
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.350
I also interviewed for other companies about,

167
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.160
just talk about [inaudible] and then what they asked me was first asked me some

168
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:54.780
C plus plus related questions like, Oh,

169
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:58.710
what's object oriented programming stuff, inheritance and stuff like that.

170
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.820
And then they asked me some link lists questions. I remember, I think,

171
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.480
and then they also asked me like a binary search problem. Like for example,

172
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.840
can you use binary search to find, uh,

173
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.980
defined if a number exists? So it was a, I think they give you a,

174
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.790
an array of a sorted number. So first, you know, the, the,

175
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.310
the easiest solution would be, you know, just go linearly,

176
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.420
but that would be an event. Oh yeah. You have to know like your, your, um,

177
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.220
complexity, your time complexity. So,

178
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.820
so then first a brute force way is just like scan it linearly.

179
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.920
And then later on to say, can't do it any better.

180
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:36.030
And then that's where you pull out the binary research method. And then I think,

181
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:39.570
I think that's, it that's like the, like the hardest questions there.

182
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:42.060
So it was pretty simple. Cause I mean, it's a finance company.

183
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.750
They don't ask you a hardship next. They asked me some call and put options.

184
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:50.070
I think they asked they, they drew like a line, which is like the payout line.

185
00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.870
And then they told me like, Oh, what combination of calls and puts is that?

186
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:58.920
And can you tell me like how to combine them so that your payout option that

187
00:10:58.921 --> 00:10:59.820
looks like that? Sorry,

188
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:02.100
I'm talking about this because it's not really software related,

189
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.110
but that's what they asked me. And then, yeah.

190
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:05.520
So then I got that question right.

191
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.210
And then went home and then they called me back like a week later and they said

192
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:11.070
that I was like the number one candidate for them.

193
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.290
And then they want to offer me a job. That was great.

194
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:16.410
I got the job and that's how I got my first internship.

195
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:21.180
So that's pretty much it. Um, yeah. Let me see if I,

196
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.860
if I forgot anything. Oh yeah, yeah. True. So I guess,

197
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:27.720
um, I did a lot of random too,

198
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.370
and I'll tell you things that are kind of like iffy, that might've helped,

199
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:35.970
but also might not have helped. And also like that actually didn't do.

200
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:39.780
But I wrote that I did. So here you could see, I got Facebook hacker cup,

201
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.770
you know, I wrote annual worldwide program competition hosted by Facebook,

202
00:11:43.771 --> 00:11:46.620
develop problem, solving skills through completing their protein puzzles.

203
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.980
I didn't even do any of them. I think I did like one or two.

204
00:11:49.981 --> 00:11:52.680
I got one of them and then I failed theater too.

205
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.630
Like I didn't even make it to the second round pie game.

206
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:59.830
I made like a stupid game using PI yeah. Using PI game.

207
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:03.610
I think it was just like a ball that runs around and shoots like balls at,

208
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:06.730
at things. And then Google AI challenge. Oh, that's the worst.

209
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:11.260
I didn't even do that. So basically the Google AI challenge, I remember it was,

210
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.060
uh, as a game of plant Wars,

211
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.520
there there's a nerd game like this that you could play for real,

212
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:17.800
like not using bots, it's a GIF planets.

213
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.100
And then you could shoot spaceships onto another planet to capture it if you

214
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:23.620
have more spaceships and theater planet. But yeah.

215
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:27.070
So you could program a bot to play that game, but I didn't even do it.

216
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.690
Like I think I just downloaded the sample bot and changed like a few parameters

217
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:33.700
and just tried it out. But I couldn't like,

218
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:35.860
I didn't even know how to run it or like test it and stuff.

219
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:39.850
So I didn't even do that by, so put it in there and also had some stupid,

220
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.210
like just to fill in my resume, like poker, you know,

221
00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:46.000
because I thought that's for trading like old traders love poker.

222
00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.610
So I talked about my poker mom, this is actually real. Like,

223
00:12:48.611 --> 00:12:51.610
I'm pretty proud of my poker games and my profit there.

224
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.420
I even put like my art stuff. I don't know why I put, uh, Oh yeah.

225
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:56.800
I guess I have to say that. Um,

226
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.180
I did get good grades in school so that might've helped. Uh, yeah.

227
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:05.260
Waterloo has like cumulative average of 93. So I was in Dean's honors list.

228
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.430
So yeah. Uh,

229
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.110
never be discouraged at your first internship because after you get one good

230
00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:11.830
internship,

231
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.400
all the other big companies will just come knocking your door and you're just

232
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.960
get like a ton of interviews. So, yeah. So in conclusion,

233
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.470
that was how I got my first tech internship and it wasn't a great tech

234
00:13:23.471 --> 00:13:27.790
internship because it was like a no-name tech internship and it was, um,

235
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.110
like C plus plus crap code base was. You know, their tech was really bad,

236
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:37.390
but it was my first job and it kind of led to how I got into Citadel.

237
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.710
And they'll talk about that on my next video. So yeah. Thanks for watching.

238
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.980
Don't forget to subscribe if you want to know how I got into Citadel,

239
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.870
which I will post, uh, next time, I guess. And then yeah. Thanks for watching.
