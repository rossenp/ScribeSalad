WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Out of the three out of three, um, I think it was, uh,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.670
Google was a hardest then Uber then snap.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.180
And I think part of that was also the composition. Uh, so Google had,

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.340
I used a line that, so there's this guy called Hasib and he writes,

5
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.290
like he wrote this blog post about like negotiating. Um, and he says like.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.170
<v 1>Before we continue our video,</v>

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.440
I just want to say that we are sponsored by a hosting group today.

8
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.720
How stinger offers web hosting services that is extremely easy to use with a

9
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:33.950
great user experience.

10
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.360
And also they are the fastest web hosting provider in the industry.

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.490
Now the onboarding experience really shows you how easy you can set up your

12
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:45.080
website since they show you.

13
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:49.070
Step-by-step how to create your website and guide you through the process.

14
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:51.290
So you can deploy your websites in minutes.

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.630
So they are a lamp stack hosting service.

16
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.950
So you can easily set up WordPress websites or choose one of their templates.

17
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.530
You can also write your own PHP code if you want.

18
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.880
And all you have to do is FTP it into their servers. You can also use their UI,

19
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:09.590
so you don't need to use your own FPT clients, which is very, very convenient.

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.440
All in all. I would recommend Hostin ger,

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.940
if you want to host a blog or a static website, since it's super affordable,

22
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.970
you know, it starts at $0.80.

23
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:24.350
So 80 cents a month for an all in one web hosting and domain name.

24
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.800
And you can set up in just under two minutes with their services.

25
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.300
So if you want to make your resume stronger and looking to host your personal

26
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:36.950

29
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:48.200
So let's do Uber like screw Facebook cause it's data engineer. So, okay.

30
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.270
So when did you start to decide like, okay,

31
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.720
I'm going to switch jobs and I'm like, what'd you do?

32
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:56.750
How many questions did you do? What'd you do? Like before Uber, blah, blah,

33
00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.380
blah, sorry. Before the interview. And like, yeah, let's just talk to them.

34
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.240
<v 0>Yes. In front of beginning. Uh, yeah.</v>

35
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.450
So I think it was around the summer of last year, 2018,

36
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.000
where I first started thinking about it. Um,

37
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.900
so first I did explore transferring internally, but there was no like headcount.

38
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.420
Um, yeah. And so, so then I started like writing up a rough plan. Um,

39
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.970
and then, um, I was, I was kind of studying, but like not really seriously.

40
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.680
Uh, so not every day, like in, um, probably like July and August. Um,

41
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.810
and then I think I got a call from a Google recruiter. Um, and they,

42
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:34.550
since I had interviewed with them before they, um,

43
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.000
let me go straight to an onsite. And so that was when I scheduled it out, like,

44
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.550
uh, like almost two months out. Um,

45
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.720
and so since I was already studying for Google, [inaudible] apply for like,

46
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:45.980
as many companies as possible.

47
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.310
So I applied or like reply to like around 20 companies. Um,

48
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.080
and then, so I just made a post about the side, all the numbers in my head,

49
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.370
but basically out of those 20, I had like 11 phone screens. Um,

50
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.950
and then obviously 11 phone screens. I like past, uh, eight of them.

51
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.330
And then I decided to on-sites with six. Um, and, uh, yeah.

52
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.030
<v 1>Nice. I like that funnel. My funnel looks totally different. Mine was, um,</v>

53
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.350
Uber, which rejected me in under 22 minutes.

54
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.533
<v 2>That was very directive.</v>

55
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.100
<v 0>Or different team before. Yeah. So you apply for teams, right? Yeah. Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.450
<v 1>Yeah. Just for context,</v>

57
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:28.290
I asked Cyrus to refer me to Uber and then within five minutes they said, no,

58
00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.830
thank you. That they didn't even call you. I was so sad, but yeah. And then,

59
00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:35.250
and then I also had applied to two other companies, um,

60
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.330
I guess I'm not super comfortable sharing just because I've owned this YouTube

61
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.560
channel, but basically it's two big companies and yeah. So then,

62
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.100
and then I did two, one screen and then two on-site and then two offers.

63
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:51.030
So nice. A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Yeah. Except for Uber, but.

64
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.210
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.610
<v 0>I wanted to do, um, to get like a lot of on-sites for practice. Oh, that's true.</v>

66
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:59.640
And then I also wanted it for negotiation.

67
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.500
<v 1>I got lucky, you know, because, because, um, yeah, cause I went through like,</v>

68
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:06.000
I'll just blur it out, you know,

69
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:09.060
when I went to that was like my first on-site and I'm like, Oh,

70
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.840
thank God I got it. But yeah. Nice. But, uh,

71
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.620
I also actually had a coffee. Does something different?

72
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:19.620
They make you do a coding challenge. Oh, I did. Um,

73
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.770
and I just Googled the coding challenge and I found it and I just.

74
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.490
<v 2>Just coffee face at it and it was totally fine.</v>

75
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.350
<v 0>I like borderline failed the first phone screen.</v>

76
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:33.670
So they gave me a second give you a phone screen. Yeah,

77
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.830
I think at the challenge. Yeah.

78
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.870
<v 1>So easy is like, they gave me the challenge. I just like, I copied the question,</v>

79
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:41.790
I pasted it and it was a Chinese website. I was like.

80
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.510
<v 2>Yeah, I just got, I said no. Yeah. I got, actually.</v>

81
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.000
<v 0>I remember the phone interview was one of the hardest state I get,</v>

82
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.360
I got Lee code hard. Oh. And then I barely got it.

83
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.850
And I got a second phone screen cause was borderline. Oh really?

84
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.140
<v 1>Oh, well at least they're nice. Yeah. And I heard like they, um,</v>

85
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.380
they do a lot of like cultural interviews. I'll be careful with that, but,

86
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.790
but yeah. And I heard they pay very well too, but yeah. Anyways,

87
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.230
so after you did your onsite and all of them, um, yeah, so,

88
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:11.820
so which were the on-sites that you did again?

89
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.210
<v 0>So I decided six on-sites, so three of them are Google,</v>

90
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.850
Uber and snap and then three others. Yeah.

91
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.180
<v 1>Um, so, so yeah, so Uber, was it like, uh,</v>

92
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.810
the cold hard they call medium versus now? Which ones out of the three.

93
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.200
<v 0>Number three? Um, I think it was, uh,</v>

94
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.830
Google was a hardest then Uber then snap.

95
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.820
And I think part of that was also the composition. Uh, so Google had, uh,

96
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.380
like all five rounds, um, we're coding, like data structures and algorithms.

97
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.330
Whereas Uber had, um,

98
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.470
they had a system design round and they had a behavioral round and then I think

99
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.363
the same with snap.

100
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.820
And I had like actually study a lot with a system design because I really

101
00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:55.680
wanted, uh, like a more senior level. Um, so because Google was like, Oh,

102
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:59.020
five coding. I was like, it was, I was pretty exhausted by then. Yeah.

103
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.530
<v 1>Yeah. So I also, I also had like similar experience with a company.</v>

104
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:07.520
I also have five algo rounds. Um,

105
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.690
like I think I got lucky cause, cause you know, it's either,

106
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.070
you know what you don't like once, right?

107
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.030
Like there's always a trick to dissolve the questions, you know? And then yeah.

108
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.270
So then that one, it was fine. I did it. And then for theater company,

109
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.380
it was like two coating rounds. And then what was it? Three. Yeah,

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.400
it was two coating round three system designed Reese reset one like behavior or

111
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:32.120
like leadership or whatever that's called and yeah, it was long. Holy crap.

112
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.960
I think it literally took from like nine to like five, but uh,

113
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.560
for the system design, I use that grokking, the inner.

114
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.410
<v 0>Rocking this, since.</v>

115
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.760
<v 1>I interview, um, yeah, I paid for that, but uh, I realized like,</v>

116
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.600
like every case they have, they always say the same thing they do. Yeah.

117
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.850
So I was like, I guess it's repetition,

118
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.280
but actually only helped me with one question.

119
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.390
Cause like the system design question at that company, it's not always like, Oh,

120
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.390
you know, bill hall, whatever. Sometimes he asks you something specific.

121
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:04.880
Like for example, I think once they said like, Oh, you know,

122
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:07.520
you have this memory space, you get blah, blah, blah. Well,

123
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:11.150
how should you like format the memory so that it's efficient, blah, blah, blah.

124
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.510
Or you have like a buffer and stuff like that. And that was annoying.

125
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:17.750
Cause I remember like when I was, uh, when I was doing it, you know,

126
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.760
at one point I was doing it and then he's like, okay,

127
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:23.540
I'll stop you over here because you know, it took you longer than most people.

128
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.050
I was like, no, I feel like.

129
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.550
<v 0>Yeah. I feel like system design is so broad that like, yeah, they can go.</v>

130
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.100
Especially if it's a specific team. Right. They can go really? Yeah.

131
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.390
<v 1>Yeah. It was lame. Cause like, yeah,</v>

132
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.230
it was like a data infrastructure position and I didn't even want to do the it

133
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.180
infrastructure, but they,

134
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.100
they didn't have any possession for like apps or whatever. Yeah. Anyways, so,

135
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.510
and then you got offers from Google snap and Uber and then yeah.

136
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.830
Why did you choose Uber?

137
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.270
<v 0>Yeah, so, so yeah,</v>

138
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:56.350
so I got offers from five of the six and then the three in serious contention

139
00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.390
were Google, Uber and snap. Um, and uh, so I ended up choosing, uh,

140
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.080
Uber because well, first of all, Google gave me a pretty low offer. Um,

141
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:07.540
so they are notorious for down leveling, uh,

142
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.220
and then Uber and snap because they.

143
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.053
<v 1>Know your true worth.</v>

144
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.840
<v 0>I kind of expected it cause I bombed like, uh,</v>

145
00:08:13.841 --> 00:08:17.830
one of the questions on the Google's actually matter. I think it does. Cause I,

146
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.860
yeah, cause I did, I did really well Uber and snap offer.

147
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.990
Uh onsites and I got like, um, like top of the range for the level offers. Um,

148
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.850
so they, the numbers are a lot higher than okay.

149
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.640
<v 1>That's Google. Where are the offers already top or was it because.</v>

150
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.900
<v 0>Yeah, they're already taught. Yeah. So actually, yeah. Uh,</v>

151
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.830
so actually with both Google, uh, with both Uber and snap, um,

152
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.510
the offers were like the base and uh, equity were already maxed out.

153
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.310
Um, and I think part of that was I had actually done some like pre negotiation,

154
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:52.870
like I had like set it up so that they knew that they would be competing with

155
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.310
all these other companies. Uh,

156
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.050
so like both Uber and snap recruiters knew that a Google onsite. Um,

157
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.711
and then like,

158
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.910
I think that's one thing like you don't like you can tell recurs about upcoming

159
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:05.880
onsites, especially if they seem like kind of impressive. Um,

160
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.620
even if you aren't sure if you're gonna pass it. Um, and then once,

161
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:12.660
uh, like even before they gave me the numbers,

162
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:16.260
I had already told them what I was expecting and like the other company's

163
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:19.530
offers. Um, so yeah, I got a, I got a pretty high initial offer.

164
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:25.070
<v 1>Okay. But let's just dig into more to just like TC negotiation. Yeah.</v>

165
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.460
Oh, in case you guys don't know what TC is, it's total compensation. Right.

166
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.960
If you go on blind, you wouldn't know what TC, you know, so TC,

167
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.320
how did you like, um, was it already at the max to TC?

168
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.470
<v 0>Yeah. So yeah. So at TC, I think that's, uh,</v>

169
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.810
I think the most important thing is knowing how much you're worth.

170
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.760
And I think the, yeah, so like I said,

171
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:48.170
blind is really good for getting that an idea. And also, um, double side FYI,

172
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.260
you can see like specific offers each level. Um,

173
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.650
so I already knew kind of the like max range. Um,

174
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.460
and then I knew that I didn't really care if it was like,

175
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.300
I didn't really care how the offer components were broken up.

176
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.130
So like if I could get a, what are the components?

177
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.130
The components are like a base equity bonus and then sign on bonus. Um,

178
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.870
and so I didn't really care how they split it up.

179
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.840
Like if I wanted like 20 K more, I didn't care if it was like,

180
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.670
like sign-on versus base. Cause usually companies don't negotiate base as much.

181
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:20.504
So.

182
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.730
<v 1>So let's go back to like exactly what happened.</v>

183
00:10:22.731 --> 00:10:24.140
So which offer did you get first?

184
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.350
<v 0>Um, I think I got, I got, I got snap first. Okay.</v>

185
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.950
<v 1>Yeah. And then, and then they give an offer. Did you negotiate them?</v>

186
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.170
<v 0>Uh, yes. I think, yeah, I think I negotiated, I actually, I think let's not,</v>

187
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:39.170
they did raise the equity just a little bit. Um,

188
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.080
and then it became the max and then, uh, but yeah,

189
00:10:42.081 --> 00:10:44.090
I had already told another that's important.

190
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:46.700
I had told all these recruiters that I was going to take awhile,

191
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.780
so they didn't try to pressure me by saying like you only have three days to

192
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:53.810
decide. Um, and I think you will see this in blog posts,

193
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.420
but basically like never accept that. Um,

194
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.660
like usually there's bluffing and if they aren't bluffing it's for another

195
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:03.830
company, so yeah. But yeah, so yeah, so I, um,

196
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.850
I told them they sounded good, but I think about it. Um,

197
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.460
and also in negotiation, you don't want to be like,

198
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.980
it's not like a adversarial thing. It's kind of like,

199
00:11:12.981 --> 00:11:16.460
you're trying to find something that's a good deal for both of you. Uh, so yeah,

200
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.190
so I told them that sounds good, but anytime we think about it, um,

201
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:21.290
I'll let you know when I get like other numbers.

202
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.720
<v 1>Yeah. And go, and then, then you got Uber? Yes. Okay.</v>

203
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.290
And then was it higher than snap?

204
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.500
<v 0>Oh, well actually it was actually before I got Uber I'd already gotten, uh,</v>

205
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.720
so I guess the kind of company's DNA. Um,

206
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.430
so I'd gotten like an offer from company D that was a bit weaker and total

207
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:41.210
compensation, but the base salary was like significantly higher. Actually.

208
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.930
It was, I was able to use that to say like, um, based on this,

209
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.810
you guys raised your equity. And so that's one thing where like,

210
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.440
even if another company's offer is on the whole, like weaker,

211
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.840
you can take a specific component, say, you know, like I, you know,

212
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:59.410
I rally really value liquid liquidity right now, or like consistent,

213
00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:04.150
like a steady state salary. And so based on that, you know, can you guys, uh.

214
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.420
<v 1>If you offer, so yeah. Okay.</v>

215
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.810
And then you approved your snap offer and then you got your Uber offer. Yes.

216
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.810
And was the Uber offer higher?

217
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.800
<v 0>Ah, so it was, it was roughly equivalent. Um, and so Uber,</v>

218
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.640
the recruiter like already knew exactly what the snap offer was going to be. Um,

219
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.670
and yeah, so it was roughly Columbus.

220
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:27.270
It's hard to compare because Uber is a private company. Uh,

221
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:31.380
whereas snap is public. Right. And so I was pretty confident Uber, uh,

222
00:12:31.381 --> 00:12:35.280
was going to IPO, um, this year, um,

223
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:40.290
which I think to what turned out to be true. And uh, and then, but then like,

224
00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:44.520
yeah, snap is like, um, public and their equity vests every month. Uh,

225
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.810
so it's a lot more alone. We're a lot lower risk, but also at the same time,

226
00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:52.350
like pretty high risk too. Cause snap wasn't doing that well. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

227
00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:53.580
so yeah, I had to.

228
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.920
<v 1>Come up with my own way of comparing the two. Okay.</v>

229
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.100
And did Uber increase their offer because of your snap offer?

230
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.240
<v 0>Uh, yes. Okay. So actually, yeah, so the, um,</v>

231
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.840
what was already at the max and so I knew that the main thing I couldn't improve

232
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:09.150
on was signing bonus. So I went on blind,

233
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.480
do some searching to see if like it was possible. Um,

234
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.050
and then I eventually like pushed for certain signing bonus and, um,

235
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.720
I used a line that,

236
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.680
so there's this guy called Hasib and he writes like he wrote this blog post

237
00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:26.670
about like negotiating. Um, and he says like, uh,

238
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.730
so you have this long time you, of these competing companies competing for you.

239
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.780
So at the very end, uh, the final like strategy should use is like,

240
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.290
cause right now your leverage is that you have these other companies,

241
00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:40.000
you have time on your hand, uh, as an element. Uh,

242
00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:42.000
and so if you give away that time advantage,

243
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.030
then you can like get something back for it. And so basically what you do that,

244
00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:47.940
as you say, um, I can I'll sign right now,

245
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.600
like basically in the process with everybody else. If you guys give me,

246
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.900
you know, like 25 K more. Um, and then yeah.

247
00:13:54.901 --> 00:13:57.560
And then usually they want to get it. They close the deal right away. So.

248
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.190
<v 1>Interesting. So you got a little bit upper? Yeah. Yeah. So Indiana,</v>

249
00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:05.430
what was the TC for like snap Uber and like Google.

250
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:07.890
<v 0>It depends on how you calculate it,</v>

251
00:14:07.891 --> 00:14:12.570
but basically around 300 K for snap and Uber and then for Google about.

252
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.440
<v 1>Like 240 K it's crazy.</v>

253
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:21.840
So 300 K for like snapping Uber and Oh yeah. What level was that? L four L four.

254
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.890
And that's pretty much at the top. Yeah. That's pretty much at the top. Yep.

255
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:26.910
Okay.
