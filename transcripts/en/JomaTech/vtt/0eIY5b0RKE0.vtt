00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 0>What's popping guys. It's this very special day.</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.690
It is Saturday in the morning and we have a special guest.

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.550
Okay. Now we don't have special guests. Uh, it's only me today, but you know,

4
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:19.020
we can still have fun with just me. Um, I don't have any plans for today.

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.650
You know, none of my friends invited me to anything,

6
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.920
so yeah. Um, so yeah, let's go, right. Uh, let's go right in web app, you know,

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.060
cause because there's nothing else to do apparently, but come on in.

8
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.443
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.850
<v 0>Okay. All right. So let's write a simple web app.</v>

10
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.720
I don't know what I want to build. All right. So usually what I like to do,

11
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.170
I like to start off with a template.

12
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.550
So usually what I do is I like to put it on Heroku. I like the host on Heroku,

13
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.210
cause it's just a lot faster and I don't need to think about the servers and

14
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:18.230
stuff like that. So I made a template called node JS template.

15
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.450
And what am I going to do is I'm going to get clone it onto my computer

16
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.100
and then maybe rename it to something else. Maybe called project.

17
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:32.960
Joma no project find Joma a wife.

18
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.850
Uh, and then let's go here as you can see, let's see if it works,

19
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.900
no JS index. Ooh, something's wrong. Cannot find module.

20
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.990
That is because we have to NPM install first.

21
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.980
So this will install all the packages that my template uses.

22
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.100
Let's look at package dot Jason. Jeez.

23
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.580
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.050
<v 0>But yeah, so we've got express EJS okay. That's cool. Cool. Cool. All right.</v>

25
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.790
So express is basically a web framework and uh, yeah, so let's try it out.

26
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.680
No GS dot index listening. Let's see. Local host 5,000

27
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.130
seems to work real well. All right. And then next, uh,

28
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:19.400
I kind of forgot how to do this, but next I'm going to deploy to Heroku.

29
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.830
So Heroku create,

30
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.760
get pushed to Heroku.

31
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.700
Come on, come on. You're compressing done.

32
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.480
Launching [inaudible]. Oh, they gave me this URL vast hollows. All right

33
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.480
. And then let's see if it works. Okay. Cool. All right. Joan

34
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 was a sounds right. So as you can see, now it's already deployed to

35
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 vast hollow. So now I have the deployment ready. So I am ready to code, but I'm not a coder. I'm not a 

36
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.480
rapper. All right. So now I think about why do I want to build? Hm

37
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.480
. So usually I like to think of a problem that I have and then find a solution for it. So all I have to do is find my most annoying problem. I need a girlfriend. 

38
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.480
All right. I'm going to take a break. I'm going to go get lunch, but um,

39
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.313
 I'll think about it. I'll think about what to build. Yeah.

40
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.270
<v 1>I'm Mr. [inaudible]. I have no buddy [inaudible]</v>

41
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.980
um, Mr. Lonely

42
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.950
shy had some,

43
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.610
one to call on the

44
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.863
[inaudible]

45
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.803
away from

46
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.213
[inaudible]. Um,  Mr. [inaudible]

47
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.450
I wish that I.

48
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.310
<v 0>So if I bought it and</v>

49
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.340
I kind of want to build something for me and my non-existent girlfriend,

50
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.170
so that we can watch YouTube videos together and it'll sync together, you know,

51
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:04.050
for example, if I play and I pause or I stopped the video,

52
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:06.900
it's going to do the same to her. Or if she does the same thing,

53
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.550
now this probably already exists, but it's good practice, you know? So,

54
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.610
all right. Uh, let's start building this out.

55
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.170
All right. So first we're going to take off this abomination of a page. Okay.

56
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.360
So we're going to take off this, this gusting picture. Okay.

57
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:31.920
Take this off. Okay.

58
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:35.970
And then next, what we're going to do is we're going to learn about the YouTube,

59
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.950
uh, player embedded player, Java script.

60
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.470
Okay. And then we read the documentation and see how we use it.

61
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.553
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.130
<v 0>Okay. See what this looks like.</v>

63
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.201
Cool. All right.

64
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:21.490
So now we have a YouTube player and what I'm going to do is I'm going to learn

65
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.350
about how to, you know, use the JavaScript to play, stop,

66
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.400
pause, and also I'll, I'll make it a little bit more pretty. All right. First,

67
00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:33.460
we're just going to make this a little bit prettier,

68
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.380
change that to seven 20, change this to four 80. Uh,

69
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.550
see what it looks like. Okay. It's a little bit bigger. Cool.

70
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.980
I want to change it to this prettier video because I like

71
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:52.900
to, I like to have fun while I code, you know, but I'm not a coder though.

72
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.700
Oh, very nice. Okay. Oh, wow.

73
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.850
Okay. And, Oh, I don't like the margin.

74
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:03.520
I think I'm just going to increase the margin a little bit.

75
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.560
So let's go to CSS mean there's no more headshot.

76
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.510
Let's put this to the player and then margin top.

77
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.780
Let's change it to maybe 50. Let's see if that, see, that looks good.

78
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.890
Okay. That looks a little bit better. All right.

79
00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:31.300
So this is it for the aesthetic, uh, just so that I can code better.

80
00:07:31.301 --> 00:07:33.610
So I have more motivation to code now.

81
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.470
And then what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna look at this API.

82
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.660
I'm going to figure out a way to send these information to my server

83
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:47.020
so that I can sync it between all of the people on,

84
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.330
off the people on the website, watching the player.

85
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.510
So after looking at the API,

86
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.100
I realized that they don't have everything I need it's because sometimes I kind

87
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.050
of just want to send the request to play or to stop to my server before

88
00:08:02.051 --> 00:08:06.430
they actually play. But the YouTube player doesn't allow me to do that.

89
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.260
So I'm going to have to make a controller that is an extra layer

90
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.970
above the YouTube player so that I could send a request to my server without it

91
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:17.500
having to actually play.

92
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.660
So I do that so that I can actually synchronize both of the users while

93
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:23.494
they watch it.

94
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.850
So the first thing of what I did is I stripped out all the YouTube player stuff

95
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.000
and how I did that was, um, I read,

96
00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.840
I read the documentation and I learned that you can take out the in controls by

97
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.290
controlling zero disable, keyboard, shortcuts, modest branding,

98
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.470
and stuff like that. But now we've got to add our own stuff.

99
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.750
So what we're going to do is we're going to add some buttons.

100
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.970
So I usually just go, let's see,

101
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.980
bootstrap button got a few con and then I just

102
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.190
copy this. So right under the player, uh,

103
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.470
I'm going to make a diff called the clear controls or something.

104
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.580
All right. Button here.

105
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.830
Maybe add another button. So I want to add a play button.

106
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.233
Oops.

107
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.230
And I want to add the pause button. Okay. That's what it looks like.

108
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.540
All right, cool. So we've got these two buttons now, and now we need a timeline.

109
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.240
We need a timeline because we need the user.

110
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:33.450
We need to allow the user to skip around and also to know where they are.

111
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.150
So yeah, let's just add that real quick.

112
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:14.810
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

113
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.650
<v 0>And then that's it. Now we got our bar and it seems to work pretty well.</v>

114
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:24.950
Yeah. Let's see if we restarted. Yeah. And then it starts the video and yeah,

115
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.800
it seems pretty accurate to me. All right.

116
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:31.970
Unfortunately we're out of time because it's already been almost 10 minutes.

117
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.650
So next steps, the next steps would be to connect the backend and the front end.

118
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.040
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to connect them using WebSockets to

119
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:42.770
communicate with each other. If you don't know what web sockets are,

120
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.680
don't worry about it. I'll explain on the next video. So yeah.

121
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:47.990
So you feel like this video, don't forget to give it a like,

122
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.940
and I will comment for the first 30 minutes of releasing this video. So,

123
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.750
uh, yeah. Comment and don't forget to press the bell button for notification.

124
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:00.920
So that next time you could comment and I'll reply. All right.

125
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.040
So I hope you enjoyed this and a PISA.

126
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.530
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
