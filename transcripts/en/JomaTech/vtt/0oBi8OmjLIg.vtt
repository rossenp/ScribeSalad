WEBVTT

1
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.960
<v 1>All right, welcome.</v>

2
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.070
So today we are going to talk about my productivity setup and what I've done

3
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.180
with it. And we are going to talk about mainly my primary setup,

4
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.980
even though that I have my secondary setup all the way through the back,

5
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.680
but I didn't prepare anything for that one.

6
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:50.480
So we'll be talking about this setup.

7
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.860
I use this setup for my morning routine by watching this hunky man,

8
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.510
he helps me do my 10 minute stretches, which I've been actually doing every day.

9
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.610
And, uh, afterwards, before I start work, I do some higher intensity exercise.

10
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.600
It's only a five minute video, but you know, I'm working on my consistency.

11
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:13.280
First. I have a water bottle on my desk at all times.

12
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.290
It's actually a milk jug.

13
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.740
I use this because it's exactly eight cups of water,

14
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.540
which is what you need in a day. And I also use this because it's quite heavy.

15
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:28.340
So sometimes I accidentally do a bicep curl while I drink my

16
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:32.780
water, which is the most strength training I'll do in a day nowadays.

17
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.820
And then for my real job, uh, I work as a software engineer.

18
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:42.290
So I mostly use, uh, their internal tools, which I can't show,

19
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.740
but I'll use some are tools here for demo purposes.

20
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.700
So I have an ID in the middle, usually a terminal on the right,

21
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.960
maybe emails on the left,

22
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.330
some SQL editor or dashboards on the top monitor and then maybe

23
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.840
some black pink also for a music while I work.

24
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.390
It looks different depending on what I'm working on.

25
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.460
Sometimes I just chat with my coworkers the whole day about work stuff

26
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.770
for editing videos.

27
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.360
I have my bottom monitor open up premiere pro so I can see a

28
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:17.660
huge timeline. It makes editing real fast.

29
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.910
And then the top monitor for extra space to open folders, transfer files,

30
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.380
browse a web. I have everything I need. This setup is quite perfect.

31
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.600
The only thing missing is my talent.

32
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.770
When I make educational videos for Joe mCLASS,

33
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:38.270
I use this setup to edit animations like this one about time complexity.

34
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.810
And then for the top monitors, I usually have my script.

35
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.200
I can reference to when I do my voiceovers for the videos.

36
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.400
And then I also have my ID open to record myself,

37
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:52.520
coding the things I'm teaching. Uh, it could be something else.

38
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:54.710
It could be a SQL editor if I'm teaching SQL

39
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.830
and then for entertainment.

40
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.320
Anyways, let's talk about the gear now.

41
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.600
So the first thing you see here is the big monitor.

42
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.820
The name is actually a little bit complicated,

43
00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:17.670
so I'm just going to leave it in the description. But, uh,

44
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.490
I know this one thing, it's a 79 inches.

45
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.060
I actually didn't buy it. LG just sent it to me. And when they sent it to me,

46
00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:30.990
I thought it was quite overwhelming. Right? When I first started using it,

47
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.980
I thought it was way too big, but after 10 minutes, I got used to it.

48
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.960
It's actually the same as having two 16 by nine monitors,

49
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.960
except that you don't have the thing in between.

50
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.500
You can also use it as two separate monitors. So for example,

51
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:51.360
once I had this half of the monitor use the Nintendo switch and then this

52
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:53.820
half of the monitor would be connected to my computer.

53
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.940
So I could play video games while I work. But, uh,

54
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.140
I don't do that anymore cause I'm a big boy. All right. So if you look up,

55
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.690
you can see that we have the less big monitor, which is still pretty big.

56
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.970
So this one, LG also sent it to me.

57
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.950
It's pretty funny because I told them that I already have the big monitor.

58
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.360
I don't need another monitor,

59
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.430
but they told me that the LG Les big model was actually one of the

60
00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:25.080
software. Engineer's favorite. Let's see more, create better. Do you all knew,

61
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.180
Oh gee, less big monitor,

62
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.700
more space for multitasking because we know you're definitely not working

63
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.230
during quarantine. That's okay. Your secret is safe with us.

64
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.360
Oh gee, Les big monitor. Perfect for quarantine. Anyways.

65
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.320
I think the true beauty of this setup is that when you combine these two

66
00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:50.580
monitors, you get five perfectly sized panels,

67
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.830
20 inches. Yeah.

68
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.630
So five perfectly sized 20 inch panels that you can use for what

69
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.370
ever you want. That's the beauty of it. And that's probably my number one.

70
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.010
Favorite thing about this setup.

71
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.810
My second favorite thing about this setup is right here.

72
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.550
As you can see,

73
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.400
everything is connected via this USB-C cable.

74
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.110
This connects to two of my monitors, my speakers,

75
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.940
my mouse, my keyboard, everything. How did I do that? Well,

76
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:37.230
I'm glad you asked this cable is connected to this easy

77
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.280
GPU, which is extremely overpriced and totally not worth it.

78
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.740
That connects to my two monitors via USB-C and HTMI.

79
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.780
And then the speakers and the USB receivers for my keyboard and mouse would

80
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:56.760
connect to that monitor. So any laptop can immediately connect to all the,

81
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.380
just by using this one USB-C cable.

82
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.640
That's important for me because I have a work laptop and a personal laptop that

83
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:07.730
I talk frequently because I sell crack as a side hustle.

84
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.310
Speaking of crack,

85
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.930
no one in their right minds should buy this EGP view on Lester on something.

86
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.580
This is the black magic EG GPU, and there's nothing magical about it.

87
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.610
The only magic it does is it makes your money disappear.

88
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.370
It's just so expensive. Right?

89
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:30.110
I initially bought it for my Mac mini on this setup so I can record my videos of

90
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.060
me drawing and teaching for Joe mCLASS.

91
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.680
But instead I just bought a gaming computer, which is this one right here.

92
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.600
And it's just so much better. However, it's not all bad. Uh,

93
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:45.530
I did kind of salvage it because my work laptop, I don't know if you can see,

94
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.480
because my, because my work, because my work laptop,

95
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.160
Oh my God. Because my work laptop can't handle the big monitor,

96
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.490
unfortunately. Uh, but with the each GPU, it works great.

97
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.350
And you might ask, why don't you just request a better laptop from your company?

98
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.543
Well, I did.

99
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.090
I asked them for a better laptop and they told me that we will give you a better

100
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:12.260
laptop once you become a better employee. So, um,

101
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.450
so I guess I'll stick with the black magic then.

102
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.010
Okay. What's next? Okay. Yeah. So these are my boast speakers right here.

103
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.000
They're kind of far away.

104
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.620
I literally only bought these Bose speakers for this one thing,

105
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.250
this puck right here. So what this does is you could turn it on,

106
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:34.100
turn it off and then you could adjust the volume like this.

107
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.420
This is the only reason why I bought these speakers because now I can sit back,

108
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.940
relax and adjust the volume like this,

109
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.280
instead of reaching all the way here to adjust the volume and maybe

110
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.840
accidentally pulling my muscle.

111
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.940
My mouse is the MX master three a it has a lot of features

112
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.930
that I don't use.

113
00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.890
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

114
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.420
<v 1>Um, so I'll just say that it's a solid mouse. Okay. And then for my keyboard,</v>

115
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.380
it's just the, uh, Mac keyboard, uh, nothing special.

116
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:14.950
These are the Bose headphones that I got expensed when I worked

117
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:18.970
for Facebook. Um, but they broke, right? The Bluetooth doesn't work.

118
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.590
The only way to make your work is to plug it in to the speakers.

119
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.940
But I don't want to get another one because they don't make them in these colors

120
00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:29.470
anymore. And I love this color,

121
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.030
but unfortunately that means I have to use this wire like a barbarian. So,

122
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.220
Oh, last but not least my chair, this one.

123
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.480
So this is the, uh, Herman Miller M body. Uh,

124
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.160
it's really popular nowadays. Every YouTube has it. Every professional has it.

125
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.750
I think it's pretty good. Um, I don't know if it's worth the price though,

126
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.010
but uh, yeah,

127
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.740
I actually chose the colors so that it matches exactly like the

128
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.180
one on the website. Uh, except one thing though, uh, if you come below,

129
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.570
so as you can see, I pimped my wheels. Uh,

130
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.470
I made them translucent for 80 extra dollars and, um,

131
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.330
that's definitely not worth it. Yeah. All right. So here's something for you,

132
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:17.760
OCD people, if you look closely,

133
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.350
you'll realize that this monitor is a little bit shifted to the left,

134
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.240
maybe by like half an inch.

135
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.130
And also this whole setup is actually not even centered with my

136
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:29.964
art.

137
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.910
It was intentional because it's a metaphor for life that things are not

138
00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:37.130
going to be perfectly aligned for you.

139
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.050
You can never plan for the unexpected and you have to be okay with

140
00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:42.890
imperfection.

141
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.030
Another reason was because I didn't have my ruler with me at the time.

142
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.640
Thank you so much for watching.

143
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:54.080
Just want to say that Joe mCLASS has a lot of new videos with new animations

144
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:58.820
that are really, really cool. And also we just completed the SQL course.

145
00:09:58.821 --> 00:10:01.460
So if you're into data analytics, data science,

146
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:05.930
or even just as a software engineer, SQL course could be for you. All right.

147
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.300
You should check it out@joemclass.com. See ya.
