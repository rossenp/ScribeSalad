00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>So today we are going to see my friend is, um, his name is Aria. He,</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.160
um, he went to my college and you know,

3
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:12.060
he's into startups and he's into engineering also. And, uh, it's been a while.

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:16.590
I haven't seen him. So he reached out to me and, um, he wanted to hang out. So.

5
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.780
<v 1>Yo Joma yo.</v>

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.070
<v 0>Oh man. Oh, and also hate that.</v>

7
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.640
<v 1>[Inaudible] Oh man. Yeah, man.</v>

8
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.980
It's been like what? College? It's crazy. Yeah.

9
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.450
So you still working for Microsoft? Actually,

10
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.620
I run a startup now. Oh, have you gone through series eight yet? Well,

11
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:56.090
actually I'm funding myself with Bitcoins. Oh, nice.

12
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.100
Um, so what about you? Where are you up to? Oh,

13
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.550
I just sold another company. I'm just relaxing.

14
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.880
Now I'm trying to figure out what to do next. Like I always think,

15
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.890
why did VCs always choose my companies? You know,

16
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.960
it's actually a hassle or enough choice too much. Yeah. I mean, yeah,

17
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:16.190
me too. I mean, I totally get that.

18
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.380
Oh, Hey, you still take chats, right? Yeah. I still dabble you're for, uh,

19
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.483
for like a

20
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.460
friendly it's anything but friendly or crush you I'm so rusty,

21
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.520
but I love to love to put you back in the poor house.

22
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.050
I've memorized over 300 openings and practice every day per pass here. Yeah.

23
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.800
Yeah, no, I'm pretty trashed here. Like haven't planned. Wow.

24
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.923
[inaudible]

25
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.950
King scamp it by far my best opening, especially if he accepts it. All right.

26
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.600
I accept you again.

27
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.660
You've activated my trap card.

28
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.920
Little does he know this is my best opening. First I played night F three,

29
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:23.510
then he responsive G five and then quickly each for the duck.

30
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.550
What is this? You thought I played G five. Didn't you? It's the wagon.

31
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.340
Bok opening and unconventional, but dangerous opening.

32
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.560
Much less studied than the classic variation.

33
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.430
I don't mind a little variation like

34
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
[inaudible]

35
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.390
is queen what a blender victory is mine.

36
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.950
Rookie mistake. I guess you haven't improved

37
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.520
on my one more.

38
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.063
[inaudible]

39
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.470
your first employees.

40
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.520
They can either make or break your company for not vine.com.

41
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.060
We have to make sure we hired the right people to build the foundation of our

42
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.120
company. Today. We are joined by my advisor,

43
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.900
Mattoon entrepreneur angel investor, and philanthropist.

44
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.700
He's known to be the Wolf of silicone Valley. All right,

45
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.700
so let's start. So why do you want to work for boring?

46
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.330
Yeah, that works very bold. I like it. Silence is dope.

47
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.670
My parents want me to get out of the house boy,

48
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.120
and I think this is a cool company. So you know,

49
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.380
pretty excited you remember when YouTube had a security hack? Yeah, that was me.

50
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.230
Okay. I am the most qualified person for this job.

51
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.880
I've been studying online video for years between fine Vimeo, YouTube.

52
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.720
I know it all. So what kind of a, so what kind of skills do you have?

53
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.660
I can, uh, write code. Okay. Writing code.

54
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:08.160
I know Java. I took a class in Java and you know,

55
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.120
I get done. Yeah. I guess that's works.

56
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.370
Yeah. There we go. Hmm. Well, this ain't my only two pythons.

57
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.070
My coach seat sharp. My coats, sexy. Sexiest should be rated R like coincide.

58
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.280
I know, but I know basic. And let's go,

59
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.540
what do you want to work on? I want to be the CTO and hallway deal.

60
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.100
I'm good with anything. I'm just really excited to work on that. Mine.

61
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:50.400
I really liked buying. So yeah. Full idea guys.

62
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.020
I want to build North line's infrastructure and wants to be the greatest app all

63
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.860
the time. I want to make sure that whenever anyone is that site,

64
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.950
they're having an experience of a lifetime. I'm not going to hack together.

65
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.690
like windows Vista. All right. So the next question, just a formality.

66
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.670
<v 0>We're going to ask you to do a little bit of a coding.</v>

67
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.290
<v 1>Question. It's quite simple. Um, here's the laptop, basically what it is is, um,</v>

68
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.990
you have to find the missing number out of a one to 108.

69
00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:21.170
Just start writing the code. Do you want me to, do you want me to coat this?

70
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.990
Um, Joma I thought this was just a formality. This is easiest book.

71
00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.730
Do you want me or not? Don't give me this interview. Yeah, that's fine.

72
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.710
Yep. Yep. A boy called Gauss figured this out in 1783.

73
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.250
Um, can I have some water

74
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:05.840
here? Silicon Valley's finest. Well,

75
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.010
that's perfect. That was quick. Pretty good. I mean,

76
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:17.003
let's just get to me.

77
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.200
All right. I think I've done

78
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.100
pretty good. It's. Like what do you mean? I mean, they got the answer, right?

79
00:07:31.101 --> 00:07:33.320
It's going to take a million years to run. Yeah. But like,

80
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.350
look there's comments and stuff like that. It's good documentation, dude.

81
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:40.850
We're done Mark yourself. So they get the job.

82
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.180
<v 0>All right. First son, me. She's amazing. She's the best? The beauty.</v>

83
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:51.130
And so far she's solid when it comes to technical skills. A CTO. Absolutely.

84
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.370
What about Cameron? Cameron? He's a straight shooter.

85
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.560
He knows five languages things the best at Python.

86
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.270
He never makes any mistake straight. Harder. All right. Now, John, no, come on.

87
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.390
No, I mean, he's my friend. I can go all night. I know.

88
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.050
I know his code is not perfect and I know he's may or may not be the smartest

89
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:11.050
guy, but I do think they can add a lot of value to the company.

90
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.880
He does have a lot of heart.

91
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:13.923
<v 1>Right.</v>

92
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:23.500
<v 0>All right. So I guess we're all good. Then let's build not wine.</v>

93
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.100

Cause I realized there isn't any good way for me to announce things permanently.

104
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.660
So I'm going to be using my Facebook page to announce things and I'm going to

head 10,000 subscribers and I did it in one month. All thanks to you guys.
