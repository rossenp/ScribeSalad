<v 0>[Inaudible]</v>

2
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.850
ah, so-so

3
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.460
demo. Ah,

4
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.293
[inaudible].

5
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.690
<v 1>Well, it's popping guys a little bit sick today, but it's okay.</v>

6
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.070
I got sick from Montreal.

7
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.773
<v 0>Uh.</v>

8
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.140
<v 1>Whatever, but, uh, I'm okay. Now just a little bit of cough, you know,</v>

9
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.190
in case you care. But yet today we are moving, as you can see,

10
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:18.050
my room is sleep packed and now we hired some people to move

11
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.380
for us. So, yeah, I'll talk to you later. Uh,

12
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.850
I think I might code later on today, but for now I'm just gonna move and uh,

13
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.050
I'll show you some footage from that.

14
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.910
<v 0>[Inaudible] take a little break.</v>

15
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 1>Almost done packing. It's pretty good. Just gonna take a nap here.</v>

16
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.440
<v 0>Real quick. Alright. Pizza guys</v>

17
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.950
was nice knowing you bumped that, but I think it's time to go.

18
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.640
[inaudible] I'm going to miss you. I've never felt that way for anyone else.

19
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.360
I love you from the bottom of my heart.

20
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.140
It's time for me to move on. It's time for you to move on to

21
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.180
always be my favorite bed frame.

22
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.103
It's kind of dirty though.

23
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.300
<v 1>All right. What's up guys. So welcome to my new place. Now.</v>

24
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:39.720
I don't want to show you everything yet because I want to keep it as a surprise,

25
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:44.100
make another video about it also haven't decorated yet, so, okay.

26
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.890
I'll wait until I'm done. But today we are doing some coding.

27
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.170
We didn't continue on our, on our web app. If you haven't seen the first video,

28
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:02.070
which was like some JavaScript title that I put I'll put in the link in the

29
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:02.730
description,

30
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.270
but you could check that out first and then I'll continue doing my web app

31
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.450
today, but that's cool. Oh yeah. Before I start,

32
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:13.770
I just wanted to tell you that the video that I'm putting here as a template is

33
00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.870
that it's done by someone I really admire his name is [inaudible] and

34
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:22.860
he makes awesome cinematography videos. And uh, yeah,

35
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:25.890
I just want to shout him out, go check his channel, uh,

36
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.630
link in the description below.

37
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.920
He makes amazing videos and I aspire to become like him. Yeah.

38
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.240
Check them out. All right. Cool. So let's start, uh,

39
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.710
let's pull up the stuff that I had before. Okay, cool.

40
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.760
So,

41
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.080
so what I want to do now is I want to add socket IO because that's how I'm going

42
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:49.710
to communicate with the server. So what I'm going to do,

43
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.740
I'm just going to go to socket.io. Now socket.io is pretty cool.

44
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:56.670
It's basically like a,

45
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.710
like a library that wraps around the web socket technology.

46
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.780
If you don't know what web sockets are,

47
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:07.520
it's basically just a ongoing TCP connection from the client and the

48
00:06:07.521 --> 00:06:10.460
server, like instead of HTTPS,

49
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:14.930
where it has to open a whole TCP connection. Every time it sends a request,

50
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.740
this one keeps it TCP connection and it will send back and forth.

51
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.730
So basically the advantage of that is that the server can push information

52
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.290
rather than the client having to request information from the server every time.

53
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.750
So instead of doing a polling mechanism,

54
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.380
the server can just push information to the client.

55
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.300
So if you don't know what TCP is, don't worry about it.

56
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.230
You'll learn it at school. It's like a basic network thing. So,

57
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:44.510
yeah. All right. Let's see. Okay.

58
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.330
Now the first thing I'll do read a little bit of docs.

59
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

60
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.110
<v 1>Yeah. So first of all, got it.</v>

61
00:06:56.111 --> 00:07:00.670
Install socket IO. Okay.

62
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.713
It's copied us.

63
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.313
<v 0>Number.</v>

64
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.280
<v 1>Done. All right. Okay. Check it out.</v>

65
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.740
Save it in package us Jason that's C socket. All right, cool.

66
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:23.500
I have it version two point. Oh, that's good.

67
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.850
So I have to change the server code a little bit because

68
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.320
right now is just express and basically I have to add socket IO.

69
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.350
So let me do that real quick. Do a little bit of a change.

70
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:45.190
<v 0>Okay. Take this off and then, okay.</v>

71
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.530
Perfect. All right. So I have this.

72
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.650
<v 1>Perfect. And now I'm got to add the.</v>

73
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.530
<v 0>Addie IO, which is the library,</v>

74
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.800
the athlete HTTP library.

75
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.263
Okay.

76
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.280
Let me just copy this.

77
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.850
<v 1>All right. Now we are going to add the same thing, but their front end. Um,</v>

78
00:08:18.851 --> 00:08:22.600
I'm going to have to download the socket IO JavaScript.

79
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:34.810
<v 0>Oh.</v>

80
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.320
<v 1>Okay. Finally I found the down button. There it is. Okay, cool.</v>

81
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.100
So let's see how we do to fund that. Let me weakness.

82
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.820
<v 0>Did you do up there?</v>

83
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:51.550
<v 1>Okay. All right. So another thing for you guys, for some people who are like,</v>

84
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.170
Oh my God, man, you keep searching up. Oh my God, dude, what you know,

85
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.660
can't you don't you know about heart and stuff like that. Yeah.

86
00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.840
So I just want to tell you, uh, if you don't like me searching things,

87
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:02.850
because I'm just trying to be realistic here. You know,

88
00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.990
I just want to show you how I code, you know, I might not be the best colder.

89
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.490
So if you don't like it,

90
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.260
you can go find another YouTuber that would teach you web sockets.

91
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.500
So just saying, all right, anyways,

92
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.690
so I'm going to copy this code snippet.

93
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.660
I'll get a copy of this code snippet, uh, added to the front end.

94
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.650
All right. Frank code done. That's cool.

95
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:32.400
So we got WebSockets on dope. So now, uh,

96
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.350
I am just going to use that web socket and put events on the clicking on

97
00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:38.040
the play,

98
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.300
clicking on the paws and clicking on the timeline so that we can send these

99
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:46.230
events back to the server using the web sockets.

100
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.520
So I'm going to do that right now.

101
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.093
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.620
<v 1>All right, cool. So here we go. Now,</v>

103
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:38.150
every time I press play, it's sensitive to the server. As you can see it,

104
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:41.240
press play every time I press pause, it says, pause.

105
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.300
<v 0>Pause, play, pause, play, pause, play.</v>

106
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.220
<v 1>So as you can see, when I click the progress bar, I get the number basically.</v>

107
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:49.610
Um,

108
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.940
this is like how many minutes or how many seconds into the video I'm clicking

109
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:56.900
to. So if it's at the beginning, it's like zero. And then if I click at the end,

110
00:10:56.901 --> 00:11:01.490
it's like 47. So 47 seconds. All right, there you go.

111
00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:06.200
So now the player is connected to the server, so that's cool.

112
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.110
Um, so I'm done for now. Uh,

113
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:13.760
I'm not going to do anything more because it's already been five, 10 minutes.

114
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.510
So I hope you liked that. And I'm going to continue doing this on each blog.

115
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.140
You know, maybe whenever I want to code and stuff, hope you liked this video.

116
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.950
If you enjoyed it,

117
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.660
don't forget to smash that like button and also subscribe and press the bell

118
00:11:26.661 --> 00:11:28.790
