00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.090
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.410
<v 1>Well, it's popping. So today we are going to talk about internships. Yes.</v>

3
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.470
We talk about this all the time, but I love playing him on it.

4
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.720
So today we are going to talk about what are the top 10 software engineering

5
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:31.310
internships you can get. Now, top internship is really subjective. You know,

6
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:34.010
some people like, for example, Apple over Google,

7
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:35.690
some people like Google over Apple,

8
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.940
so you don't really know it's kind of subjective.

9
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.860
And also there's a lot of things to consider like salary, uh, benefits, uh,

10
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.510
prestige, you know,

11
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:49.280
some people it's all about the respect your parent is all about and then how

12
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.450
much you'll learn.

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.290
And then also the team and also the technology that they use.

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.290
Some people care about that. Some people don't. So, you know,

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.070
so it's kind of hard to consolidate all these together and come up with good

16
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:02.840
answer until now.

17
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.520
So there's this guy in Waterloo that scraped LinkedIn, you know,

18
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.610
scraped the whole website, looked at all. You want to lose students.

19
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.290
And basically what he did is he looks at every single student and their history

20
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:19.670
of internships that he did now, Waterloo makes you do six internships.

21
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.770
So basically he made an assumption that your last internship

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.310
is better than your before last internship. So for example,

23
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:32.540
if their first internship was Google and then their next internship was Apple,

24
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.470
he would deem Apple better than Google. Now that's just one person.

25
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.690
So he did that with everyone. You know,

26
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:43.220
he did that with every single year Waterloo kid and basically gave an ELO score

27
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.690
to every one of these companies.

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.070
So now I'm just going to use this website and I'm going to sort it by designable

29
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:50.900
score. Before I go into the top town,

30
00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:53.480
let me just show you what this site is all about. Uh, this,

31
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.200
I think the site is kind of down now and I kind of just kept a copy for myself.

32
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.550
So, so here's what it looks like. As you can see, every row is a person.

33
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.820
So if you search Citadel, uh, you know,

34
00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:08.060
you see that this guy went to ClearBridge associate,

35
00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.860
then TD securities then Citadel.

36
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.470
So that means to do that would be better than all of these companies.

37
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.040
And in code connect would be better than Citadel. Oh, that's me.

38
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.850
That's actually me. I guess that data wasn't very, um, updated.

39
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.350
I can clearly say that Citadel is better than Scotiabank by far

40
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.640
anyway. So this is what it looks like. And then when you aggregate all of this,

41
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.950
you get this with ELO. Uh, I don't know why we can't sort,

42
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:35.360
I mean, usually you can sort by,

43
00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:39.800
I think it's because the person then they probably didn't do the department.

44
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.560
Didn't scrape the JavaScript. So I have like an old version.

45
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.160
So what we're going to do is we're just going to copy all of that.

46
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.670
And like, as a true data scientist, I'm just going to use Excel. You know,

47
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:55.520
I was thinking like maybe parsing it or something, but screw that.

48
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.250
I'm just going to use Excel because it seems like it's well formatted.

49
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:02.530
So all right. Company name, copy, open up Excel.

50
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.220
And uh, okay, cool. And then put a filter here,

51
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.630
filter and then sort D sending.

52
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.350
So I'm not going to tell you, which is first yet,

53
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:18.640
so I'm going to blur it out here.

54
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.820
I'm just going to blurt a top 10 and as you can see, okay.

55
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.720
Maybe I'll start from the bottom, you know, so you guys know spoilers. So,

56
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:26.554
you know, for example,

57
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.810
EA is ranked number 24 and he got squared number 22 and then Bloomberg

58
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.130
21, you could see it sorted by ELO score. Yeah. And then, okay,

59
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:40.750
I'm going to blur out the top. Ooh. The top 10 makes a lot of sense. All right,

60
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.480
let's start. Number 10. We have

61
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.610
Microsoft. You still working for Microsoft.

62
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.410
<v 2>So you still working for Microsoft.</v>

63
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.480
<v 1>So yeah. Um, Microsoft is still pretty good then, you know, as not bad, uh,</v>

64
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.370
not going to lie. Microsoft is a pretty good company.

65
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.200
It's just that for me or for my, some of my friends,

66
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:08.160
we just like to joke around that Microsoft is like a company that's like a low

67
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:10.950
tier company, but it's not. Microsoft is a great company.

68
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.130
The only reason that we do that is because we have to make fun of one company.

69
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.310
And Microsoft is so big such that if I make fun of them,

70
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.220
they wouldn't care because I'm so small. But yeah,

71
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.420
this is great because I'm able to talk about Microsoft. Okay.

72
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.320
So Microsoft is known to have pretty easy interviews.

73
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.330
I have done their interview for software engineering and for program

74
00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:34.080
manager.

75
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.290
And I would like to say that their software engineering interview was pretty

76
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:38.640
easy. I pass in one shot.

77
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.150
So the software engineering interview is quite simple for me.

78
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.690
At least they came to Waterloo and I had two interviews back to back.

79
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:48.900
And then after those two interviews, they'll say you get the internship or not.

80
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.620
So the first question I got was a little bit of a design question with like

81
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:56.040
databases or like infrastructure. Basically what they're saying is that,

82
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.470
you know,

83
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.550
if you send a certain message to a certain server and they have to send it back

84
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:02.580
and stuff like that, but what if, if like those messages get lost,

85
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:04.950
what would you do for fault tolerance and stuff like that?

86
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.750
So a little bit of a design question.

87
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.400
And then the second question is super easy link list. Question is stuff like,

88
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.960
uh, can you find out if the link list has a loop or something like that,

89
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:19.290
and that is there another way you can do it. I'm not going to go over details,

90
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.990
but basically it's two questions. All right.

91
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:26.670
Second thing I want to talk about is the salary. Um, for me,

92
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.610
I think the salary for me was like $7,000 a month.

93
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.570
And then you get sick housing. Uh, actually housing is kind of a gamble.

94
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:36.720
Sometimes you might get better housing sometimes not because they just put

95
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:40.260
interns everywhere. For me, I was able to go into like a hotel.

96
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.290
I think it was like the Hyatt hotel. And it was pretty dope.

97
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.900
Cause you got made service every single day. So yes,

98
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.480
the benefits were pretty good. All right.

99
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:50.850
Let me double check the salary real quick, Microsoft. Yeah.

100
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.690
So Microsoft has $7,200 per month,

101
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.300
and then they give you 1,300 for housing or you choose their corporate housing,

102
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.370
obviously choose a corporate housing cause it's way better, but a yeah, 7,200.

103
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.120
This that that's not bad. That's not bad. Um, yeah, I'll show you at the end,

104
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.350
the list, like the salary list and later on, but I don't want to,

105
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.610
you gotta stay through this whole video, just check it out. All right, cool.

106
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:21.380
Onto the next one on the list. Number nine, it is Yelp.

107
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.640
I had an interview of Yelp for software engineering and their interview.

108
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:30.080
I would rate it a bit harder than Microsoft. You know, I pass in one shot too,

109
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.320
but they had a lot of interviews. Okay. I think onsite,

110
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:38.210
I had two onsite interviews and then two full interviews later to confirm

111
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:42.920
that I wasn't, you know, just lucky and very standard interview questions.

112
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:45.770
And then, uh, they also look at your projects a little bit.

113
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.510
So I think what I showed them is I showed down a project that you could sync

114
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.870
watching YouTube together. They were pretty impressed by that.

115
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.390
And then a lot of like normal questions,

116
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.150
normal like algorithm questions that you would get on Nico.

117
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.870
So then the phone screen is also just coding. You know that you go on code pad,

118
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.670
they asked you a question and then you code it.

119
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.450
So I think their interview process is a little bit harder and they don't accept

120
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:11.960
like that many people. All right, let's talk about the salary.

121
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.710
So Yelp is $7,600 per month,

122
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.930
plus $1,500 for housing. If you don't do corporate housing, that is pretty good.

123
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:22.670
I think Yelp is your position.

124
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.880
You hired them like Google and Microsoft because they're a little bit smaller.

125
00:07:25.881 --> 00:07:29.210
So they have to stay competitive by giving you more money. So yeah.

126
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:33.800
So salary is pretty good. And then prestige. Um, yeah,

127
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:38.420
I think Yelp is pretty much mid tier, like, okay, honestly, don't,

128
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.950
don't take my words for granted,

129
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.250
but I'm just like comparing to all the next ones that we're going to see.

130
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.740
But Yelp Yelp is like not like super high tier,

131
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.880
but it's also not like super low tier. It's kind of like with Microsoft,

132
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:54.620
same level as Microsoft in terms of like prestige in terms of how much you're

133
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:59.120
going to get next company is Pinterest. Uh,

134
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:02.420
to be honest, I don't know why this isn't higher. Uh,

135
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:06.050
it might be just variants to be honest because there aren't that many people

136
00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:09.710
that got into Pinterest because the total number of students that got there,

137
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:14.000
or like at least scraped it, it was only seven. I do think that, uh,

138
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.610
Pinterest is pretty high up there cause um, I heard from a lot of people, uh,

139
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.370
Pinterest is like one of the smartest companies.

140
00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:23.990
Like every time you go to Pinterest, people say like,

141
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:26.330
well I've worked with like the smartest people. So yeah,

142
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.420
I think Pinterest should be a little bit higher up. It might be just parents,

143
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.420
like I said. Um, okay. Let's check Pinterest. Ooh.

144
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.290
So how hard is the interview? Uh, I don't know.

145
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.170
I actually don't have a cause I've never interviewed with Pinterest,

146
00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:41.780
so I wouldn't know. So I can't tell you that. Okay.

147
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.250
And then how good the salary is. Alright, you ready?

148
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.050
The salary is $9,000 a month and then

149
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.090
$3,000 for housing.

150
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.630
So that makes it like $12,000 a month. Isn't that crazy?

151
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.780
So yeah, so definitely because of the salary,

152
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.870
people do want to work at Pinterest. Right?

153
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.570
Next company I have here in fusion. Hm.

154
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.470
I'm actually not familiar with this company. Let me Google it real quick.

155
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.980
Or maybe it is a really good company. I don't know, but I don't have, I mean,

156
00:09:15.981 --> 00:09:17.750
if you guys know, please comment below if you know,

157
00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:19.490
infusion and what their reputation is,

158
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.740
but I don't quite know because there's a lot of,

159
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.920
there's a lot of other good companies that didn't make the list. Uh,

160
00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:27.950
I'll give you some spoilers. Amazon did not make the top 10.

161
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.310
LinkedIn did not make the top 10 square did not make the top 10,

162
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.510
but they're all super good companies. It's possible that a lot of smart people,

163
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.930
they got into these companies and then did you scum board?

164
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.290
So they want to work for startups and then it will decrease their yellow.

165
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.670
That's just how it works. But yeah. All right. Company number six. Ooh.

166
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.110
Speaking of Amazon,

167
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.010
I wonder if you can guess which one does is so company number six,

168
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.450
it is a nine.com. So in case you guys don't know what a nine.com is,

169
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.830
subsidiary of Amazon a nine. I think it's more of like the research focus part,

170
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.120
the more data driven part.

171
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:07.010
So I think they do like a lot of the search functionality of Amazon

172
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.380
and all the hard stuff, the hard problems.

173
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.920
So I had an interview of a nine actually twice actually,

174
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.990
and I got rejected twice. So the first time, um,

175
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.860
yeah, I'm not going to lie. I think it was pretty hard. Um,

176
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.330
I don't remember what the question was,

177
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.810
but I think it was related to dynamic programming and I think it took me some

178
00:10:26.811 --> 00:10:30.740
time to write it and then they also have like a design question. Uh,

179
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.000
I think it's like something related to like either horizontally scaling or very

180
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.970
creased scaling. I think it was like a distributed question,

181
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.130
but basically I didn't do so well.

182
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:44.090
And then the second time I got the same interviewer and I think I did well

183
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:47.330
because like, it was the same question, but they still didn't take me.

184
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.270
So I think it's because I was being a Dick. I was like, yeah,

185
00:10:50.271 --> 00:10:53.180
I was there before. Yeah. Whatever, you know, I think,

186
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.140
I think they just didn't like me. So, so how good is the salary?

187
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.150
Let me check. Oh, well then again, I wouldn't know, cause I didn't get the job,

188
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.190
so, but let's look at Amazon.

189
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:08.360
So Amazon gives you $7,600 a month and

190
00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:12.560
$2,500. So that's pretty average. So I guess it's average,

191
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.740
average salary. I don't think it would be much different from Amazon.

192
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:17.180
So I think that's,

193
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.950
that's a good estimate of what 89 interns would get 7,600.

194
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.920
Okay. And then in terms of prestige,

195
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.210
it's kind of similar to like it's like Yelp and it's like above Yelp and

196
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:32.120
Microsoft definitely, definitely below Pinterest.

197
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.570
So I think that's the prestige level, especially in Waterloo.

198
00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:40.490
Like it's pretty good, but it's not like, Whoa, Oh, number five,

199
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.620
Google classic, Google. I mean,

200
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.960
everyone loves so work at Google.

201
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.650
A lot of like really smart people can get through Google early on,

202
00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.200
but they also like to come to Google at the end because the company is so big.

203
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.670
You can choose which team to go in.

204
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.490
Some people like to work for this very specific team at Google.

205
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.870
Some people sometimes if you're not like super great at programming or you're

206
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:05.770
not like a prodigy,

207
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:09.130
but you can still get to Google because they're so big such that they accept a

208
00:12:09.131 --> 00:12:14.050
lot of interns. So prestige level, I would say pretty high, you know?

209
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.300
Uh, but nowadays it's getting more and more easy to get into Google. And uh,

210
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.410
so I think that's what your values decreasing in terms of like Waterloo

211
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.160
internships. So the interview varies a lot.

212
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:29.020
So it really depends what your interviewer is.

213
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.250
I personally never gone to Google. Um, I, yeah, I did.

214
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.280
I did a few interviews. I choked,

215
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.900
not a lot of like dynamic programming questions or anything.

216
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.950
Some of them can be simple. I heard some of them can be hard. It really depends.

217
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.210
So a lot of variance there now the salary is pretty,

218
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.020
to be honest. Uh,

219
00:12:48.021 --> 00:12:50.860
I think the reason they can do that is because everyone loves Google.

220
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.480
So they pay you $6,600 per month and then maybe

221
00:12:55.481 --> 00:13:00.250
$3,000 for housing per month. So that makes it maybe 9,600. But yeah,

222
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.060
their base salary isn't that great because it's only 6,600.

223
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.870
So yeah. And then my friends who worked at Google,

224
00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:11.530
they said it was pretty chill. Uh, to be honest, they don't work that hard.

225
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:14.650
And even once you're full time, uh, if you don't want to,

226
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.540
you could go in teams that don't work really,

227
00:13:16.541 --> 00:13:20.290
really hard and up a Google is really good to work there because later on,

228
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.170
you know, you have a super comfortable life company, number four,

229
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.830
Facebook, Facebook. Oh Facebook. So yeah,

230
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.830
I've never worked as a software engineer at Facebook.

231
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:38.230
Can I even say that my friends who worked at Facebook said they loved it.

232
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.410
You know, they have a great campus, beautiful campus, uh,

233
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.640
lots of prestige kind of. Yeah. But it's getting bigger.

234
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.550
And once a company gets bigger,

235
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.250
obviously they lose prestige and stuff like that. But, uh, yeah.

236
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.230
So the salary for Facebook interns for software engineering is $8,000

237
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:00.310
and $1,000 for housing. So in total $9,000,

238
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.190
I'm surprised actually that's quite, that's quite low for housing.

239
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:07.990
And then Facebook is really good because when you come back as a returning

240
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:10.030
intern, if you do really well,

241
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.780
you get more stocks and like bonus and stuff like that. So on average,

242
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.460
according to this chart is like $107,000 salary.

243
00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.560
You get about $37,500 of stocks per year.

244
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:28.690
And then your bonus can vary from 75,000 to a hundred thousand dollars

245
00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:31.810
in bonus that that means your first year, you just boom,

246
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:35.500
a hundred thousand dollars right. In your bank account. So yeah.

247
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.610
So that puts Facebook on number four and then number three.

248
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:44.010
<v 3>Is Twitter.</v>

249
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.890
<v 1>All right. So Twitter is number three.</v>

250
00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.380
Twitter is surprisingly not that high in terms of salary.

251
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.480
I'll talk about that later. How hard is the interview?

252
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.680
I remember interviewing for Twitter for software engineering or data science.

253
00:14:57.681 --> 00:15:01.820
I don't remember. And I had a phone screen and with that phone screen I fell.

254
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.530
So I'm guessing Twitter's pretty hard, you know, cause I felt the phone screen,

255
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.530
but, but then again, you know, maybe I just suck. So,

256
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.300
but according to other people, I think Twitter's is also pretty average. Um,

257
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.980
I don't see a lot of people getting into Twitter. So I think Twitter is pretty,

258
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.490
like pretty difficult in terms of like the interview, not super, super hard,

259
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:25.490
but also not, you know, not super easy, but yeah.

260
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.410
So that's how hard the interview is.

261
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.780
So I can't really tell you anything about that. Uh,

262
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.220
default screen that I had was a dynamic programming question that I screwed up.

263
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.870
How good is the salary? The salary is pretty, actually it's $6,500 per month.

264
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.340
And they give you $2,000 for housing or maybe they have corporate housing.

265
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.860
I'm not sure. Yeah. And then prestige, I think it's,

266
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.650
I think it's pretty up there. Um, I mean,

267
00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:50.750
for some reasons they're losing popularity nowadays.

268
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:54.560
I mean also this list is kind of old, but yeah, Twitter's losing popularity.

269
00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:57.890
So maybe not that much. All right. Number two.

270
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.480
Okay. So I realize I've been doing this wrong. This should be number one.

271
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.320
So I started number 10, but I realized my Excel sheet. It starts at one,

272
00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.920
but then the first row of my cell sheet, it says company name.

273
00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.660
So that means I included the Heather, but okay.

274
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:18.230
So for the number one company I will choose, I would choose one company.

275
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.470
I don't have all of these. And then yeah.

276
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.990
So it's basically gentleman's first company. Alright. Anyways.

277
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.850
So number two company is

278
00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.570
Palentier technologies. Oh, I,

279
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:37.310
I think Palentier is actually the coolest company because I've tried so many

280
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:40.520
times getting into pond here and I still haven't gotten in yet.

281
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.750
So the first time I had an interview was when I was, uh,

282
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.610
when I was freshman year,

283
00:16:46.611 --> 00:16:51.260
actually I got really lucky because like I talked to this guy and he just gave a

284
00:16:51.261 --> 00:16:53.750
talk about Palentier and he was from Montreal and I was like, Oh, me too.

285
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:55.190
I'm from Montreal. And then, you know,

286
00:16:55.191 --> 00:16:59.210
he was nice enough to give me an interview. And then I got the phone screen.

287
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.570
The phone screen was actually pretty hard. It was um, well, I don't know,

288
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.680
at least I think it was pretty hard.

289
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.450
It was like print a binary search tree in order or

290
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:11.000
something like that or like left to right. And that was like, Oh, easy.

291
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.620
I wrote that recursion. And then he's like, all right,

292
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.730
now I'll do it with file recursion. I'm like Nani. And then yeah.

293
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.580
So basically you had to, you know, you,

294
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:22.460
you just had to make a stack kind of like a, kind of like a recursion stack,

295
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.030
but basically you just have to make a stack. You had to loop it in and Dan,

296
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:30.560
you pop the stack until there's no more things to pop. Um, you could search,

297
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.340
find a research treat in order to traverse. So, uh,

298
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.000
without recursion and you'll find it. And that's exactly what I did.

299
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.140
So it was a phone screen. Right. And then what I did was, um,

300
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.370
I secretly Googled the answer and went to the week of Peter Page and saw the

301
00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.770
pseudo code. And then I just looked at it and said, Oh wait,

302
00:17:49.771 --> 00:17:53.670
I think I understand. And I just wrote the code perfectly for them. Yeah.

303
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.270
So that's that, that's how I got past it.

304
00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.690
But then after that I went onsite and then the guy talked to me,

305
00:18:00.691 --> 00:18:02.820
he looked at my resume. He's like, how the did this guy get in?

306
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:06.750
And then he asked me like a design question and yeah, I,

307
00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:09.480
I just screwed up because I didn't know anything back then. I was just a kid.

308
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.520
So I didn't know anything about different structure.

309
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:15.360
I only knew about algorithms. So yeah. So I got killed. Hmm. Okay.

310
00:18:15.361 --> 00:18:16.500
It's not that great. So yeah,

311
00:18:16.501 --> 00:18:20.970
the salary is $7,500 per month flat,

312
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.000
that's it? And then you have to pay for your own housing and stuff like that.

313
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.210
So it's not the best. I think this company has a lot of prestige,

314
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.530
especially back then everyone was wearing these like dope pass black sweaters by

315
00:18:31.531 --> 00:18:35.790
Palentier. And everyone felt really cool working. They're not going to lie.

316
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.240
It was a little bit cultish, according to some white friends, but in a good way.

317
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:43.650
So yeah. And I remember, um, people telling me that their food was amazing.

318
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:46.500
They have like salmon, you know, like a really nice grilled salmon.

319
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:51.180
They have like really good chefs to make food. They have massages, you know,

320
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.560
at their campus. So yeah.

321
00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:56.640
So they usually have things like four deployed engineers and normal software

322
00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:59.640
engineers and stuff like that for deployed is pretty cool because it means you

323
00:18:59.641 --> 00:19:04.140
get to travel and you get to, you get to talk with clients and then,

324
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.420
you know, fix their or whatever. But yeah,

325
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.840
it's a really cool company and makes you feel really bad because they're like

326
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.500
gods with data. That's basically what Palentier is. Yeah.

327
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:14.363
For those who don't know,

328
00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:18.090
Palentier technology is basically like a data consulting company.

329
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.800
Like they don't say they're a consulting company.

330
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.660
They say they're a technology company. But in the end,

331
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.800
I think they're a consulting company.

332
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.880
What'd they do is like they help the government like check out with somewhat bin

333
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.270
Ladin. They help, um, they help like some,

334
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.090
some government stuff to like track down disease and stuff like that.

335
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:37.140
They probably like do a lot of sketchy stuff that we don't know about because

336
00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:38.520
they're like, there's just really good data.

337
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.110
They help hospitals and stuff like that for,

338
00:19:41.111 --> 00:19:45.420
for processing and analyzing their data. What else? Something more interesting.

339
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.040
Or they help a lot of hedge funds and banks do some financial stuff that we

340
00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:54.050
can't talk about because they're so sick. Good. All right. So number one,

341
00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:00.500
according to my spreadsheet. It's company name. Yeah. All right.

342
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.600
Let me just look at the one that pays the most.

343
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.400
I will say that they're number one. I'm good.

344
00:20:07.401 --> 00:20:11.900
There's a lot. Wait where's Jane street. Oh no, no. Jane Shree is not here.

345
00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:15.410
Wait. Yeah. I don't know. Okay. So Jane street should be here,

346
00:20:15.411 --> 00:20:17.300
but I guess it's not anymore,

347
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.360
but you could kind of know where I'm going with this. Okay. And it was,

348
00:20:20.361 --> 00:20:21.290
I'll just choose this one.

349
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.740
I don't really want to choose it because my brother worked there and I don't

350
00:20:24.741 --> 00:20:29.330
want him to feel proud of him. Oh, okay. it. I'll just choose it. All right.

351
00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:34.100
So the number one company is two Sigma

352
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.680
for you guys who don't know two Sigma is a hedge fund. It's a,

353
00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:41.780
it's a very quantitative based hedge fund.

354
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.560
Meaning they use a lot of tech and to use a lot of numbers to kind of like

355
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.390
decide on what stocks to trade or what commodities to trade and stuff like that.

356
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:51.940
So they're known to be pretty techie.

357
00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:56.320
They don't like the finance kind of vibe or like finance culture. Uh,

358
00:20:56.350 --> 00:21:00.440
people are not like jocks there. People are like pretty cool. Like basic.

359
00:21:00.441 --> 00:21:03.670
It looks like it looks like a typical tech company when I went there and

360
00:21:03.671 --> 00:21:05.770
visited. So the reason why I chose this,

361
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:10.720
because the pretty high salary it's $10,400 a month.

362
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.750
And then they give you $5,000 for relocation.

363
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.220
And then they give you $5,000 per month for housing. What the?

364
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.540
Holy. That's crazy. That's more than how much I make as a full-time.

365
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.840
Uh. But yeah. And the bonuses I heard, they're crazy. Like,

366
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.310
why don't you work there? Full-time bonuses are amazing. And uh, yeah,

367
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.120
you wouldn't believe it.

368
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.080
So basically all of these finance companies should be here. Uh,

369
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.880
in case you guys don't know it's not FinTech because FinTech means a technology

370
00:21:42.881 --> 00:21:44.830
company that is about financial products.

371
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.610
Like they help you manage your portfolio, but that's not it,

372
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.180
they use tech so that they can, uh,

373
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.300
so that they can grab a ton of data and then just make a lot of money,

374
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.970
the stock market or whatever that they trade.

375
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.910
So it's totally different than FinTech technologies,

376
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.240
but you can't compare it to like, like Robin hood, you know,

377
00:22:04.241 --> 00:22:09.130
it's not the same thing, but yeah. So two Sigma Citadel Jane street, um, like,

378
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:14.290
um, Cisco HANA S SIQ notice on Cisco HANA,

379
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.810
uh, Renaissance technology. Actually,

380
00:22:16.811 --> 00:22:19.120
we can't talk about Renaissance technologies because that's just that another

381
00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:23.380
level. So we, that just like, we don't understand what to do, but yeah.

382
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:25.030
So all of these are really,

383
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:30.010
really good hedge funds and they probably pay the most compared

384
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:33.220
to like other tech companies. So, yeah. All right.

385
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:37.480
So now let me talk about, um, Oh wait, so yeah.

386
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.120
So two Sigma prestige hella. Hi,

387
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.300
it's funny because it wasn't that high before when my brother started,

388
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.210
I remember me telling my friends like, Oh, my brother works at two 78.

389
00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.420
They're like, what the is that? I'm like, Oh, it's a finance company. It's like,

390
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:53.080
Oh, finance is a banker or something like, no,

391
00:22:53.081 --> 00:22:56.230
it's not a banker as a qualitative researcher. But anyways,

392
00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.480
two Sigma was not really popular, but nowadays,

393
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.230
because of the emergence of all these finance companies,

394
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:04.030
and then they realized like, Holy, they pay a lot.

395
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.650
It got the attention of the solver engineers. So, so yeah.

396
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.910
So now prestige definitely high prestige. Uh, people love to Sigma.

397
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.530
They think it's, they think is like the best thing since sliced bread. So yeah.

398
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.750
Pretty good. Alright.

399
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.490
And interview is probably super hard if it's the same or if it's similar to the

400
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:27.250
full-time interview, a lot of probably questions,

401
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.070
a lot of quantitative questions, a lot of statistics questions,

402
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.240
a lot of brain teasers, lots of hearts. Yes. Questions. I mean, I don't know.

403
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.060
I never got an interview from them, so I wouldn't know. But yeah,

404
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.070
that's what I heard. Um,

405
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.950
there were a lot of companies that did not make the top 10 list.

406
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.680
Don't know why probably because we just don't have that much data. Um,

407
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.110
like I said, this, this set is not super,

408
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:51.260
super good because it's still kind of hacky,

409
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.670
but let me tell you a few companies that I think deserves, you know,

410
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.930
to share the number one spot. One of them is Snapchat. Of course, come on.

411
00:23:59.931 --> 00:24:03.440
Snapchat is great. Snapchat, such a great company. It's also an LA.

412
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.870
So that's pretty dope. They have a New York office too.

413
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.930
They paid $10,000 a month. So I think Snapchat is really good.

414
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.950
Cora Cora is extremely hard to get in really smart people.

415
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.330
They pay $8,300 a month and then let's see Twitch.

416
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.950
Twitch is super fun. You know,

417
00:24:18.951 --> 00:24:21.200
you get to get to watch people play games all day,

418
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.170
and then they pay you $7,400 a month.

419
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.910
And then Airbnb, Airbnb is really good too.

420
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:33.770
They pay $7,000 a month plus corporate housing and they give you some Airbnb

421
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:38.600
credit. Super cool entered. Dog-friendly uh, one of my friends,

422
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.160
yeah. One of my friends interned there and he got to bring his dog every day.

423
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.870
Let's see. Oh, Stripe is really good. Stripe is a really good $7,000 a month.

424
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.830
Plus corporate housing. Definitely good company. It's about payments.

425
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.030
Let's see, Dropbox. Of course, Dropbox is really good.

426
00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.740
I'm surprised they're their salary solo $6,300 per month

427
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:02.720
plus $5,000 housing. Oh,

428
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.710
I guess the $5,000 housing is pretty good or corporate housing,

429
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:11.120
but I don't think any corporate housing would be $5,000. Maybe that's total.

430
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.960
I'm not sure. So yeah. Yeah. That's pretty much it.

431
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:18.350
I think these companies are definitely really, really good.

432
00:25:18.351 --> 00:25:22.190
So if ever you have the opportunities to, to work there, definitely do it.

433
00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.560
And yeah, if ever you guys are, you know,

434
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.920
inundated by offers from all these companies and you find it really,

435
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:29.930
really hard to choose, well,

436
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:34.610
I'm going to link you guys the salary for all of these internships and

437
00:25:34.611 --> 00:25:39.320
also the site that gives you like the ELO and then you could kind of compare and

438
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:42.380
see which one's better than which well, so yeah,

439
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:43.910
I hope that was interesting for you guys.

440
00:25:43.911 --> 00:25:48.020
I hope that was useful and a happy job hunting does.
