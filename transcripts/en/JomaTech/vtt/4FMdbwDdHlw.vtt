00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.931
<v 0>In your opinion,</v>

2
00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:04.590
what are some of the best soft skills to have at a large tech company and why?

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.970
<v 1>That is a good question. Um,</v>

4
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.920
what's popping guys.

5
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.970
<v 0>Hey, all right. Today I am very, very excited for this video.</v>

6
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.880
Why is because we finally got sponsored?

7
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.580
So this video is gonna be sponsored by blue apron,

8
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:40.670
as you can see the delicious food as laid out. All right.

9
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:42.590
So blue apron is a meal kit service,

10
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.820
and I'm so excited because finally I can make healthy food for myself because

11
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:50.300
you know me, I always go out and eat pokey bowls. Or when I cook,

12
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.170
it looks like this.

13
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.093
<v 1>Huh?</v>

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.010
<v 0>Oh my God. That's pretty disgusting. But yeah,</v>

15
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.090
so I'm very excited and I get to eat all this free food.

16
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.570
And another reason why I'm super happy about this is that, you know,

17
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.780
they make really delicious and healthy food. And since you know,

18
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:09.740
I'm getting jacked,

19
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.360
this is perfect for me and an something for you guys.

20
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.220
The first 50 people to sign up will get $50 off your first two

21
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:21.230
weeks of blue apron, which is great.

22
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.520
It makes it pretty much like as cheap as buying groceries. Okay. All right.

23
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.660
Can you, can you come in and we have a special guest today.

24
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.510
We got the girl at three Oh four.

25
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.910
<v 1>Her name.</v>

26
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.130
<v 0>Is Ariel. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?</v>

27
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.540
<v 1>I'm a software engineer. I just graduated college 2017.</v>

28
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.910
Oh, I do iOS, but I did web before that. So iOS is totally new to me,

29
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.680
but I guess doing my job.

30
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.160
<v 0>Nice. We actually have another special guest later on,</v>

31
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.220
but you'll have to keep watching to find out who, all right,

32
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.540
what food do you want to make? We have three different steak meals.

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.580
<v 1>We got, we got wild, Alaskan fit to Cine.</v>

34
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.630
<v 0>Pasta. We got lemon grass, ginger Turkey burgers.</v>

35
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:10.850
And finally we have Parisian steaks.

36
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.240
<v 1>Oh my God. Oh, wow. I want steak free.</v>

37
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.360
<v 0>So it's all laid out. You know, one to six,</v>

38
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.460
I asked you guys on Twitter to give us, you know,

39
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:21.350
your best questions about software engineering.

40
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.810
So we're going to be answering this while we cook.

41
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.250
<v 1>Oh, those are French fries are dumb. Yeah. Those are French fries.</v>

42
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.463
Okay.

43
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.450
Oh my God.

44
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.650
<v 0>French reduction. This is my UCO also.</v>

45
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.010
<v 0>Oh, so yeah. So which one do you want?</v>

47
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.390
Choose you either can choose the lemon grass, Turkey or the fettuccine.

48
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.340
I'm going to read it. It's better to Cheney. Fascinating. All right, go ahead.

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.920
<v 1>Wait, do I get it now? Yeah. It's so simple. It's time. Okay.</v>

50
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.380
Instructions are so simple. Like a competition or anything.

51
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.780
Just pop it up. Well, I use the oven for them. If you're not cooking,

52
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.830
I'm cooking. I'm cooking. It's part of my video. Yeah.

53
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.260
<v 0>You know, once I get my new apartment,</v>

54
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:26.640
because my new apartment has a dope kitchen and a dope business, right? Yeah.

55
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.210
It's actually, really? Yeah. If you watch my videos, you would know.

56
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.110
<v 1>Whatever. No one watches your videos. That's not true. Wow.</v>

57
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.610
It's like in Japanese and stuff. It's from new parents, all this.

58
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.260
Oh my gosh. Manny's comes in a little thing like this. Wow.

59
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:44.340
You never need to buy any.

60
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.530
I don't think I've ever gotten believed from before.

61
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:50.850
So this is like a new experience.

62
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.110
<v 0>First question by Rosa Noor. Hello. Joma OPA.</v>

63
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.820
I do curious what makes you move from software engineer to data scientist?

64
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.210
Thank you. Yeah, that's a great question. I actually got asked that many,

65
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:04.044
many times.

66
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.560
So the main reason why I switch is that I want to do something new because the

67
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:10.140
first time I switched was during my internship.

68
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.450
So I did software engineering internship at LinkedIn,

69
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.150
and then I want to try data science. And I did that at Facebook.

70
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.690
And then after I did at Facebook, I realized that, you know,

71
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.380
maybe sometimes it's not like I really like the product more than actually

72
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:24.810
solving the architecture problems and stuff like that.

73
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.350
So that's why I really like data science because you're a lot closer to the

74
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.590
product because they say you're analyzing data to try to find product

75
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:32.424
recommendations.

76
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.330
So it's closer to a PM role than what software engineer would be.

77
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.930
And I realized that that's one thing I really care about because I was really

78
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:40.764
into startups,

79
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.970
really into making my own products and data science is closer to product

80
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:45.804
management than that.

81
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.140
And now I just love data science because it's just fun to discover something

82
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:50.040
cool with data.

83
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.920
<v 1>One is not preferred. I open the bag</v>

84
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.320
done with that. Did you want, do you ever cook me? Yeah. Uh,

85
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.180
slash can I take some of these ingredients? What was black garlic

86
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.023
Corazon?

87
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.120
<v 0>Do you remember when I came and make her made Curry with you? Made Curry.</v>

88
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.753
<v 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.050
<v 0>I want to say, I'm going to find these questions. Okay. Mitchell Wakefield,</v>

90
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.311
in your opinion,

91
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:30.000
what are some of the best soft skills to have at a large tech company? And why.

92
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.390
<v 1>Is a good question? Um,</v>

93
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.270
I would say probably relationship building is a good,

94
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.210
soft skill to have at a tech company or a very large tech company,

95
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.810
because there's a lot of people at a large tech company.

96
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.900
And the way that you're going to work well with other people is to have like

97
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.900
relationships with those people doesn't necessarily have to be like personal

98
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:49.734
relationships,

99
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.800
but just like having some sort of rapport with a lot of different kinds of

100
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:56.700
people are going to help you get your job done is also going to help you biting

101
00:05:56.701 --> 00:06:00.470
your, and everyone's going to like, know who you are and stuff.

102
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.610
And sometimes networking is key, especially at larger tech companies recently,

103
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.740
where am I? All right. I can do this. Oh yeah.

104
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.440
What do I do then? I just, all right. Do you know what you're doing? Yep.

105
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.390
Recently, something I've been thinking about is that when you're an engineer,

106
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:25.300
you can obviously show competence just by writing really good code,

107
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.830
but you can demonstrate so much value by actually taking charge in a project.

108
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.830
And that requires a lot of soft skills.

109
00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:36.400
So like basically like leadership skills, right? Running a meeting,

110
00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:37.450
starting meetings,

111
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.380
being able to talk to all the cross-functional people to get their suggestions

112
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:44.980
and then like connecting those suggestions to other people.

113
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.780
It just makes you look so much more competent.

114
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.900
And then people will actually start to think of you as someone who can like own

115
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:51.670
a project and totally bring it through.

116
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.210
And all of that is like soft skills.

117
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.150
All of that's talking to other people talking to other engineers,

118
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.140
maybe like delegating work. Even. I don't have to do that a lot.

119
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.240
So it was really on my mind. You got to, Oh no, it's downloaded.

120
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.590
I thought it was the smell.

121
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.570
It's hot. That's hot. Okay.

122
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.310
Make sure I get a lot of screen time a minute. It's still my channel, right?

123
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.410
Wow. Was your friend married? No,

124
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.390
he's single live there. Yeah. Temporary.

125
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:39.550
Yeah. Everything. Yeah. I'm sorry. My hands are so,

126
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.550
Oh God,

127
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.820
I don't like guns. Look, are you recording?

128
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:55.870
Yeah. I don't do things when you're not recording.

129
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.440
Please record him all the time much.

130
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.310
Oh my God. I thought you were going to just,

131
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.400
you want me to eat this? This, this challenge is the challenge.

132
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.800
You don't want the Jason

133
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.100
I'll do [inaudible] what did you learn on the job and not in school that you

134
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:27.690
wish you learned in school or knew about it earlier? It could be technical.

135
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.610
Could be, yeah. Okay.

136
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.330
So on the job as pushing, you're working at a larger company,

137
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.420
a lot of your work is going to involve going through other people's code.

138
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.220
And that means some things are going to take a variable amount of time and you

139
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.630
just don't know how long you're going to take.

140
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.430
So like scoping a project at school and at work is so different.

141
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.300
At least it was for me, like at school you could play,

142
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.880
do everything the last day, if you really needed to. I mean,

143
00:08:54.881 --> 00:08:57.720
maybe for bigger projects, but at work,

144
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.030
things are just not going to take the amount of time that you think.

145
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.940
So that's something I've really had to learn. And when I was an intern,

146
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.830
I was like, the first time I got, I had to learn that. Yeah.

147
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.740
I wish I improved my writing skills. Yeah.

148
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.950
Cause like I thought I was like, when I was going to school, I was like,

149
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.110
I don't need to write, like, I'm a computer science major.

150
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:21.200
I don't got to like write anything, like paragraph structure, whatever.

151
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.090
But then I found that like,

152
00:09:23.091 --> 00:09:26.720
whenever you're communicating what you wrote to like what code you wrote or

153
00:09:26.721 --> 00:09:30.530
like, if you're communicating to other people, um, async what you're doing.

154
00:09:30.531 --> 00:09:33.740
Then you have to have really good writing skills to come off clearly and like

155
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.200
communicate really well. So like even just like PRS, right.

156
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.750
When you have to write a really good description of what you just made so that

157
00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:40.130
it makes sense to another person.

158
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.770
And I wish I had like worked on their writing skills. Yeah.

159
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.370
And that is also like one of the soft skills.

160
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.490
And the other question that's true. Yeah. Really important. Soft skill.

161
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.060
Also one more thing is this, it doesn't actually apply to me,

162
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:57.920
but recently one of our coworkers said that at school things

163
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.550
didn't really check his code. They just checked to see if it worked.

164
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.380
And so that's a thing like your job, if people are going to look at your code,

165
00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:10.460
it can't just work. It has to be like good code. Oh yeah. Quality.

166
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.710
<v 0>Yeah. I want to talk about this too.</v>

167
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:17.690
Like coding is not just about how fast your code runs or if it works because the

168
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:21.380
whole, because coding 90% of the time means you're working with other people.

169
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.100
Yeah. Good code means other people can read your code and then write whole

170
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.020
trash. Like my videos, like my coding skills.

171
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.650
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.640
<v 0>Which programming language is a good prerequisite for computer science,</v>

173
00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:41.600
students and freshmen.

174
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.660
<v 1>Yeah. For what? Which programming language. Yeah.</v>

175
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.490
Python is good for interviews Python. Yeah. I mean,

176
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.540
it depends what you're doing.

177
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.870
<v 0>Question by EKI what benefits, if there are any,</v>

178
00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:57.440
do you see in getting a software engineering degree versus a computer science

179
00:10:57.441 --> 00:10:58.970
degree? Yeah.

180
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.200
And how highly do you think companies value self projects versus actual

181
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:06.350
internship and work experience? So two, two questions. Okay.

182
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.650
<v 1>Okay. I would say software and you're doing versus computer science.</v>

183
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.320
I'd my school didn't have a software engineering degree,

184
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.770
but I think it depends maybe on like what the school program is and if it aligns

185
00:11:15.771 --> 00:11:16.604
with their goals.

186
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.850
Cause I can imagine like some software engineering programs or just like CS

187
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:22.730
programs at other schools. So I would say like, if you are at a college,

188
00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:26.300
then talk to your advisor and see which one is like more like what you want to

189
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:29.150
do. And then the second question, uh,

190
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.760
self projects versus actual internship or work experience,

191
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.690
I guess it depends on what the self project is. But if, unless it,

192
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.700
unless it's like really cool, I would say that like work experience,

193
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:42.290
actual initiatives, consult projects.

194
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.200
Cause there's a lot of stuff that you learn in internships that aren't just

195
00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:47.930
about coding and it's about like working with a team or working with other

196
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:50.780
people and communicating and stuff that are really valuable.

197
00:11:50.781 --> 00:11:54.130
I think to learn just my two. How do you.

198
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.230
<v 0>Keep being productive in software engineering?</v>

199
00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.940
More specifically how you do it with hella distraction around you

200
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.040
basically. How do you not procrastinate?

201
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.790
<v 1>Just always progress. Yeah. Stop.</v>

202
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.460
But I think the accountability systems are good.

203
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:12.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

204
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.520
I personally do get distracted a lot in general at work

205
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:18.720
also, but I, I,

206
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:24.030
I have just learned to accept it because in a day I have a certain amount of

207
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.750
energy. And even if I have more time, like, like eight hours in a day,

208
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.760
it doesn't mean that I'm going to work the whole eight hours.

209
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.770
Cause I just get mentally tired. Right.

210
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.160
So it's okay to procrastinate from time to time. Like for example, studying,

211
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.630
how, how did you not procrastinate?

212
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.490
<v 1>I had to remove myself from social situations sometimes like go to a</v>

213
00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:44.760
library, like lock myself in a room, you know,

214
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.530
that's kinda how I had to do it.

215
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:51.690
Also have a nice drink or something like a treat, not like nothing

216
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:59.100
[inaudible] library. I meant coffee, tea. There's like a Boba place. Yeah.

217
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.200
I guess I would just like get Boba and I'll be like,

218
00:13:01.201 --> 00:13:03.870
this is my treat while I study. And then it kind of puts,

219
00:13:03.871 --> 00:13:05.250
sometimes it puts into that mode,

220
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.520
especially if it's something that you always have when you're studying. Yeah.

221
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.410
That's true. I always have firsthand Coldwell college, so yeah,

222
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:18.060
not great advice, but just do it. I think at least at work,

223
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.340
other people also want to get stuff done.

224
00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:24.690
Usually at some point that's more like social pressure at work. Cause it's like,

225
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.230
you don't get it done then someone else's. Yeah. That's true.

226
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.870
That's more motivation for people. I don't want to live.

227
00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.710
Whereas in college it's like the only person I'm laying down as myself

228
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:39.720
person, everything looked good. I love you.

229
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:49.920
<v 0>Wait, one last question for you guys, which is a simple answer. I think, do you,</v>

230
00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:54.210
as seasoned developer have to refer to documentation and code snippets when

231
00:13:54.211 --> 00:13:57.570
coding at work or do you already have all the knowledge needed in your head?

232
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.790
<v 1>I'm a robot sits up program. I always look so fun. Oh yeah.</v>

233
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:06.270
There's so much stuff you can't a hundred percent Mr. Robot.

234
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.600
<v 0>I Google how to write loops in Python.</v>

235
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.290
<v 1>At the daily basis. I do use Google a lot. Yeah.</v>

236
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.630
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Literally everything I do.</v>

237
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:20.430
I copy code snip is almost of course having a good coach and the good.

238
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:23.760
<v 1>Well, that's the thing that you learned in this season developer.</v>

239
00:14:23.761 --> 00:14:27.090
You just know what's good and bad codes. Perfect. Yeah.

240
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.340
<v 0>Okay, cool. So here's the food looks very, very delicious.</v>

241
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:33.930
Thank you my Hugo, thank you Arielle for,

242
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:39.030
for helping me cook this meal or should we say thank you for cooking.

243
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.100
<v 1>For me and.</v>

244
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.420
<v 0>Allow me to help, but yeah, I'm pretty sure this is, um,</v>

245
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.140
surely healthy. I mean, if we look at the nutritional facts,

246
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.320
let's see if it's a Cine, you know, you get 710 calories for this one.

247
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.830
And then for the other ones, six fleets,

248
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:03.140
we get 610 calories. Yeah. Lots of protein. Both of them. 41 grams,

249
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.123
39 grams.

250
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:10.750
<v 1>Let's try it out guys. Try to pass the first fry. Actually.</v>

251
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:15.640
I'm gonna try out pasta scuffed fish, and I'm going to find

252
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.490
out I only so good.

253
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.400
<v 0>Well good drama, Yukon. This is.</v>

254
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.950
<v 1>Let me try. Yo. That's good.</v>

255
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.740
I don't. You mean thank you,

256
00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:34.660
blue aprons for making the recipe and follow

257
00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:41.110
it's good. That was really good. I've never had fish pasta. Yeah.

258
00:15:41.111 --> 00:15:44.260
I don't think I've actually ever made fish pasta before either, but easy.

259
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.440
So good. Yeah. This is actually really good. Really healthy. Oh my God.

260
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.780
I want to try this one. If I could make.

261
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.760
<v 0>This myself, I'll be, Oh my God. It's over.</v>

262
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.700
<v 1>Okay. Out the garlic butter, extra butter.</v>

263
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.920
Um, yeah, you get more than just this by the way, eat off of this plate.

264
00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.400
<v 0>Sure. It's just like, why would get in large companies?</v>

265
00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:10.560
Cafeteria food wins are good.

266
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.220
<v 1>Oh, you don't think so. I think this was definitely better than that or better.</v>

267
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.540
Yeah. I think was better.

268
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.990
It feels like I shopped at whole foods without needing to go to whole foods and

269
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.640
pay for it. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty much.

270
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.270
<v 0>I think I can do this with my girlfriend.</v>

271
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.470
<v 1>Come on. Can you just act it just fine?</v>

272
00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:43.180
I could do this connect. My non-existent when your future girlfriend. Yeah,

273
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:47.620
my future. Hopefully one day I won't get a girlfriend.

274
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.490
Right. So last words.

275
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.790
<v 0>Thank you so much. Blue apron for sponsoring this video. Oh my God.</v>

276
00:16:54.791 --> 00:16:58.630
We have so much fun making this. Oh my God. So yeah. And once again,

277
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.860
don't forget link on the description to get free. What $50 off.

278
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.430
<v 1>For your next purchase? All right. Peace out guys.</v>

279
00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.940
And then the rap music starts. Oh yeah.

280
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.250
Why always me?

281
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:25.120
Why always me.
