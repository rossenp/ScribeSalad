00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>Here's what I did before making this video. I was at home watching K-pop videos.</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.250
When suddenly I felt useless and pathetic because I just spent two hours

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:09.480
watching four girls say

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.000
I needed some sort of confirmation that I was still wanted and loved in this

5
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:16.620
world. So I called my mom.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.000
She didn't pick up. She never does.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
So I needed a new way to feel validated my next best thing.

8
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.840
My data science skills I needed to feel wanted.

9
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:31.500
So I revamped my resume and brushed my hair and applied to all these data

10
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:35.570
science analytics positions. I whispered to myself, tell me you want me?

11
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.760
I quickly learned that it takes more than 20 minutes to get an interview. So I,

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.180
um, brushed my hair, took my pants off and went to bed soon.

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.540
The interview started flowing in one phone call, two phone call,

14
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.650
three phone call rejection. You win some, you lose some.

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.340
I started getting on-site interviews one onsite, two onsite,

16
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.170
three onsite at every interview I whispered to them, tell me you want me,

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.100
some did some didn't, but I had what I need I'm validated.

18
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.380
And here is what I learned from all these things.

19
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.343
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.240
<v 0>So for the technical interview,</v>

21
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.530
this is basically just a simple SQL or SQL question,

22
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.340
or it can also be a simple coding question like Python or something.

23
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.210
And the reason why they ask you this question is to make sure that you know how

24
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:35.030
to write queries, because they're going to be doing a lot of that on a job.

25
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.550
And also if you can work with a simple program,

26
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.180
if you could write simple programs, nothing too complicated. Now,

27
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.800
not going to lie at this part of the interview or this interview is probably

28
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:49.370
going to be the easiest out of the data science analytics position.

29
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.110
So let's see if you can solve one of these questions. Here's an example.

30
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.370
So here you have a table called publisher info that has all the information

31
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.650
about a publisher and the videos they publish.

32
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.490
And then you have the consumption info where you have all the information of

33
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:08.360
user consuming, a single video. So two questions, one,

34
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.320
how many minutes worth of video does an average publisher have to,

35
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.010
how many publishers have at least one user who watched their videos?

36
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.600
I'll give you 10 seconds to finish.

37
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.580
<v 1>So here's the answer.</v>

38
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.040
<v 0>In a real interview. There will be more up questions since it's an hour long,</v>

39
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.290
but let me show you how I studied for it.

40
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.250
I locked myself in a room and open cracking the coding interview and finish all

41
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:38.330
the questions until chapter five or until I feel like puking. After that,

42
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.150
I go to all these websites to practice SQL questions.

43
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.900
And of course I go on glassdoor.com to see if we could find any juicy

44
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.320
questions, the math interview,

45
00:02:48.321 --> 00:02:51.350
or sometimes they call it the quantitative interview.

46
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.340
This one is quite simple also because they just asked you some simple

47
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.850
probability questions or some simple descriptive statistics.

48
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.820
So here's an example.

49
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.610
It takes an STD test and the test is advertised as being nine, 9% accurate.

50
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.270
If you have the STD, your test positive nine, 9% of the time.

51
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.320
If you don't have the STD, you will test negative nine, 9% of the time.

52
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.390
If 1% of all people have this SDB and Jorma test positive,

53
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.360
what is the probability that Joma has this disease?

54
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.490
I'll give you a few seconds to answer this question.

55
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.340
Tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock

56
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.600
so the answer is zero because you have to get late togetherness.

57
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.350
Okay. Anyways, the right answer is 50% and you have to use beta.

58
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.030
So if you went to college and you listen during your freshman year,

59
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.780
these concepts should be pretty familiar to you, but then again,

60
00:03:45.781 --> 00:03:47.430
that's only if you remember them.

61
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.480
So here's a list of things that they would ask you about.

62
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.590
So like conditional probabilities based theorem by normal distribution,

63
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.900
normal distribution, descriptive statistics,

64
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.510
and like understanding the law of large numbers,

65
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.910
central limit theorem and linear regressions.

66
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.350
So if you understand these concepts, that's pretty good and you should be fine.

67
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.920
And then for me, I wasn't fine because I didn't listen.

68
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.980
So what I did to study for that, I went back to my old textbooks,

69
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.800
read some of these chapters and then refresh my memory.

70
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.400
And then also I did some practice questions, especially for probabilities,

71
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.820
because sometimes it's a little bit tricky. It's almost like a brain teaser.

72
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.760
So you just got to practice just like coding the product interview.

73
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.030
Now this is a little bit subjective, but it's important to get, right?

74
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.020
They will ask you a hypothetical product and how you improve it.

75
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.980
And then they will also ask you what metrics would you track to measure its

76
00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:38.910
success. Also,

77
00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:42.420
they're going to give you situations where there are trade-offs between metrics

78
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.300
and you have to argue which one is best for the product.

79
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.590
It's not always black and white.

80
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.760
We just want to know how well did you work with data in the products

81
00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:54.120
perspective? So it's kind of hard to give you an example of a question.

82
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.790
Cause usually it's like a back and forth and a conversation.

83
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.850
So here's an example of what the interview would look like. All right.

84
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.870
So as you know,

85
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.520
not vine is a platform where users can share 6.1 looping videos

86
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.050
as seen in the startup series. And it's basically a feed of content. You follow.

87
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.920
Now,

88
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.450
imagine we are considering launching a share button where you can share someone

89
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:17.970
else's video and it will show to your followers,

90
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.950
how would you evaluate this change?

91
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.060
What metrics do you expect to change and how will you decide to launch it or

92
00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:25.380
not? Hmm, well,

93
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:29.880
we can do an experiment rollout to only a few publishers first and then AB

94
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.570
tested. So for some users, they see it. And for some,

95
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.250
they don't see the shared post.

96
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.540
That way we can see the difference in consumer behavior. For example,

97
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.300
inventory will probably go up because of that.

98
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.480
We will see if it increases video, watch time per person.

99
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.320
And if it increases retention from users with this feature,

100
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.740
we also have to make sure it doesn't cannibalize the original content.

101
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.290
So even if they have more video impressions,

102
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.210
we want to see if the view impressions didn't decrease too much,

103
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.940
which can mean they don't care about the shared videos.

104
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.050
We can also run surveys to survey them if they enjoy watching this shared

105
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:09.620
content. So, so product questions are like that,

106
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.520
but usually with more follow-ups and more deep dives, but you get the gist.

107
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.750
So obviously this is a generalizations of all the data science interviews.

108
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.630
I've had. Some are harder, some are easier,

109
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.880
but if you were able to answer these question,

110
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.680
your chance of getting a data science job is higher with

111
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:32.270
statistical significance than if you weren't able to answer these questions.

112
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.230
By the way, this video was sponsored by brilliant.org,

113
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.920
which is kind of cool because I actually used trillian.org.

114
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.950
When I was applying to my untitled large company,

115
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.070
since the company gave me links to help me prepare for my interview.

116
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.970
And one of the links that they gave me is a bunch of competent torics questions,

117
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.210
AKA probably questions on brilliant.org.

118
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.200
It really helped me on the map part of the interview because I was killing the

119
00:06:57.201 --> 00:06:58.400
probability questions.

120
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.280
I actually find it really fun to crank out these questions.

121
00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.190
It makes me feel good about myself and keeps me sharp.

122
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.740
And they're good brain teasers for interviews,

123
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.690
especially for data science or quantum.

124
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.130
Very good supplement to my interview preps. So highly recommended. Also,

125
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:14.000
if you're in school,

126
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.380
you could supplement your learning by using this website because there's a wide

127
00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:19.370
variety of topics,

128
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.720
which is pretty dope because I love the UI on the website and it makes studying

129
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:27.170
so much more fun with their quizzes. If you're interested,

130
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:29.960
there's a link in the description down below, best of all,

131
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:33.140
you can get 20% off their premium subscription. So YouTube,

132
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:37.730
you can kill it at the interview for the large entitled company. All right.

133
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.300
Hope you enjoyed this video or I gotta go now pose, um,

134
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.970
after figuring out how to make food. Cause my roommates are gone.

135
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.550
I've been eating Cheetos for like the past two days.

136
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.143
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

137
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:54.580
