00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>Today's guest is Gary 10.</v>

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.990
He is a designer engineer and founder turned early stage

3
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:11.580
investor. Co-founding initialized capital with Alexis Ohanian.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.930
In 2013,

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.010
their firm manages over $500 million.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.930
And if invested at the earliest stages of companies like Coinbase,

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.850
Flexport, Instacart, and Cruz prior to initialize,

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.350
Gary spent nearly five years as a partner at Y Combinator

9
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.940
advising and funding more than 1000 companies and founders

10
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.130
before YC. He was a co-founder of a blog platform called [inaudible],

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.840
which was acquired by Twitter in 2012, for $20 million.

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.090
He then worked at Palentier as a founding member of the engineering team and

13
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:54.540
fun fact, he actually designed the Pelletiers logo.

14
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.670
Gary also holds a bachelor in computer systems engineering from

15
00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:04.350
Stanford university. Wow. That is one heck of a resume. Very impressive.

16
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.420
<v 1>But I got very lucky by getting in on that's.</v>

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.660
<v 0>What everyone says. And here he is talking to me a YouTuber,</v>

18
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.030
the camera of the camera, unless you want to do a little bit of promo, but yeah,

19
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.630
so,

20
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.730
and I also heard that now you're the portfolio initialized portfolio is valued

21
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.940
that 36 billion.

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.320
<v 1>Correct. And in almost every single case,</v>

23
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:28.310
we were the first or among the first check. So when the company was worth,

24
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.540
certainly under $10 million and we funded about 200 companies.

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.230
<v 0>So like Coinbase, you were one of the first. Yeah, that is crazy.</v>

26
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.360
So I have a lot of viewers, most of them are from a high school or like college,

27
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.600
just, um, just a little curiosity. Did you do well in high school and college.

28
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.890
<v 1>Uh, high school I aimed for exactly perfect a minuses.</v>

29
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.080
Cause I figured out that my, our college admissions process,

30
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.100
the transcript that the district would send out didn't have plus or minus.

31
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.170
And so every moment I spent on getting a plus or not minus meant that

32
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.850
it wasn't optimized. Wow.

33
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.560
<v 0>Okay. That's a very 80 20 mindset. That's cool. You got a min-max of your life.</v>

34
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.940
That's true. That's true. That's true.

35
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.070
And then what did you do with the other time?

36
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.840
Because I'm pretty sure you had more time because you didn't optimize for eight.

37
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.790
<v 1>Oh man. I mean the reality is I actually grew,</v>

38
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.330
grew up pretty poor in Fremont or Fremont. Yeah.

39
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:27.950
And so we were growing up in apartments. I wanted my parents to buy a house.

40
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:28.171
I mean,

41
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:32.990
I wanted to grow up in the house and I was 14 and I was obsessed with

42
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:35.390
computers and I knew how to make webpages.

43
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.130
So I opened up the internet section of the yellow pages and cold called until

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.810
someone gave me a job for seven bucks an hour to make websites for cities.

45
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.940
And that was my first job when I was 14.

46
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.290
I ended up taking all those earnings over every summer and winter break for a

47
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:51.921
few years.

48
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.660
And we ended up putting down the down payment for the home that me and my

49
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.550
brother grew up in. So that's amazing.

50
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.560
And so me computers just fundamentally changed my life.

51
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.350
Like I grew up like sometimes food insecure.

52
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.900
Like I know what it means to be hungry or show up to school,

53
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.630
like wearing the same clothes again, you know? Um,

54
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.960
and so computers actually really changed my life in a fundamental way.

55
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.350
And I would've worked on computers for free, but it turns out,

56
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.770
especially over the past 20 years, it's basically like winning a lot,

57
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.300
like winning the lottery was being into computers like now and in the past.

58
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.580
<v 0>20 Years. Yeah. I do feel very fortunate that I chose computer science for sure.</v>

59
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.720
You know, it's funny. Cause I,

60
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:33.900
I used to work when I was maybe not 14 because that was illegal.

61
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:37.530
But when I was 15, I think I worked at McDonald's yeah. The contrast here,

62
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.473
but yeah.

63
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.290
<v 1>And um, my dad thought I would got really soft by just working on computers.</v>

64
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:46.110
He was like, maybe you should go work at McDonald's. I was like, no dad.

65
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.040
<v 0>Computers. That's really cool. So back to, you know, now what you're doing,</v>

66
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:54.870
you're a VC right. Initialized capital. And um, can I ask you,

67
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.850
what kind of companies do you guys invest in or what do you look for?

68
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.680
<v 1>Yeah, totally. Uh, we are super focused on the earliest stage. Okay.</v>

69
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.890
And then, so, you know, people with just an idea,

70
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.570
when we met Brian Armstrong who created Coinbase, he just quit his job, uh,

71
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.520
as head of anti-fraud for Airbnb and Airbnb had just been minted as a billion

72
00:04:17.521 --> 00:04:21.900
dollar company. And now it's worth like North of 30 billion, which is crazy,

73
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.830
but for him to quit that job at that moment, uh,

74
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.770
and work on the super speculative thing called Bitcoin,

75
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.920
that was really noteworthy for us. I think it was 2013.

76
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.250
<v 0>13. That's crazy. Okay. And then you,</v>

77
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.790
you guys were one of the first invest in them or you were to first invest.

78
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.720
<v 1>Yeah. I mean we funded them at Y Combinator and then initialized.</v>

79
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:46.860
I was able to invest again. So that's one of the funnest things,

80
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:50.610
seeing people who are just have this crazy idea. I mean,

81
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:53.220
Bitcoin was fringe, you know,

82
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.060
I read about it on hacker news and dismissed it like a lot of other people.

83
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.300
But for us, it goes back to the founders.

84
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:04.740
Like if they are really smart and really great engineers who can build

85
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:07.260
anything, that's the most important thing.

86
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.040
And this is in contrast to how I think most venture capitalists work.

87
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.850
Most people just look at the buzzword, they look at the resume,

88
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.790
they look at the buzzwords and they say, check, check, check, okay,

89
00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.440
I'm going to take that meeting or not.

90
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.940
And I think that that's why startups suck so bad.

91
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.380
That's why you read about you open up tech crimes or you open up Twitter and you

92
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.290
read about the startup, the raise $10 million. It's like,

93
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.510
that doesn't sound very good at all.

94
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.860
And it's because a lot of startup investors don't think from first principles,

95
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.870
they're never built a company before, or they never built software before.

96
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:44.550
Like they don't know how to be an engineer.

97
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.400
They don't know how to be a designer. They've never built anything.

98
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.290
And so what do you, do you rely on your PowerPoint watching skills, I guess.

99
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.100
<v 0>So aside from technical skills or you know,</v>

100
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.120
what they can and cannot in terms of personality traits,

101
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.830
what do you look for in these founders?

102
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.710
<v 1>The number one thing I think is actually grit around</v>

103
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.783
iteration.

104
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.810
So I mean just making something that people actually want and then putting it

105
00:06:10.811 --> 00:06:13.060
out there, even if it sucks. If,

106
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.050
if there's one person out there in the world who would be happy that that

107
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.660
exists, then you did the right thing, right?

108
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.890
If you are putting out software that you're not embarrassed about,

109
00:06:23.891 --> 00:06:28.510
then you waited too long generally. Um, and then once you have that out there,

110
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.100
like you don't have to blast the world,

111
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:33.280
but get like at least one or two people using it and relying on it.

112
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.910
And if you can get one or two people to really love it,

113
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.140
then that's the kernel of something that could grow a lot faster.

114
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.260
And so that's one thing that we ask ourselves a lot. When we meet a founder,

115
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.470
have they made something that, uh,

116
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.670
their customers actually truly love because that's more important than

117
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.780
all the Stanford and Harvard's and all the Google and Facebook, you know,

118
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.900
resumes in the world. Like you could take all of those and add them up.

119
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.890
And it wouldn't matter if those people can't sit down in front of a user,

120
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.640
figure out what they need and then build the thing and then have someone be

121
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:10.530
really happy that that exists. So it's simple. It's I actually shockingly.

122
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.560
<v 0>Simple. So it sounds simple, but I mean obviously finding product, product,</v>

123
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:16.770
market fit is not always easy, right?

124
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.370
Like that's actually like the biggest thing.

125
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.240
So imagine if I did find a product market fit, how would I pitch it to you?

126
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.300
How can you extract the most signal out of my pitch?

127
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:27.850
Or how should I make my pitch so that you can extract it? Yeah.

128
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.090
<v 1>Totally. Number one thing is, uh, and I get cold.</v>

129
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.960
I get probably 20 cold emails every single day, which is crazy. Um,

130
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.490
and these are actually not actionable for me because in that email I can

131
00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:43.060
actually tell, uh, what is it, who's it for?

132
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.920
What problem does it solve? And then how do I even know if it's actually solved?

133
00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:52.000
Well, those are sort of the four things. Really. It's not a lot of things,

134
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.730
but you know, if someone was going to call email near cold,

135
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:58.180
pitch me or pitch anything to any investor,

136
00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.830
that would be how I advise it.

137
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.630
And that's sort of the process that a founder has to take every single

138
00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:08.260
day, whether it's not just for investors, it's actually to your customer,

139
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.630
to like, cause a customer is sitting there and you know,

140
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.600
I'm trying to buy Bitcoin. It's a huge pain in the butt.

141
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.810
I have to go to this other website. I have to go to Western union.

142
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:18.610
I think I went to Western union really.

143
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.830
And I wired money from Western union cash to some

144
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:27.730
random address in India maybe or something like that.

145
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:32.290
And then it magically appeared in this super sketchy payment system that then

146
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.870
showed up on Mt. Gox and I could buy my first Bitcoin.

147
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.130
And so that was the state of affairs, you know, today, uh,

148
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:42.250
everyone forgets because Coinbase now exists. You go to the website,

149
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:45.880
you put in your credit card, you put in your bank account information,

150
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.360
it's trusted, it's encrypted, it's all in the United States.

151
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.570
It's fully compliant. It's frankly,

152
00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:55.620
way better than what the alternative. I mean,

153
00:08:55.621 --> 00:09:00.330
it sounds simple and it is very hard to actually find a problem like that and B

154
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.550
solve it in exactly that way.

155
00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.330
<v 0>[Inaudible]. So now that you've invested in multiple startups,</v>

156
00:09:05.331 --> 00:09:08.540
I'm sure some of the startups film, right? Not all of them succeeding.

157
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.270
<v 1>Probably more than 50% not working out.</v>

158
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.550
<v 0>Why do you think startups fail?</v>

159
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.600
What are the most common issues or problems that make them fail?

160
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.250
<v 1>Yeah, the number one, um,</v>

161
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.810
really early ends up being co-founder problems actually. Um,

162
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.630
especially when you're only two or three people, uh,

163
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.250
you actually kind of need those people.

164
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.830
And so that's probably the number one thing.

165
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:33.500
And that's why when we look for teams that are starting out,

166
00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:36.560
we really like teams that have actually worked together before,

167
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.950
or have known each other for a really long time. I mean,

168
00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:43.820
one litmus test almost for whether or not a co-founder is good.

169
00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:48.740
Is have you ever been camping in a storm because that's kind of how

170
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:51.620
it's going to feel like it's going to be garbage.

171
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.140
Like you're going to get punched in the face. It's going to be wet.

172
00:09:54.141 --> 00:09:57.500
It's going to be cold. Like someone forgot, matches.

173
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.130
There's going to be like a thousand problems that crop up.

174
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.520
And if you are able to work with someone,

175
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.790
you can get through all those problems and, and you know,

176
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.370
the thing is that's going to happen. So.

177
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.380
<v 0>What about solo founders? Have you ever invested in solo founder?</v>

178
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.880
<v 1>Yeah, absolutely. Um, the classic advice was try and find co-founders,</v>

179
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:19.640
but solo founders can make it work too. Um,

180
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.460
either they have to build the whole first version themselves, uh,

181
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:26.600
and they have to raise money or, you know, there are lots of different paths.

182
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.170
Um, it's usually better to be a solo founder, uh,

183
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.880
than to have co-founders who are.

184
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.210
<v 0>Bad sense that makes it bad for each other.</v>

185
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.550
<v 1>Yeah. Bad for each other. Cause you know, it's almost certain death when you're,</v>

186
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.840
you know, out there,

187
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.630
maybe you're trying to raise money and then you lose a co-founder.

188
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.890
<v 0>Yeah. I think I read an initialized capital. You said something about, if,</v>

189
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:47.810
if we have you as an investor,

190
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.100
then you're going to help us prevent the 1009 lines that potential,

191
00:10:52.101 --> 00:10:53.870
what are those a thousand landmines?

192
00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.630
<v 1>And we could probably talk for hours about it. Um,</v>

193
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.860
just like we can do a few more, um, aside from co-founder stuff, honestly,

194
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.570
a lot of it is shipping.

195
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.190
So a lot of people are so obsessed with getting it perfect

196
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.110
that they actually never ship.

197
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:12.020
And there are lots of examples of companies that have actually raised millions

198
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:16.460
of dollars hired tens of people worked on problems for years and then never

199
00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:19.340
shipped sometimes when they finally do ship.

200
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.420
It's so late that the opportunity for them was a year and a half ago,

201
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:27.050
competitors, you know, came and went startup entire competitors,

202
00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:31.100
started released and died and it's just too late. And you know,

203
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.700
they burned millions of dollars. I, you know, it's crazy that that happens,

204
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:36.350
but it happens a lot actually.

205
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.040
So being able to iterate in front of users really important,

206
00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:43.820
and there are startups even today that have not shipped yet. And the.

207
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:48.110
<v 0>I see, I see. So if I am a startup founder,</v>

208
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.310
like why would I come to you for money rather than other people imagine how that

209
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.220
rock solid product. Right.

210
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.580
So why would I come to initialize capital versus another? Yeah.

211
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.790
<v 1>See from, well, we started companies before.</v>

212
00:11:59.791 --> 00:12:03.480
So part of it is so many investors have never started anything.

213
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.450
And so they're very lean back and you know,

214
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.210
if you've ever done pitches,

215
00:12:09.211 --> 00:12:12.960
you can kind of tell what kind of pitch is going to be immediately because it

216
00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:17.610
kind of feels like you're being watched by your teachers from high school or

217
00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:21.720
something. It's, you know, it's lean back. There's not a lot of, you know,

218
00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:25.110
sort of discussion. There's no back and forth. It's just impressed me.

219
00:12:25.111 --> 00:12:27.390
And then I'm going to grade you. Um,

220
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.670
and those aren't the P those aren't the investors you want.

221
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.170
And then what's worse is after that, those investors will say, well,

222
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.530
I'm interested. This is very interesting. But, uh,

223
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.080
come back to me when you have a lead,

224
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.810
which is basically the,

225
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.780
it's just literally the worst thing that investors do and it's,

226
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.010
and most of them do it. It's completely crazy. What do you mean by lead? Oh, um,

227
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.770
who is going to do most of the money into the round?

228
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.270
<v 0>Oh, got it. Got it. Okay. So a lot of people,</v>

229
00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.390
if they just want to back kind of like.

230
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.510
<v 1>That's the thing, there's basically two types of investors.</v>

231
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:04.290
From what I can tell, there are people who have eyes and they can see,

232
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.500
it's like, Oh, that's fire. Right. I'm going to invest.

233
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.750
I don't care if anyone else investing. In fact,

234
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:12.990
I hope nobody does because I want to invest as much as I can.

235
00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:16.410
So we're that type of investor. And then there's a giant,

236
00:13:16.411 --> 00:13:18.690
there's probably 10 times more, uh,

237
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.080
in number and dollar amount in follower capital.

238
00:13:22.081 --> 00:13:24.570
So these are people who have never built anything before,

239
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.310
or they're purely finance people and they are actually waiting for

240
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.460
outside signal. Right. These are the people who love the checkmarks.

241
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.050
These are people who are not believers. Right.

242
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.260
<v 0>Yeah. I guess in their defense,</v>

243
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.410
that's a perfectly valid strategy for what they have, right? Yeah.

244
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.770
Like you still have money and that's it. Exactly. So that's perfectly valid.

245
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:46.470
It's kind of like, um, I guess, stock investing.

246
00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:49.290
Some people see if there's trending then. Okay. Then let's yeah.

247
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.640
<v 1>Get up. So for us, we'll say yes. And we'll fund you right away or we'll say no,</v>

248
00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:57.330
and we'll tell you why, and that's rare on its own. And then after that,

249
00:13:57.331 --> 00:14:00.420
we're actually gonna work with the founder to actually, you know,

250
00:14:00.421 --> 00:14:05.250
I'll close candidates, we have monthly strategy sessions, you know,

251
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.450
basically I'll meet with founders as often as they possibly want to. Um,

252
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.460
our usually cadence usually it's, um, you know,

253
00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:15.870
every month or so and whatever problem that's happening with the business,

254
00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.820
we basically try and address it. Um, and you know, definitely not in a way that,

255
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.650
you know, I'm not their boss.

256
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.850
I'm basically just another founder who is trying to help. Right.

257
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.080
And that's actually really valuable.

258
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.380
<v 0>So you don't have much say into the direction of their company. Right.</v>

259
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.330
But you can influence them and help them.

260
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.710
<v 1>Um, in our experience after funding, lots of people, if we need control,</v>

261
00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:40.620
we funded the wrong company. I mean, we want to find companies.

262
00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:45.390
We want to find founders who they have a clear sense of their direction.

263
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.880
And honestly, any investor,

264
00:14:47.881 --> 00:14:51.030
any advisor is only going to spend what an hour,

265
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.280
two hours per week at most thinking about this problem as a founder,

266
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:58.550
the founder is thinking about this, like 24 seven, you know,

267
00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.370
even when they're sleeping, they're thinking about the problems that they have.

268
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.610
So I have no right to come and say, here's how you should run your day.

269
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:06.101
<v 0>I guess,</v>

270
00:15:06.101 --> 00:15:10.600
last question about startups for people who want to start their own startup,

271
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.900
either they're already in high or they're late high school, college,

272
00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:15.640
or even full-timers now,

273
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.790
what advice would you give them if they want to do a startup?

274
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.150
<v 1>I guess the number one thing is pick a problem that's around them that they</v>

275
00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:24.550
understand. So the hardest thing about, um,

276
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.060
students starting startups is they haven't experienced enough of life.

277
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.380
And a lot of the biggest problems that exist in, uh, you know,

278
00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:36.370
sort of humanity today that could be addressed by startups. Um,

279
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.930
they actually require a lot of weird specialized knowledge, right. Um,

280
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.500
and so often I ask them like, well, what's weird about you. Like,

281
00:15:44.501 --> 00:15:47.080
what's weird about your family. What's weird about, you know,

282
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:49.900
what your dad does. Like what, you know, sometimes,

283
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.690
sometimes people grow up around like, you know,

284
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.320
shipping and freight and then they go on to actually start something in that

285
00:15:56.321 --> 00:15:57.370
space. Like the, you know,

286
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.870
the weirder and the more unusual that is often that is someplace to actually

287
00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:05.800
start, uh, because you know, companies like Flexport are exactly that it's,

288
00:16:05.801 --> 00:16:10.030
you know, there's an entire world of people who care about how, uh,

289
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.110
shipping containers move around the world. And then on the flip side,

290
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:15.850
there's sort of smart engineers.

291
00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:19.630
Like people like you watching who are really smart,

292
00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:24.250
who can build any kind of software and what you basically need is this Venn

293
00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:28.090
diagram to meet in the middle and, um, where that needs,

294
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.550
that's where a billion-dollar startup could be. Right.

295
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.660
So you need to know something weird and special and different than, you know,

296
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.090
everyone else who's agreed.

297
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.990
<v 0>And engineer. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah.</v>

298
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.390
Like try to find inefficiencies in the world,

299
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:42.340
especially if it affects you personally.

300
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.220
Cause then you understand the problem very well. Yeah, totally.

301
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.080
And then apply technology to it.

302
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:50.770
And then usually that's a pretty good combination for a successful startup.

303
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.540
Right. Totally. Awesome. All right.

304
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.180
We'll take a break here and then we'll talk about VCs.

305
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.080
<v 2>All right.</v>
