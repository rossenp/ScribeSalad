<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.410
<v 1>Um, I don't know how to use this thing, dude. Ah,</v>

3
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.150
crap. But yeah. Uh, thank you DGI for this amazing gift. Uh,

4
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:07.470
this is a Maverick air. I have no idea how to fly it, but uh it's okay.

5
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:11.550
I got Matthew here. So Matthew, come here. Why don't you teach.

6
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.860
<v 2>Me how to fly this? Oh, no, no. Okay. All right.</v>

7
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.580
Let's just shut the camera. Shut the camera.

8
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.250
<v 3>My 24th year was a year of growth and it all started our</v>

9
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.960
March 12th, 2017.

10
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.760
I spent my 24th birthday sleeping on the train in Korea after clubbing.

11
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.110
I then moved to New York and started my first full-time job at Buzzfeed as a

12
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:38.040
data scientist.

13
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.050
I made my first appearance in a Buzzfeed video that 15 minutes of fame felt

14
00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:46.320
pretty good. And I appeared in more Buzzfeed videos.

15
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
I then moved to bay area and started my job at Facebook as a data scientist,

16
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.600
working for the video creator team. I dressed up as my Bitmoji for Halloween,

17
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.780
and then I met my UCO and did a call with her.

18
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.160
And then finally I started the startup series and I forced all my coworkers to

19
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:05.760
be in them. And here I am today,

20
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.720
blessed with an amazing team at work. But most importantly,

21
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.100
I'm blessed a few guys who supported me along the way and thank you for making

22
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:17.610
this community amazing, but it wasn't always that easy.

23
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.550
<v 0>It wasn't all smooth sailing actually face a lot of failures before realizing</v>

24
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:27.900
that what I really needed was to learn, to accept myself with what I have.

25
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.910
I tried starting a startup and felt six times during college.

26
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.760
I applied to product management positions at Facebook and Google with no offers.

27
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.880
I worked for a whole year making videos on YouTube and Facebook only to gain

28
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.470
200 subscribers at the end.

29
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.180
But I continued to pursue those goals because setbacks are hard,

30
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.180
but they're the ones that will teach you the most about yourself,

31
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.000
what you're capable of and what you really want.

32
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.810
And don't forget that the things are work achieving will never be easy to say

33
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.800
yes to the grind,

34
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.080
because I know that one day somewhere or someone recognize

35
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.950
your effort and you'll be rewarded. But remember,

36
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.490
before everything else before you do sight of what's important,

37
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.070
you have to step back and remember who were there for you and who made trickles

38
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:21.904
possible.

39
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.180
[inaudible].

40
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.820
<v 3>The, thank you for all you guys who came along the way,</v>

41
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.440
but I'm just getting started.

42
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.980
My goal this year is to cherish everything you guys have given to me.

43
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.040
And I will give it back to you guys, however I can,

44
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.210
because I owe it to you guys. So thank you so much and I'll see you soon.

45
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.560
Okay.
