00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>All right. Welcome. Welcome. What's popping.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.590
Now today we have a special guest. We have John Kim. Hey guys.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.950
He actually also has a YouTube channel. It's called Solon encoded.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.860
So you guys should check that out. He has a lot of good insights. Now,

5
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:18.600
the reason why I have him today is because he has a very special case.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.670
He did not come from a CS background. He, I don't even have a CS degree. No,

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.240
he does not. But where do you work? I work at capital one, capital one.

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.400
<v 1>As a software engineer. Software engineer. Yeah. I just got senior too.</v>

9
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.050
So that's pretty nice. Yeah.

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.170
<v 0>Yeah. I ha I have never gone senior yet, but yeah. So as you can see,</v>

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.540
it's very possible to get a software engineering job without a

12
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:46.460
degree. So we're going to be talking about that.

13
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.760
All right. So before we start,

14
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:59.750
I just want to ask like a few questions just to determine what kind of engineer

15
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:04.430
you are. So first question Mac or PC. Both.

16
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.373
You can't choose both.

17
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.640
<v 1>I have both. I use both at work. Do you use Mac? Because they gave me a Mac.</v>

18
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.230
<v 0>I thought it would be the opposite.</v>

19
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:14.600
I thought you would use Mac personally and then PCs.

20
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.560
<v 1>No capital. One's pretty Hitman. Wholly. When I worked for Citadel,</v>

21
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.250
they gave me windows. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So what about home? You use windows.

22
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.570
I use both, but windows for gaming for, you know,

23
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.120
like got it. Everything else development. Yeah.

24
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.870
<v 0>That makes sense. Windows for interesting spaces or cabs?</v>

25
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.920
Tabs. Okay. What's your favorite ID?

26
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.800
<v 1>I like, I like a lot. I like Adam right now.</v>

27
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.850
<v 0>Yeah. That's good. That's good. Do you use like any special plugins or like.</v>

28
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.970
<v 1>Yeah, I have tons. Like I try to not go too crazy.</v>

29
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.250
<v 0>Yeah. I don't want to get too cluttered.</v>

30
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.400
<v 1>Yeah. There's like one where like,</v>

31
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.260
like it's like a number that pops up every time you talk.

32
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.690
<v 0>About languages, your favorite language.</v>

33
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.080
<v 1>I like JavaScript right now. Web people like to hate it.</v>

34
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.880
<v 0>Did I love JavaScript? I loved,</v>

35
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.390
I let them know Jess my jam and also Google with the VA engine. Yeah.

36
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.550
It's amazing. Cool. All right.

37
00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:10.010
So I guess now we're just going to go over more kind of like a personal

38
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:13.220
question, just to get to know you better. So as a kid, I mean,

39
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:16.520
I'm guessing maybe you didn't know much about engineering and stuff like that,

40
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.550
but did you have any affinity to building things?

41
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.420
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, Lego was my thing for awhile,</v>

42
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.440
but I actually just really liked video games. That was like my thing, like, I,

43
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.450
I hated studying. I hate, I just like,

44
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.220
I like making stuff into video games and uh, yeah, my dad was an engineer,

45
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:37.490
so I kind of had that like drilled in me, like making stuff.

46
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.300
<v 0>Cool. I got two important questions. Okay. First question.</v>

47
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.130
Which games do you play? Superstar?

48
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.740
<v 1>That was like my thing. Millie?</v>

49
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.333
<v 2>Yeah, no, seriously.</v>

50
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.110
<v 1>I played a sheep. man. Yeah, I played Martin. Okay.</v>

51
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.090
<v 0>She gives you usually like Sheik would have an advantage against Mark. Really?</v>

52
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.250
I didn't get that.

53
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.610
<v 1>Like into it too. I mean, I played, I played a lot. Like,</v>

54
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.800
did you ever go to competition and stuff? No. I mean,

55
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.250
my parents wouldn't lend me, you know, they thought did you know how to use,

56
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.530
like wait dash dash. I did a little bit of weight.

57
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.320
<v 0>Okay. What about the second question? So you worked for capital one now,</v>

58
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.600
do you like enjoy your job?

59
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.330
<v 1>Yeah, no, I love my job, actually.</v>

60
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.940
My bosses are really good and capital one is really good perks.

61
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.860
So a lot of people don't know this because cabaret lens is more East coast

62
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:32.640
company, but they're huge. They have like crazy campuses.

63
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.860
It's not like a boring or a bank.

64
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.400
<v 0>Recently. Yeah. The reason why I ask is because you love video games, right?</v>

65
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.420
Yeah. So I was worrying like,

66
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:42.540
do you ever think about moving into game development? Ah.

67
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.580
<v 1>So the thing is I have a few friends who are in games and then their number one</v>

68
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.350
tip is to knock it into gear.

69
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.300
<v 0>If you like video. Yeah. That's all I heard. Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.060
Like when you work for gaming, it's actually.

71
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.060
<v 1>James you yeah.</v>

72
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.750
And video game programming is probably one of the hardest to do and

73
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.290
time-consuming to do just assuming, just to make it a little guy to move.

74
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.223
It takes you like.

75
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.000
<v 0>Yeah, that makes sense. So maybe no plans to go with gaming.</v>

76
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.160
<v 1>And the money's in, um.</v>

77
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.380
<v 0>Like apps, to be honest,</v>

78
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.130
the money's in like web and cool. Cool.

79
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.550
So what about on your free time? Like what do you do nowadays? Like.

80
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.290
<v 1>I have a BA I have a newborn, so yeah. Look so young though,</v>

81
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.000
but I'm married, so, Oh, wow. It's uh, yeah, it's,

82
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.910
that's takes up a lot of time. I like to make YouTube videos,

83
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:34.740
but I actually like really enjoy programming and I'm like kind of

84
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:35.850
lucky that I get to do that for them.

85
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.690
<v 0>Yeah. All right. So I guess before we start, um, I should have one question.</v>

86
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.950
So what did you do in college?

87
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.100
<v 1>So I actually just studied economics and accounting.</v>

88
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.830
<v 0>Yeah. So what did you want to do before college?</v>

89
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:49.890
Like did you want to be an economist? Is that even with.

90
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.620
<v 1>No, actually my,</v>

91
00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:54.570
my dad's an engineer and he's always pushed me to be an engineer,

92
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.260
but I was pretty bad school. So rebel. Yeah, I got it.

93
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.250
<v 0>I got it. Okay. So you did economics and then what'd you end up with,</v>

94
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.630
did you do internships or anything?

95
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.140
<v 1>I did. I did like zero internships. So I should have brought,</v>

96
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.750
I should have watched videos, man. Hey, at all,

97
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.860
even though you were feeling like I was probably like playing StarCraft or

98
00:05:13.861 --> 00:05:16.650
something probably less good. That's pretty much what I did.

99
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.490
<v 0>Makes sense. Makes sense. But yeah. Um, so that's the thing.</v>

100
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:23.400
So you did economics and then you didn't do any internships.

101
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.310
And then did you land a job right after you got.

102
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.030
<v 1>No, actually I did it.</v>

103
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.170
So it was like 2010 right after the financial crisis.

104
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:34.530
So it was really tough. The market was pretty tough, so. Okay.

105
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.640
So I ended up going back to school for this cat program.

106
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.130
It's like this isn't Santa Clara. It's like a,

107
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.110
I want to say like eight months program where you get all the classes for

108
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:47.010
accounting essentially.

109
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.160
<v 0>Okay. And then you got accounting.</v>

110
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.230
<v 1>Jobs? Yeah. And then I got my accounting. Um,</v>

111
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:57.170
so I had like interviews and like ENY and like the befores by pretty good.

112
00:05:57.171 --> 00:05:58.070
I mean, I have a lot of friends.

113
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 0>Who want.</v>

114
00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:59.683
<v 1>To end up with those</v>

115
00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.550
[inaudible] come on, man.

116
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.550
I ended up working at a small Korean firm. It was terrible.

117
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.760
<v 0>Oh, nice. Okay, cool.</v>

118
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.530
So then when did you start knowing about coding or did you knew before,

119
00:06:17.531 --> 00:06:18.640
but you just didn't get into it.

120
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.460
<v 1>It was actually during that time, my, um, friends and I,</v>

121
00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:24.790
we kind of got together were just tinkering. I,

122
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.370
it was like my roommate and another friend who, uh, came, just got back.

123
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.041
He was like studying,

124
00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:33.430
he was unemployed at the time he just started tinkering and I actually started

125
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:34.510
doing art instead.

126
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.580
<v 0>Okay. So you guys were making an app and you were doing like sidebar?</v>

127
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.390
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I did like design. I made like, you know,</v>

128
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.130
like circles and squares and stuff. And then.

129
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.560
<v 0>You start wanting to code. Is that how it happened?</v>

130
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.490
<v 1>It actually, it came out of necessity. Necessity, I guess. Yeah.</v>

131
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.640
Cause they found jobs as engineers essentially.

132
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.400
And then I went back to San Jose and then I was like,

133
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.730
I have all these art skills, but I still want to make like apps.

134
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.470
So that's when I started. Yeah.

135
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.750
<v 0>Uh, if you don't mind me asking, what was the app about.</v>

136
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.580
<v 1>This is video games.</v>

137
00:07:03.581 --> 00:07:06.730
We made this like hamster it's actually really embarrassing.

138
00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.520
So I'll probably I'll find some clips of it. And I'll show you.

139
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.220
<v 0>Was it like a cute game or was it like a.</v>

140
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.740
<v 1>It was a cute game kickings or.</v>

141
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.840
<v 0>Yeah. And so when, so, okay.</v>

142
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:18.850
What was your first development job and how'd you get?

143
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.570
<v 1>Well,</v>

144
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:24.520
actually my first development actual job would be this current one that I

145
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.900
have. Yeah. I knew the CEO in Korea who had a small app company.

146
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.010
So I did some stuff with it and I called that my internship. So connections.

147
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.660
<v 0>Connections, connections are pretty important.</v>

148
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.850
<v 1>To grind and hustle and you know, that's all that matters.</v>

149
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.781
<v 0>Yeah, Indiana.</v>

150
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:40.540
I just want to talk about how important connections are because yes.

151
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.000
I talk about internships and all of that, but in the end,

152
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.300
the reason like all these internship was because of connections and that

153
00:07:46.301 --> 00:07:48.280
connection for me is U Waterloo. You know,

154
00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:52.540
because they're known to produce like a high quality engineers and then that's

155
00:07:52.541 --> 00:07:55.710
why they hire us. So Indiana connections are really important. Uh,

156
00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:57.070
I hate the word networking,

157
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.870
but I do think that's one of the most valuable skill you can have. I agree.

158
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.620
And sometimes not going to lie. It's about luck. If you happen to know someone,

159
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.830
for example, I happened to know my brother and he happened to be, you know,

160
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.470
he paved the way for me, so yeah.

161
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.690
So how did you even get those, uh, capital ones? So you got a few internships,

162
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.600
like with the Korean CEO and then w what else was there.

163
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.260
<v 1>And your resume? So I, I like self study on and off for like three years.</v>

164
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.390
I tried like iOS and Java, but, um, I ended up going to a bootcamp actually.

165
00:08:28.391 --> 00:08:31.300
So that was probably the biggest like boost,

166
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.230
but the bootcamp itself doesn't really help you in terms of boosting your

167
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:38.320
resume. Actually it's, uh, sometimes it's considered a negative,

168
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.820
like there's like people looking for like new bootcamp applications. Right.

169
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.480
Um, but I did a lot of projects in hackathons when I was at the bootcamp.

170
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.600
<v 0>Okay. So, um, what, what was that about?</v>

171
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.510
<v 1>You can't call it, it's called, um, uh, Def bootcamp.</v>

172
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.040
<v 0>Okay. And, uh, how much, how much should it cost? So.</v>

173
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.150
<v 1>The total was like 13,000, I believe, maybe 15,000.</v>

174
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.860
I forget exactly. But it was, it was pretty hefty. It was a decent amount.

175
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.330
Luckily I had, yeah.

176
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.780
<v 0>I guess like, how did you choose a bootcamp?</v>

177
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.520
Cause now there are so many and some people think some of them are scams.

178
00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:16.070
Some of them are not sure how, how, like, why this one? So.

179
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.180
<v 1>It kind of goes back to connections. Um, I did. Uh, so when,</v>

180
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.850
during my whole time in like investigating about programming,

181
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.680
I started a podcast where I like interviewed software engineers and there was

182
00:09:27.681 --> 00:09:30.770
this one guy who I interview, he went to hack reactor,

183
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.320
and he was telling me about his experience.

184
00:09:33.321 --> 00:09:37.280
And he was actually an accountant to go into a hacker, uh, engineer.

185
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.250
So he gave me a lot of information and, um,

186
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.400
he told me like the ones that are good right now, I will say,

187
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.270
cause my boot kit no longer exists. Um,

188
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.800
but I would say hack reactor and app Academy is probably the best. Um,

189
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.320
there's a few other good ones, but you gotta watch out. Right.

190
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.520
<v 0>So on your resume, basically, you had a few internships and then the bootcamp.</v>

191
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.460
Right. And then that's when you applied to capital one.

192
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.750
<v 1>Yeah, pretty much. So actually I didn't, I never applied,</v>

193
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.900
I met someone there at a meetup. So again,

194
00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:12.500
like all my interviews I ever got after my bootcamp, um,

195
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.880
was because I met people. I reached out.

196
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.500
Got it.

197
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.200
<v 0>Okay. So did you interview for them or did you just get the job?</v>

198
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.820
<v 1>We have a pretty stringent interview process, like any fortune 500 com. Got it.</v>

199
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.660
But, um, the initial like interview, like I didn't have to go through a parser,

200
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.780
which my, I don't think my resume would have through,

201
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.100
cause I don't have Waterloo.

202
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.160
<v 3>Because I went to Waterloo.</v>

203
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.890
<v 0>Yeah. I guess that's one thing I want to mention too.</v>

204
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:44.780
Like a lot of people ask me like, Oh,

205
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:47.240
is it important to get a CS degree and stuff like that?

206
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.120
And I say like for the skills, maybe not, you know,

207
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.040
for the actual work experience, maybe not.

208
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.960
But the reason is because they have so many applicants that the only way they

209
00:10:56.961 --> 00:11:00.740
can go through all the applicants is by filtering people out and like for them,

210
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:04.580
yes. They know that they might filter out really talented people. If, you know,

211
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.880
sometimes they don't have a CS degree, but they're still very talented,

212
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.210
but it's just, you know, the opportunity costs of going through all of them.

213
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.620
It's just too high for them, you know? So it's like, I understand that it's,

214
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.750
but it's just a limitation.

215
00:11:17.751 --> 00:11:19.880
We don't have enough resources to go through all of them.

216
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.630
So your way to standing out is to have these stupid keyboards like Ivy league.

217
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.060
But yeah, it sucks,

218
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:30.110
but I think that's why trying to get the connection or like a referral,

219
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.100
you know, it's really important. Yeah.

220
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.320
<v 1>The referrals are like super important. Um,</v>

221
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.330
I found work like a month after my bootcamp and that's on the very fast side.

222
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:42.140
Most of my friends, they took six to year, six months a year. Wow.

223
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.130
So that's something they leave out at bootcamps. I see, you know, 99,

224
00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:49.820
95% success rate, but maybe a year later.

225
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.640
<v 0>So capital one, when you just started, did you with people who had CS degrees?</v>

226
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:56.800
Are they like you who didn't have CS?

227
00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.840
<v 1>A good mix of both actually. Yeah. Um, and surprisingly,</v>

228
00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:04.410
I would say the people who went to bootcamps were in a sense,

229
00:12:04.411 --> 00:12:09.150
like more like driven. Okay. Yeah. It's kind of interesting how that is.

230
00:12:09.151 --> 00:12:09.710
Yeah.

231
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.030
<v 0>I felt that a lot, uh, at my other jobs too,</v>

232
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:13.710
because you feel like you need to prove yourself.

233
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:15.600
<v 1>Exactly. Now that's imposter syndrome.</v>

234
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.630
<v 0>Exactly. So can you talk more about imposter syndrome? Like, did you have it?</v>

235
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.970
<v 1>I did for a little bit, like how long? Um, maybe like three months,</v>

236
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.330
like, um, I always say it takes like three months to get used to a job.

237
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.970
Makes sense. Yeah. Maybe it was like a job in the good new job thing,

238
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.500
but it was like totally different for me. New job, big company career switch,

239
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.430
all this stuff. So.

240
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.320
<v 0>So like, uh, like what were you most afraid of that you thought you didn't know.</v>

241
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.800
<v 1>To put it? Simply asking dumb questions. Okay. You know?</v>

242
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.250
Cause like you don't know what you don't know. That's true. So it's like,

243
00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:50.850
I didn't, like I had questions about JIRA. Right. Stupid. Okay.

244
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.480
<v 0>Yeah. Um, yeah. Asking you about dumb questions is interesting because, um,</v>

245
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.450
a lot of people say like, Oh, don't be afraid to ask questions.

246
00:12:57.451 --> 00:13:00.390
There's no such thing as dumb questions. Yeah. Maybe that's true.

247
00:13:00.391 --> 00:13:03.210
Like maybe for score something that, but when your reputation is on the line,

248
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.930
when your job is on the line, when you have people looking at you,

249
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:07.621
working with you,

250
00:13:07.621 --> 00:13:10.560
sometimes their judgment can lead to like future repercussions. Right.

251
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.710
And maybe internships, not that bad because you're going to leave anyways.

252
00:13:13.711 --> 00:13:15.660
But when it's a full-time job, it's a lot harder.

253
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.850
I was lucky that I did a lot of internships.

254
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.060
So I'd ask all the stupid questions there. So if ever you do an internship,

255
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.000
make sure to ask a stupid question then now when you're full full-time yeah.

256
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:26.850
For example, I asked what LS was in the terminal, you know,

257
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.190
it's to look at your file system. Yeah. Stuff like that.

258
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.960
And then the guy just looked at me, he's like, dude, what the are you? You know?

259
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.670
But here's the thing, like, you know, you don't know, you know.

260
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.760
<v 1>So you don't know. Right. Exactly.</v>

261
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.930
<v 0>So, yeah. So it is kind of a tricky thing, especially at full-time. So I don't,</v>

262
00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.900
I don't, I'm not going to say, Oh, you should just ask the question, you know,

263
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.390
but yeah. Cool. So what about, um,

264
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.330
do you have any like tips and tricks to stand out? I mean like first of all,

265
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.140
I guess some people would probably even look down on you because you came from

266
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:57.210
bootcamp. So how do you prove to them that like, no, I'm good.

267
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.990
<v 1>So there's, there's a few ways and everyone has like different opinions.</v>

268
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.280
What I do is I want a bunch of, I just want a bunch of hackathons that yeah.

269
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.230
<v 0>Can we talk about hackathon? Like what was it?</v>

270
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.060
<v 1>So let's see.</v>

271
00:14:09.061 --> 00:14:13.440
So I won one of the sponsor prizes from tech crunch disrupt.

272
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.740
That's like probably the largest hackathon. And then there was a few other ones,

273
00:14:16.741 --> 00:14:20.340
one at Facebook called chime hack. Um, that was really fun.

274
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.760
That was my pretty big names. Surprise. Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.660
There was a small one where it was like hack against violence.

276
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.790
So it was like some, yeah, that one was like.

277
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.880
<v 0>Okay. So can you tell me about one, like, I guess the best one,</v>

278
00:14:32.881 --> 00:14:36.660
the one that you want or like the one that you felt like you did the most work

279
00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:39.240
or that you learned the most? Can you talk about that hackathon?

280
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.770
<v 1>Sure. Um, actually the Facebook one was the number,</v>

281
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.740
like probably the life changing moment.

282
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.420
Cause that was the first one that I want. And, um,

283
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.160
it was literally right after I learned about like restful services.

284
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.230
Can we just built the credit credit at the Facebook? And we won based on that.

285
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:57.560
Wow.

286
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.100
Like that really changed my mind that like I thought hackathons were for these

287
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:03.620
like nerdy, like super like, you know.

288
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.630
<v 0>It's not, yeah. It's not in line most of the times when I go to hackathons,</v>

289
00:15:07.631 --> 00:15:09.460
they're all like full knees. Yeah. No,

290
00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.460
I honestly hate that because they just spit out like all these technologies that

291
00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:15.520
they don't know how to use just to just like sound smart stuff.

292
00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:19.600
Imposter syndrome. Yeah. But yeah. So, okay. So you made a crude up, like what,

293
00:15:19.601 --> 00:15:20.434
what did it do? Like.

294
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.740
<v 1>So that was basically it,</v>

295
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:27.660
the whole theme was to report like sexual abuse. So we made, uh,

296
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:32.110
an app where basically people who are like

297
00:15:32.111 --> 00:15:36.100
consultants and like people who have like skills to help people who, you know,

298
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:37.570
got traumatized.

299
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.960
Like they could connect on one side and like they could be on their messenger or

300
00:15:40.961 --> 00:15:44.260
whatever. And then the other, like people who actually needed help,

301
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:48.200
they could go in and it was like kind of connecting them on the honestly got it.

302
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.380
<v 0>Yeah. That's actually a really cool cause. Like I like to tell people a lot, um,</v>

303
00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.010
about making apps, you know, like it's not about the latest technology.

304
00:15:57.011 --> 00:16:01.090
It's not about how good your technology is, especially because I kind of, uh,

305
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.060
I'm leaving on the product side now I care about, you know,

306
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.520
does your product add value to a person's life? Yeah.

307
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.450
Building a simple rest API by having tremendous value to it. For example,

308
00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:15.370
you know, the app that you make is a lot more important than using all the fancy

309
00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:16.030
technology.

310
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.210
<v 1>No, that's true. And then most of the judges, they don't care. Exactly know.</v>

311
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.810
They just want to know they just want a good presentation and that good picture,

312
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.070
you know, so yeah.

313
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.430
<v 0>That's it cool. Uh, so what about like the interview for capital one?</v>

314
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.563
How'd you prepare for that?

315
00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:33.280
<v 1>So, you know, standard cracking the coding interviews. Um,</v>

316
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.590
I went to like meetups where they did an interview preps.

317
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.610
I talked to some of my other bootcamp grads.

318
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:41.800
We kinda got together and like asked each other questions,

319
00:16:41.801 --> 00:16:43.630
like lots and lots of HackerRank problems.

320
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.940
<v 0>So when you actually did the interview,</v>

321
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.850
did you feel prepared because of the cracking decoding interviews?

322
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:49.480
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

323
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.160
definitely cracking like that book is probably the Holy

324
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:57.060
grail of like programming and every questions is great.

325
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.700
<v 0>So what's the percentage of like technical questions and like non-technical</v>

326
00:17:00.701 --> 00:17:02.200
questions. And do you think those matter?

327
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:06.250
<v 1>So for capital one, um, they made me do a take home.</v>

328
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.000
So I created a react app where like I listed like once a bank tracks,

329
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.590
transactions and stuff. And then they had like four people interview me.

330
00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.890
So there was two like three technical interviews.

331
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.060
So they asked me like a lot of technical questions. I did some white boarding.

332
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.820
Um, and then we have one behavior questions. Cool.

333
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:27.760
<v 0>Cool. Nice. Okay. So a lot of those traditional coding.</v>

334
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.370
<v 1>Yeah. Traditional, like I'm not sure exactly the percentage,</v>

335
00:17:30.371 --> 00:17:32.080
but it was a lot of coding. Yeah.

336
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.790
<v 0>Cool. All right. So back to personal life, um, yeah. How old is your kid now?</v>

337
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.230
<v 1>Yeah, my kids like, uh, three months, he just had his hundred day, man.</v>

338
00:17:41.231 --> 00:17:42.790
It's crazy. They're going like this.

339
00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:46.570
<v 0>Are you going to, is it a he or she is, are you going to make him a programmer?</v>

340
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.160
<v 1>Yeah, I am actually, well, I mean, who knows.</v>

341
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.000
<v 0>What they're going to grow up to revise. Okay. Parenting,</v>

342
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.780
are we going to change into a parenting channel now? But yeah.

343
00:17:56.781 --> 00:17:58.580
So question how,

344
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.080
like I always thought that parents always try to raise their kids in ways that

345
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:05.330
they've never been raised before, you know,

346
00:18:05.331 --> 00:18:08.960
because they kind of want to either one that vicariously through their kids or

347
00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:12.170
to have their kids live the life they couldn't have. Do you think that's true?

348
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.193
Are you going to do that?

349
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:18.320
<v 1>I had a really good childhood, so I love my parents. I still like,</v>

350
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.610
we're kind of lucky in a sense where I know a lot of people don't like speak to

351
00:18:22.611 --> 00:18:25.070
their parents often and once they grow up and have their own family,

352
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.720
but we talk like every day.

353
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.670
So I want to try to encourage them to do like, kind of raised them similarly,

354
00:18:31.671 --> 00:18:35.780
but there's different things. Like they're really strict on school and I,

355
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.420
I'm not a school guy, so I want to,

356
00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:42.080
I just want them to be passionate about something. I don't care what it is.

357
00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.293
Like I say programming.

358
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.580
<v 0>Yeah. I guess that makes sense. Cause like for my parents,</v>

359
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.540
I think the reason why they were probably stricter on school was because they

360
00:18:50.541 --> 00:18:53.930
don't want me to end up like them where they don't have like good jobs and stuff

361
00:18:53.931 --> 00:18:57.650
like that. So they want me to just be decently wealthy, to live a normal life.

362
00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:01.850
And then for me, imagine if I had a kid in my mind, what I would do is like, Oh,

363
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.840
I have a decent living.

364
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.890
It's okay if they fail at school because I want them to live the life I can

365
00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:10.250
have, which is, you know, to express your artistic freedom, you know,

366
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:12.890
to do more art classes because I didn't do that much. Sure. You know,

367
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.930
and there were a lot of sports I wanted to do,

368
00:19:14.931 --> 00:19:17.990
but we just didn't have the money to do it. So I think if I had a kid,

369
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.590
I would be like, yo man, like guitar and do that. But I think he would be like,

370
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.270
you're. Yeah. I don't want to do any pushing me. I just want to good in school,

371
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:32.900
but yeah, you gotta find yourself, find yourself, dude, go through YouTube,

372
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:37.040
go fly that. There's no travel, travel on it. No,

373
00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:41.600
I just want to go to Stanford and study, but yeah. Cool. Nice.

374
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.190
So I guess, um, yeah. Uh, thank you so, so much for coming in and uh, yeah.

375
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:49.280
Things are very invaluable. Yeah. You wanna, you know,

376
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.540
plug your channel and film.

377
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.320
<v 1>Yeah, I got it. Um, yeah. So my name is John, as I mentioned, um,</v>

378
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.260
you guys can check me out at Solon coated,

379
00:19:56.261 --> 00:19:58.610
like for everything like Instagram and YouTube.

380
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.730
I do a lot of like programming related, like, you know,

381
00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:04.880
lecture type videos and a little bit of like logging type videos.

382
00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:05.714
So come check me out.

383
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.490
<v 0>I think that's about it. And thank you for watching. See you guys next time,</v>
