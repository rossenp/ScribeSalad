00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>How do you describe software engineering to dates without them getting it'd be</v>

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:05.400
really important. Help me.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.260
What's popping. Good morning.

4
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.870
I hope you guys are having an offense tastic Thursday,

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.780
that today I'm just going to get a few engineers to answer some of these

6
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.320
questions that you asked me on the previous blog. If you haven't seen that,

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:26.610
it's this one, a lot of good questions and hopefully good answers from us.

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.350
One more thing. I just want to say, thank you so much for 2,500 subscribers. Um,

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.280
wow. Like, yeah, we grew pretty fast, so I'm pretty happy about that. It's all.

10
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.170
Thanks to you guys. So thank you so much.

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.410
I'll also talk about the AirPod giveaway at the end of this video.

12
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.350
So stick around. All right. So it's time to go to work.

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.440
You slacked me. I know you are. I want to make a video of me.

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.640
Can you answer some CS questions for me? And once he asks questions,

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.380
she has advice. Questions. You have some rain. Come, come, come, come, come.

16
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.300
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's pop. And dude, what's up, dude?

17
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.180
I I'll make a video of me. No, really? Come on. Just ask some questions.

18
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.800
I need engineers to ask. Okay. Dope. Dope. Dope. Let's go.

19
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.500
All right. All right. All right. Ready?

20
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.070
What let's you guys get close to clinicals, but like you're my friends,

21
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.010
you know, pretend you're my friend. What's up guys. All right.

22
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:33.110
So remember I did a Q and a before,

23
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.640
or I asked you to do a Q and a on my last video when I had a thousand

24
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:41.510
subscribers. Now I'm going to answer that. So let's go through it. Okay.

25
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.880
First question by Omar.

26
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.760
Santiago is software engineer and easy major.

27
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.920
It is for me. What do you mean? Why does it make any sense? Okay.

28
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:52.701
So in Waterloo,

29
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:57.010
there is a software engineering major and it is it's,

30
00:01:57.011 --> 00:02:00.260
it's not as easy as the computer science major, which is what I did.

31
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.800
Next question. Hmm. Wait, there's a difference. Yeah,

32
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.220
there was a difference CS major.

33
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.870
So we have engineering and also we have like sciences.

34
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.200
So I took a bachelor of science in computer science,

35
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.380
and then most people can get an engineering degree in sovereign engineer,

36
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.670
hurricane. How'd you get how'd you learn to get so good at break. Dancing

37
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.060
is not good. That's not true. My video. I was pretty godly.

38
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.610
Oh my God. But yeah, I was just born like,

39
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.800
Oh. This question. So long. Next

40
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.930
question. There's so many questions. Okay. Jake,

41
00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.810
Nicole asks I find tech quite intimidating,

42
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:47.420
so channel's definitely an eye-opener. Thanks.

43
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.590
So what do tech companies care about which university you went to or is it

44
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:55.790
really down to internships and experience when starting in the industry? Um,

45
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.310
I don't think that your school matters too much,

46
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.930
but it does matter in terms of like what companies might come to like career

47
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.570
fairs, just how good your career is.

48
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.720
Like you probably like at your school is smaller.

49
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.000
You might have to put in more effort to reach out two.

50
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:15.630
I get the impression that tech people are quite busy and I do see some people

51
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.850
coding on public transportation. So how's life outside of tech job. Well,

52
00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:24.540
my life is great, but,

53
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.210
but that's because I'm a data scientist and we don't do coding as much,

54
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.300
but yeah, I don't know life outside of tech, but for me,

55
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:36.900
I just do a lot of videos lately. So I don't really have a social life.

56
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.610
You guys have a social life? Yeah. I think work life balance is pretty good.

57
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.430
It's just that there are ups and downs, I guess.

58
00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:48.750
So sometimes it gets like really busy and sometimes a lot of downtime.

59
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.310
So I don't think we're always busy.

60
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.630
How long does it take to learn a language before being qualified to use it for

61
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:59.460
work? I don't think you even need to learn the language before you're qualified

62
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.300
because just don't tell them that you don't know it. You'll be fine.

63
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.670
You can tell them it's fine. No, like if you want a job,

64
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.880
just tell them, you know, that language. And then once you get the interview,

65
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.410
that's when you learn the language, am I right? That's a terrible advice.

66
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.620
Just call them which languages, you know?

67
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:23.640
And they'll let you code in that language. And once you get to the company,

68
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:27.240
you can learn whatever language they use. Yeah. That's what I meant. I mean,

69
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.060
yeah. You could learn the language on the job, but yeah.

70
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.600
Are you still doing the regular blogs if you mean my startup series? Yes.

71
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.890
Episode three is coming out soon. I'm probably going to publish it February 1st.

72
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.900
So you have to be on the lookout for that favorite music. K-pop all right.

73
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.620
Another long question. All right. Number one.

74
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.370
How do you rate your university experience at Waterloo? It was great.

75
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.820
No, all you're really selling your soul right here. It was fine.

76
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.930
Lots of internships. Really good at a lot of friends. Um, yeah.

77
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.020
Courses are pretty easy. How did you start learning to code?

78
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.180
I went to college and there was a code. Why didn't you take the CS class?

79
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.530
Oh, well cause, cause my brother took the CS class, so then they,

80
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:18.150
he told me that there's lots of money in tech. So then I, I started doing tech.

81
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.560
Oh, what inspired you to become a programmer? Yeah, it was lucrative.

82
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:26.820
So I wanted to know what are TV shows you like to watch?

83
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.390
What do you like to watch? Do you like

84
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.600
[inaudible], what's your favorite city in the entire world? Soul.

85
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.980
[inaudible] I'm a career. Boop. What advice would you give to a teenager?

86
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:45.570
Trying to make it out there in a tech world.

87
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.080
Make sure you do want to come to tech before you decide.

88
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.710
Cause you're still a teenager and uh, yeah, I would,

89
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.490
I would also suggest you to get a girlfriend before coming to college.

90
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.490
Cause it gets in tech, in tech, in computer science. Yes.

91
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:02.324
It's true. It's true.

92
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.130
Are there any downsides to working in tech

93
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.060
downsides? Yeah. I don't know. You just have too much money and I'm like,

94
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.780
this is hard to like true. Is that true?

95
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.450
Like everyone's in tag and then it's just like your normal. Yeah.

96
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.830
So lack of diversity. That's that's one problem. Like I'm trying to make,

97
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.380
you know, artistic friends, but you know, none of these people are artistic.

98
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:32.300
So how do you know why Jennifer

99
00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.910
[inaudible] alright. Next cherry Berry asked what colors are under beds.

100
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.520
Okay. Real question. Do you actually intend to start a startup? Okay.

101
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.080
Roll answer. Uh, I'm on a TN visa, so I'm not allowed to,

102
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:59.270
to start my own business or have any other income, other debt.

103
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.800
My actual job right now. Sasquatch cat. Squatch ask Lamar.

104
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.270
I love your sense of humor. Personality. Thanks. All right. Your videos

105
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.601
[inaudible] was a question.

106
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:15.200
My question is what tips advice would you give to a high schooler?

107
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.720
Trying to become a Sweden? The future?

108
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.870
Any do's or don'ts love your videos by the way.

109
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.510
I hated since in high school. Oh,

110
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:30.100
what'd you what'd you end up coming back then because I took it again in college

111
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:32.890
and it was a lot better. Um,

112
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.160
I would suggest doing a lot of side projects,

113
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.460
like just making a website for yourself,

114
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:43.750
even thought would be good and internships. Now high schoolers have internships.

115
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.520
Now don't do an internship before you go to college. Just take that summer up.

116
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.850
Oh yeah. True. Go get a girlfriend.

117
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.260
Look at me now. All right. Your videos,

118
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.130
your videos provide so much detailed information about internships.

119
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.080
I absolutely love it. Question.

120
00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:05.170
How do you compare the work and tech companies and quantify Nance.

121
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.750
And can you intro your brother?

122
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.140
Why does my brother always get the spotlight in Quantico?

123
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.090
I guess the biggest difference is that quantum researchers are versus

124
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:20.950
FinTech companies. Software engineers are first citizens, Jesse Chan.

125
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.340
What is one thing about tech industry programming that annoys you?

126
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.610
What is something you wish you could change about the industry?

127
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.400
Love your videos. Keep it up. Thank you. I guess,

128
00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:34.960
for females going into tech, it's pretty different.

129
00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:39.730
There's a lot of pain points, obviously because of the gender,

130
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.650
gender. I want to say inequality, like lack of diversity gender.

131
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.550
Um, for example, during one of my internships,

132
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.870
I was the only girl in the team of 10 engineers.

133
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.510
And that's pretty to deal with, especially culturally,

134
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.000
um, like they like things that you might may not necessarily like,

135
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:04.170
and it's hard to fit in,

136
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.580
but those are just one of those things that are improving slowly.

137
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:13.590
And that's why we need more girls to come into tech so that that trend can

138
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:16.560
change. Congrats are a milestone bro.

139
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.610
Question for you as someone who seems quite busy on a daily basis,

140
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:24.720
what would you say are some of your keys to productivity and accomplishment on a

141
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:29.040
way keys to productivity and accomplishing your goals? I guess,

142
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:32.730
manage your time. I mean, so

143
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.520
I guess once I found the most useful is, I don't know,

144
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.760
just start using a calendar and time box your stuff, you know,

145
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:44.730
to make sure that you don't go overboard. Kevin Walter asked,

146
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.350
can you get a job at a big company that USA as a terminal graduate students?

147
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.540
Yes. Oh yeah. Probably.

148
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:55.710
You just have to apply to like a big company or any company that would sponsor

149
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:58.940
you and they'll give you like an H1B visa and you could stay

150
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.680
exhorted his when applying for your first tech job.

151
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.680
How do you know when you're ready? At what point do you just go for it?

152
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.620
And what advice do you have to be ready for it? First tech job.

153
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.690
You're always ready. You're always ready. Okay. Just believe in yourself.

154
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:23.490
Just apply. Just apply. Because like, if you fail then,

155
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.050
okay. You know, you're not ready, but like

156
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.150
[inaudible] what is it like working with other professionals,

157
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:38.010
software engineers, professional software engineers like us.

158
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.600
Oh really? Oh, we're very professional.

159
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:49.050
Very demanding. You know, they're very professional, but yeah, no,

160
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.350
it's just the same thing as working with normal engineers, I guess.

161
00:10:52.351 --> 00:10:56.010
I don't know. It's the same as working in a school project. Kind of.

162
00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.510
Do you have any pieces of advice such as things to avoid in the workplace?

163
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:04.620
As in asking dumb questions? Wow. Come on, man.

164
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:07.070
There's no such thing as a dumb question. Kind of.

165
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.210
Well, like you should always, you shouldn't just ask everything.

166
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:17.600
You should still like try to figure it out on your own.

167
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.430
And if after like 30 minutes or an hour and you still don't get it,

168
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:26.570
then you should ask them. Who is your current favorite music? Artists.

169
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.300
Black. Oh, what would you say?

170
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:38.000
What is your skincare routine before moving on from one language to another.

171
00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:40.310
How comfortable should I be in the first week?

172
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.990
And you're just looking at my skin. It's not that good. Why, why?

173
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.350
Why is he asking you? [inaudible]

174
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.430
uh what's because I'll ask him the girls. Okay, fine.

175
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:57.270
What is your senior routine? Korean skincare team. Okay.

176
00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.700
Well, I can tell you mine versus you use toner,

177
00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.360
then you use moist or like face wash.

178
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.710
Now you use tone and then you baseline what? My work is around.

179
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.000
Wait, wait. Okay. Funny face. Okay. Face wash and tone. Okay.

180
00:12:12.001 --> 00:12:12.900
Clearly I don't do it.

181
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.800
I actually just put water in my face and then I put moisturizer. Yeah.

182
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.610
I'd open wash my face to be honest, but yeah. Um,

183
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:25.440
what else is called the mask and like put the mask on sometimes masks mask.

184
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.300
Okay. What's your favorite part about your current job?

185
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.970
I think my favorite part is to pupil.

186
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.810
Aw, wait, can you do it again? But with like more genuine,

187
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.460
my favorite part is the people. Oh,

188
00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:50.040
sorry. [inaudible]

189
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.330
another great video Jolla. Yeah.

190
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.800
I can see you definitely hitting those 10 K before the summer. Anyways.

191
00:12:58.801 --> 00:13:02.610
One question. Are you actually working right now? If so,

192
00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:05.250
what tech do you work on your daily life?

193
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.230
So I'm actually a data scientist and I worked for a decently large company in

194
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:13.200
Silicon Valley, Simon FOM asks,

195
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.740
what are some important attributes you like to see in a fellow software

196
00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:20.910
engineer? Well, I mean, it's not like I'm a manager or anything,

197
00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:22.950
so it doesn't really matter. But I mean,

198
00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:26.400
I usually like engineers who also have empathy,

199
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.480
meaning they actually know what they're building and who they're building it for

200
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.480
so that, you know, they care more about the product.

201
00:13:33.481 --> 00:13:37.170
When you build stuff also wonder code doesn't suck. Right?

202
00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.250
Cause there's a lot of code out there. I've seen your dis

203
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.030
good mentors being good mentors. Like if you know how to do something,

204
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.600
just teach the other person and don't be a Dick about it.

205
00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.430
Pineapple asks K as a lot of my heart is set on iOS developer.

206
00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:01.380
Well, to answer this question, um, to be an iOS developer the best way, wait,

207
00:14:01.381 --> 00:14:05.370
I don't, I don't know what that means. I think it's just one major.

208
00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:09.540
Do you need a major? I was like, what is the better? Yeah, better it does.

209
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.500
I thought, well,

210
00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:15.180
maybe it is made better to be too good to be an iOS

211
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:19.080
developer. Is it better? Is it better to be an iOS developer?

212
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:20.670
I better answer this one.

213
00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:25.290
First C S med heart that said I always

214
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:29.340
developer [inaudible] tengo, mucho, dinero,

215
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.413
whatever. Screw it.

216
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.380
[inaudible] how do you describe software engineering?

217
00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:44.020
Two dates followed them getting it'd be really important. Help me.

218
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.590
That's a good question. Um,

219
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.970
I never tell them at first that I'm a software engineer or I work in tech.

220
00:14:55.971 --> 00:14:59.840
So say that you get to build cool, cool products.

221
00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:05.540
Lots of cool products that you use daily. Yeah. Oh,

222
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:08.720
that's true. Yeah. If you're in a big tech company or like a popular one,

223
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:11.960
like Snapchat, you can just say, Oh, I work for Snapchat.

224
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.640
And then they're just like, Oh really? Those are the girls.

225
00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:20.890
I mean, it's not an exciting company.

226
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:26.230
You're, dude. Just keep it short. Yeah. I guess, I don't know.

227
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.100
Describe your hobbies and stuff like yeah. Right.

228
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:34.480
David Kwan asked great videos looking to get in the tech industry myself on my

229
00:15:34.481 --> 00:15:37.690
first co-op term for systems and design engineering at Wharton right now.

230
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.710
Oh wow. Nice. A fellow Walter, the kid. So these videos help a lot.

231
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.060
This is pretty general,

232
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:47.110
but people always say to do projects and I was wondering what sorts of things to

233
00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:50.770
do that we'll get good experience and or good.

234
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.980
I actually don't like, um, like it's fair,

235
00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:58.510
but I don't like people who only do projects because it looks good on your

236
00:15:58.511 --> 00:16:01.000
resume. Cause I don't know, because first of all,

237
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:04.120
it doesn't even seem like you care about it. But I mean,

238
00:16:04.121 --> 00:16:05.410
if you really have to then yeah.

239
00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.440
I'd probably do some web projects full stacks just to show that, you know,

240
00:16:08.441 --> 00:16:10.630
every part of the stack, but yeah. I mean,

241
00:16:10.631 --> 00:16:13.270
I would recommend you do something that you enjoy and you have fun because it

242
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:18.250
would probably make it better anyways, if you do like doing it. All right. Okay.

243
00:16:18.251 --> 00:16:20.800
So thank you so much for all of these questions. Um,

244
00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.860
I hope this was helpful for you guys. Uh, yeah,

245
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.920
I guess I'll see you later back at home. Peace.

246
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.040
Yeah. It's too cheesy. I guess I'll do it. Yeah. I can't reach,

247
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:41.350
I can't reach. All right.

248
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.390
So I just want to say big,

249
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.150
thanks to all my friends who participated in the video.

250
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.170
If you want to follow them on Instagram, you can. I'll just put them down below.

251
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.740
Also. I want to say AirPods, the contest is still running.

252
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.580
It's going to run until January 30th and here it is.

253
00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.620
These are the AirPods that you will receive. Ooh,

254
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:06.130
man, it's disgusting. The contest is not over,

255
00:17:06.131 --> 00:17:08.560
so it's not too late to participate.

256
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.830
All you have to do is you follow me on Instagram and on Twitter.

257
00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:14.200
So that will give you two entries to the contest.

258
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.290
So for the questions I did not answer so, so sorry,

259
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:21.160
I just didn't have enough time and it would make the video too long. But uh,

260
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.450
if you messaged me on Instagram,

261
00:17:22.451 --> 00:17:26.890
I will answer you and I'll probably give a better answer and a serious answer.

262
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.010
So it's probably even better if you asked me on Instagram, once again,

263
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.310
thank you so much for watching you guys are the best. Thank you for the support.

264
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.680
I just want to say that, you know, because of you guys,

265
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:40.630
it really pushes me to make the first entertainment channel for tech people

266
00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.570
by tech people. I just want to say again, this is really important to me,

267
00:17:43.571 --> 00:17:47.440
but I just want to make tech more open and accessible and entertaining.

268
00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.910
