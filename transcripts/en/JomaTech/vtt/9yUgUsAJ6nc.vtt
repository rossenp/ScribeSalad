00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>I want to say, sorry in advance. Um, I'm kind of sick. So I,</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.470
I might cough a lot,

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.950
which is why this video will be heavily edited and, um,

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.390
small announcements. I remember I used to have, um, free resumes. Uh,

5
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.110
I would share my resume and my resume template,

6
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.680
my cover letters and my cover letter templates to you guys. Um,

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.930
that link has been broken for the past six months, but I finally fixed them.

8
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:32.310
So they're during to description now. So you guys can check that out. Sorry.

9
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:35.640
It took so long, but all right, let's start the video. Okay.

10
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:39.990
So the first story I want to talk about is that there was someone who had a

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.400
Google offer for $277,000,

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.330
total compensation at Google. And I thought that was pretty cool.

13
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:52.020
And I was extremely jealous, but this story was on blind. Uh,

14
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.170
in case you don't know what blind is, is this a anonymous forum?

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.760
It's kind of like Reddit, but for work,

16
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.070
I stumbled upon this post on blind it's about this person who got a Google

17
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:06.120
offer and he said it was thanks to blind. You know,

18
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:09.990
he came from a CS background at a no name public university, apparently.

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.670
And he had three years of experience in the midsize tech company making

20
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.370
150 K. Okay.

21
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.770
And then after his hard work interviewing what happened is he ended up

22
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.800
with $277,000,

23
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:28.950
total compensation as an L for at Google.

24
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.840
If this isn't the American dream, I don't know what it is now.

25
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.050
The thread was huge. Uh, as you can see,

26
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:39.780
there were so many people congratulating him and asking him,

27
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.280
follow up questions, blah, blah, blah.

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.490
The thread is definitely worth reading for people who want to interview for

29
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:47.910
Google because he gives actual a lot of tips. But I don't care about that.

30
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.770
I read it because I never had anyone congratulate me for my job.

31
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.540
So I kind of pretended that was me. Yeah. Anyways,

32
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.940
let's see how he did it. I think that's what you guys care about.

33
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.180
So apparently the first thing he did is he read, uh,

34
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.100
let's see elements of programming interviews, which is a, uh, a book it's a,

35
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.720
Oh, he bought the Java version.

36
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.640
He said that I wouldn't have even heard about this book without seeing it

37
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.200
mentioned on blank. What a Brown noser,

38
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.360
good book though. But, um,

39
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.450
I actually used the Python version because I'm a snake.

40
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.290
And then after that he leaked coated classic classic.

41
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.303
He said,

42
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.690
I don't think I would have done as much leak code as I did if I wasn't stressed

43
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:39.950
so much on blind, grow those man. Seriously.

44
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.700
Why don't you just go marry blind if you like blind so much, man,

45
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.420
I hate this guy anyways. And then the third thing he did,

46
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.750
he also said that he used algo expert.io,

47
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.100
a site where you can practice coding interviews along with video explanations.

48
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.460
Now I'm kidding. He, no, he didn't. He didn't use algo, but he could have,

49
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.440
and it probably would have been worth it just saying. So for lead code,

50
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.280
apparently he did 30 questions, 30 easy,

51
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.080
50 medium and 20 hard like mine. And then when he interviewed at Google,

52
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:17.790
he said that he had six total, two interviews, one phone call,

53
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.360
which was a 45 minutes and then five onsite,

54
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.870
which were also all 45 minutes. And one of them,

55
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:28.800
he said was a behavioral interview. And yeah,

56
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.180
apparently Google does that now.

57
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.870
And I heard that they call it a Googley interview. Yeah.

58
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.640
They want to know how googly you are. If you don't know what means, uh,

59
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.700
for them it means, um, it just means that you're not a jerk.

60
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.740
If you're a Googley, then it means you're not a jerk.

61
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.380
So they're just making sure of that. For example,

62
00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:51.330
if you're subscribed to this channel, you're googly. And if you talk about me,

63
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.900
because of all my ads, then that is not Google-y. Yeah.

64
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.050
And he said the rest of the interviews were all pure coding,

65
00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.610
no and design questions.

66
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.050
After he passed all the interviews for the negotiating part, he said,

67
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.100
I received three competing offers of about 250,000,

68
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.050
but thanks to blind, thanks to blind.

69
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.790
I knew Google could pay more.

70
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.720
So he had an initial offer from Google for $250,000,

71
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.150
which was already pretty good by itself.

72
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.160
And then he used all those $250,000 offers to try to boost him

73
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.000
up. So I think he did some negotiating back and forth between the companies and

74
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:32.940
eventually, Oh, actually wait, let me,

75
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.920
he actually lied saying that the paid two 70,000 instead of two 50,000,

76
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.590
they said that the offers were actually two 70,000,

77
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.870
which eventually got him to 277,000 from Google.

78
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.480
You know, I do not condone lying. That is extremely unethical.

79
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.200
So don't get caught. Speaking of unethical and lying.

80
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.000
Facebook is actually the worst place for work-life balance.

81
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:03.930
According to our survey, I'm just kidding. I love Facebook.

82
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.990
Facebook is great. Love the company, love the people.

83
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.670
One of the best cultures out there.

84
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.040
There was a thread on blind where they asked you if they worked over 40

85
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:14.490
hours.

86
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.230
And if they worked during the weekend and Facebook has the highest rate

87
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.210
of 68%,

88
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.980
meaning 68% of them reported working 40 hours or more compared to Google,

89
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:27.870
which was 42%,

90
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.730
46% reported working on weekends for Facebook while Google only

91
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:37.620
19%. I'm actually surprised LinkedIn is there with 47%,

92
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.870
which surprised me because when I was there, they barely worked a week days.

93
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.700
And then question number three was,

94
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.300
do you feel pressure slash stress due to fear of PIP,

95
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.430
which is a performance improvement plan,

96
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.210
which means you're going to get fired soon or layoffs. Of course,

97
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.910
number one was Netflix with 80% of the people,

98
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.380
meaning everyone is scared shitless of getting fired,

99
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.140
which is the line of what I heard about the culture is that, you know,

100
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:04.970
they just fire people when they don't need them,

101
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.750
but that's why their products are so good. Amazon was 76%.

102
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.300
Facebook was 41% wellness, a big drop,

103
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.820
but it's still high compared to Google with a 30 to 13% and

104
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:18.860
Microsoft of 7%. Honestly,

105
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.490
I think a high layoff rate is actually pretty good because it keeps their

106
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:23.810
employees on their toes.

107
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.190
I would hate to have freeloaders and under-performers on my team is it's just

108
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.660
not fun. It drags you down.

109
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.920
And I also love to gossip whenever people are getting fired because that's

110
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.730
juicy. Of course these numbers are not conclusive.

111
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.680
I mean the sample size is extremely small and it's also biased. I know,

112
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.830
I know I'm pretty good with stats. I mean, what can I say?

113
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.870
I was a data scientist.

114
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.510
<v 1>Now.</v>

115
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.920
<v 0>Another thing I want to talk about,</v>

116
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.030
I want to talk about people complaining about my ads in my videos.

117
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.660
Now I want you to know this is actually a very common thing for you tubers to

118
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:03.860
do. And this YouTuber, Dan mace explains it perfectly.

119
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.940
<v 2>Before you start commenting, Oh wait meeting an ad, a sponsored video.</v>

120
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:08.260
You hurting my eyes, wasting my time.

121
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.870
Let me tell you something about sponsored videos.

122
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.020
The brand doesn't have anything to say over the actual content. If anything,

123
00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:16.030
you should be stoked because for me as a creator,

124
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.270
I'm getting paid in order to make these films. And in order to make more films.

125
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.260
<v 0>I just have an addiction. Like I can't stop myself. You know,</v>

126
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.660
now I don't want to generalize. Right.

127
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.310
But I'm pretty sure that most of you, if you were in my position,

128
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.020
like not all, but most of you would do the same. If you were in my position,

129
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.880
would you put an ad? If they pay you $10,000 to do it?

130
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.410
Not so principled anymore. Aren't you dude.

131
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.610
I would suck a Dick for $10,000. Just kidding. Just kidding.

132
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.490
I do it for a hundred bucks, but yeah, I mean,

133
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:53.350
I actually don't think that many people are complaining.

134
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.580
I just really want to say that joke was this funny. Okay. Whatever.

135
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.420
In other news, apparently Jake Paul dissed,

136
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.860
the whole software engineering career, there was a video of Jake Paul.

137
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.510
Uh, let's see. Yeah.

138
00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.400
A YouTuber that confronted this other utuber his name was Cody Ko and I'm

139
00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:17.410
actually a fan Cody coasts. I might be biased,

140
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.940
but Cody Cole made a funny commentary about him saying on all like some

141
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:22.600
criticism,

142
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.400
he made another video where Jake Paul confronts Cody Ko to stop bullying,

143
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:30.610
stop internet bullying. When he described Cody Ko,

144
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.900
he said that Cody Cole was just a small backend developer,

145
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.510
a backend tech dude. I forgot what he said, but here's the.

146
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.040
<v 1>I saw this Cody Ko guy for the first time when he was working at full screen,</v>

147
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.790
which is like a YouTube community network as like a little, uh,

148
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.410
backend tech developer.

149
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.770
<v 0>He just single-handedly disrespected a whole career saying that or</v>

150
00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:58.740
career software is small and no skill kind

151
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:02.430
of a thing, but it's okay. Cause at least Cody Cole has her back.

152
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.640
<v 3>Just a little puny, little backend tech developer,</v>

153
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.200
just so disrespectful.

154
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:14.810
Just belittling an entire career in one little statement. It's not cool,

155
00:09:14.811 --> 00:09:17.900
dude. You can come from me as much as you want,

156
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.040
but don't come from my fellow software engineers. That's where I draw the line.

157
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.670
<v 0>Speaking of celebrities, the next story isn't about tech,</v>

158
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.110
but it's about Constance BU actress from crazy rich Asians.

159
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.880
She's also an actress from an ABC show called fresh off the boat.

160
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.930
And recently it got renewed. So apparently what happened is that on Twitter,

161
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.620
she actually started saying stuff like, Oh sake,

162
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.910
start swearing and expressing how much she was annoyed by the show being

163
00:09:46.911 --> 00:09:49.220
renewed. And people were shocked about this.

164
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.270
Now what happened was she probably had a contract that binded her in the show

165
00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:56.120
for like maybe five years or six years. I don't know how many years,

166
00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:59.510
but she would have to continue filming for fresh off the boat.

167
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:03.320
But because of a recent success of crazy rich Asians and stuff like that,

168
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:06.710
she probably had better opportunities coming in, but she could not take them.

169
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.810
She could not take them more fulfilling job Rose because she has to do a

170
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.740
fresh off the boat. So on Twitter, she was just saying like, Oh this. Like,

171
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:18.230
I hate that. Okay. I forgot what she said exactly.

172
00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:20.270
But it was pretty disrespectful to, to show.

173
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.950
I think it's honestly fine to be dissatisfied with something or like

174
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.300
dissatisfied with your current job. If you have better opportunities coming in.

175
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.670
That's totally fine. I understand that.

176
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.410
But I think it's extremely disrespectful to publicly curse your

177
00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:38.840
employers, right? I mean, isn't an awkward,

178
00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:42.260
if you go back to work next year with the same employer,

179
00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:46.220
fresh off the boat and everyone knows that you just hate your job.

180
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.580
Like how are you supposed to work with them now? It's terrible.

181
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.590
So I just want to end this video by saying.

182
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.230
<v 4>That was an extremely Google-y thing you did.</v>

183
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:58.520
All right.
