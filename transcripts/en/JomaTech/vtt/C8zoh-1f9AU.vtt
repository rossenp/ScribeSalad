So what we're doing is we're doing work from home Fridays.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.390
I can't speak too loudly right now because you know,

8
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:31.550
most of the people are sleeping. It's actually 7:00 AM now,

<v 0>I think I forgot your question or something. Cause like</v>

20
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.260
I'm basically on call.

21
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.963
I'm just going to stay.

22
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.250
<v 1>I still have to answer an email. Really?</v>

23
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.700
[

24
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.610
inaudible]. Why did I go.

25
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.870
<v 1>Yeah. What are you doing? I just got, I just got a text.</v>

27
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.700
I have to do something real quick, dude. We're in the middle of a run chart.

28
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.690
I'll take only a second. It's so slow.

29
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:18.180
Are you serious? Shady to hotspot. Holy.

30
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.550
Just imagine I told you man, should I stay at home? Holy.

31
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.450
This is absurd. Yeah. Does your manager know you're in Tahoe?

32
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.780
Uh. Well, he knows I'm working from home,

33
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.970
but yeah, from home. Oh VPN. God.

34
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.650
[inaudible] Holy. How am I supposed to? This is so weird.

35
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:07.980
I was supposed to type on this. Oh my got it. This was

36
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.340
for you a kiss. Oh awesome. Thank you so much. You're the best.

37
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.230
I've never had a kiss before in my life.

38
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.100
My hands are so cold thing and also the clairs are really hard to see.

39
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.740
I'm so stressed bro. I so stressed. at my keyboard.

40
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.190
[inaudible] can we get like for debt, but for one part of it, it's good.

41
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.950
We're just waiting on the other part now. All right. Anyways,

42
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.240
we're going to go back to skiing later,

43
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:49.500
but right now we're just going to do that.

44
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:51.720
So I'm going to skip all this part pace. See you later.

45
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.070
What are you doing now? Better reception here.

46
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.050
Reception is a lot better. I can actually hotspot. Yeah.

47
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.280
I still have to answer this real quick. I haven't done it.

48
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.820
My hands are so cold. There's just something about the laptop. No worries.

49
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.830
Gotta do what you gotta do to make your, make your PM. Happy.

50
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.470
Try my best to stay alive.

51
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.320
Right? Look who is using my laptop right now.

52
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.410
What are you doing right now? Trying to get this quarter. Did you laugh at me?

53
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.030
When I brought my laptop? That's good. Foresight. See you owe me one. Now, dude,

54
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.770
you didn't even bring your own laptop. Now his manager is up on his.

55
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.810
So now he's working. There you go. See, I think I had, you know,

56
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:54.720
you laughed now. Like you've laughed before, but there you go.

57
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.300
I'm actually I ended up being right. All right. Once in awhile.

58
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.270
<v 2>Meanwhile, back at home, we see software engineers in their natural habitat.</v>

59
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.180
Working really hard to produce their quality code.

60
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.510
The laziest of the pack decided to bake cookies.

61
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.180
I was quickly denied of that luxury.

62
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.500
Darn it not again.

63
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.310
<v 0>Good morning was popping up for breakfast.</v>

64
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.970
What the? This is. Should we have combo jelly and eggs? Isn't that?

65
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.843
Normal

66
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.020
yellow brothers.

67
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.063
<v 1>Jesse is so bored. He's.</v>

68
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.660
<v 0>Having fun, Jesse. So how big are you?</v>

69
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.743
Wow.

70
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.850
<v 1>What's popping. Look at this beautiful view. My God. I'm my friend Cyrus again.</v>

71
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.270
How are you doing? Uh, yeah, today's a lot more chill cause it's Saturday.

72
00:07:58.271 --> 00:07:59.920
So I definitely did not need to work today.

73
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:03.610
So that's why I don't have a backpack. I don't have my laptop, but then again,

74
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:06.100
my laptop is broken, so I can't work anyways, but Holy.

75
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.350
<v 0>My laptop. What the?</v>

76
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.220
<v 1>Absolutely beautiful. But yeah,</v>

77
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.720
I guess I'm going to say I might as well say it now. So as you know,

78
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.550
I said last time that was going to give a giveaway at 2,500, um,

79
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.750
subscribers, 5,000 and 10,020 5,000. And I miss all of those.

80
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.580
So that's why I am doing four giveaways. Woo. Get excited.

81
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.830
Unfortunately not AirPods this time. I can't afford AirPods anymore,

82
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.650
but I'm going to do a free giveaway for my merch.

83
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.010
So that means I'm going to pick four winners and I'm going to give you the

84
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.490
detailed later. Probably like not now, cause I can't think of anything,

85
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:50.410
but it's probably going to be following me on Instagram.

86
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.590
Follow me on Twitter and then write a question for me and the best questions

87
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.730
we'll get you free merch and what else?

88
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.700
And then I'll also like send me a video of a, a gentleman parody water.

89
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.270
If you want to buy him water. He was my sponsor code porn,

90
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.480
hub.com/jumo tech, Hey gentlemen,

91
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.510
parody or something like that. And the best one we'll also get free Marsh.

92
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.110
But yeah.

93
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.800
So I'll give you probably like a coupon and if you buy any one of the Birch, uh,

94
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.160
I'm going to try to design more of them. But I think so far,

95
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:27.080
just like a few of them and are pretty cool. But yeah. Yeah. Show me, show me,

96
00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:31.610
show me that. Show me that one 80 bro. Whoo, barely 90.

97
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.280
No, that was not past night. All right. So I am uh,

98
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.260
teaching sunlight. How to snowboard. I am a great teacher.

99
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.350
I want to prove to the world what a great teacher I am.

100
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.413
What do you have to say?

101
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.150
<v 0>Crappy all the time.</v>

102
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.540
<v 1>But it's not because I suck at TJ because she's.</v>

103
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.583
<v 0>No.</v>

104
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.560
<v 1>No. I want to show the world what a great teacher I am. So you better not up.</v>

105
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.420
Excellent. Excellent. And then you break. Don't be afraid.

106
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.080
Cause I think it's all mental. How's it feel?

107
00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:16.460
How's your first time snowboarding tire. Okay. That's good.

108
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:18.350
It means you're using egg, like your leg.

109
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.540
<v 0>All right. Get up, get up, get up.</v>

110
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.090
<v 1>No wonder why your butt's so flat.</v>

111
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.850
There you go. Stop being sideways. Go straight.

112
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.050
<v 0>I, I missed it. I missed it.</v>

113
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.040
<v 1>I actually, I didn't film your face plant. So you're lucky.</v>

114
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.810
<v 0>Well, we got down the first floor. Yeah. Well the house let's go faster.</v>

115
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.960
Ah, ah.

116
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:02.180
<v 1>Can you start doing that? And just like, like, Oh no, like yeah,</v>

117
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.110
like don't move your thing.

118
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.180
Don't don't break. Just, just stay until, until you're too afraid.

119
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:16.670
Like now's a good time to start like this.

120
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.820
<v 0>Woo. That was good. That was good.</v>

121
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.680
Really excited. Nice blogging skills gain. Really good.

122
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.560
There you go.

123
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.460
<v 1>All right. So yeah,</v>

124
00:11:37.461 --> 00:11:41.150
I was just going to take a food break and here's three winners,

125
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.690
not as good as Facebook food, but you know, what can you do?

126
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:48.290
We can do this cost like 45 bucks. I think it's like 15 bucks.

127
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:53.950
<v 0>Sausage sucks. So expensive. And like water's probably 10 bucks.</v>

128
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.470
<v 1>Oh, what a beautiful day. Look at the beautiful blue sky and a sun.</v>

129
00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:03.790
Me trying to get up for like 25 minutes. Oh my gosh.

130
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.380
Every run takes like 30 minutes.

131
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.930
It's because you're too lazy to unstrap because sun me is actually doing really

132
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:11.764
well right now.

133
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.670
I think I'm just going to blog a little bit and talk about my life. Um, yeah.

134
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.910
So what, what, what kind of topics should I talk about? Okay.

135
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.260
A lot of the questions I hear,

136
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.440
I hear about like what coding language or what kind of,

137
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.830
what kind of area you should focus on. But at the end,

138
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.890
I think quarterly language don't matter. It's all about fundamentals.

139
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.920
It's all about fundamentals. So like for example, coding, right?

140
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.040
Like in my mind, PHP C plus plus whatever,

141
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:43.240
if you write normal code or whatever you have in like those coding questions,

142
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.150
it's always so simple. It's always any like loops four loops,

143
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.150
four loops and stuff like that.

144
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.090
And a lot of people ask me what language is learned,

145
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.700
but that doesn't really matter because it's better to learn the,

146
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.030
like the fundamentals and the algorithms and just understanding how to build

147
00:12:58.031 --> 00:12:58.780
products.

148
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.620
And then the reason why you would choose a language is either already libraries

149
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:06.220
or already frameworks or because you're working for a company that's using that

150
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:07.054
language anyways.

151
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.180
And then that's where you would maybe learn a little bit more language.

152
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.370
But most of the big companies, they don't, they don't even care.

153
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.990
<v 0>[Inaudible] Hey, what's coffin. I'm Joe man. We're done for the weekend.</v>

154
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.300
<v 1>Thank you Jennifer, for the intro now. Thank you so much.</v>

155
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.490
I'll don't forget if you liked this video,

156
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.360
don't forget to subscribe and also like the video and also follow me on

I don't want a copyright strike anyways. Yeah. So as I said, you know,

159
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.280

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.490

162
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.920
that's usually not why I do join the weekend, but you know, it's my,

163
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:27.330

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.220

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.320
