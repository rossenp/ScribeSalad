2
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.593
cool.

3
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.943
[inaudible]

4
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.383
[inaudible].

5
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.390
<v 1>Okay. All right. I hope you enjoyed this video. So, I mean,</v>

6
00:06:55.391 --> 00:07:00.130
let's take a break. You want something to drink? Oh, it's a Coca-Cola.

7
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.810
Yeah, sure. Do you want a glass? Let's go get a glass. All right,

8
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:07.560
let me just grab one. Oh my God.

9
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.750
What this video is sponsored by brilliant.org.

10
00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:15.490
I did not expect that anyways. I will continue to video after this message,

11
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.510
by the way, this video was sponsored by brilliant.org,

12
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.200
which is kind of cool because I actually use trillian.org.

13
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.230
When I was applying to my untitled large company,

14
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.350
since the company gave me links to help me prepare for my interview.

15
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.250
And one of the links that they gave me is a bunch of competent torics questions.

16
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.460
AKA probably questions on brilliant.org.

17
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.480
It really helped me on the math part of the interview because I was killing the

18
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:41.680
probability questions.

19
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.560
I actually find it really fun to crank out these questions.

20
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.470
It makes me feel good about myself and keeps me sharp.

21
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.020
And they're good brain teasers for interviews,

22
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.940
especially for data science or quantum.

23
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.410
Very good supplement to my interview preps. So highly recommended. Also,

24
00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:57.280
if you're in school,

25
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:01.660
you could supplement your learning by using this website because there's a wide

26
00:08:01.661 --> 00:08:03.700
variety of topics, which is pretty dope.

27
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:08.140
Cause I love the UI on the website and it makes studying so much more fun with

28
00:08:08.141 --> 00:08:10.450
their quizzes. If you're interested,

29
00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:13.210
there's a link in the description down below. Best of all,

30
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:16.420
you can get 20% off their premium subscription. So YouTube,

31
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:20.920
you can kill it at the interview for the large entitled company. All right.

32
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:22.810

thank you for supporting this channel. And we got one question from honey.

35
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.990
What do you do during weekends? Well,

36
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.560
I do a lot of stuff I film and then I edit my video.

37
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:39.130
Sometimes I hang out with Matt Cho. I like to try new restaurants.

38
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.440
I like to go to the gym. That's pretty fun.

39
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.890
I do a little bit of rock climbing and then if it's during the winter I go

40
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.250
snowboarding. So yeah, that's pretty much it. Thanks for watching.

41
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:54.993

42
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:55.970
<v 1>Right.</v>
