00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.020
<v 0>How I tackle the college admissions is I looked at where I was at,</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.850
which is my grades were not the best.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.660
And so I looked at all the top schools and I thought about which one would be

4
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:12.210
easiest to get into Stanford is actually up there.

5
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.480
<v 1>Because they don't look at before we continue this video.</v>

6
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:18.830
I just want to say thank you so much to audible for sponsoring this video.

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.900

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.060
When you try audible for 30 days,

visit audible.com/joma or text Joma at

10
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.190
500, 500. So what are audible originals?

11
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.810
One glad you asked audible originals are exclusive audio titles created by

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.800
celebrate a storytellers from worlds as diverse as theater,

13
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.570
journalism, literature, and more. So basically there's like sound effects,

14
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.920
music, voice actors, and it's basically really well produced.

15
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.280
I myself have been listening to bad blood by John Kerry,

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.930
you which is about Elizabeth Holmes and her start-up therapist and how she lied

17
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:04.850
her way into create a multi billion dollar biotech startup bill Gates loved

18
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:08.270
it. Apparently it was one of his favorites in 2018.

19
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.870
I've been using Autobot when I do boring stuff. Like when I commute,

20
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.790
when I do laundry, when I cook,

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.990
which allows me to suck in all that knowledge and become a better me.

22
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.500
And you should too. So if you're interested, don't forget,

23
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.420
you can go to audible.com/joma or send Joma

24
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.660
to 500, 500, the try audible or free.

25
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.470
<v 0>Look at your channel. I was, I'm actually like, Oh man,</v>

26
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.070
I kind of want that channel. You know exactly where I can do random.

27
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.870
Like if you looked at my vlogs and my old videos, you would see that,

28
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.820
you know, it's a lot of random also. Yeah. And I actually enjoyed doing that,

29
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.560
but then it was, um, it was because this channel blew up that, okay,

30
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.240
I have to double down on this. Right.

31
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.850
So it's kind of sad that me see what you mean. Yeah.

32
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.450
I'm always tempted to make more Stanford videos because it gets clicks.

33
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:03.350
It gets views, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just want to see whatever. Okay.

34
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.920
But I do think that like, your audience is like very strong though. Yeah.

35
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.820
I'm really thankful for that. A lot of good means. Yeah.

36
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.410
Like I think at the beginning,

37
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.630
my channel was also like that like a bit more like Mimi, you know,

38
00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:19.340
a lot of like inside jokes and stuff. Yeah. But, but,

39
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.850
but then like the tech videos, they just like blew me up. So I'm like, Oh, okay.

40
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.810
I guess I'm going to keep doing that. Right. Okay. Cool. So, all right.

41
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:29.870
Let's start the interview. I always say like, I don't want to, you know,

42
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.570
make it too much of an interview. So if ever you want to ask me questions,

43
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.800
you could ask me questions. Okay.

44
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.880
And what's funny is because like my viewers are always like, um, dude, can you,

45
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.890
you shut the up and let the other person talk always about you. Joma.

46
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.130
Yeah. So, okay. So I'm just telling them, like, it's not an interview,

47
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:50.180
it's a conversation so that I can say stuff too. Yeah.

48
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:51.590
So before I start started, you want just like,

49
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.860
introduce yourself a little bit about your channel. What is it about, uh,

50
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.480
jeez, a spiel. Hi, I'm park. Uh, have a YouTube channel.

51
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.240
Check it out. Hi.

52
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.180
I brought you in because uh, you go to Stanford and, uh, you know,

53
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.450
Stanford gets a lot of clicks through and can I use that on my channel?

54
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.980
So can I just ask you a little bit about like your scores first and then like,

55
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.300
how'd you get in? What did you like,

56
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.030
why did you think you got in and stuff like that? I sat,

57
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.840
I got a 1590 and then AC ticket. What is that out of? Oh,

58
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:30.400
1600 Canadian. Sorry. 1600. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good.

59
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.770
I think it's um, like it's one point bef before the maximum.

60
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.340
Yeah. It was one question was always from diverse rash,

61
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.870
but I know I just, you know, you shouldn't even get accepted to Stanford. Yeah.

62
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.560
That's pretty impressive. So in your videos you say that, uh, you know,

63
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.570
you don't study a lot and stuff like that. Yeah.

64
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.640
Is it true now or is it even true before? Because like 1590.

65
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:57.760
That's very, like, think you would need to study a lot for now. Right.

66
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.740
So what I'll say about the test scores is that I think I was just always sort of

67
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:04.510
lucky with test taking skills.

68
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.620
Like I didn't study too much for like standardized test. I just took like,

69
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.190
Oh wow. Maybe like three or four practice tests beforehand.

70
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.220
And then usually that'd be enough. Yeah. I mean,

71
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.850
people keeps telling me to meme that I don't study, but like I told you earlier,

72
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:22.330
I'm taking like two classes right now in high school.

73
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:25.540
I say I tried a lot harder. I see only like junior,

74
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:27.910
senior year it's because I had like this end goal,

75
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.970
like this Holy grail of getting it to Stanford. So you want it to get into STEM.

76
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.570
Right.

77
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.110
I want it to get into a prestigious school because what about like Harvard and

78
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:36.370
theater schools? You don't care about them?

79
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.540
How I tackle the college admissions is I looked at where I was at,

80
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.370
which is my grades were not the best.

81
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.180
And so I looked at all the top schools and I thought about which one would be

82
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.170
easiest to get into.

83
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.590
And Stanford is actually up there cause they don't look at freshman year.

84
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.070
And like, I have like a weird set of extracurriculars.

85
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:55.930
So I thought it fits Stanford best.

86
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.160
So the decision to apply to Stanford versus like Ivy league or whatever it was

87
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:03.820
basically just cause I thought it'd be easier to get into Stanford. Okay. So,

88
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:07.780
so you want it to get into like Ivy league slash prestigious school? Yeah.

89
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.670
And then you thought Stanford was like the easiest one as weird as it is to say

90
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.330
Stanford seemed like the, uh, easiest option. Interesting. Okay.

91
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.360
Ella is here right now. Oh, sweet. So I'm going to, I'm going to go.

92
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.370
<v 1>So here we have Elliot now. So you want to tell you a little bit about yourself,</v>

93
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.630
about your channel. What are you talking about?

94
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.750
<v 2>Yeah, I'm a sophomore at Vanderbilt. Um,</v>

95
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.160
I am working on a channel right now that focuses a lot on like college

96
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.130
videos, entrepreneurship lifestyle.

97
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.210
I'm really into like videography whatnot, but it really changes up a lot.

98
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:41.850
So I'm still trying to find my style. I'm pretty like.

99
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.830
<v 1>Classic kids try to, you know, what they want to do, you know,</v>

100
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.350
passion and stuff like that. That makes a lot of sense. But yeah.

101
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.000
So we were talking about, um,

102
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.930
why you chose Stanford and you said it was the easiest to get into.

103
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 0>And what I meant by that is that like, I have a good chance to get.</v>

104
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.810
<v 1>Into any of these schools,</v>

105
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.100
but like between like the 2% chance at the other schools,

106
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.730
there was like a 5% chance for Stanford, which is why I applied there.

107
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.241
All right.

108
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:11.570
That's what I'm trying to say opportunity for me to get more clarification

109
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:15.680
question. Okay. So don't say anything to Elliot Elliot. Normally,

110
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.390
how many practice tests do you take for like these, um, SATs? Wait,

111
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:23.150
was it SATs? I took both. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

112
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.660
So usually how many tests would you take before taking the real test?

113
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.110
<v 2>Maybe like at least five to</v>

114
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.420
around 10 to 15.

115
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:35.590
<v 1>Okay. Yeah,</v>

116
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.170
because I was just trying to get a feel of if that was a lot or not a lot.

117
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.390
So yeah. You're correct. You do not study a lot and yeah. I mean,

118
00:06:43.391 --> 00:06:45.880
I, I took a lot of like tests growing up.

119
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.720
There's like standardized tests everywhere in the O series of schooling systems,

120
00:06:49.721 --> 00:06:54.070
so. Okay, good. Yeah. Not in Canada. We don't have that, right? Yeah.

121
00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:57.130
That's why university of Waterloo is a great school. There's so.

122
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.380
<v 2>Many people from Waterloo who relate to all the tech.</v>

123
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.520
<v 1>Oh yeah. Because we're basically a factory. I would just make like tech, babies,</v>

124
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:07.510
and pretty much I was at Stanford and I'm one of the Stanford.

125
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:09.520
You guys turn out like entrepreneurs, you know,

126
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:12.550
people care about certain things, you know, like Snapchat, you know,

127
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.900
it's gonna change the world and stuff like that. Snakes. All right.

128
00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:20.380
Can I ask about you? Like how did you get into, um,

129
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.480
like your school miserable. Yeah. Sorry. Cause I actually don't know any, like,

130
00:07:25.481 --> 00:07:26.314
do you know?

131
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.990
<v 2>It's not that well known on the East store, like West coast.</v>

132
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:32.770
I'd say I didn't even know about the school before. Where is it exactly?

133
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.350
It's a Nashville Tennessee. So it's like down South.

134
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.240
<v 1>Mm. Yeah. So what are your like sat scores? Never revealed.</v>

135
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.250
<v 0>Oh, wow.</v>

136
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.420
<v 2>No, I don't mind. I say, I say, um, yeah, I got a 35 on my act.</v>

137
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:49.510
I never took the sat and I.

138
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.270
<v 1>Out of 36. Oh, okay. Yeah. Go, go again.</v>

139
00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.290
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

140
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:00.580
<v 2>35 And um.</v>

141
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.920
<v 1>Yeah. Can you tell me about your, uh,</v>

142
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.360
what is it like the common application or like a essay stuff? What is it,

143
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.700
what did they ask you? And then like, what did you say? Like,

144
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.790
why did you think you got in, what was your selling point?

145
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.400
<v 2>My cell was honestly my Instagram.</v>

146
00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:18.610
I was doing a lot of photography and I talked about like,

147
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:20.890
I could have talked about my violin,

148
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:23.950
but like every Asian does that or like my volunteering.

149
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.930
<v 1>I play well, that's pretty dope.</v>

150
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.040
<v 0>Yeah. No, that's what I'm saying. [inaudible].</v>

151
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:38.260
<v 2>No. So I talked about like my Instagram account, um, in high school I had like</v>

152
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.410
24, 5,000 and I was like growing it and I thought it was like kind of unique

153
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.620
and I don't know. I just thought it would be pretty interesting to talk about,

154
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.850
develop a story around it. So.

155
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.390
<v 1>Nice. That makes sense. What was your selling point for Stanford? Um,</v>

156
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.400
my selling point is that, um, I don't know, basically.

157
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.470
<v 0>I'm the kid studying communication, which nobody really does, so yeah.</v>

158
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.090
Yeah. What else? Oh yeah.

159
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:06.690
So can you tell me a bit about like what you guys are studying right now? Um,

160
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.230
right now I'm taking some film classes.

161
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.680
I took some acting classes and I took one CS class,

162
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.250
decided that it's not for me, so I have to cut that out for my child.

163
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.870
<v 1>Oh. I love CBS Joma tech,</v>

164
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.790
good channel and watch it all the time.

165
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.580
<v 0>Later on. I'll tell you why you should get TCS, but okay. Okay. Okay.</v>

166
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:28.311
<v 2>Convince us. Um,</v>

167
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:33.020
so I it's called human and organizational development and I have like a business

168
00:09:33.021 --> 00:09:36.320
minor. It's too complicated to explain. It's just business pretty much.

169
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.810
It's a liberal arts school, so cool. It just, it's kind of, wishy-washy.

170
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.410
<v 0>Interesting. Interesting. So, I mean, it's, it's way too early for you guys,</v>

171
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:46.640
but I'll still ask it, like what,

172
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.400
what do you envision yourself in like five years?

173
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.880
So like what kind of job or how are you guys going to make money?

174
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.260
Like you don't, I mean, you don't have to,

175
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:58.100
but basically what do you think you'll do in five years after college?

176
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.710
<v 2>I'm really, really interested in like marketing. Um,</v>

177
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.360
even maybe biz-dev for tech and I like eventually would love

178
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:08.270
to be in like entrepreneurship and running my own thing.

179
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.640
I don't think that's something where it's like super forced.

180
00:10:10.641 --> 00:10:14.480
So then you have to be patient with it and just get some experience and learn

181
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:18.380
about like the inner workings of an industry before you can really be like, Oh,

182
00:10:18.381 --> 00:10:21.170
I'm going to go create a amazing solution for it.

183
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.720
If you don't know what the problem is, it's kind of difficult.

184
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:27.680
So I just like want to try to work like a traditional job for a little bit,

185
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:32.090
but eventually would love to do my own thing. I haven't thought that far.

186
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.350
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. We all know who the better student is. I mean, yeah.</v>

187
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.810
<v 1>And it's, uh, everybody knew it anyways. Okay.</v>

188
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.350
Question. So.

189
00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.430
<v 0>Once you guys got, you know, pretty famous, you know, big boys Chanel. Yeah.</v>

190
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:51.710
What, what kind of questions do you guys get most often asked on Instagram or,

191
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:52.544
sorry, not Instagram. Just.

192
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.130
<v 1>Curious to hear a lot of the earlier ones.</v>

193
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.580
<v 0>Just people telling me, asking me to like, read over the applications.</v>

194
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.090
So like for the first couple of months of my channel, I was just editing essays,

195
00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:05.050
like 24 seven for them. Yeah, I did. Cause like I,

196
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.190
I started the channel to try to help people.

197
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.100
Cause I thought there was like an information gap in the college application

198
00:11:10.101 --> 00:11:13.460
process for kids who didn't get like counseling and things like that.

199
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.730
So I wanted to help them, but after a while I just, I was just drowning.

200
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.140
I have to stop.

201
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.940
<v 2>I would say I do get a lot of questions from high schoolers as well. Um,</v>

202
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.850
it's like, Oh, what do I do for like, how do I get into this college? Like,

203
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.750
I don't know. Um, I also get like some entrepreneurship stuff, like, uh,

204
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.860
how do I, you know, make some side money or videography questions,

205
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.873
stuff like that stuff.

206
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.850
<v 0>So are you already making side money right now? So yeah.</v>

207
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.720
<v 1>Transitioned. So do you make side money right.</v>

208
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.830
<v 2>To like flip and resell a lot, which was like my, um,</v>

209
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.520
I was making a lot in like high school, like thousands and I was like, whatever,

210
00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:52.730
that's great. And I invested all that money into like an Amazon business,

211
00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:55.450
doing label FBA private label.

212
00:11:55.860 --> 00:12:00.130
It's basically like you get a product and you make it your own branded yourself.

213
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.290
And like, I like drop shipping a little bit kind of,

214
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.090
but like drop shipping is lost. Um,

215
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.790
governing is like you use other people's products, private label,

216
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:10.930
you go through the manufacturing process and the branding and uh, yeah, so it's,

217
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.640
it's a lot. Um, but yeah,

218
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.220
and then all that money I made through flipping and reselling,

219
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:20.020
I lost through Amazon and pretty much. And so, um,

220
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.800
yeah, I am pretty much just relying on YouTube.

221
00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:26.780
<v 1>YouTube income. Yeah. Um, do,</v>

222
00:12:26.781 --> 00:12:30.630
do you have any like side businesses that are related to your YouTube? Like,

223
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.570
do you do a sponsored videos? Do you sell something?

224
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.640
<v 2>I am not selling right now. Um, yeah, pretty much just ad revenue,</v>

225
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:42.540
some small I've done like one sponsorship in my total time on YouTube.

226
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.020
I don't like doing them a lot and then never really like really focused on

227
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.011
monetization.

228
00:12:47.011 --> 00:12:50.730
So I just kind of like leave that alone and I'm trying to get back into it.

229
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.320
Cause it's like, it takes a lot of time.

230
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.850
You guys know it takes up a lot of time.

231
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.830
<v 1>I was about to say like, yeah, I hate it too,</v>

232
00:12:55.831 --> 00:12:59.010
but then I'll probably have a sponsor for it as well,

233
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.210
but um, okay. Oh, interesting. Okay. Um,

234
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.880
so how much do you make for like YouTube and stuff?

235
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.060
<v 2>Yeah, currently. So it really depends. I'm sure you guys know,</v>

236
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.920
like from once a month, um, for me it's like I'll the, the check or the,

237
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.550
the payment I get from you to be around, um,

238
00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.930
one to two K and it is, could be a lot higher if I actually,

239
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.050
I use a lot of copyrighted music, probably on 80% of my videos.

240
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.310
So that's the reason why all my biggest videos, none of them are monetized. Um,

241
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.200
cause I care a lot about music and whatnot.

242
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.170
<v 1>So like around how many views per month do you get?</v>

243
00:13:34.171 --> 00:13:37.950
Just so that we can get a comparison on in case people want to beat you?

244
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.760
<v 2>I would actually pull it up, I think probably at least a million. Yeah,</v>

245
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.850
I think um, maybe one to two. Okay.

246
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:48.480
<v 1>Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. So do you, um, we'll get to you,</v>

247
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.520
do you, do you plan on, uh,

248
00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:56.760
like expanding something new business line or something, you know, for like,

249
00:13:56.761 --> 00:13:58.860
do you do something for photography?

250
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.520
<v 2>As of right now really? I'm just like exploring,</v>

251
00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.780
I'm trying to tap into my creative side a little bit more.

252
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.820
So I'm not really focused on, you know,

253
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.150
I could roll out that course or whatever. Like, you know,

254
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.390
here's how you get into college or whatever I could do that. Um,

255
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.200
I want to compete and you can make big bucks doing that. And it's pretty,

256
00:14:16.201 --> 00:14:18.090
it's pretty easy. So, um,

257
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.110
I would arguably say like anyone who has a sizable following and has some

258
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:26.280
informational power, there can like make a few hundred grand,

259
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.520
I'd say doing that. And I know people who have, but really, uh,

260
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.370
I'm not like trying to monetize quick. So as of right now,

261
00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:36.990
now what are they selling? People sell like courses. Yeah.

262
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.630
Courses go for like 500, $2,000.

263
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.350
I know like people to like the Amazon thing. I know people who have like sold,

264
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.530
uh, never sold on Amazon, sold a course.

265
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.640
They made like around 10 million off of that. So there's a lot,

266
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.080
especially in entrepreneurship, there's a lot of. Like.

267
00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.530
<v 1>Courses are good because you don't,</v>

268
00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.850
there's no cost except your time to make it once and then you could sell it.

269
00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.850
<v 2>It's a revocable product that you can just yeah,</v>

270
00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.890
here in my garage guy here, my girl, what is it? Ty Lopez.

271
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.920
<v 1>Oh yeah. Here's my garage. A better.</v>

272
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.930
<v 2>Knowledge. That's his whole.</v>

273
00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.280
<v 1>Bunch of just like, uh, Dan Locke. I don't know if you've ever seen his ads.</v>

274
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.390
All those people.

275
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.630
<v 2>It's all. Yeah. I mean, yeah.</v>

276
00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:26.500
<v 1>I mean, if it works, it works. I mean congrats on them. Yeah. But yeah. Anyways,</v>

277
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.060
um, yeah, back to you,

278
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.730
because you said that people will usually ask for your application,

279
00:15:30.731 --> 00:15:33.400
so you actually reviewed their applications. How long would it,

280
00:15:33.401 --> 00:15:34.600
did it take you to review them?

281
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:39.040
<v 0>So like, they'd send me like their common app essays, like 650 words.</v>

282
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:43.240
So it took like 30 minutes to 45 minutes just like reading through it and

283
00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:45.100
leaving comments and stuff like that. Yeah.

284
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.430
<v 1>That's a lot. So what, what are like the general tips you would say?</v>

285
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.450
What makes an app?

286
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:50.771
<v 0>I guess for me,</v>

287
00:15:50.771 --> 00:15:54.130
like the biggest problem I saw in the essays I read is that like,

288
00:15:54.131 --> 00:15:57.460
you want to make your essays enjoyable to read. Like,

289
00:15:57.461 --> 00:16:01.930
it doesn't have to be funny, but like if like, if someone picks it up,

290
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.880
they want to finish it. You know what I mean?

291
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.410
I don't know how to put that into words.

292
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:06.850
It's basically just saying write better.

293
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.650
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. So we were talking about narrative, I think is very good. So.</v>

294
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.510
<v 1>What did you write about in yours?</v>

295
00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.280
<v 0>Uh, my common app essay.</v>

296
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.720
I brought back some anecdote from kindergarten when I did a show and tell

297
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.280
thing and I brought a dead bird class freaked out and I sort of connected that

298
00:16:24.281 --> 00:16:25.390
to how I just like,

299
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.760
like talking and like presenting and performing things like that and like all my

300
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.330
other extracurriculars.

301
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.990
So I guess my narrative was literally my life story and that's good.

302
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.100
And they seem to like it. Good.

303
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.190
<v 1>Well, that's cool. Yeah. So are you saying that like, yeah,</v>

304
00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:41.710
you brought a bird and then people freaked out or something?

305
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.420
<v 0>Yeah. When I brought the bird and people freaked out,</v>

306
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.120
I felt like empowered, empowered. Yeah.

307
00:16:49.121 --> 00:16:51.160
I felt like this is something I want to do,

308
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:56.080
which is why I did speech in high school. Why you made videos? Took, you know,

309
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.191
film classes,

310
00:16:57.191 --> 00:17:01.540
things like that because I wanted to get that same sort of feeling of show

311
00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:02.374
Intel.

312
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.920
<v 1>Interesting. So w w why do you think you have this feel?</v>

313
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.130
Like why did it feel so good when people freaked out over you?

314
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.160
<v 0>I don't know. I guess since, since I was a kid,</v>

315
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:16.060
I was always small and I was a minority, but back then I lived in like, Texas.

316
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.840
So I was the only Asian kid. So I always felt like really invisible.

317
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:24.100
And once like people started looking at me, I, it just felt good. Yeah.

318
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.220
<v 1>You felt like a cereal in milk.</v>

319
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.240
I really like that. Yeah. Do you still feel this, um,

320
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.460
like segregation a little bit and maybe not segregation,

321
00:17:36.461 --> 00:17:40.030
but like alienated because you're Asian-American and Stanford,

322
00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:41.260
or just in general here.

323
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.490
<v 0>See, in a Stanford and the Bay area in general. I really don't feel that at all.</v>

324
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.970
Um, maybe in like some, like subsections of the,

325
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.610
like maybe if you go to like frat houses, you might feel a little off,

326
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.960
but in general,

327
00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:58.050
I'd never felt like any sort of prejudice against me since I've been here.

328
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.430
<v 1>So when did you feel like prejudice?</v>

329
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.780
<v 0>The bouncing between like suburbs, like white suburbia,</v>

330
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.700
like through most of my childhood,

331
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.390
this was always like the only Asian kid in the neighborhood. Yeah. I mean,

332
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.000
I had they're all my friends, but looking back on it now,

333
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.320
there was always some sort of divide.

334
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.280
<v 1>Okay. Can you kind of elaborate on the divide?</v>

335
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:22.250
<v 0>Yeah. Like they like make jokes about like my eyes and things like that.</v>

336
00:18:22.251 --> 00:18:24.260
And I just sort of learned to just take it, you know,

337
00:18:24.261 --> 00:18:27.710
they called me like or something like that. Chin, CUHK, et cetera.

338
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.320
And I just sort of rolled with the punches.

339
00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.780
Like I just took it because I wanted to be friends with them,

340
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.720
but I realized now that I couldn't be friends with them.

341
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.790
Cause I'm never going to be then.

342
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.600
<v 1>Did you ever felt that like, Oh, I wish I wasn't Asian.</v>

343
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:45.980
<v 0>Yeah, definitely. Um, for a lot, a large part of my life,</v>

344
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:50.630
but yeah. I mean, I'm very comfortable with being Korean, Korean, Korean.

345
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.880
<v 1>Korean. Yeah. Makes sense.</v>

346
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.133
<v 0>It makes sense.</v>

347
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.840
I guess I just spending a lot of time with my parents learning about the

348
00:18:56.841 --> 00:18:58.160
heritage and going to Korea now.

349
00:18:58.161 --> 00:19:01.130
And then I realized that it's a good place to be. Cool.

350
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.650
<v 1>Cool. What about you? How do you like,</v>

351
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.850
did you ever felt like you were alienated when you were kids and stuff like

352
00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:08.630
that?

353
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.720
<v 2>I feel like I grew up in New Jersey, pretty diverse area.</v>

354
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.610
And then when I went to high school,

355
00:19:13.611 --> 00:19:17.750
I was lucky I moved to Indiana for my high school, which is like,

356
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.020
it was pretty much white suburbia too. Um, but I was lucky enough to like,

357
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:23.660
have a pretty diverse community there. Um,

358
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.990
but I feel like the school I'm at, at Vanderbilt,

359
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.190
it is that segregation. There's a lot of Greek life at Vanderbilt. Um,

360
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.250
Greek non-Greek most Greek is white. And like,

361
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.090
there is that segregation and literally the other day I was just like looking at

362
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:42.350
lunch and you can even like, see it's not on purpose or anything,

363
00:19:42.351 --> 00:19:45.140
but there's actually like segregation implicitly.

364
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:48.560
And like I thought that was pretty interesting. I never really like noticed it,

365
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.650
but, you know, I don't know if that has to do with the fact that like,

366
00:19:51.651 --> 00:19:55.670
people are drawn to, you know, there's similar communities.

367
00:19:55.671 --> 00:19:56.570
I don't know exactly,

368
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.290
but there is a divide and like I felt that was like pretty interesting.

369
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:05.180
Cause I never really recognized it until like college, to be honest. Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.100
Did you want to do CS like in high school? Oh yeah.

371
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.990
<v 1>That's a great question. So I actually want to be an investment banker.</v>

372
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:16.570
Oh no. Yeah, yeah.

373
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.770
So I joined math and business. That was a program that was called double degree.

374
00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.930
And you do math at Waterloo and then you do business at another school.

375
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.680
And then I want to be an investment banker because I didn't want to follow my

376
00:20:30.681 --> 00:20:34.910
brother's footstep. What he did was he dropped out of the business.

377
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.780
He did the same program,

378
00:20:35.781 --> 00:20:40.700
but he dropped out of the business in two semesters and he did

379
00:20:40.701 --> 00:20:42.170
math. He was like a big math nerd.

380
00:20:42.171 --> 00:20:44.840
He did pure math and he ended up being like a quantum,

381
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:48.370
like a quantitative race researcher. I didn't want to do that.

382
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.640
I didn't even want to touch like STEM stuff. I said, you know,

383
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:55.330
I'm a sociable guy. I could be a businessman, whatever that means. Right.

384
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.130
So then I joined, uh, I joined Waterloo and Wilford lorry,

385
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.150
which is theater course.

386
00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:06.010
I started theater college and after one semester I dropped business

387
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.710
because I just couldn't handle it. I was like, Oh my God, it's so boring.

388
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.190
And then it was after that, that I learned about, Oh, you know, Facebook,

389
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:14.440
they pay a lot for computer science. I mean,

390
00:21:14.441 --> 00:21:17.260
for our software engineers and Google and all these cool jobs.

391
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:19.960
And then I just switched from math to computer science.

392
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.570
I was lucky because when I was taking math,

393
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.760
I also was taking like CS for fun because of that had the credits to go

394
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:31.360
into computer science. But, uh, but yeah.

395
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:36.190
And then even after I went to do a few internships in software

396
00:21:36.191 --> 00:21:37.024
engineering,

397
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.440
I still didn't really want to do it because I thought I'm a business, man.

398
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.250
I should do more like things that is like a little bit more social.

399
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.560
So that's why I changed the data science.

400
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.670
And then I changed to product manager because, um,

401
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.620
cause back then I was very ambitious. I was,

402
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:58.480
I wanted to make a startup or like I want to run a startup or do my own thing.

403
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.270
Right. And then over the years I, you know,

404
00:22:01.271 --> 00:22:06.040
I kind of reevaluate my values and what I care about. And in the end,

405
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:08.560
like there are some other things I care about now.

406
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.630
And I feel like right now software engineering is a good fit for that. Yeah.

407
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.330
So yeah. You guys have any, a study tip?

408
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.920
<v 0>Uh, not going to lie. I'm a little lacking in this area, but um.</v>

409
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.100
<v 1>Like, so are you, are you getting bad grades right now.</v>

410
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.340
<v 0>Or? Um, no, not like getting bad grades.</v>

411
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.000
Like the thing is like Stanford grade inflation, et cetera.

412
00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.850
And as long as you just, sorry,

413
00:22:35.851 --> 00:22:39.570
what's the grade inflation grade inflation basically means like, if there's a,

414
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:43.800
like a bell curve for like the grade distribution, then it's like skewed.

415
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.440
<v 1>So the range, the median is not like.</v>

416
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.200
<v 0>C no, it's not. It's probably, it's probably around a,</v>

417
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:53.580
B I think I read that the average GPA at Stanford is like a 3.7 or

418
00:22:53.581 --> 00:22:54.414
3.8.

419
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.360
<v 1>Interesting. That's that's odd. But, but then again,</v>

420
00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.410
are your grades important nowadays because you're not going to go to, I mean,

421
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.850
if you are going to grad school, it's important.

422
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.430
<v 0>But yeah. The only field who are grades really matter,</v>

423
00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.560
I would say is probably like, if you're pre-med,

424
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.070
if you're going to like some sort of STEM graduate school,

425
00:23:11.071 --> 00:23:15.750
like physics or something or blah, I'm not really sure. But other than that,

426
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.140
the Stanford name on top of your degree will probably matter more than the

427
00:23:19.141 --> 00:23:20.280
number beneath it.

428
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.510
<v 2>A lot of the top schools like have, and Harvard, for example,</v>

429
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.880
like people say it's hard to get a FORO,

430
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.790
but it's like easy to get like a three seven, three, eight.

431
00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:33.390
<v 1>Okay. Cause everyone get well, cause it was so hard to get in.</v>

432
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.850
They deserve the great inflation gap. Right?

433
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.950
<v 2>Yeah. I don't know exactly how it works. Yeah.</v>

434
00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.230
But like very has like great deflation.

435
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.310
<v 1>Yeah. So it's like the average is a D it's all out slower.</v>

436
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.330
<v 2>Yeah. It's terrible.</v>

437
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.850
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. Um, I think MIT and Princeton also have great deflation. Oh really?</v>

438
00:23:51.851 --> 00:23:53.320
Yeah. So actually MIT,

439
00:23:53.321 --> 00:23:56.440
I think has a quota on a number of students I can get A's in a class,

440
00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.680
so they're literally competing with each other. And I don't know.

441
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.850
That seems toxic to me. Yeah.

442
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.410
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. When I went to see job, which is something in Quebec,</v>

443
00:24:05.411 --> 00:24:08.350
it's like pre university, we had something called an aura,

444
00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.060
our score and it, what it is is if you're, it,

445
00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.040
it compares your, your grades with your classmates. So no one would collaborate.

446
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.590
Cause if your classmates do bad, then you do well. Yeah. Right. Is terrible.

447
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.700
So what about like, um, you know, now that you've started college,

448
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.400
do you think you're very different from when you're high school?

449
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.550
Like what are some of the lessons that you've learned a lot and you,

450
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:37.330
and you wish to pass it on to kids or high school leaders?

451
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.040
Right.

452
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.170
<v 2>I think it's changed a lot. Like in high school,</v>

453
00:24:41.171 --> 00:24:43.090
I didn't really care about things.

454
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.090
I just was always just doing enough to get by.

455
00:24:46.091 --> 00:24:49.720
I wasn't really ambitious or anything. Um, and I did well enough,

456
00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:54.460
I think just to, you know, do okay. In school and when whatever, um,

457
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.560
and even freshman year of college, I'd say,

458
00:24:56.561 --> 00:25:00.640
I wasn't really like that driven or like ambitious, um, freshman year,

459
00:25:00.641 --> 00:25:01.331
summer though,

460
00:25:01.331 --> 00:25:06.280
I spent like three months alone in New York and I really just got to do my own

461
00:25:06.281 --> 00:25:09.340
thing and explore. And I think I really, um,

462
00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.980
thought about like where I wanted to be in the future.

463
00:25:11.981 --> 00:25:16.790
And then that really helped me be grounded in my goals and my ambition. So like,

464
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:19.450
I think I've changed a lot since then. Um, yeah.

465
00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:23.920
I mean like a lot of people change in college just because you're exposed to new

466
00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:28.030
perspectives. It's, it's a different world and like it's not the real world yet,

467
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.230
but it's once up closer.

468
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:33.640
So like your eyes are opened up or your mind is opened up to a lot more, uh,

469
00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.630
information and practice.

470
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.110
<v 0>Electives. Well, the first two years of high school, I was slacking off.</v>

471
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:38.973
Like you said, um,

472
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:43.690
I had this weird concept that being cool and not studying like the cool kids.

473
00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:45.670
So I just didn't study. But junior,

474
00:25:45.671 --> 00:25:49.300
senior year I was so like romantically attached to the idea of getting into a

475
00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:52.540
good school that I worked my off, like really hard.

476
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.200
But now that I'm here at Stanford, it's like, if,

477
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.790
since I don't have an end goal in mind,

478
00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:00.940
I guess I have like a bit of perspective. I don't,

479
00:26:00.941 --> 00:26:04.510
I don't like work as hard mostly because I don't have anything to work towards

480
00:26:04.511 --> 00:26:05.344
at the moment.

481
00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.760
<v 1>I mean, it it's a hard thing to do, right? Like, um, Oh,</v>

482
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.070
I'll give you a comparison in a company,

483
00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:16.180
we have something called like a goal metric or an OKR.

484
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.260
It's something that the company work towards too. Right.

485
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.570
But it's not always correct. It doesn't always lead to the right path.

486
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.590
And the most dangerous thing you can do is following it blindly and then

487
00:26:29.591 --> 00:26:33.250
realizing that that's not what you want. Right. So, I mean,

488
00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:37.450
I think it's totally okay that you don't have a goal anymore,

489
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.910
but it's nice to try to think about it and know at least what

490
00:26:42.911 --> 00:26:44.910
kind of direction you want to go to. I mean,

491
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.660
I feel like you kind of know what you want, especially for now. It's like,

492
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:50.220
you want to own your own thing you want,

493
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.440
I'm guessing you want to do your own thing,

494
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:55.860
run your own business kind of a thing, right? Yeah. It changes every day.

495
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.673
Exactly.

496
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.860
<v 2>Every two weeks to take a step back and think about it.</v>

497
00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.220
And literally within a month it could be complete opposites.

498
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:06.680
It's just like thinking longterm, like what, uh,

499
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.840
what I really want out of life in the longterm.

500
00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.450
<v 1>Do you not even have like a slightest idea of a goal or something that you want</v>

501
00:27:14.451 --> 00:27:16.850
to work towards too? Like, it can be anything like, Oh,

502
00:27:16.851 --> 00:27:20.870
I want to be more honest person. I want to be a funnier person. Right? Like,

503
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.733
yeah.

504
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.040
<v 0>Uh, I think what I've concluded is that if I am,</v>

505
00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.920
if I'm going to work on anything, it has to be sort of creative.

506
00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:33.470
I need to have my own input on it because I've tried like sort of busy work,

507
00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:36.590
like desk jobs. And I just, I don't it, I don't think I can do that.

508
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.730
So whatever I'm doing,

509
00:27:37.731 --> 00:27:40.610
it's probably going to involve sort of what I'm doing already.

510
00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:45.080
Maybe like YouTube or just creating, maybe writing,

511
00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.700
just anything in that sort of industry, area, media entertainment, et cetera.

512
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.060
<v 1>Yeah. Imagine if you guys can do YouTube,</v>

513
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:57.710
like full-time imagine if every job paid the same, what would you do?

514
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.170
Would it be YouTube or something else?

515
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.470
<v 0>I mean, all things considered. If you could do YouTube as a career,</v>

516
00:28:03.471 --> 00:28:06.650
it's an amazing thing. You can work at your own pace.

517
00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:10.580
You can just do whatever you want. So, I mean, yeah,

518
00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:11.780
it wouldn't be bad.

519
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.480
My only problem with it is that your budget is not as high as like,

520
00:28:14.481 --> 00:28:18.890
if you worked in like the film industry or something. Like if I,

521
00:28:18.891 --> 00:28:21.380
if I wanted to make a feature film in the future, you can't do that on YouTube.

522
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.671
<v 1>Hmm. I mean,</v>

523
00:28:22.671 --> 00:28:26.330
you could be a creative director or like a direct a movie director that that's

524
00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:30.260
also a possibility. Right. You know? Yeah. Yeah. I guess like,

525
00:28:30.261 --> 00:28:31.580
imagine if you could do anything,

526
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.810
anything not constrained to YouTube or something else you could do anything,

527
00:28:35.811 --> 00:28:37.370
anything, what would you do?

528
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.040
<v 0>I dunno. Think of it.</v>

529
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.890
<v 2>I would probably say like movie directing, it would be,</v>

530
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.770
if I was good enough would be a dream. Um,

531
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:50.600
I personally think like YouTube allows me to fulfill a lot of what I want out of

532
00:28:50.601 --> 00:28:55.010
life and that's not just like super career-driven goals. It's like,

533
00:28:55.011 --> 00:28:58.970
I want to meet people who are doing cool things and surround myself with those

534
00:28:58.971 --> 00:29:01.130
types of people. And YouTube has allowed me to do that,

535
00:29:01.131 --> 00:29:03.500
which is great that it aligns with that goal.

536
00:29:03.501 --> 00:29:05.540
It also allows me to like travel and explore.

537
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.920
And that has also been like one of my long-term goals. Um,

538
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.130
kind of like Barbie was saying about like having something where he can really

539
00:29:13.131 --> 00:29:14.000
express his creativity.

540
00:29:14.001 --> 00:29:17.120
I think like YouTube really does kind of allow me to do that.

541
00:29:17.121 --> 00:29:20.120
And I've realized like recently that's like super important to me.

542
00:29:20.121 --> 00:29:23.090
So I think like potentially, yeah,

543
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:27.020
considering if it was like more sustainable in the longterm, I feel like, um,

544
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:31.130
it could definitely be viable or reasonable for me to pursue, but you know,

545
00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:33.380
in the real world, I don't think I would ever do it. Like full-time.

546
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.590
<v 1>Um, so what's like the future of your channels,</v>

547
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:38.420
but actually before talking about the future,

548
00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:41.950
what was the origin of your channel? Like why you start it?

549
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.640
Cause sometimes it might not be like what it is now.

550
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:47.530
Like you might've started for a better reason,

551
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.690
like my channel and just carry on.

552
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.170
<v 0>Right. Um, I guess I didn't really plan to start a channel.</v>

553
00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.350
Um, just at the end of summer break last year when I was,

554
00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.090
when I just graduated high school,

555
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.000
I knew I wanted to make a video on college essays. Like I said,

556
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.000
to help like the information gap. And then, um,

557
00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:09.690
winter break of this year of my first year at Stanford,

558
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:14.220
I was just bored and I decided to make some videos and then it's just been sort

559
00:30:14.221 --> 00:30:15.600
of going like that ever since.

560
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:19.710
<v 2>Yeah. So for me, I was in high school, I got into Vanderbilt.</v>

561
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.640
I searched on Vanderbilt on YouTube and I could not find any other videos other

562
00:30:23.641 --> 00:30:27.240
than this five-year old video of the sky interviewing drunk people.

563
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.410
And so I, and I knew like Dana life videos were doing well.

564
00:30:31.411 --> 00:30:35.190
And I saw that the same in tech. Right. So it's like, okay,

565
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.320
should I like create a day in the life of your, for Vanderbilt?

566
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:40.980
So in my mind it made a lot of sense because I wanted that when I was in high

567
00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:42.900
school, there was nothing to watch. Um,

568
00:30:42.901 --> 00:30:45.510
and so I decided to make one and I was like, Oh,

569
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:49.590
if all these videos are getting millions of views, I can make one. That's like,

570
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.100
okay. You know, or even half, that would be amazing. So, um,

571
00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:56.250
I just went off and made it and yeah, I made it, I made,

572
00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.940
I started my channel just to like make that video. And then it,

573
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.910
after like three weeks it started doing well. And then I was like,

574
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.310
and I was like, Oh, what, what the heck is going on?

575
00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.200
But like I realized at that moment,

576
00:31:07.201 --> 00:31:11.430
like that was an opportunity to ride that momentum. And you know, this,

577
00:31:11.431 --> 00:31:15.360
like once you get on the YouTube train, it's really hard to get it off. Um,

578
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:18.360
but I rode that momentum and I just said like, okay,

579
00:31:18.361 --> 00:31:21.750
well now I'm just riding the momentum. Like I can't really take a break,

580
00:31:21.751 --> 00:31:23.850
but I love what I do. So it's like, it's great for me.

581
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:27.390
<v 1>[Inaudible] Stephanie, good to ride the momentum. I did the same thing. Right.</v>

582
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.810
I did like a day in the life of a Facebook engineer and just blew off,

583
00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.500
like it blew up. And that's what started my channel pretty much. But yeah.

584
00:31:34.501 --> 00:31:38.970
So if ever anyone wants to make a YouTube channel, you should start with that.

585
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:39.840
Okay.

586
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:43.170
<v 2>There's a lot of people in our, like the college niche. There's a lot of people.</v>

587
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.930
<v 1>Great. Now you guys are the future generation of YouTubers.</v>

588
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.050
Like soon I'll become irrelevant. Like in a few years,

589
00:31:49.051 --> 00:31:51.480
like my channel will be irrelevant, will be filled a few guys.

590
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.920
You guys would be like the next generation. So, yeah. And it's funny cause um,

591
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.790
I actually watch a lot of these videos and I always keep tabs on them and it's

592
00:31:59.791 --> 00:32:01.560
fun to see because some of them like, yes,

593
00:32:01.561 --> 00:32:04.320
you can get millions of view for your day in the life video.

594
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:09.000
But if you don't sustain that or if you have nothing to say,

595
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.530
like it doesn't last for long,

596
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.980
there's a lot of people that get like 2 million views or 3 million views,

597
00:32:13.981 --> 00:32:18.840
but then their future videos, nobody cares anymore. But yeah. So, um, yeah.

598
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.850
Make sure you engage your audience. Yeah.

599
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.220
<v 0>Yeah. I agree with that. That's why, um,</v>

600
00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:27.840
I guess my approach is quite different where like I saw the potential in like

601
00:32:27.841 --> 00:32:30.120
making a bunch of Stanford videos like I do,

602
00:32:30.121 --> 00:32:31.440
and it's still sort of have a quota.

603
00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:35.700
Like I shouldn't make one every so often to make sure I'm still on the radar.

604
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.000
But what I noticed about like, you know, like channels you sent to make one,

605
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.460
like video that pop off,

606
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.480
like people subscribe or people view through that one type of content.

607
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.490
And if they can't sustain that, then nobody like wants to watch them. So I've,

608
00:32:48.491 --> 00:32:49.970
I guess what I'm trying to build is like,

609
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.650
people want to watch me and not like the type of video I'm making or like maybe

610
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.980
they just interested in my life. And I, even if it's a bit slower,

611
00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.360
I think I definitely appreciate it.

612
00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.900
<v 1>That more that's very true. Cause like, um,</v>

613
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.740
the way how I thought about it when I start making my ma made my channel was

614
00:33:05.741 --> 00:33:10.690
that I made the start-up series to sustain people by made all like the,

615
00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.390
like how to get into tech. And that was to drive a new audience. Right. And,

616
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:16.930
um,

617
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:21.160
and you can also think about it in a way where you just title it in a way that

618
00:33:21.161 --> 00:33:25.810
is very, you know, external, external, but then once they watch your video,

619
00:33:25.811 --> 00:33:28.450
they're like, Oh my God, this guy is funny. Oh my God, this guy is, you know,

620
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:32.740
so that they can relate to you and stuff like that. But yeah. Have you guys, um,

621
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.460
did people recognize you at school or like in the, on the streets and stuff?

622
00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.120
Yeah. How did it feel? The first.

623
00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.460
<v 0>I guess for me, I've always like, when I first got here, I,</v>

624
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.300
I sort of enjoy feeling invisible. Cause I like to just observe and like.

625
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.910
<v 3>I bet you like bring the dead bird. Yeah, same.</v>

626
00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:49.440
<v 0>Right, right.</v>

627
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.980
But that's in like a specific setting where like people are there to look at me,

628
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:57.820
but like, otherwise, like I'm not very social because I dunno,

629
00:33:57.821 --> 00:33:58.900
I like to think to myself.

630
00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.660
So when people started approaching me and recognizing me,

631
00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:04.870
it was sort of weird because I felt like just this little freshmen at the

632
00:34:04.871 --> 00:34:08.650
school, just trying to learn things and people are like approaching me.

633
00:34:08.651 --> 00:34:12.250
I also choke really hard when people approach me or like a bunch of like kids

634
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:15.040
who like show up to me and they're like, Oh, I watch your videos. And I'm like.

635
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.533
<v 3>Me too.</v>

636
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.880
<v 0>Hello. And uh, yeah. I dunno. It's a, it's a lot to take in. Definitely.</v>

637
00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.300
<v 1>Cool. Cool. Nice. Nice. All right.</v>

638
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.990
Would you guys like the second part of the video where he just,

639
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.290
I just tore around my apartment. Sure thing. All right. Let me.
