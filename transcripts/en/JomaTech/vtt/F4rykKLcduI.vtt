00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.320
<v 0>Quick. Pause. Thank you so much, Squarespace for sponsoring this video.</v>

2
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.330
Enjoy the video. Cool.

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.350
<v 1>All right. So welcome to my channel. So can you tell me a blue,</v>

4
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:13.100
little bit about yourself? We know that you're a competitive programmer,

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.790
but just a little bit about your life. I am coming or a Richter.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.270
<v 2>Uh, and I liked competitive programming, uh,</v>

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.220
to the degree that I decided to work in competitive programming. Um,

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.950
so not only I participate in those contests,

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.330
I also organize the contest programming camps, uh,

10
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.750
preparing for IOI for Olympics for high schoolers.

11
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.860
Right now I'm in USA for Google cogent because I advanced to the finals.

12
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.040
And this is some part of my life that a few times a year,

13
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:46.610
I go to some international competition. Uh,

14
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.580
plus I have a YouTube channel where I teach algorithms.

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.290
<v 1>Nice. So Google code jam. What does it take to get to the final?</v>

16
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.570
Cause I never even got past the preliminary.

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.490
<v 2>Sure. Basically.</v>

18
00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:03.440
It's not about maybe preparing something for the few days before the contest.

19
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:05.690
It's about being very good in allegories.

20
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.610
And obviously for that you need years to practice. Maybe not, if you are a very,

21
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:14.750
very good. And then there are several other qualification rounds, I think,

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.800
free plus one extra preliminary qualification round.

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.510
And then to 25 people I think advance to the finals. That's it?

24
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.490
Just 25, I think 25 plus the champion from the period previous year.

25
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.600
So 26.

26
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.750
<v 1>Who was the champion from the previous year [inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.870
<v 2>And actually he was drinking for the last five years.</v>

28
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.430
<v 1>Oh my God. So he doesn't need to take the preliminary rounds.</v>

29
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.030
He just goes straight to the final. Yeah. Cool. Cool.

30
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.380
So can you talk to me more about what is competitive programming? Exactly.

31
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.120
<v 2>Yeah. I think in sharp,</v>

32
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.890
it's a mind sport where instead of like interests are

33
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.360
poker, you think about cards on your next moves here.

34
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.950
You think about programming, how to program something.

35
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.690
You were given a few problems to solve. Uh,

36
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.290
we've some timely meet constraints for data, how big it can be.

37
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.600
You need to invent quick enough algorithm efficient enough and implemented in

38
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:21.350
time and who is fastest and solves the most problems with.

39
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.200
<v 1>Do they usually care about the time it takes to execute</v>

40
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.790
or just the complexity?

41
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.530
<v 2>That's a good question and complexities very important because it's a</v>

42
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.710
difference of ranking one second or one hour or a day.

43
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.160
And there is usually a time limit, like two seconds,

44
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.700
as long as you are within that time limit, you are okay.

45
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.830
There are some competitions where it might matter or also maybe length of count

46
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.680
how good scarier program produces,

47
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:56.300
because this is some NP hard problem that doesn't have an exact

48
00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:00.250
solution. It's just how solution you will find.

49
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.160
But most of the time is just, you need to pass it.

50
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:06.100
Then you get the number of points that is assigned to this problem.

51
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.740
<v 1>So for example, Google code jam at the end, in the final,</v>

52
00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:15.600
how did you guys compare programs? Is it mostly on the time or the correctness?

53
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.170
<v 2>This is one of those where it's only the correctness and uh,</v>

54
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.670
running within time. And then every problem has some score assigned.

55
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.420
Like this one is 15 pounds. This one is 20 because it's harder.

56
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.250
And the hardest is say 40.

57
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.780
And the sum of points matters. If there is a tie,

58
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.920
what happens of course then when you submit it,

59
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.780
like your last solution means somebody finished in two and half

60
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.350
hours, then he's better than somebody who got the same scurry four hours.

61
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.010
<v 1>Oh, so, okay. So how fast you do it matters? Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.020
What do you think you're going to place?

63
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.040
<v 2>I think around top down, this should be my expected last year.</v>

64
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:58.290
I was second just after [inaudible].

65
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.680
<v 1>That is crazy.</v>

66
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.600
<v 2>This was my one of highest performers in my life. It's not about,</v>

67
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.820
I expect to repeat that. I hope. Of course.

68
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.040
<v 1>So can you give me an example of what a competitive programming problem is?</v>

69
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.940
<v 2>Okay. I will give you, I think a cool example. I probably can't solve it,</v>

70
00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.250
but let's try. I think you can. Okay.

71
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.050
It will show some point of mine. Okay. Let's say there is,

72
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.500
there was a tennis match or it can be volleyball.

73
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.310
And you're given the secrets of, uh, letters.

74
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.250
I ended up whoever player a or scarred the point,

75
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.020
and there are some rules in tennis. Like you need some,

76
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.640
some number of points to win a set than game match. I don't know. I don't know.

77
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.780
Where was myself? Okay.

78
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.730
You're given like sequence for the whole match and you need to tell which player

79
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.580
won, like won the whole game. Exactly. Hunt.

80
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:57.600
Of course you can implement all of that to say now, of course,

81
00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:59.480
if there is a tie at the end of Saturday,

82
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.430
they still need to play maybe for a long time.

83
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.330
It's not like whoever gets four points or whatever means immediately.

84
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.320
And you can implement that in say 10 minutes. Right?

85
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.500
<v 1>I mean, yeah, well, I'm going to do, it's very, very simple. Right.</v>

86
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.600
We have a string of like a BA BA BA B,

87
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.730
and then because I know the rules of tennis.

88
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.320
Imagine if I do know the rules of tennis,

89
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:22.110
I'm just going to increment the points. And then if it's a set,

90
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.270
they already won the set. It's just like, okay, he wants to set.

91
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:25.373
So just live there.

92
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.690
<v 2>Right? Exactly. So you would do that.</v>

93
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.860
And usually what happens during contests is that you see a problem.

94
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.350
You think for a moment about how to implement it,

95
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.820
to implement maybe the back for a little bit, uh, you spend say 10 minutes,

96
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.860
you look at the leaderboard and you saw the,

97
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.350
you see that somebody solved it in 30 seconds.

98
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.010
How is it possible? You might ask.

99
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.100
<v 1>Oh, did they have like preset code that they already wrote?</v>

100
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.040
<v 2>Uh, not necessarily. Maybe it's about like, uh,</v>

101
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.940
pasting the in C plus plus include something. Wait,

102
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.160
so.

103
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.210
<v 1>When you mean 30 seconds,</v>

104
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:02.330
do you mean the run-time was 30 seconds or do they submit it in 30 seconds?

105
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.300
<v 2>You've read the problem and implemented and hit submit in France because they</v>

106
00:06:07.301 --> 00:06:09.190
already heard the question. No,

107
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.730
it's about quickly coming up with a simple idea.

108
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.880
And here the idea is that you bring the last letter.

109
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.350
<v 1>Oh, because, Oh yeah. Cause if you already won, you're the one that ends. Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.350
<v 2>And if this drink is AB whatever happens and at the end there is. Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.420
<v 1>Well that's, that's assuming, that's assuming the string is correct.</v>

112
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.493
<v 2>That's a good point.</v>

113
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.060
There's some say these advantage of people used to competitive programming is

114
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:36.610
that they always assume that data is correct.

115
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.960
Some of the statements said something that there is that sequence describing the

116
00:06:40.961 --> 00:06:43.210
image. Or if the, see,

117
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.780
if the statement said that you are given a sequence of numbers that are in this

118
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.790
entire interval, they will be in this interval.

119
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.050
They don't care about incorrect characters, maybe some number, uh,

120
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.530
being non integer. They just do what they are told.

121
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.630
So they might miss something in real job when they should ask. What if my,

122
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.930
what if user will give me incorrect date?

123
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.910
<v 1>Um, I add super smart. Yeah. Just look at the last letter of the string he won.</v>

124
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.080
Yeah. That person won. Cool. I like that. This is fun. Okay.

125
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.150
And then would you say,

126
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.320
would you say competitive programmers make good software engineers or it there's

127
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:21.154
no relation?

128
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.110
<v 2>It's very hard that I I've seen an article that says there is a negative</v>

129
00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:26.860
correlation,

130
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.420
even for sure they are smart people in the top of competitive programming are

131
00:07:31.421 --> 00:07:34.510
very smart. But on the other hand, uh,

132
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.260
they are maybe over skilled in algorithms that isn't that

133
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.720
important in a job. What is important that you implement carefully,

134
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.190
that you are able to do back stuff? This, uh,

135
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.940
I think this is easy for competitive programmers. They make a lot of mistakes,

136
00:07:51.941 --> 00:07:55.750
so they need to collect, uh, corrected all the time. Uh,

137
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.650
but there are some skills that they don't have and they are good candidates and

138
00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:03.430
some of them will be awesome workers. Some of them will not.

139
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.020
<v 1>That makes sense. That makes sense.</v>

140
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.130
So what are like the biggest contests and platforms for a company?

141
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.150
<v 2>I already mentioned coat versus this is restaurant platform.</v>

142
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.980
There is also Japanese art coder, uh, American Topcoder,

143
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.000
which is a very old platform, like almost 20 years. It was one of the first,

144
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:22.661
well,

145
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:27.580
the other two are quite young and they organize contests online

146
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.870
every week. I think.

147
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.280
So if you combine all those platforms plus several that I didn't mention,

148
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.950
you will have contests every second day or so.

149
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.690
Plus there are some big onsites from time to time like Google couch,

150
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.120
Topcoder open Facebook, hacker cup.

151
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:48.100
Some of them are just organized by big companies to attract skilled

152
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.710
participants and to maybe hire them.

153
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.920
A Google code jam actually is I think the well prepared

154
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.900
one, I also, we've a stream,

155
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.900
quite professional stream that has a lot of advertisement.

156
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.430
And you already know that they will advertise Google stadia this year during the

157
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:09.180
stream, but it's also for programmers.

158
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.380
So there's a lot of clips work with us. This is echo intern.

159
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.530
Please tell us what you do and why you like Google.

160
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.070
It's like one big advertisement.

161
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.420
Of course still I don't complain because I get to compete with other strong

162
00:09:24.421 --> 00:09:28.830
competitors. I have a chance to win money and I have a trip to yes.

163
00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.260
<v 1>Yeah, that's true. Oh, did he pay for your flight here? Yes. What about hotel?</v>

164
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.910
<v 2>They cover hotel sometimes five star one. Uh,</v>

165
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.960
so I've been to few five star hotels only because

166
00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.813
competition's paid for that.

167
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.450
<v 1>Well, what's the prize for like first place, second place.</v>

168
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:50.930
<v 2>Right now it's around 10,000 or $15,000,</v>

169
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.480
which is fine. Especially if you live not in a rich country in Europe,

170
00:09:56.780 --> 00:10:01.040
it's more for example in pond, but it used to be so much more,

171
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.630
really even $100,000 for doing, why is it so low right now?

172
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.840
I think, but this is only my fault. Uh,

173
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.810
that may be because once you in such money,

174
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.870
you don't have an incentive to work in their company.

175
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.493
<v 1>Cause they're trying to recruit.</v>

176
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.870
<v 2>Yeah. Google wants to get those,</v>

177
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.600
those people so that they shouldn't give them money.

178
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.550
<v 1>Okay. Maybe, uh, just a side question.</v>

179
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.100
Do you use to do math competition?

180
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.080
<v 2>I did. I actually in high school Thiel, maybe middle of high school.</v>

181
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.060
I did maps instead of informatics. And I went to some international.

182
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.170
On-sites maybe not as big as Google cogent, but yes, I was,

183
00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:48.530
I think one of the best in Poland on my year. Nice.

184
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.850
And a lot of people in competitive programming are very good in maps.

185
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:58.310
Some of them didn't study computer science, they studied maths or economics.

186
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.870
<v 1>So is it very similar solving for these math questions and solving for coding</v>

187
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:03.410
questions?

188
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.830
<v 2>I think the skills required to comprehend all of that,</v>

189
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.410
to understand the logic implications,

190
00:11:09.411 --> 00:11:13.160
to prove that something will work are similar. I see you,

191
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.280
you need a lot of knowledge that is only for algorithms,

192
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:20.600
but the same people are good in both. Okay.

193
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:21.590
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

194
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.910
Do people usually do competitive programming during university and then do they

195
00:11:25.911 --> 00:11:28.820
stop after it? Because it seems like everyone's so young.

196
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.280
<v 2>Yeah. Most of people are yang. Uh,</v>

197
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.090
maybe also because competitive programming almost didn't exist 20 years ago.

198
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:39.290
Now they're only a few guys that are in the top and over 30,

199
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.740
most of people study a lot in high school maybe, uh,

200
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.390
to prepare for IOI if they are very competitive and skillful in university for

201
00:11:47.391 --> 00:11:52.100
ICPC competition or just to get to some company

202
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.900
because interviews are also about algorithms.

203
00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.430
So competitive programming is maybe a place to, to try,

204
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.870
uh, to, to learn a bit, to compare yourself with others. Uh,

205
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.010
plus there are competitions like Google kickstart that are more mainstream for

206
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.860
programmers. And you have a chance to that.

207
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.580
If you are good to their Google might invite you to an interview.

208
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.490
And after university, once you have a job already, maybe you start a family,

209
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:25.720
you don't have time anymore to practice like several hours a week.

210
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.930
Then why would you continue that? That's true.

211
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.830
Some people still do because they enjoy it, but not a lot of them. Yeah.

212
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

213
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.920
I personally think it's a lot easier to just apply to these jobs

214
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.200
normally than winning a competition.

215
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.910
Do you think the coding questions for the interviews are similar to the

216
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.580
competitive programming questions or is it way easier?

217
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.560
<v 2>Hm. So regarding the first question, how easy it is to get for competitions.</v>

218
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:58.110
It's not that you have to win like Google kickstart to be invited top 200,

219
00:12:58.111 --> 00:13:03.090
maybe even top 500 is enough that you can say that while applying and

220
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.960
maybe they will give you the first interview because of that. Oh, okay.

221
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:11.190
Still you will quickly fail if you are in good, maybe in other areas.

222
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.590
Uh, but it's a chance to be recognized compared to thousands of people,

223
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:21.060
maybe tens of thousands, uh, and problems are similar.

224
00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.090
Competitive programming is harder, uh,

225
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.720
because it's for people that train sometimes here is for that.

226
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.270
It needs to be harder. Uh,

227
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:35.160
but there are just some differences while competitive programming requires some

228
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:36.540
complicated algorithms.

229
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:42.180
Coding interviews sometimes can ask you questions that aren't possible to be

230
00:13:42.181 --> 00:13:45.870
tested with computer. Like maybe some parallel computing,

231
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.270
we've thousands of machines.

232
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.890
You will not meet such a problem in competitive programming because organizers

233
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.090
don't want to get thousands of machines to test your program.

234
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.830
Google organized such a competition when we've hundreds of machines testing your

235
00:14:01.831 --> 00:14:05.610
program, but it had some limitations. It was called distributed culture,

236
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:10.500
core coding interviews have also sometimes other problems that can not appear

237
00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:13.650
in competitive programming. Uh, like for example,

238
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.390
inventing an algorithm that we work in constant time for something like our

239
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.890
invigorating attack,

240
00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:23.670
given an RA binary search some number because the RA started,

241
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.420
it's very hard to test with competitive programming because you need to get that

242
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.500
ROI anyway.

243
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:33.450
So the time spent by computer or checker for that needs to be at

244
00:14:33.451 --> 00:14:35.070
least the linear complexity. Anyway,

245
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.390
when you speak with somebody during interview, they can ask you,

246
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.760
what about this? Can you achieve smaller memory?

247
00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:46.620
Maybe try to get constant memory while program that is automatically

248
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:49.410
judged. Sometimes has some limitations.

249
00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:53.720
Like you cannot distinguish between complexities also then constant factor

250
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:54.440
matters.

251
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.330
So th the fact that everything is tested has the downside of not being

252
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:03.530
able to distinguish everything, but also has an advantage.

253
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.120
Everything is fair and objective. It's not that interviewer likes you.

254
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.210
So he gave you better skirt.

255
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.530
<v 1>Yeah. Quick question. So in competitive programming,</v>

256
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:19.540
does it ever happen that the higher complexity is actually better

257
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.880
because the lower, sorry, the higher complex.

258
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.800
<v 2>What you said to make sense? Like the,</v>

259
00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:27.100
the higher complexity might be faster and better.

260
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.790
<v 1>Because like the constant is too high for like the lower complexity does that.</v>

261
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.010
<v 2>Yes. It might happen. I,</v>

262
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.120
you need to understand when you want to focus on competitive programming,

263
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.070
you want, you need to understand, for example,

264
00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:42.700
that hashtag hash maps have quite high, constant factor.

265
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.790
If you can evolve, these are small. Anyway,

266
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.000
they would fit in an RA, use an error. Instead,

267
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.590
everything will be constant access anyway, but it's faster.

268
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.660
So this is one example. And the other is that maybe some complexities,

269
00:15:58.661 --> 00:16:00.550
theoretically worse,

270
00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.450
but because of small data actually like this,

271
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:08.110
even though it's an square, because any small, you don't care about it,

272
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.350
you don't have to invent [inaudible].

273
00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.600
<v 1>So people don't check your code during competitions, right. They just run it.</v>

274
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.360
<v 2>Even, it might happen that tests are very weak.</v>

275
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.380
Like they do not cover some case, like maybe edge case,

276
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.540
or maybe your algorithm is hubristic and it could be quadratic.

277
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.400
But when data is random,

278
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.360
then for some reason there are some algorithms like that.

279
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:39.700
And organizers tried to care about that pessimistic runtime.

280
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.410
And they try to create as cases, malicious test cases,

281
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:49.180
but they don't always succeed. It's impossible to predict all the answers.

282
00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.850
They have a hard job. So.

283
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.510
<v 1>Do people ever win because they realize the tests aren't that good.</v>

284
00:16:55.511 --> 00:16:59.530
So they could make their code, like even not cover all the edge cases,

285
00:16:59.531 --> 00:17:00.850
but then win because of that.

286
00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.920
<v 2>It might happen, especially during class minutes of a competition or, you know,</v>

287
00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:09.790
already that you will not have time to come up with a solution.

288
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:14.410
So you're just throwing whatever it's maybe like in school writing sub essay,

289
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.060
maybe marking year, the answers by random. Okay. A C B I,

290
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.830
maybe it will pass. And just once every 10 or a hundred at times it will.

291
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:29.590
<v 1>Cool. Cool. Cool. So you have the, you have personally met Kennedy, right?</v>

292
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.880
Yes. I have my team. Right. Can you get him here?

293
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.100
<v 2>Yeah. I think you would need to write to him like a few weeks ago.</v>

294
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:44.350
<v 1>Oh, really? Uh, shoot. Okay. Well he is coming in a Google code jam,</v>

295
00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:45.184
right? Yep.

296
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:46.060
<v 2>But you know,</v>

297
00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.370
usually you plan those trips a few months in advance and you already have

298
00:17:50.371 --> 00:17:55.140
tickets. So there's nothing now that you can do. Oh, well, you know,

299
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.160
some people actually will be here already in advance

300
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.600
because I asked, uh, several guys very,

301
00:18:02.601 --> 00:18:06.000
they maybe want to go to escape room together in San Jose. That's fine.

302
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.210
[inaudible] easy for you guys. Uh, yeah.

303
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:12.870
I think people in competitive programming are very good in SQL.

304
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.420
And so I'm going to with several strong guys and psychosis,

305
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.860
I think that if there are some algorithmic problems as us,

306
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.820
we will be very good, but he's not one of them. Sorry for that.

307
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.460
<v 1>Yeah. So, uh, what about any other, uh, competitors?</v>

308
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.880
Like do they all, are they all in school? What did they do for a living?

309
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:39.320
<v 2>The best ones are those that still after university, they do something.</v>

310
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.250
Of course they are some very skillful and talented, uh,

311
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.320
once in high school or a university.

312
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:50.630
But if some other people have 10 years of experience already, they're better.

313
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:55.910
Those that enjoy the competitive programming and they want to practice for

314
00:18:55.911 --> 00:18:59.030
the sake of it. Uh, because they like it.

315
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.700
And some of them work in university like doing research in algorithms sometimes

316
00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:06.200
in machine learning. I know,

317
00:19:06.201 --> 00:19:10.460
I feel guys that started companies or startups on their own,

318
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.220
or like they do cool stuff like that.

319
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.930
<v 1>I don't compete anymore. Right.</v>

320
00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.200
<v 2>They do some of it, you know, it's,</v>

321
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:20.900
they cannot spend 20 hours a week,

322
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:25.310
but if they like something and their job is a bit related to that,

323
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.570
it's good for them to stay fresh with algorithms,

324
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.120
new algorithms in the world. Uh,

325
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.920
then they can spend several hours a week and it's still useful to some degree.

326
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.090
Some people work in Europe, in university, some in big companies like Google.

327
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.800
They're also people like me that just stay in competitive program.

328
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.570
It's a bit like questioning in school. Why do you need biology for,

329
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:54.690
and the question is to teach your children.

330
00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:58.880
Of course, there are some users.

331
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.440
And I also had internships where I just strictly did

332
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.820
augers, like working on algorithm in a company,

333
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:11.360
selling flight tickets, working on algorithm to

334
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.230
combine single flights into something we've changed.

335
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.620
You don't do that with machine learning because there is just,

336
00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:23.930
let's say thousands of possible sites and you need to combine them in

337
00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:24.950
good enough complexity.

338
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.550
This is exactly a problem that could appear in the programming context.

339
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:29.810
<v 1>Interesting.</v>

340
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.430
So do you mind me asking like how old you are and when you started competitive

341
00:20:34.431 --> 00:20:35.264
programming?

342
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.020
<v 2>I am right now, 24. And I started,</v>

343
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.900
I think when I was around 16, 16,

344
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:46.580
I knew some of C plus plus maybe just starting to be tough

345
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:51.460
Peyton, uh, when I was 16 and when I was 17 or 18,

346
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.280
I bought my first book. I'm not from a big city,

347
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:59.230
so it's not that I had a lot of friends to discuss with or to learn from.

348
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:03.430
Uh, also, uh, not a lot of teachers know programming,

349
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.870
like algorithmic programming. You only in university learned that. Uh,

350
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.280
well I bought a book Carmen's introduction to algorithms.

351
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.420
I've read most of that and I could do it because I was good in maths.

352
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.480
So then my, my skills, my performance,

353
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.440
I think skyrockets also then university meeting,

354
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:28.540
other talented people, uh, competing with them in team ICPC,

355
00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:30.520
competition and.

356
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.920
<v 1>Curiously. That's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. What about, uh, again,</v>

357
00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.400
like when did he start and like, how old is he now?

358
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.740
<v 2>I think he started when he was like six we've called him when he was</v>

359
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:47.550
11 for the first time he was in international Olympiad for high school.

360
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.660
And I think for the first time when he was there, he didn't win.

361
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.870
He won when he was 12. Okay.

362
00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.580
<v 1>Wait, how old is he now?</v>

363
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.840
<v 2>My age or maybe one year older. I think he's 25.</v>

364
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.820
He's even don't don't quote me on that.

365
00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.080
<v 1>Okay. Okay. That's cool. So what do you plan to do in the future?</v>

366
00:22:07.081 --> 00:22:10.920
Like do you think you just want to teach competitive programming or do you want

367
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.730
to do something else? You know, what, if everything paid the same,

368
00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.070
every job paid the same. What would you choose?

369
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:22.020
<v 2>Can I just play games on PS4? You have to stream it.</v>

370
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:23.813
Okay. Okay.

371
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.270
<v 1>So I guess you liked playing games on PS4.</v>

372
00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.361
<v 2>Yes.</v>

373
00:22:27.361 --> 00:22:32.160
But algorithms are also called if I were to chose just till the end of my life

374
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:33.960
to do algorithms are play games.

375
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:39.210
I would choose algorithms because those are more interesting to me, core core.

376
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:44.400
It's called to do some of this and some of that. Uh, yeah.

377
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.730
If everybody paid this, if everything paid the same,

378
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:52.440
then I for sure would continue with my YouTube channel where, uh,

379
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:56.940
for now I don't even have ads. So I earned zero, uh,

380
00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.130
for now, for that. And it's,

381
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.490
I don't think it will change a lot in the near future. Uh,

382
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.090
but I know that I helped some people.

383
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.930
I receive messages that they like me, if it is that they learn something.

384
00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.580
Also sometimes I try coding interview problems just to bring more people to

385
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.430
competitive programming. This is something that people search for.

386
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:22.710
And then maybe some of them will just enjoy algorithms and will stay there.

387
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.490
I also organize camps, um,

388
00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:30.270
teach in high school, some S um, yeah,

389
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.420
also from the organizations site, I'm not only teacher,

390
00:23:33.421 --> 00:23:36.660
but also organizer organizer of contests events.

391
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:40.350
And I liked that I will be doing that in the future.

392
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:44.130
<v 1>Cool. Cool. All right. Well, thank you so much for coming. Uh,</v>

393
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.210
do you want to talk your channel a little bit promoted or something?

394
00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:52.300
<v 2>Yeah. So basically, if, if you want to learn algorithms,</v>

395
00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:56.530
then it's a good idea to check each other out, but I guess that's it.

396
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.630
The name of my channel is Arista we've C H R E C

397
00:24:01.631 --> 00:24:02.410
H T.

398
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.240
<v 1>How did you come up with that username?</v>

399
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.030
Cause that's the same as our competitive programming.

400
00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:07.000
<v 2>Yeah. Uh,</v>

401
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.990
I use Erika in the internet and a lot of people ask me about the meaning of

402
00:24:10.991 --> 00:24:11.290
that.

403
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:16.120
And the answer is it's a bunch of random letters and there is huge advantage to

404
00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:19.560
that. It's never taken the,

405
00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:24.070
if you take something from a book or a, like your name, something like this,

406
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.933
it will be taken.

407
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.330
<v 1>Yeah. That's funny. Cool. All right. Thank you so much for the interview.</v>

408
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.020
I appreciate it learned a lot. Thank you so much. See ya.

409
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.660
