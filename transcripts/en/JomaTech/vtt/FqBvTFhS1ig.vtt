00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>Before we continued as video. I just want to say, thank you,</v>

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:06.270
Dashlane for sponsoring this video more on that later.

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.220
You know, there's one misconception that I hate on the internet.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.570
They always think that PMs don't do anything or that they don't add value.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.060
So what do you say about that?

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.820
<v 1>I think it's hard because I think like there are,</v>

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.110
there are certain roles where it's,

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.290
you don't necessarily need a PM if it's purely like technical,

9
00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:27.530
it's like sometimes a PM doesn't add any value there.

10
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.700
But I think working is like kind of the central point across all these

11
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:35.690
different, like product functions and helping unblock, um, in general,

12
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:39.590
like being a PM, the day-to-day PM role is not like glamorous, right?

13
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:42.350
It's a lot of unblocking, a lot of escalating to other people,

14
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:46.040
a lot of getting people to do things and managing the project itself.

15
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.230
Like the day-to-day aspects of it are.

16
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:53.030
So like not having someone to help do that is one challenging for everyone to

17
00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:57.350
get their job done too. It's like, I think having a vision and spending,

18
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.620
having someone spend time thinking about the overall strategy and not saying

19
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.230
like, okay, the, we only care about building this one feature,

20
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.670
but how do these sets of features like actually manifest itself into like a

21
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:12.380
product that actually is something that's special is like very hard to do when

22
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:15.170
you're just focusing on a very local problem. Right? Um,

23
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:19.370
it's you need like someone to look at the problem holistically to help manage

24
00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:22.670
the pieces, help break it up and set timelines. Um,

25
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.720
and they get like kind of the work all done. Otherwise you've seen it.

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070
Other companies like, um,

27
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.760
there are other companies out there that don't necessarily have PMs and it's

28
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:32.960
really engineering driven.

29
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.930
And the problem is that I've heard from other friends who work at those

30
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:37.910
companies is that you build a really,

31
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.670
you want to build a really cool features and the really,

32
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:43.730
really like flashy stuff that like you would use,

33
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.210
but no one else outside of you or the company would want to ever use that,

34
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.760
lets you build really cool features, but no one wants to use them.

35
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.730
And so it's honestly around like how do you build,

36
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.550
how do you build features and how do you get someone to understand what the

37
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:56.540
users actually want?

38
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.330
<v 0>So you also mentioned like product vision,</v>

39
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:02.510
like that's pretty important because you can't just focus on execution,

40
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.820
but how do you even get better at product vision since you usually only vision a

41
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:08.654
few times?

42
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.570
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Right. I think you're always thinking about it. Okay.</v>

43
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.260
You always see it,

44
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.440
but I think it's a really deeply understanding in order to get real product

45
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:15.831
intuition,

46
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:19.040
you have to deeply understand what the user problem or customer problem is.

47
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.450
I see. And that's either doing research or use it utilizing data and asking the

48
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:25.400
questions that you need. Um,

49
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.290
I think those are the feedback loops that tell you like,

50
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.660
Oh and reading market research, looking at trends,

51
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.640
things like that's where it gives you a vision of like, Oh,

52
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:34.520
this is where the market is headed. Or this is where,

53
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.660
this is where people are having trouble. Um, and that's helps like craft like,

54
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.640
Oh this is like on videos, right?

55
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.940
Like that means like discovery might be really hard or people don't have sets of

56
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.250
controls. Right. And so in that case,

57
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:50.480
like you have to really understand all these external signals to help build

58
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.040
that intuition.

59
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.740
<v 0>Yeah. Thanks for debunking this misconception.</v>

60
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.000
It seems like it's a very messy job and you're trying to make things on

61
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.030
all the time. Yeah. So,

62
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.810
because it's so messy to like unblock people and do all that crap,

63
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.870
like what would make your job easier for different functions?

64
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.250
Like as a software engineer,

65
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.300
how can I make your job easier as a data science test? How can I make your job?

66
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.860
<v 1>Yeah. I think it's all about just setting like timelines and deliverables.</v>

67
00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:17.461
Like if you say,

68
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:21.690
if we need this piece of analysis and you can estimate it correctly to say,

69
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:23.130
yeah, I'll have it done by the end of the week.

70
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.220
And it helps plan things because it's a chain, it's a chain reaction, right?

71
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.160
Someone does an analysis, you have recommendations,

72
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.190
you then work with design to help like scope them out.

73
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.790
They tell you some deadline and then engineering can help. We can work on it.

74
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.060
And so at that point, if those deadlines are not actually like accurate,

75
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.390
then it postpones everything and it makes it pushes things out.

76
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.560
And so it's all about just like getting the proper estimation and chunking it

77
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:50.070
out into the right set of milestones to make sure you continue to make progress.

78
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.270
<v 0>Right. So, so being good at estimating how long it will take certain things.</v>

79
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.690
Yeah. Right. So do you prefer if someone, uh,

80
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.240
overestimates how long it is or underestimates.

81
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.520
<v 1>Mean it's always under promise over deliver. So it's a good model.</v>

82
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.980
That's always the one thing that you could keep in the back of your mind. Yeah.

83
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.030
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. I wasn't very good at estimating when things would be done.</v>

84
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.600
<v 1>It's not necessarily just like a sweating up front, how long it is.</v>

85
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:18.900
It just like if you get three days in the seven day analysis and you say, Oh,

86
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:21.450
it's going to take longer just telling people that like, Oh,

87
00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:24.530
this is actually going to slip a little bit and then you can plan that.

88
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.820
<v 0>That's true. Okay. So what about PMs? Uh, how are they evaluated then?</v>

89
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.163
Because, um,

90
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.650
it might be kind of hard because some products are easier than others.

91
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.220
For example, if the product is already booming versus a product that's crap.

92
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.880
Yeah.

93
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.541
<v 1>I think it's a couple of ways.</v>

94
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:42.630
I think you can do a one on like the product strategy that you have.

95
00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:44.730
Like did you set the right vision and does it,

96
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.090
and it may not necessarily be that like you succeeded, but it's also,

97
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:49.020
if you failed, like,

98
00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:52.080
did you learn why you failed that can help iterate on your product strategy

99
00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:55.710
coming up? So it's not just, you don't get rewarded just for succeeding.

100
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:58.590
You can actually get rewarded for failing, but failing in the right way.

101
00:04:58.591 --> 00:05:01.890
So you had the right hypotheses, did all the research, what you built,

102
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:04.710
just didn't work out and then you learn for why it didn't work out.

103
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.410
That makes your product stronger. It's a second. So that's one,

104
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:09.600
the second one is like pure execution, right? It's like,

105
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.970
did you execute on what you were going to say? You were going to do?

106
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.700
Like if you have six months and you have to build something in six months,

107
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.010
did you actually build it and ship it in six months?

108
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.040
And the last one is more like, kind of cross-functional it's like, did you,

109
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:23.490
were you able to motivate your team? Did they like working with you?

110
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.080
Were you able to unblock them?

111
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.340
And how was your relationship with like other teams outside of your core team?

112
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:33.270
And like, did you were able to get like a lot more out of other people? Um,

113
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.280
and did they like doing it?

114
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.630
<v 0>Do you think the skills to pass the interview as a PM</v>

115
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.960
are the same as the skills to be a good PM?

116
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.520
Cause I feel like for software that's not true. Yeah. Right.

117
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.360
<v 1>Software. It's like, I think you have to pass some bar artificial bar.</v>

118
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:54.360
Like you have to know how to do all these recursion problems,

119
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:57.740
but like in theory you never do it ever in all algorithm problems.

120
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.050
They never do it. In theory and practice and software engineering,

121
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.560
I think in product, it actually gives you a good signal. I'm like,

122
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.610
can you take an ambiguous problem and like break it down if you take,

123
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.640
if you have a really ambiguous problem and you're not able to put a framework in

124
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.670
place to analyze it, you're never going to be, it's going to be really,

125
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:16.520
really hard to be successful. You can learn it for sure. Um,

126
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.640
and then if you can't like have fluidity with some data and saying,

127
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:21.620
here's a hypothesis of why something's down and say,

128
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:24.560
here's how it would prove it. Like you're going to struggle. Like it's,

129
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:25.670
I'm not saying it's all learnable.

130
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.210
I think it's just like there's effort that you can put up front to problem

131
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.710
solving, to learn and to say like,

132
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.140
here's how I would think of stuff that definitely helps.

133
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.680
So I would say it's definitely a more fair.

134
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.190
I think the one thing that isn't necessarily super fair at being someone that's

135
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.650
like young is like experience,

136
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.160
like the fact that people are looking for more experienced people,

137
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.820
like in a role, like you have two more years of experience, like,

138
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.270
and people don't take you for that role or two years less of experience for

139
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.540
someone else. Like, and the CA and what they say is like, Oh, you're not,

140
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.310
you don't have experienced to be in this role.

141
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.120
I think that's a little bit more of a cop out because it's a matter of,

142
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.960
it's just a matter of like, how does this person have the right set of skills?

143
00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:07.580
Like not necessarily experience map.

144
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.070
<v 0>That's true. So for you, uh, especially during your time at Facebook,</v>

145
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.040
what skills do you think were most important to your success?

146
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.580
<v 1>I think at Facebook, it's a lot of just communication, like over communicating,</v>

147
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.040
realize when you work on a really under your team itself,

148
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.940
like people understand all the context for why you're doing things and you don't

149
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:27.310
need to, like, you can get really in the details.

150
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:30.300
But if you take a step up and look at your manager, your manager's manager,

151
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.520
other teams, they lack all like the individual details.

152
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.880
And so it's like keeping those people informed to say, you're working on this.

153
00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:41.740
This is why we're working on it makes your life easier. Um, yeah.

154
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.290
So I think that's like one of the biggest skills you've learned,

155
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.360
especially at a big company is like, how do you manage,

156
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:49.780
like outside of your core team? Because at a small startup, it's easy.

157
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.480
Cause everyone knows that you're working on your finite resources.

158
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.990
Like everyone in the company knows exactly the problems that you're working on.

159
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.900
Whereas a bigger company it's like people are working on so many different

160
00:07:58.901 --> 00:07:59.734
things. It's hard.

161
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.540
<v 0>Hm. So communication matters a lot. What do you hate most about being a PM? Ooh,</v>

162
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.540
I think there's, it's hard. I think.

163
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.300
<v 1>There's a lot of unflattering things you have to do as a PM.</v>

164
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:13.570
Like you have to like commute over-communicating you have to unblock and having

165
00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:14.380
those,

166
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:19.330
like having to like step through politics and like,

167
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.710
and people's incentives is kind of, you're all on the same team.

168
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.070
And the fact that people sometimes act like a different differing agendas is

169
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.460
really difficult because you have to find why if they understand it and then

170
00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:32.230
sometimes like it comes to a head. If those,

171
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:36.310
if those things are not like aligned. And so in that case, it's just like,

172
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.090
there's a lot of unnecessary roadblocks for you to do something that you want to

173
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:42.370
do. And then like, everyone's agreed to, um,

174
00:08:42.371 --> 00:08:45.130
I think that's like pretty frustrating because it's inefficient.

175
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:50.470
<v 0>Can you give me an example of what office office politics actually are?</v>

176
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.870
Cause I'm on my previous video,

177
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.990
I said something about office for data science and a lot of people

178
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:02.550
mistook me thinking that I hate office politics, but that is not true.

179
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.040
I think off of policy, office politics are great,

180
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.610
but I just wish I was better at it. Right. Like I think it's great.

181
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.310
Like I watched billions bunch of office politics. It's not great, but, but,

182
00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:16.440
but it's, it's so juicy. Like I like it. So anyways,

183
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.110
can you give me an example of what office politics actually look like.

184
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.660
<v 1>In real life? I think it just means,</v>

185
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.390
I think it's less like contentious is what people think.

186
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:26.450
I think it just means like you're working with a team, that's not your team.

187
00:09:26.451 --> 00:09:30.620
Right. They have different goals and like they have different incentives.

188
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:32.960
Like if you're on that team, like you have a goal that you want to hit.

189
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.290
Like you're not willing to work with another team because it doesn't mean that

190
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.500
it doesn't help you hit that goal. And so why would you ever want to do that?

191
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.330
Right. And so it's more of like,

192
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.590
how are teams aligned and structured to make sure like, you can reduce that. Um,

193
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:47.780
because like that's just inherent. People are always going to be like, Oh,

194
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:50.630
I like, I'm looking out for my team. Like if that's not the case,

195
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.170
if like you can't help my team, like why would I work? But as in general,

196
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:55.640
you're a part of the same company. So like,

197
00:09:55.641 --> 00:10:00.290
you have to understand where they're coming from. Nothing really juicy, so.

198
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.560
<v 0>Right. Exactly. It's not crazy like backstabbing</v>

199
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.970
or just like, yeah, like it's fair. It's fair to be.

200
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.920
<v 1>Fair. And people come from the right place.</v>

201
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.450
<v 0>So I just want to take a second here to talk to you guys about dash lane.</v>

202
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.340
Dashlane has been a huge time-saver for me. So as you know, I buy a lot of.

203
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.650
So I hate entering my password and my credit card information every

204
00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:27.890
single time. And now with Dashlane, I don't have to,

205
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.340
because every time there's an online form, it just fills everything out,

206
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.980
automatically saving me tons of time.

207
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.250
And it keeps everything secured. Plus,

208
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.880
if any of your personal information gets leaked in the dark web,

209
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.710
Dashlane will alert you because they are actively monitoring the dark net for

210
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:48.260
you. When you do see your passwords get leaked,

211
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:52.250
all you have to do is press one single button and it will change all your

212
00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:55.790
passwords for you. You know, I used to have one password for everything.

213
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:58.250
I use all the apps, all the websites, which is kind of dumb,

214
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.530
but now I take my security pretty seriously. They also have a VPN,

215
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:07.970
so you can access content everywhere and prevent prying

216
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.620
advertisers, eyes, just joking. But seriously, if you're interested,

217
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.860
you can get it for free on your first device. If you go on

218
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.190
dashlane.com/joma and for my viewers, you can get 10% off premium.

219
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.880
If you want to use the VPN or the dark web monitoring.

220
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.540
Now that's pretty cool. All right. That's pretty much it. All right.

221
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.440
Do you have any tips for people who want to transition into PM?

222
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.600
I know we talked about that a little bit, but just like more.

223
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.850
<v 1>Concretely. Yeah. I think like in general, it's like,</v>

224
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.370
just continue to be thinking about like products, right.

225
00:11:40.371 --> 00:11:44.300
Or like products that you use, whether it's like an iPhone, a watch,

226
00:11:44.301 --> 00:11:49.130
like even it doesn't have to be actually like an, uh, an electronic product.

227
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.740
It can be anything. And he's like, okay, how would I make this better?

228
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.050
And then just breaking it down in your head, like, Oh, who would I,

229
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.260
who would use it? Why would they want to use it? Where does this, like,

230
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.890
where does this like a breakdown? How can,

231
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:04.840
what are the things that I can build that make this better?

232
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:07.600
I think it just helps you really think about like a framework. Right.

233
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.041
And then I think like,

234
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:13.660
just like understanding more of like developing a hypothesis of like,

235
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:17.910
why you think something's a case and trying to like prove or disprove it. Um,

236
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.320
so that helped you like develop like the critical thinking.

237
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.340
I think understanding data in general is like, is definitely helpful.

238
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.630
Like being able to learn to write your own queries. Like it's not necessarily,

239
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:32.130
like, it just helps you understand like how the things are done. Um,

240
00:12:32.131 --> 00:12:36.300
and if you need to, you can do it yourself. Um, and then I,

241
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.550
I think it's just like mostly just like curiosity and just the ability to like

242
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.910
really want to dive deep in a product. Like for example,

243
00:12:42.911 --> 00:12:46.720
I was never a software engineer. I didn't know anything about API as,

244
00:12:46.721 --> 00:12:49.630
I didn't know anything about developers platforms and what tools they build,

245
00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:53.470
but I worked for three years on building developer platforms, API APIs,

246
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.220
and like really technical solutions without knowing any of it to start.

247
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.220
And after that, it's like you dive deep, you understand problems.

248
00:13:00.221 --> 00:13:02.740
And you're like, okay. Yeah, here's what the solution is. And you learn.

249
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.070
And so it's all about like, how do you understand what the problem is? You know,

250
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:08.020
the customer or the user or the developer?

251
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.580
<v 0>Uh, I guess what I meant more was, um, you concretely,</v>

252
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.850
did you use any resources to help you prep for progress?

253
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.490
<v 1>I know, I think the best way is like,</v>

254
00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.140
just to do as many mock interviews as you can. How do you get, um, I mean, you,

255
00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:25.860
if you know someone at a company with your friends, like, just ask your friend,

256
00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:30.030
if you just like, give me this prompt and then just like go through it as like,

257
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.640
there's no substitute for like real experience,

258
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.820
if you think about it in your head,

259
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.210
but actually having to communicate and tell people, um,

260
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.610
is a much harder problem.

261
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:43.830
The second thing is just like making sure you understand how to communicate and

262
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:47.220
like explain things. I think people think about it for me, example, for example,

263
00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:49.800
I think of all the things in my head and it's like, Oh, I understand it.

264
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:50.900
But communicating,

265
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.540
proving to someone that you understand a problem is a much harder thing,

266
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.270
but what you can do that it tells them that you understand,

267
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.700
you really can understand what the problem is.

268
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.990
And so I just say like do a ton of like mock interviews with friends.

269
00:14:03.991 --> 00:14:06.570
Like there's some resources online. I don't, I didn't look at any,

270
00:14:06.571 --> 00:14:11.100
but there's some resources online that like really go into like what the types

271
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.920
of things you should look at are there's a lot. Yeah. There's a really,

272
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.420
there's a lot of resources out there.

273
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.280
And the other thing that is help that are helpful,

274
00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:21.840
like is even if you just do basic like look at some basic consulting

275
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.910
frameworks, like, can you just help?

276
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.730
Because understands like how people think about frameworks and breaking things

277
00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:27.564
down.

278
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:32.550
<v 0>But those friends, they have to be in PA they have to be a PM. Right. Okay.</v>

279
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.540
Yeah. I mean, it's kind of hard for some people who don't have PM friends. So,

280
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.830
um, I mean, I guess you could read cracking the PM interview. Yeah. I read that.

281
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.040
I didn't get the job five. I think it's pretty straight.

282
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.890
<v 1>And a lot of companies will tell you like how to,</v>

283
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.050
how to prep and they'll give you resources to prep.

284
00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:50.940
And so you just do it and you go through it.

285
00:14:50.941 --> 00:14:53.060
I think a lot of times I see people when I do interviews,

286
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:57.260
like the resources are all there, but you obviously didn't read them.

287
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.890
Um, and so like, it's not like it's not rocket science to go through.

288
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:03.110
This is just all about the structure and the framing that you have.

289
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.730
<v 0>[Inaudible], let's go to like the personal stuff. All right. More about you,</v>

290
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.930
you know? So like, why did you choose PM one?

291
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.880
<v 1>I wasn't good enough to be a software engineer.</v>

292
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:17.590
<v 0>I was, you were strictly mediocre,</v>

293
00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.140
but you wouldn't want in general.

294
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.500
<v 1>Like, for me, it's like, it was really interesting to build things or to see,</v>

295
00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:26.470
like to write like a couple of lines of code and see something happen

296
00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:29.260
immediately. And I think that was like where it was like, Oh, I want to,

297
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.830
I don't want to work in like client services. I don't want to do other things.

298
00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:35.020
I want to work. I don't want to wait even sales. Right.

299
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.860
Because I want to go like actually build the things that like people use.

300
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.740
And I was like, if you, I'm not a software engineer,

301
00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:43.720
like what are the types of things you can do? Right.

302
00:15:43.721 --> 00:15:47.380
You can start a company or you can work at like the product manager and own a

303
00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:51.430
product and build it from end to end and have a team built team team,

304
00:15:51.431 --> 00:15:54.490
working with you to build it as well. And so it was more around like,

305
00:15:54.491 --> 00:15:57.820
how do I just, I see all this good, these cool things in Silicon Valley,

306
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.910
like outside of Silicon Valley, like, how do you,

307
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.920
how can I build something like that?

308
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.430
And so it was more around like that type of mentality and product gave me the

309
00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:07.450
best chance to do it.

310
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.110
Did you build anything when you were a kid or when you were? Yeah, yeah.

311
00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:12.610
I was actually super into,

312
00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:17.290
I thought I wanted to be like a mechanical engineer or like something like a

313
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.840
material science or stuff like that. Or I,

314
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.010
we have this class in high school where we built, um, we built engines.

315
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.870
We built, like, we actually measured, we built like cosmic Ray, uh,

316
00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.280
uh, finders. And we were able to kind of do really cool. Uh,

317
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:36.610
we were able to do kind of build really cool things in a class.

318
00:16:36.611 --> 00:16:40.120
And I think that was just really fun to get experienced building like mechanical

319
00:16:40.121 --> 00:16:40.954
stuff.

320
00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.880
But then I took a couple classes in college around like building web apps. Oh,

321
00:16:44.881 --> 00:16:48.560
I love that. I thought it was really, really cool to just build something. Um,

322
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:49.810
and I think I went to San Francisco.

323
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:52.780
Like the first class you take is like CS one Oh six, a I'll really.

324
00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.030
<v 0>Anyone, but everyone.</v>

325
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.220
<v 1>Has, I think 95 or nine is optional,</v>

326
00:16:57.221 --> 00:16:59.710
but 95% of the undergrad class now takes it seriously.

327
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.990
My class was like 1,200 people wholly. Um, but the last project you build is,

328
00:17:04.991 --> 00:17:08.350
I mean, the projects you build are a one, you build a rip breaker.

329
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.920
<v 0>I can't believe you screwed up. I can't believe you did that too,</v>

330
00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.040
because I still see some people building that. Yeah. It's a very common,

331
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.053
it's a crime.

332
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:19.240
<v 1>And the last one was to build a watered down version of Facebook. Really.</v>

333
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.850
It had the basic functionality of friend requests wow.

334
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.190
From writing on things and that'd be easier. Yeah.

335
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.610
And so the ability that you can actually see that and build it, um,

336
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.080
that he was definitely a little bit yeah,

337
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.880
you got some of the starter packages for it,

338
00:17:30.881 --> 00:17:33.010
but like the fact that you were able to build and see like,

339
00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:37.600
Oh my lines correspond to this stuff. Um, it was really cool.

340
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:42.790
<v 0>Wow. No wonder why Stanford is such a good school. Holy. All right.</v>

341
00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:47.500
So a little bit more philosophical. Yeah. You know,

342
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.010
what are you working towards in life? Yeah.

343
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.330
<v 1>I think it, they might want to definitely at some point,</v>

344
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.560
want to like start a company or join something really small. Right.

345
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.633
I think the problem,

346
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.520
the problem I see a lot is that people start companies for the sake of starting

347
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:00.031
companies,

348
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:03.180
because they think it's like a quick way to get rich in the end of the day.

349
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.650
Like that's not going to happen.

350
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.550
Like the odds are so much against you that like it, the only way it's going to,

351
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:11.610
you're gonna give yourself the best chance of succeeding is if you are really

352
00:18:11.611 --> 00:18:16.110
passionate about that area and willing to spend 10, 15 years, like building it,

353
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:19.560
even if it re even if it might fail. Right. And so it's like,

354
00:18:19.561 --> 00:18:22.770
I think the only way I would think about starting a company is like, if,

355
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.090
if I had enough conviction and motivation and a specific problem to solve it,

356
00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.450
otherwise I think joining a company super small,

357
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.630
where you help build the product from scratch,

358
00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:35.190
but not necessarily come with the idea.

359
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.010
It's something that's really fascinating because it's like,

360
00:18:37.011 --> 00:18:39.240
how do you bring something that's super small to scale and like,

361
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:42.870
hopefully grow it. Um, so that's kind of where I want to go. Um,

362
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.680
I think I've learned some pretty, really pretty good skills now in order to.

363
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.070
<v 0>Nice, wow. A true builder. You are. That's nice.</v>

364
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.980
But what kind of problems would you like to solve?

365
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:56.630
Like what are the areas that you care about?

366
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:57.471
<v 1>Like,</v>

367
00:18:57.471 --> 00:19:00.080
there's a lot of stuff that happens just on just like getting people to use more

368
00:19:00.081 --> 00:19:03.290
things. Right. Like, I mean, I work on products, they do the same thing. Right.

369
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.770
But I think there's something around like some of the social good around like

370
00:19:06.771 --> 00:19:07.610
health, right?

371
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:12.380
How do you make things health more accessible on some of the more societal level

372
00:19:12.381 --> 00:19:16.610
problems that people are trying to tackle, but as much trickier, right. Um,

373
00:19:16.611 --> 00:19:20.590
health has won wellbeing. What you care about. That's what I care about.

374
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.190
I want to see something, I want to see something.

375
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.190
I want to see something that really makes an impact in people's lives.

376
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.620
If it's like money transfer to,

377
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.880
to rural countries and making it easy for people to bank. Right.

378
00:19:31.881 --> 00:19:34.490
Like I think that's something that you can just see impact of a product you're

379
00:19:34.491 --> 00:19:37.310
building. Like, yes, you can build a product. That's cool.

380
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.880
But seeing people use it in a way that like actually changes their lives,

381
00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:44.240
like I think is something that would, I would love to do. Cause as mentioned,

382
00:19:44.241 --> 00:19:46.910
it's more mission driven. Cool. Um, yeah.

383
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.510
I think we're doing stuff around like sports is also super interesting.

384
00:19:50.511 --> 00:19:54.590
Like maybe there's so much like so much data out there to make better decisions

385
00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:58.190
from like your sleep to your health, to your performance. Um,

386
00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.420
that doesn't exist.

387
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.560
I'm just saying that's a really super interesting piece as well as education,

388
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.560
all of these like things where people can, like, you can actually see,

389
00:20:06.561 --> 00:20:11.480
people have fundamental changes in like wellbeing is I think something that

390
00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.433
is interesting on work.

391
00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.820
<v 0>Nice. Nice. Yeah. Just to make sure that your incentives are, are true.</v>

392
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.920
So if every job paid the same, what would you do?

393
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.370
Oh, if every single job paid the same.

394
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.920
<v 1>I personally, this is going to be out of left field,</v>

395
00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:29.870
but I think I want to work in like the state department,

396
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.220
the state department and government.

397
00:20:31.221 --> 00:20:34.700
I think it'd be really cool to be like working, um,

398
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.230
foreign affairs and work like with kind of governmental policy across like

399
00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.830
foreign policy across like different parts of the world. Um,

400
00:20:42.831 --> 00:20:44.420
I think it's hard to get into it.

401
00:20:44.421 --> 00:20:48.580
I think it's like the process FICO working in the government is like

402
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.000
ferry antiquated, um, where it's just like,

403
00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:55.420
there's no real good career trajectory. Um,

404
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.860
but I think that's like super interesting.

405
00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:00.540
<v 0>That's true. That's true. That's cool. So what about now?</v>

406
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.220
Like what do you do outside of work?

407
00:21:02.221 --> 00:21:04.650
Let's not talk about what do you do outside of work?

408
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.200
<v 1>I love being like, I love being outdoors.</v>

409
00:21:07.201 --> 00:21:10.830
I love like how of being can tell being hiking. I like go hiking.

410
00:21:10.831 --> 00:21:12.960
I love going skiing. I love traveling. Oh yeah.

411
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.850
I'm going to Japan in a couple of days.

412
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.660
<v 0>Oh really? Yeah. Did everyone's going to Japan? Cool. All right.</v>

413
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.520
Thank you so much for coming in. Yeah, appreciate it. Yeah. All right. See ya.
