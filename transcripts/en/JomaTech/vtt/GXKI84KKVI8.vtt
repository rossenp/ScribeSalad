00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.540
<v 0>Welcome to the Joe show the show where we give you tips and tricks on how to</v>

2
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:06.420
land a successful career. In tech, the last video,

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:10.230
I talked about how I got my first internship, which was at Scotiabank,

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.910
and I promised that I will make further ones about different internships.

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.200
So this is the second internship I had. It is at Citadel. Oh yeah.

6
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:22.260
I just want to say shout out for the people who, um, told me to,

7
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.670
to make this video.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.540
I guess a little bit of context before I was a software engineer or my first

9
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:29.040
year in university of Waterloo,

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
I actually did not want to be a software engineer. I want to work in finance,

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.310
but you know,

12
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:39.300
you'll see later on why became more of a software kind of guy than a finance

13
00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:42.900
guy. And it's kind of it's because of Citadel actually.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.300
And it was without further ado. Let's.

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.630
<v 1>I just want to start over.</v>

16
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.310
<v 0>By talking about the benefits.</v>

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.840
Citadel not going to lie was my highest paid

18
00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:02.510
internship out of all the other ones. So what I got,

19
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:07.190
I think I had 7,800

20
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:09.320
$7,800 a month.

21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.400
So it's kind of like $45 an hour.

22
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.630
You can say if you work 40 hours a week, and then you also had free housing,

23
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.610
I had a, I had a studio apartment and it was kind of like a penthouse.

24
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.090
It wasn't really a penthouse, but basically you had like, you know,

25
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:29.900
full windows and you could see the Lake and stuff. And it was amazing.

26
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.370
The view was beautiful. It was gorgeous. They get lunch, breakfast and dinner.

27
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.150
So you get to eat there if you want. Yeah. So out of all the internships,

28
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.620
this one probably paid the most.

29
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.240
If we combined all the benefits and the monthly pay together. So yeah,

30
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.340
it was a pretty good internship. So, all right.

31
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:49.850
Let's get to how I got the job in the first place. So remember,

32
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.760
last time I said, I went to university of Waterloo,

33
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.270
so I was in co-op and then this was my second co-op term.

34
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.180
So I did the same thing. I did a ranking. Uh,

35
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.930
basically what happens in ranking is you applied to a lot of jobs and then later

36
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.620
on you could see if employers want you, or did they rank you when he rank you?

37
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:08.210
It means they don't want you to, like, they're not,

38
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.830
you're not the number one choice,

39
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:12.860
but if the number one choice does not want the job, you might get the job.

40
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.810
So that's how you order the worst. Let's look at my resume. Let's look, uh,

41
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.850
let's look at what I did. Okay. So as you can see, still using my old,

42
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.390
late tech format. So I got my first job experience,

43
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:30.590
which is that Scotia capital from the previous video. But I think what got me,

44
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:35.270
the job was actually my personal project and just how I

45
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:38.480
aligned with like the finance slash software type of guy.

46
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.610
So I'll show you what it is. So here, as you can see prediction trading bot,

47
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.490
this was the project I talked about last time.

48
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.940
They really liked that because it's really the finance and it shows that you can

49
00:02:49.941 --> 00:02:54.350
code, you know, it shows I can code Python and I'm scrappy. And basically,

50
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.460
you know, I could make something that runs and it doesn't die. So next project,

51
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.750
ramen international training competition. I think this one mattered too.

52
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.000
Not because it showed my coding skills,

53
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:08.020
but it showed because I care about finance and at least I would have like, um,

54
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.070
you know, context,

55
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:13.030
like finance context so that they don't need to re-explain everything.

56
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.073
But to be honest,

57
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.530
most software engineering jobs in finance or like technical jobs in finance,

58
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.450
they don't care if you don't know anything about finance,

59
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:22.510
because they think they can teach you. They know they can teach you, you know,

60
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.590
finance stuff is easy,

61
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.130
but the technical skills that's kind of hard to teach and it requires more

62
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:27.970
resources for them.

63
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.330
They usually prioritize you knowing your technical stuff really well,

64
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:34.570
rather than you knowing your finance stuff. And then the other project, uh,

65
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.650
smash player database. Uh, yeah, I used to be really into super smash Emilia.

66
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.110
And what I did was I was really into,

67
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.490
I was into like a Toronto community or I used to play competitive smash a lot.

68
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.730
I wasn't really good. I never got out of the pools, but I mean,

69
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.280
like if I play against a casual player, I'll probably beat the out of them,

70
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.000
but I was really interested in like ranking players.

71
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.470
I want to see who's actually better than who, so I won.

72
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.680
So I made it like an ELO kind of thing where you could input, like,

73
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.910
who'd you play it against and then, you know, using ELO, calculate your ranking.

74
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.780
And that's like the first time that I learned how to make like a website that

75
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:11.710
has like, could, you know, create, read, update, delete, and stuff like that.

76
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.690
But I used PHP, which is like, like very old school,

77
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.210
but at least, you know, I learned the fundamentals and then yeah,

78
00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.410
CRC robotics I've had talked about last time and I kept in my resume. So yeah.

79
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.620
So that was my resume going in. All right. So let's talk about the interview.

80
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.920
So how it worked.

81
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.410
I had two phone interviews and then one onsite and on the onsite I had three

82
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:37.770
interviews. So the first phone interview was, uh, it was pretty easy,

83
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.810
cause it was a fit question. Basically,

84
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:42.240
you talked with the recruiter and you talk about, Oh,

85
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:45.390
why do you want to join Citadel? What have you done in the past? You know,

86
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.710
what do you know about finance?

87
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.900
So I thought she really liked me because I showed a lot of passion, passion.

88
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.650
And then I also talked about my technical skills and how like, you know,

89
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:57.600
I have a CS degree, I learned C plus plus,

90
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:00.780
which is perfect because a lot of their code base are in C plus plus.

91
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.780
And the reason for that is because, you know, it's high performance, you know,

92
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:07.080
they write, you know, really high-performing code, you know,

93
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.850
so they love it. They like that. The fact that I use C plus plus the most.

94
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:14.550
So the second one, yeah. Interview is a technical one.

95
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.500
I don't quite remember exactly what it was because it was four years ago.

96
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.790
But I do remember that I did not code cause we didn't open code Pat or anything.

97
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.940
He was asking me a lot of like theoretical question or computer science

98
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:30.900
question. I remembered it was a question asking about imagined or multiple,

99
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.480
you know, it's, it's something related to this,

100
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:37.500
but multiple threads wanting to change your database,

101
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.050
like how would you make sure that, you know,

102
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:42.000
you don't have like corruption of data,

103
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:46.050
like imagine if you need to update one row and another row,

104
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.560
but then at the same time, another guy's updating a row like transactions.

105
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.830
So what would you do? So then you have to talk about the concept of locks.

106
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.110
They want to make sure that you understand what locks are,

107
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.000
because I think you work with it a lot in, at Citadel or at least my team.

108
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.230
I was pretty surprised that I got the on-site interview because I didn't think

109
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.080
my phone interview went that well, because I don't know.

110
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.950
I was scared that he saw through my and I didn't know what the I was talking

111
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:12.800
about when I was talking about locks and stuff. But you know,

112
00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:16.490
I guess I tricked him because I got an onsite. Now,

113
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.730
funny thing about the onsite. This is, this is a funny story. Um,

114
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.340
one 40 onsite, uh, before going there, I went to Montreal first.

115
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.160
Cause that's where I lived all the other candidates that had an onsite.

116
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.670
They went from either Toronto Waterloo. So they took the same, uh,

117
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.760
they took the same plane. I was the only one that was taking it from Montreal.

118
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.670
So the funny thing is when I went there for my onsite,

119
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.570
no one else from my school was there, no one I Waterloo was present.

120
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.140
So then I was like, Oh. Then I just get like lucky.

121
00:06:45.141 --> 00:06:48.590
And then I probably just got the job because I was the only candidate.

122
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.180
That's not true because apparently they, they flew them out later on.

123
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.500
But I do think that me being there first had an advantage somehow.

124
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.020
And then the interview process, it was, um,

125
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.990
you do three interviews during the day, the first interview,

126
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.660
this guy was more of a probability kind of guy.

127
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.950
So this guy asked me like two brain teasers and like one probability question or

128
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.470
it was like two probably questions, one brain teaser.

129
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.700
And then the second interview, second interview was, I think it was a hard one.

130
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.370
This interview, I would call it like C plus plus theory or something like that.

131
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.210
Basically it asked like, what is the order of like deletion? And so far,

132
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.690
it was very successful as related. And then I think he asked me about locks too,

133
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:34.170
like how it works or like semaphores so make sure, you know, your,

134
00:07:34.171 --> 00:07:38.240
your C plus plus theory or I guess like, you know, concurrency stuff.

135
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.560
Cause I think that's really important,

136
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:43.310
especially in like a high-frequency kind of firm. And then the third one,

137
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:45.320
the third one was pretty chill. Uh, the third,

138
00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:49.820
almost like a classic classic interview where, you know,

139
00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:53.570
first he would ask you to, you know, make a class of design,

140
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.730
to design a class that was served a certain purpose.

141
00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.350
And that purpose for me was like, imagine you have a, you have a portfolio, uh,

142
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:03.560
what would you want to keep? And then after that, after I designed the class,

143
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.230
the second question was like a simple coding question.

144
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.690
I was pretty excited and I thought I did all right,

145
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.890
but I didn't have any expectations because I didn't want to keep my hopes up.

146
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.850
But when I went home, they called me and they said like, Oh, you know, we,

147
00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.590
everyone liked to, uh, we want you to work for us and here's the offer.

148
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.650
And during that time I had other offers too. For example,

149
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.710
I was thinking about going to Bloomberg because I also got an offer at

150
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:31.550
Bloomberg, but I was pretty happy that I'd been accepted because you know,

151
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.570
like Citadel ended up being a lot higher in pay. So that's cool.

152
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.610
Let me show you, um,

153
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.620
what my job offer or like the ranking looks like in Waterloo in case

154
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:45.440
some of you do I'm wearing the Waterloo shirt, but anyways,

155
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.000
in case some of you want to, in case some of you want to,

156
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.740
you know, maybe join Waterloo in the future is what it looks like. Uh Oh, okay.

157
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:58.620
Yeah. So here you can see the job titles employers,

158
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.040
and when it says offer, it means they offered you. And when it says ranked,

159
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.660
it means that you're not the best candidate,

160
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.690
but if the other people don't take you, then I'll take you.

161
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.450
So this is how it looks like, get you interviewed, like,

162
00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:10.920
those were the only interviews I got,

163
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.420
I got 10 interviews and then five of them accepted me. So yeah.

164
00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:17.640
So then that's how, that's how it works. Okay.

165
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:22.590
I guess I'll talk about how it was at Citadel. Um,

166
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.460
I worked at the options market making team, so it was a,

167
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:31.080
it was pretty coding intensive because you know, it's like high frequency. It's,

168
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.340
uh, it feels more of a business than kind of like gambling because some teams,

169
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.810
you know, they just gamble on oil or like they just gamble on certain assets,

170
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.510
but like market-making was like, you have, you know,

171
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.100
you have regulations and then you have deals with the exchanges.

172
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.870
So, you know, it feels like if it was more of a business and like, uh, you know,

173
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.680
low risk kind of, um, kind of team. So yeah, so the work we worked,

174
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:59.520
decently hard, people work pretty late, um, compared to Facebook, you know,

175
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:03.630
it's around the same. I feel like it's not crazy when I worked there. Um,

176
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.480
I mostly worked on their C plus plus code base.

177
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.380
So it was a lot of C plus plus I learned a lot actually before this internship,

178
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:12.720
I didn't know about anything because of this internship.

179
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.280
I learned about networking, you know, TCP, UDP kind of thing. I learned about,

180
00:10:17.281 --> 00:10:20.790
you know, OS stuff I learned about processes.

181
00:10:20.791 --> 00:10:24.780
I learned about multithreading I learned about locks semaphores and all these

182
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:25.614
good stuff.

183
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.210
So this was a very good internship because I learned a lot about like CS

184
00:10:30.211 --> 00:10:33.420
fundamentals and then it made school like a lot easier.

185
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.780
So like an example of what I did there, I probably can't say much,

186
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.460
but in some ways I roll my own web server, you know, like I'm not saying like,

187
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:44.730
Oh, you just install no JS and put express and stuff like that. No,

188
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.170
I actually wrote like a server that receives a TCP connection and then receive

189
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.280
HTTP request response, and then follows the www like,

190
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.510
um, specification and then receive that.

191
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.470
And then I spit out a string back to that. So it was very low level.

192
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.320
And in addition to that, I also wrote my own web socket layer.

193
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.560
So I don't know if you guys know what that is, but like it's pretty popular now.

194
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:12.510
So I'm pretty sure you guys know what web sockets are,

195
00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.830
but basically instead of using the HTP requests, you could do a web socket,

196
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.610
which means it's actually one TCP connection with the server that does not get

197
00:11:20.611 --> 00:11:24.000
killed. And you send messages to each other is actually old technology,

198
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.810
you know, because how HTP works is like you send the HTP request.

199
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.240
So that means you open a TCP connection,

200
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.850
you send the thing and then you close it to speak connection.

201
00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:36.270
And then when you send another HP connection, you do it again. You close it.

202
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.180
So there's a lot of overhead web socket takes care of that.

203
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.530
It's just one connection stays on and you send message to each other. Next time.

204
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:43.921
I see you,

205
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:48.270
I'll be talking about LinkedIn and how I got a software engineering internship

206
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.200
there. So if you want to see what's going to happen or how I got that job,

207
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:53.663
don't forget to like.

208
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.220
<v 2>Ooh, I forgot to mention the startup series. Yeah, it's still going on.</v>

209
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.040
Don't worry about it. The next episode is coming real soon.
