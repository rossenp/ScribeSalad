00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>What are you doing for Waymo, cruise and Uber? Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.150
So what we've done at scale is built the data platform for AI.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.040
So AI is really built on top of data and these algorithms require

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.090
billions and billions of examples of labeled data to be able to perform in a

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:16.470
safe or reliable way.

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.440
So this 22 year old interviewed me for a full-time

7
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.940
position and rejected me just kidding.

8
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.340
He was 19 when he interviewed me and rejected me, that was three years ago.

9
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:34.970
And that was a senior at Waterloo. Well, in my defense,

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.430
they never actually explicitly rejected me.

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.270
They just go sit me after the interview, I'll show you the emails later.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.640
Let's take a look at their old website.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.760
This company used to be called scale API,

14
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.670
and it wasn't focused only on labeling trading data.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.430
They built an API for human labor.

16
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.070
We're going to go back to August, 2016.

17
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.903
<v 1>Huh?</v>

18
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.800
<v 0>I don't think that's it.</v>

19
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.310
Ah, okay. That's more like it. So it kind of like task rabbit, but with, uh,

20
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.970
without the in-person stuff. So like phone surveys, transcription,

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.620
e-commerce tagging some categorization outsourcing work,

22
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.490
essentially. Now they only focus on categorization,

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.490
AKA labeling for model training.

24
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.590
So refined work.

25
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.910
The scale was funded by a Lucy gro and Alexander Wang.

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.380
Even as a name, looks like a startup. Anyways,

27
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:39.620
back then there were only two co-founders and they were looking to hire their

28
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:43.190
first engineer. So I applied here's the email exchange.

29
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:48.110
We had Lucy grill actually meshed with it on

30
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:52.280
Tinder a year ago. She didn't respond to me, but, but then again,

31
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.890
my opening message wasn't that great.

32
00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.653
<v 1>So apparently.</v>

33
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.100
<v 0>They stood out because I did a lot of different roles, so that's good.</v>

34
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.930
As a startup, we look for someone who can wear many hats. Well,

35
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:12.350
that's good. They quickly hit me up with a take-home project.

36
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.310
Oh. Well, I mean, it's too late.

37
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:23.450
Now the project asked me to create posts, end points for them.

38
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.280
So their customers can send annotation box requests, AKA send images,

39
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.480
and then we,

40
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:34.460
or scale API will have their contractors drop boxes around whatever they want

41
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.450
and then send them back to the customers where they will probably use it for

42
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.190
some machine learning model or something.

43
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.710
So this project just focuses on this part and the UI

44
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.580
for the scale contractors to actually draw the boxes. Actually,

45
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.580
I think I still have the code for this. Let me whip it up.

46
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.490
All right.

47
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.320
So here's what I built so that the contractors can use to draw

48
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.110
boxes. All right. Let's send it some requests.

49
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.520
So here we see there's four images or four requests I'm sending.

50
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.680
All right. And then we'll see this.

51
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.790
And here you go.

52
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.380
So you could see now that you have a few requests and here you see a

53
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.640
picture of, um,

54
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.500
a few cows and here it says you have to annotate baby cow and

55
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:43.200
big cow. And then the instructions, it says,

56
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:46.890
draw a box around each baby cow and big cow.

57
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.910
So that's cool. So I think it's pretty simple. You just, you know,

58
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.470
draw them baby cow, baby cow, baby cow. Oh no,

59
00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:58.440
that's not a baby cow. So, you know, you can exit out,

60
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.570
switched a big cow and then annotate the big cow and then you can

61
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:07.260
also, uh, reset it. You could also say it's broken.

62
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.070
I don't know if ever it's broken and then there's also the urgency here.

63
00:04:11.071 --> 00:04:14.220
You could also sort by urgency if you want. So here you go.

64
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:17.880
You have urgency sort by urgency sort by date.

65
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.980
You could also click another one if you don't want to do this one right now. Uh,

66
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:27.210
yeah, I think that's pretty much it. So let me just annotate this big cow,

67
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.200
baby cow, baby cow, and then mama cow.

68
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.950
This will be saved in a database and send to the customer and the customer

69
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:37.740
received real, received these things.

70
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.720
And then you just submit and then you submit it.

71
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.140
And then here's another example. Um,

72
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.970
I think this is a picture of a K-pop group called the notes.

73
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.010
Okay. I, I know it's black pink. Okay. I know it's black pink. So here it says,

74
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:57.960
draw a box around the best black pink member and then the objects it's like my

75
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.590
bias. Okay. Um,

76
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.980
let's see. Hmm.

77
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.403
Okay.

78
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.310
Okay. And then, Oh, Oh.

79
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.070
Are you serious?

80
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.130
All right. So I think you get the point. And, um,

81
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.440
they also told me to use demean stack, um, if I can,

82
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.260
but to be honest, I wasn't much of a front end guy.

83
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.160
So I ended up using the men stack, you know,

84
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.180
very patriarchal of me. Um, I had some angler,

85
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.010
but it was clear that I wasn't really using the framework. Right.

86
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.390
But I mean, they said they loved it though. Um, but I have a feeling,

87
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:06.590
they didn't look at the source code until later on when it goes to me.

88
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.000
So no hard feelings though. I mean, I I'd go to myself too.

89
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.800
I would have been a trash employee.

90
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.810
<v 1>What's popping guys. Here's a day in the life of an early startup employee.</v>

91
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.730
So here's me coding right now.

92
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.980
<v 0>So they invited me for an interview and, uh, Alexander does CEO interviewed me,</v>

93
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.340
we just chatted. And then he asked me an algorithm question.

94
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.820
The question was a fine median in the data stream question.

95
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.290
He had to give me a hint for me to solve it. So, um,

96
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.650
that probably didn't help my chances. And, uh,

97
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.070
unfortunately he didn't respond to me after the interview.

98
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.770
And then as you can see,

99
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.840
here's my last desperate attempt after a month. I don't know,

100
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.600
actually, actually that was my last attempt.

101
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.760
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
