00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.173
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.530
<v 1>All right. So today we are going to talk about money.</v>

3
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.550
I was inspired by Stephen Graham because he was talking about his multiple

4
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:39.440
income sources, but because I'm an idiot or a baller, you know,

5
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.550
tomato, tomato,

6
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.650
I feel like it's more fitting that I show you guys my reckless spending.

7
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.910
So as you know,

8
00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:51.770
I got $45,000 in bonus with my new software engineering job.

9
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.780
So what I did was that I took $19,000 of it and put it

10
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:01.490
into my 401k so that the company, dude, I'm kidding, man, dude,

11
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.320
I'm not a loser. I don't do 401ks. Also, you didn't click this video for this.

12
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.880
You clicked it for my reckless spending.

13
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.880
So I'm going to show you so as you can see,

14
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.920
if I do see my spending over time, it's pretty much a hockey stick.

15
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.490
I mean, usually people would be pretty happy about hockey stick graph,

16
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
but I mean, if this is my spending, so I don't think that's a great thing.

17
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.210
So as you can see, according to this, my last month spending was

18
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.800
$18,900. And well, I mean,

19
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.730
you know, I mean,

20
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:38.270
we should dig deeper into it because it's not always accurate because sometimes

21
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:42.260
the program, they, they look at transfers and they think that suspending,

22
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:43.190
but it's actually not,

23
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.230
or actually spend more and it just wasn't recorded on this program.

24
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.490
So we're going to try to export all of that into an Excel spreadsheet and then

25
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:56.840
I'll dive deep into it. All right, before we continue this video,

26
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:59.600
I just want to say that viewers discretion is advice.

27
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.270
I made this video for entertainment purposes.

28
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.420
Please do not spend all your money recklessly like me.

29
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.890
And you have to know that my net worth is totally fine.

30
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.780
It has been growing faster than ever.

31
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.760
So please spend responsibly did not

32
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.120
do like me. It's only for entertainment.

33
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.670
And if you're wondering, how is my net worth still growing so fast,

34
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.090
despite me spending so much? Well, I'm not going to tell you,

35
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.520
is it because I'm a trust fund, baby? I don't know.

36
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.020
Is it because of my Bitcoins?

37
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.223
<v 0>I don't know,</v>

38
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.800
enjoy the video.

39
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.310
<v 1>So I'm having, I'm having problems with the autofocus.</v>

40
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.050
So I'm going to have to put this in the background.

41
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.460
So in case you were wondering why I have a Bitmoji, this is what I use it for.

42
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 2>All right. Okay. There we go.</v>

43
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.641
<v 1>All right.</v>

44
00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:10.140
So now what we're going to do is I'm going to rename the description just for

45
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.750
one's, uh, privacy reasons and also too,

46
00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:16.770
so that I actually remember what it is because now sometimes the names are quite

47
00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:20.100
cryptic. It doesn't mean anything. So I'm going to do that first.

48
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.690
And then secondly, what I'm going to do,

49
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.770
I'm going to separate them into buckets of spendings.

50
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.260
Cause I don't like the preset spendings that they use.

51
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.420
So I'm going to bucket them into birthday gift, a business expense,

52
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.480
charity, entertainment, food, uh, I don't,

53
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.560
f-ing no materialistic desires, medical, other rent,

54
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.300
self-improvement transportation and travel. Before you ask me what they are,

55
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.210
I'm going to go through them. Okay. So don't worry about it.

56
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.810
And I don't even know it's just because I didn't want to sort them anymore.

57
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.040
There were a lot of small purchases from Amazon and I didn't, I don't have time.

58
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.190
I don't have time to sort through all of them. Okay. All right. So I got it.

59
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.790
I did a lot of data cleaning cause you know, I'm a, I'm a data scientist.

60
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.790
So I ordered it by the amount spent.

61
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.940
So you could see it in order of amount spent. All right.

62
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:12.990
So let's go to the summary now. Uh, I made a pivot table and then you know,

63
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:17.070
a graph because why not? Honestly it's not even necessary.

64
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.950
But if you look at the breakdown, the,

65
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.330
the biggest expense is this line here, which is materialistic desires,

66
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.300
which is everything that's really at the shopping and stuff that I don't need.

67
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.380
So that is the highest spending with $4,000.

68
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.210
And then the next highest is entertainment. That is like concerts.

69
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 2>What else?</v>

70
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.080
<v 1>It's like concerts, comedy shows, stuff like that.</v>

71
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.340
And then here it's like business expense. This is related to like cameras.

72
00:04:47.341 --> 00:04:50.790
Anything that I need to run my YouTube channel. Well, I mean,

73
00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:55.140
I actually don't need it. It's more okay, fine.

74
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:59.040
Some of it can go to materialistic spending, but it's related to YouTube.

75
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.700
So I'll put it in business expense. And then we have food,

76
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.080
which is a thousand dollars,

77
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.550
which includes restaurants actually only includes restaurants.

78
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.110
I never do groceries. So it's, it's mainly restaurants. And then we got rent,

79
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.740
which is my rent. I mean, I don't pay 4,600.

80
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.540
I don't know if you saw my other video. And I said, I paid 4,600 chill,

81
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.740
man. I have roommates. It was only clickbait. Okay. I only pay 1900.

82
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.300
And then we have self-improvement,

83
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.890
which is the smallest bucket of my spending for self-improvement.

84
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:36.540
I have a personal training and maybe audible or something like

85
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:39.390
that. But yeah, as you can see, I'll spend a lot on that.

86
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.720
I don't do a lot of self-improvement and then transportation,

87
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:44.370
which is like Uber. It's what?

88
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:49.200
The $1,000 did I might as well

89
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.330
rent a Tesla or something. So here it says 22,000.

90
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.530
I'm not sure if that's true.

91
00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:58.730
Maybe like I'm going to like clean it up a little bit. Okay.

92
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.600
So let's look at it. Deep dive style. So monthly rent,

93
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.600
$1,900. Okay. The Apple watch,

94
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.740
Adam is 1400 K con LA tickets.

95
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.860
I bought three of them. So this shouldn't really be 1300.

96
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:17.450
I should divide this by three. So let's see just by three.

97
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.520
So then $1,000 for my new bedsheets bedding duvet and all that totally

98
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:26.510
worth it. Because now when I sleep naked, it feels like, you know,

99
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.290
so silky hands are all over my body. It feels really good.

100
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.630
And then here is Hamilton tickets. I bought a Hamilton ticket for my brother,

101
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.710
his fiance and me and yeah, it's on me. So this one,

102
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:43.520
I have to leave it there because even though I bought three of them,

103
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.570
they're not paying me back. All right. And then next we have eight X. Oh,

104
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.610
this is Trevor Noah. Yeah. So for Trevor Noah,

105
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.060
I bought two tickets. That was um, yeah, that was for me.

106
00:06:56.061 --> 00:06:58.730
And then they're a friend and that costs 964.

107
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.810
I can divide that by two because they're not paying me back. Okay.

108
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.190
And then I bought a pixel three XL. Uh it's right here.

109
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.480
Why did I buy it? Um, no idea. I think it's like,

110
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.500
it's a hedge, you know,

111
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.850
in case one day Android becomes better than iPhone or that one day,

112
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.070
um, iPhones are not cool anymore.

113
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.910
So at least the transition will be a lot easier for me because I,

114
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.020
now I use both.

115
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.040
So it's a lot easier for me to transition into Android when the time comes.

116
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.200
And then the next spending three of them, $640.

117
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.260
That is my flight ticket to Japan because I am going to Japan this year. Uh,

118
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:41.030
I bought them for my friends, but they will pay me back.

119
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:45.290
So I will delete these two. Okay. Oh wait. Oh.

120
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.870
I want to say the joke. I want it to say. Oh yeah.

121
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:52.670
And the reason why I bought three tickets to Japan is because I want both of the

122
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:56.600
seat next to me to be empty. So I bought all three of them, but no,

123
00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:00.650
I'm not that rich. And then all right,

124
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.400
$633. This is a business expense is it's,

125
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:08.540
it's kind of like a box it's for doing live videos, using my camera. Uh,

126
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:13.460
I use it for my tech interview. Pro might as well plug tech interview pronoun.

127
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:14.181
Good news.

128
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:19.160
We added new videos about system design and also about how to transition into

129
00:08:19.161 --> 00:08:20.030
software engineering.

130
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.290
And then the reason why I bought this live video thing is that we do live videos

131
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:26.570
every two weeks for the Facebook group.

132
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.510
And then you could ask us Q and A's and stuff like that. If you're interested,

133
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.330
click on tech interview product com. All right.

134
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.250
And then next we got Ticketmaster.

135
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.790
<v 2>What is this? 544 bucks?</v>

136
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.200
What did I buy? I don't remember

137
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.980
the the that I buy it.

138
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.810
July 4th.

139
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.113
<v 0>What the?</v>

140
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.260
<v 1>Oh, got it. Got it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Got it. Oh yeah.</v>

141
00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:10.070
So I bought tickets for Allie Wong front seat. Okay. Actually not front seat,

142
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.860
the, the road before the front seat, because I don't want to get,

143
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.730
I don't want them to talk to me while they do their show because I always get

144
00:09:16.731 --> 00:09:19.610
nervous. So next we have, wow. That's a lot.

145
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.510
We have four Facebook, uh, charges.

146
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.050
Two of them is for advertising. I mean, you know,

147
00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:30.830
how do you expect my channel to grow? You really think that I make good content,

148
00:09:30.831 --> 00:09:34.400
which is how I grow my channel. Don't be so naive.

149
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.150
I pay for my subscribers. And then the other two is, uh,

150
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.420
for mental health America, which is a charity. Uh,

151
00:09:41.421 --> 00:09:45.500
I'm doing a fundraiser and I put in $500. Uh, it's not a thousand,

152
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:48.410
so this is wrong. Cause uh, I kind of did it twice by accident.

153
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.090
So it's only $500. I'll talk about that later. I don't want to,

154
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.830
I don't want you guys to think I'm a good person or anything. All right.

155
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.870
And then, Oh, $440. That is my virtual assistant.

156
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.290
I pay for a virtual assistance so that they can manage my calendar.

157
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.560
They can respond to some emails that can help me do some invoicing and stuff

158
00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:11.120
like that. Very useful.

159
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.700
Highly recommended if you're rich and then the next one Tom on,

160
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.670
that's actually just a guitar. So I bought a guitar. Uh,

161
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:20.570
you could see it right here.

162
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.513
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

163
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:33.260
<v 1>Let's see. And then he got a lot of, uh, business expense here.</v>

164
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:38.240
Zapier or press Venmo. What the did I buy WordPress? I don't know. Okay.

165
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.710
Some of it is pretty dumb. Okay. I guess you got the gist of it.

166
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:47.390
You got the bulk of my spending and let's go back to the pivot table

167
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.870
and see how it looks. It's not that bad.

168
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.790
It's it's it's it's still $19,000. Okay. Hmm. Crazy thing. Honestly,

169
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.410
I am okay with everything,

170
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.940
but what the hell transportation is so high.

171
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.380
Let me look at that.

172
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:10.250
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

173
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.240
<v 1>Live, live, live, live, live so clearly I like Uber more, but Holy.</v>

174
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:19.970
$1,000. Is that right? Did I spend a thousand dollars in a month? Holy.

175
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.940
Did. I might as well just pay for a Tesla or something. Oh, you know what?

176
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.610
You live and learn. All right. Anyways.

177
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.930
So I'm going to wrap this video in terms of a money-wise. So as you can see,

178
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.880
travel $900. It's not that bad, actually transportation. $1,000.

179
00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:39.260
I could do better in that.

180
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.490
Self-improvement I shouldn't worry about spending more in self-improvement but

181
00:11:43.491 --> 00:11:47.570
clearly I don't care about my self improvement. That much rent 1900.

182
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.380
I can't change anything. Those are some utility costs, whatever other,

183
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.300
I don't want to go into that, but what isn't other, let me go check cash,

184
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:58.870
advance interest on what that is. Virtual assistant was an other, Oh,

185
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.190
maid cleaning service. I also put them other that's I recommend that too.

186
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.570
Especially if you're lazy. Right. So, okay. That's that's not that bad.

187
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:12.400
I'm not going to change anything there. Entertainment. I don't want to,

188
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.240
I don't want to change that because entertainment's important. Right? Uh,

189
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.600
let's go back and entertainment on. See what I pay for entertainment. Yeah.

190
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.930
Like, like totally worth it. Right. Spotify. I have to show time,

191
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.990
got to Hamilton tickets. You know, it's for my brother.

192
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:29.950
It's important to Fandango movie. Totally important. I don't know what, Oh,

193
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.840
in-flight wifi. That's important to Patrion on a white says Jim,

194
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:39.070
but Patrion. I got to support to Patrion members, Tiffany Young tickets.

195
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.280
K-pop really important. We're going to skip this one.

196
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.670
We're going to skip that one. Nintendo digital. I can take that off.

197
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.290
It's only $4 Trevor. Noah. That was worth it. That was really no. I mean,

198
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.310
what are you going to do with your money?

199
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:55.450
If you're not going to have fun with it. K con LA tickets totally worth it.

200
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.300
Allie Wong totally worth it. So yeah.

201
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.540
I'm not going to change anything in my entertainment, business expense.

202
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.670
Dude's business expense. Mantz you know, to recap. Yes.

203
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:10.840
I spent a lot this month, but that's probably not every month.

204
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.800
I hope. And there's two reasons why I spend so much.

205
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:19.420
The first reason is consumption, smoothing. All right. It's an econ term.

206
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:23.160
Learn it every time. Every time I spend too much, that's my excuse.

207
00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.030
I'm just doing consumption, smoothing.

208
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.830
And then the second reason is I don't plan on saving for retirement

209
00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:34.510
because I'm banking on the fact that one of my investments will pan out

210
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.280
and will make me rich.

211
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.990
So that saving a few thousands here and there would be irrelevant.

212
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:46.330
Oh, what kind of investments? Stocks real estate Bitcoins. No, you plebs. Okay.

213
00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:51.430
I'm investing in my future kids and banking on the fact that one of them will be

214
00:13:51.431 --> 00:13:55.210
extremely rich and that will pay dividends to me.

215
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.000
It didn't work out for my parents,

216
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.020
but I'm optimistic for my kids.

217
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.400
<v 2>I should really call my parents.</v>

218
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.070
<v 1>And new K-pop video. Anyways. Now I want to talk about the charity section.</v>

219
00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.760
So I got all these corgis from the thousand skies. So thank you so much,

220
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.290
but I don't know what to do with them.

221
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.120
I'm not going to keep them in my place forever.

222
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.650
So I decided to give them out in exchange for a donation to my

223
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:31.350
fundraiser in mental health America.

224
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:36.000
So that's when I decided to donate 500 to bootstrap my fundraiser so that it

225
00:14:36.001 --> 00:14:39.420
doesn't look like a total failure if I don't have anyone donating.

226
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:44.520
So if you're in the Bay area, SF Bay area, you could, you know,

227
00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:46.170
for a small donation, even just two bucks,

228
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:50.460
you could just give two bucks and then I could personally hand you the corgi and

229
00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:52.610
I could meet. And like you give you a corgi,

230
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.080
but if you're not in the SF Bay area, unfortunately I can't deliver it to you.

231
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.370
But if you really want one,

232
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.160
you could go on thousand skies.com in case you want to know,

233
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.800
they're not paying me for this. I just really,

234
00:15:03.801 --> 00:15:08.120
really liked the corgis because there's a sentimental value to it.

235
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.520
Um, if you watch my videos from the beginning, you would understand why it's,

236
00:15:13.521 --> 00:15:14.900
because, uh,

237
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.820
many times I interacted with the corgi on one of my videos that went really,

238
00:15:19.821 --> 00:15:24.710
really popular and I kind of associate my success to these corgis and,

239
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.100
uh, yeah. And I kind of want to pay homage to it anyways,

240
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:31.820
that's it for now the video is long enough on this. I edited it really well.

241
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:36.140
I'm not sure, but, uh, thanks for watching really appreciate it. And uh,

242
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.360
I'll leave some links down below, like for example,

243
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:42.740
the fundraiser Lang and the thousand skies link and yeah, I hope you enjoy it.

244
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.900
So I'll leave you with this. Don't spend recklessly spend responsibly,

245
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.860
but remember self-worth before work.

246
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:53.710
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
