00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.340
<v 0>If you've actually done any kind of programming,</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.630
you wouldn't know that programming is frustrating, it's confusing.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.880
And sometimes it's even the moralizing. You remember, when you just started,

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.080
you were so motivated, so passionate about the things you can do with it.

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.300
All you see are people building their empires with it and affecting billions of

6
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:25.860
lives with their lines of code. But no one ever told you about their failures.

7
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.300
The untold stories of people who have fallen and the hardships that brought to

8
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:34.920
them. The reality is when we start programming and building things,

9
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:38.520
break things, get stuck, projects get scraped,

10
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.770
or even worse. Businesses die and jobs are lost. Startups fail,

11
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.540
and time is wasted. Failure after failure are happening every day.

12
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.790
But all you see are the successes that coding brought to these different people.

13
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.550
But no one talks about the path to get there.

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
Programming is hard and you will fail. At one point,

15
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.080
you will doubt yourself. You'll see, you're not smart enough.

16
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.520
You're not lucky enough or that you're not gifted enough. Worse.

17
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.850
Other people will tell you that you're not meant for computer science.

18
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.740
You're not meant to be an entrepreneur.

19
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.210
You're not smart enough to be a programmer. You know what? I'll tell you that.

20
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.050
I think that some of you are not born to be programmers.

21
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.720
You might be just wasting your time.

22
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.080
You want to ignore my advice and close this video.

23
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.773
<v 1>Good.</v>

24
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.270
<v 0>Ignore my advice. If that's you, then it means you're a bit stubborn,</v>

25
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.910
but you don't give up and you care. It means you fell all the time,

26
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.600
but you pick yourself back up and you become stronger.

27
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.350
It means you're dumb enough to try to do something impossible,

28
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.500
but then you make it possible.

29
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.720
You push technology to its limit and you're at the forefront of innovation and

30
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.770
you push even further. And when people tell you that you can't do it,

31
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.970
you go ahead and you do it. When people tell you, you're wasting your time,

32
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.740
you go back and you work twice as hard and you come back and prove them wrong.

33
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.730
When people tell you you're crazy, it's a compliment to you.

34
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.440
If that sounds like you,

35
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.690
then you are a true innovator and we need more people like you because we need

36
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:25.350
more people to face the impossible and conquer it.

37
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.280
I don't care if you're just trying to pass a CS course or not.

38
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:31.290
You're building a rocket ship startup.

39
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.360
What matter is that you are not stopping until you reach your goal.

40
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.780
As a society, we have many, many problems,

41
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.730
but we tackle them heads on and we keep innovating to make our lives

42
00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:46.140
better on planet earth.

43
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.890
One of the problems I care a lot about is natural disasters.

44
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.170
I'm partnered with IBM today to talk about a global initiative called call for

45
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:55.920
code,

46
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.400
which calls for developers to build something impactful and have a positive

47
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.450
change across the world, through their code. As you know,

48
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:08.920
there are hundreds of natural disasters every year, like hurricanes,

49
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.760
earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, and wildfires.

50
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.830
Those affect numerous lives and causes tremendous damage to families

51
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:22.780
across the globe. If you strive for real impact, we desperately need you.

52
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.670
This is why the 2019 call for code global challenge is a

53
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:32.380
competition to ask people like you to build solutions that help the health and

54
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.050
wellbeing of these victims of natural disasters.

55
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.000
There are so many aspects of that.

56
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.800
We're talking about accessing medical records, providing food and water safely,

57
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.450
controlling infectious diseases, building supply distribution networks,

58
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.010
and even getting access to mental health during natural disasters,

59
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.200
we need all kinds of technologies.

60
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.000
Here are a few examples of potential projects. You like working on blockchains,

61
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.280
build secure supply networks,

62
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.110
to distribute aid to the people in need you like AI and NLP build

63
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:09.370
bots to help real time communication. You're into data science,

64
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.830
analyze and predict what the effected populations need before they even

65
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:18.340
ask for it. Every one of your project will matter,

66
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.300
and it will be for an extremely good cause. Now, of course,

67
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:23.560
this is still a competition.

68
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.030
So they have a grand prize of $200,000.

69
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.160
Not only that the project with the greatest potential impact will be

70
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.780
implemented through the IBM code and response initiative and receive

71
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.130
open source support through the Linux foundation. Last year's winning team.

72
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:47.020
Project owl has already begun to deploy their solution in Puerto Rico as part of

73
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:48.160
the code in response.

74
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.380
So are you up for the challenge duty impossible. Be in there,

75
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:55.360
the Bader joined a call for code.
