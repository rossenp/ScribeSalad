00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>Welcome to the drama show today. We have these special guests.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.970
We have my ex-girlfriend joining us today.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.490
So why don't you introduce yourself?

4
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.010
Why always me? Yeah. So in case you didn't understand a joke,

5
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.810
what I was saying is that I don't have an ex-girlfriend because I'd never had a

6
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:34.490
girlfriend, which is kind of true. I mean,

7
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:37.520
I wouldn't consider the ones I had in middle school and high school,

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.570
real relationships, because it wasn't really driven by love or anything.

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.350
It was primarily driven by horniness and nothing else. And then in college,

10
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.110
it was really hard for me to be in a relationship.

11
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.320
And the reason why was because I went to university of Waterloo.

12
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.220
Now it's not because darn any girls there it's because we move every four

13
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:55.790
months.

14
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.850
So four months I would be in school in that four month that would be working.

15
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.150
So if you meet a girl and you hit it off, you know, it's real nice.

16
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.350
And then three months later,

17
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:06.980
you have to move out and it's not worth being in a long distance relationship

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.870
when you only met each other for like four months.

19
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.250
So I think that's the primary reason why I was never in the relationships.

20
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.580
And also because I'm a slide away, new videos, every Thursday,

21
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.170
I finally chose a schedule. I am going to post on Thursdays from now on,

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.120
at 12:00 PM Eastern time. I even made a cover photo for it. So it's pretty dope.

23
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.640
It's pretty official. And, uh, yeah.

24
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.720
And also another thing don't forget to follow me on Instagram at Jamal pod,

25
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.720
because from now on, I'm going to live stream on Instagram.

26
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.320
And the reason why I chose Instagram is because YouTube is getting too big for

27
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.860
me. And I can't have like a proper conversation with you guys.

28
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.480
So I chose Instagram to make it smaller so that at least I can have more of a

29
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:50.720
conversation or I can answer all the questions. All right.

30
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.450
So today I am going to bring you guys to the office,

31
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.990
which is actually pretty cool because I finally got the approval to film at the

32
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.750
office. The only thing is that I have to blur everything out.

33
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.860
That's too sensitive or that HR said I can't film, but yeah, I'm pretty excited.

34
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.410
All right, let's go. This is the gym, this,

35
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.790
and this is my desk and this is sun me.

36
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.570
<v 1>The. I'm not some me, bro. I'm not even.</v>

37
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.560
<v 0>Korean. And then now we are at the roof, as you can see, it's a beautiful view.</v>

38
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.150
All right. I hope you enjoyed that tour. And now it's time to go back home.

39
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.450
So now I'm going to Cameron's I'm going to say hello to him.

40
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.320
Cause it's been a while. I haven't seen him. Your camera was popping and we go,

41
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:35.270
what the are you doing, dude? What, what, what is this? It's nothing.

42
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.163
Oh, wait.

43
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.140
[inaudible] you were saying you were coming at 10 30.

44
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:49.610
I just want to surprise you. I mean, come on man. dude. Why are you filming?

45
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:53.480
Still do yo my God. Your hand, right?

46
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.150
<v 1>It's a little sticky.</v>

47
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 0>Oh, dude. This is actually pretty cool. God, it's so realistic.</v>

48
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.303
<v 2>Holy.</v>

49
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.910
<v 0>All right. Let's just do a little bit of coding. All right.</v>

50
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:15.870
So let me just show you a dope ID. It's called Microsoft word.

51
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:19.050
I don't know if you ever heard of that, but it's pretty cool.

52
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.980
Cause like Chickasaw, just like syntax highlighting, you know,

53
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.670
you could just change the color, like this change, the color like that.

54
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.380
So though, I mean,

55
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:32.850
I don't think any IDE can customize your colors that much.

56
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.570
So yeah, it's pretty much, this is like the dopest idea I've ever used. So.

57
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.323
<v 2>Simple yet</v>

58
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.160
delicate in flavor and texture.

59
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.870
They have the power of persuasion stronger than that.

60
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.213
Emotions

61
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.090
says that no man has ever resisted the temptation of

62
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.760
perfect balance of crisp cookies and rich,

63
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.070
impossible to find.

64
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.960
<v 0>All right. So I just wanted to tell you guys, um,</v>

65
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.460
I went to VidCon a few days ago and I actually had a lot of clips. So funny.

66
00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:33.870
You know, I filmed a lot of people, a lot of my coworkers, but I lost it all.

67
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.780
I'm very, very sad. The only thing I have left.

68
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.100
<v 3>So we hung out for the whole weekend. Like</v>

69
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.880
we hung out for the whole weekend.

70
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.100
Sort of you feel like our bond is stronger now because we

71
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.720
hung out. I feel like it's much worse.

72
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.380
I learned that you flirt by trying to quiz people about data science,

73
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.630
say something nice about me so that so that my audience can feel hashtag

74
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.160
relatable to me. You know what I mean? What is nice about, okay.

75
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.910
I'll just tell you what to say and you say it. Sure. Okay. You have to say,

76
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.080
you know Jonathan. No. No. Okay. Sorry.

77
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.480
I've never called you because whenever people call me Jonathan,

78
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.710
he like Morrisons are warm, but probably people call you Jonathan. Not a lot.

79
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.360
Probably Jonathan sometimes like in bed.

80
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.050
Wait, does anyone in here? Like when you're, well,

81
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:47.000
let me think, because that's like kind of funny, actually they did.

82
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.040
They never say my name in bed because it's not like they get excited or

83
00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:54.840
anything. They me to say other people's names, but yeah.

84
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:56.640
Say something like Joma,

85
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.210
you could seem very silly at times and sometimes even kind of mean,

86
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.560
but in reality he's actually a very sweet person and it would,

87
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.720
and that has shown multiple times today. Can you say that,

88
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.303
you know,

89
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.040
sometimes Gemma seems kind of dumb kinda mean, but uh,

90
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.120
it turns out that's entirely true. I didn't say Dom first of all.

91
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.910
Oh my God. All right. I'm done for today. Thanks for watching the blog.

92
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.260
Peace out.

93
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.640
I didn't shave cause this time I'm not sponsored by dollar shave club.

94
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.473
<v 4>[Inaudible]</v>

95
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.000
that's what I look like when I'm having sex.
