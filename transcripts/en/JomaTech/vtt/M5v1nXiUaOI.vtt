00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.201
<v 0>All right.</v>

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.520
So some of you might know that I just quit my data science job at Fang.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.590
The reason why I not seeing explicitly which company it's in case I

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:12.870
need to go begging back from my job, you know?

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.460
And I don't want them to say like, Oh my God,

6
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.970
what did you say this about a company. We're not going to take you back now,

7
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:20.100
before I go into why I quit my job,

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.870
I kind of have to re-explain what my role was as the data scientist and the

9
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:27.810
reason why I have to re-explain it is because, um,

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.950
it's not as standardized as like software engineering, which is, I mean, I,

11
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:35.880
I know I explained in a lot of videos, but I'm just going to do it again,

12
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:39.840
just so that you can have, uh, the right context to understand why quit.

13
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.850
So basically this was my job title at

14
00:00:44.851 --> 00:00:49.680
this company and, um, yeah, so you can read it. So, in essence,

15
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:51.420
in my words, um,

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.110
a data scientist is usually put into a product team and usually in the product

17
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:58.290
team, there's a product manager, there are software engineers,

18
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.640
and there's a data scientist. Now, obviously there are other roles, you know,

19
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:05.820
for example, like UX researchers and, um,

20
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.230
and like product specialist, marketing people, legal people and stuff like that.

21
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.410
But I'm just going to simplify it and say, okay,

22
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.010
so there's software engineers and data scientists and product managers.

23
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
So I'm not going to explain it in a way where it's like, Oh, data scientists,

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.960
they make mottos. They use like AR and like software engineers,

25
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.230
they built infrastructure and to use programming languages, blah, blah, blah.

26
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.520
I'm not going to explain like that.

27
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.450
I'm going to explain it in a more fundamental way of what their roles actually

28
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.190
are. So engineers,

29
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.250
they actually have the technical abilities to build the thing.

30
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.230
We actually want to build product managers.

31
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.170
They're basically the leaders or like the owners of the product.

32
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.410
They decide what the product is going to do,

33
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.320
and also what the product should be doing.

34
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.920
Basically they have the vision and they're in charge of actually executing,

35
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:55.200
getting the done. And, um, you know,

36
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.410
they'll do whatever they need to do to actually ship a product.

37
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.580
In some ways you could think of them as like mini CEOs of a product or a

38
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.350
feature. And then data scientists.

39
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.480
We have the most time to think because we don't need to like build anything

40
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.130
like for engineers and stuff like that.

41
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.850
And we also don't need to focus on executing and talking to cross-functional

42
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:16.980
partners all the time. So in some ways,

43
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:21.390
because we're able to think more than those two counterparts,

44
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.230
where basically like advisors are like consultants of like the product.

45
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.140
We don't actually make the final decisions and calls. I mean,

46
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:31.560
obviously your opinions matter. But in, in essence,

47
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.360
the people who had the final say are kind of the product managers and also the

48
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:36.871
engineers,

49
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:39.870
because the engineers are going to build it so they could build whatever they

50
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:43.350
want and then product managers. Um, they're the ones,

51
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.970
they're the ones that decide on the future of the product now,

52
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:52.950
because we have so much time to think our job is to try to understand

53
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:56.220
the product inside the now we're a support, technically not.

54
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.080
I'm not saying all data scientists do that,

55
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.200
but I think that the fundamental role of a data scientist is to understand the

56
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.400
product in and out better than anyone else. The reason is because, like I said,

57
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.740
you have more time to think you have more time in your hand.

58
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.690
So basically we use data to try to understand exactly what the product needs and

59
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:16.360
where the product should go in terms of the product direction.

60
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.520
And what we can do is we can tell our team exactly where we should prioritize

61
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.040
and how we should do certain things. Why?

62
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.990
Because we have so much time to think about it. You know,

63
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.480
we don't need to build stuff. We don't need to execute on anything.

64
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.490
So that's our role.

65
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.530
We're always making sure that the team is working on the most important things

66
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.330
currently. Okay. I'll do one more analogy just because I like doing analogies.

67
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.290
So imagine the YouTube channel, right. Um, uh,

68
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.510
engineers would be like video producers,

69
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.020
which is the people who actually know how to make videos because Indiana,

70
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.030
if you don't have a video, you're not going to have a video channel.

71
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.160
So I think of engineers like video producers, and then product managers,

72
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.350
I think of product managers as, um,

73
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.980
the people who it doesn't need to be multiple people.

74
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.030
It could just be one person,

75
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.770
but basically the person who sends emails tries to look for sponsorships and

76
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.160
they think about, okay, where should this channel go? Basically,

77
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.700
they do everything. That's not relate to videos. You know, we got branding,

78
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:20.080
we got sending emails, making websites, communicating with other YouTubers,

79
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.940
basically just all the crap that video producers might not want to do.

80
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.340
So I think those people are like the product managers,

81
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.570
and then we got a data science. So data scientists would be kind of like an, uh,

82
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:33.790
an analyst of your YouTube channel. Uh,

83
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:36.100
what an Alice would do is they would all,

84
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.430
they always look at analytics to make sure that, uh, you know,

85
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:42.280
you get some insights to know what kind of videos to make next. Like,

86
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:45.550
for example, you look at the views and they say like, Oh, okay, you know,

87
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.040
these things are kind of hot right now, or this is kind of trending.

88
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.680
And you look at comments to basically, you're like,

89
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.660
you're trying to understand your users the best way you can using data or

90
00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.570
anything. Actually, it doesn't even matter. It doesn't even need to be data.

91
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.600
So basically those are the fundamental rows.

92
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.290
Basically a data scientist should figure out how to get more subscribers,

93
00:05:05.291 --> 00:05:06.490
how to get more views.

94
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.850
And why are certain things working or are certain things not working.

95
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.130
So then give them insights, give, uh,

96
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.250
the product manager or like the video producer insights into like, okay,

97
00:05:15.251 --> 00:05:19.300
what should you make next? How should we, you know, like these strategies? Okay.

98
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.860
I know that was kind of long just to explain fundamentally what a data science.

99
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.730
<v 1>This is need water.</v>

100
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.080
<v 0>Okay. I'm too lazy to get water. Okay. But, um,</v>

101
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.590
basically the reason why I quit my data science job.

102
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.850
<v 1>In essence, it's because.</v>

103
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.980
<v 0>Cause I'm still exploring.</v>

104
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.430
So I guess what I'm trying to say is a lot of people are content with their

105
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:51.000
first job out of college. And um, for my case,

106
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.110
I think that for the first years out of your college,

107
00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:00.140
it is totally okay to keep searching and try to understand yourself and

108
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.950
try to understand what exactly is a right fit for you in terms of a job.

109
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.100
Like I prioritize, well, I might be wrong. I don't know,

110
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:10.370
but I prioritize long-term like, for example,

111
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.990
if I just stuck with data scientists and in the future,

112
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:16.220
I realized that I hate the job.

113
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.020
Then the cost of switching jobs is a lot higher later on if I was already five

114
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:22.100
years or six years in.

115
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.480
So I do think that sacrificing the first few years,

116
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.100
trying to discover what you actually want is definitely beneficial for your

117
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:35.030
career. Hopefully I don't know. We'll see. So I'm not saying, Oh, by the way,

118
00:06:35.031 --> 00:06:36.380
I'm switching to software engineering.

119
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.970
I have a feeling that some people don't know,

120
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:42.650
but I'm not saying that software engineering is my true calling or that this is

121
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:46.460
the final job that I want. I don't know. I'm not sure I might be wrong.

122
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.860
You know, I might not even last for like another year or two,

123
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.520
but in the current state that I am right now,

124
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.410
I feel that I don't want to do, you know, the analytics part, like,

125
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.870
you know, the YouTube guy where he just looks at analytics,

126
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:02.480
I kind of want to make videos. I want to be a video producer.

127
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.350
So in this analogy, it means that I want to build things.

128
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.580
And I think that's currently what I want, at least why I think I want,

129
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.650
so that's why I'm going to try out software engineering now. And uh,

130
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.320
yeah. Cause I thought that I was always a builder and you know,

131
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.350
I do like some aspects of data scientists, but you know,

132
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:25.610
I want to try to build stuff this time. Like I think at the core,

133
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.200
my personality does fit more of a builder. You know, I do like building stuff,

134
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.340
but yeah. So yeah,

135
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:34.820
so those are the arguments of me wanting to become a software engineer.

136
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.750
So I'm going to talk about some things about why I don't want to be a data

137
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:39.650
scientist anymore.

138
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.760
So at least at my company or my old company,

139
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.010
the way you get evaluated,

140
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.670
no matter what role you have is how much impact you have.

141
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.340
And basically what impact means is it, do you,

142
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:54.800
did you have like a positive contribution to the company?

143
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.090
So even if you worked your off or you did, you know, you do a lot of smart,

144
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:00.080
intelligent things,

145
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.560
but it doesn't have any positive impact to the company or like it doesn't really

146
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:06.950
change anything. Then you still might get fired after awhile.

147
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.190
So as a data scientist using the scope that I talked about,

148
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:14.230
like the fundamental rows, basically, um, how it,

149
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:18.590
data scientists can have impact in a company like that is by, uh,

150
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.550
make like being like influencing the product decision, uh,

151
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.380
influencing the product direction.

152
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.880
So for a data scientist using that scope of like fundamental rows, uh,

153
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:32.420
data scientists, how they can have impact is by, you know,

154
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.530
making it analysis or something such that it leads into

155
00:08:36.531 --> 00:08:38.150
actionable insight,

156
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.680
meaning that people will use that insight and now they'll take action to towards

157
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:45.860
it and then it will benefit the company. So that's impact. All right.

158
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:47.030
So I have a few examples.

159
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:50.750
I'm just going to read it out loud because I can't remember them.

160
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.400
So basically in a simple way,

161
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.540
if your analysis convinced the engineers to build something and our metrics went

162
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.230
up,

163
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.090
that's impact also if your analysis convinced a PM and the team

164
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.680
to put a new feature a or a project on the roadmap that's

165
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:08.514
impact,

166
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:14.100
if you create an amazing prediction algorithm to predict whether a user

167
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:18.060
watched a video with a loan in their apartment or with friends,

168
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:22.200
but the team didn't decide to implement it because they don't think it's useful.

169
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.490
That is not impact.

170
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.980
If you found that Korea is a growing market for live videos,

171
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.090
and you have tons of evidence that adding a donation button can make your

172
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:37.170
company dominant in the live video market in, uh, in Korea.

173
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.360
But even with their sound evidence,

174
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:44.070
you cannot convince your product team to focus on Korea. That is not impact.

175
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:46.440
So as you can see,

176
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:51.180
it's not always a hundred percent fair because for some team it might be

177
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:52.800
easier than another.

178
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.570
And there's a lot of factor that plays into the success of a data scientist and

179
00:09:57.571 --> 00:09:59.580
some of them are out of your control.

180
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.750
And that was one thing that I found a little bit harder to cope with.

181
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.030
Now I've worked with teams where it was really,

182
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:08.220
really easy to find opportunities,

183
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.700
and then you show those opportunities to them and then they're super excited and

184
00:10:11.701 --> 00:10:13.620
they'll do it, you know, and that's a lot of impact,

185
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.300
but I've also worked for teams that move a lot

186
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.710
slower, I guess, a more friction. And basically, you know,

187
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:26.040
you don't have as much credibility to them and it's a lot more difficult to

188
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:30.090
convince them to do what you want to do. So that's why it's a little bit harder.

189
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.610
So, and basically if you have no influence,

190
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.640
you don't have impact as a data scientist. Now,

191
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.150
sometimes you might be lucky that your work is so good that your work speaks for

192
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:44.130
itself, right? But the reality is that in life, that's not always the case.

193
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.320
Sometimes you just have to be influential.

194
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.130
Basically you have to have the skills to influence your peers,

195
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.890
your engineering manager, the product manager.

196
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.710
You have to get them in the same team as you,

197
00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.840
or you have to basically are basically,

198
00:10:57.841 --> 00:11:02.220
you have to kind of convince them that your ideas are good and that they should

199
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:05.670
implement it. But that's the thing. Um, it doesn't always happen.

200
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.020
And sometimes you gotta be pretty good at like the office politics or like,

201
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.730
you know, stuff that are more like soft skills ish. And I believe those are,

202
00:11:14.731 --> 00:11:17.640
were the skills that lacked or at least that's what I thought before.

203
00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:20.910
And which made me kind of like, eh, like believe it or not,

204
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.150
I'm actually kind of like a work introvert.

205
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.280
So I'm also like still very inexperience in, in, in,

206
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.630
uh, understanding like the work dynamics and also like some office politics and

207
00:11:33.631 --> 00:11:37.410
stuff like that. I'm still quite new. So I mean, I did get better,

208
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.180
but at the time that was what made me want to switch to software engineering

209
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:46.470
because I felt like I wasn't ready to be a product leader on my team.

210
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.120
I didn't feel like I had the maturity to make an influence decisions on my team.

211
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:56.080
I didn't have the confidence in myself nor my work and that stressed

212
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:58.960
me out. Yeah. That's stressed me out now don't get me wrong.

213
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.310
There's a lot of aspects of data science that I enjoyed and that I like and that

214
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:06.220
I still like. And I do hope that when I work as a sweep,

215
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.730
that I could use some of the things that I've learned and,

216
00:12:09.731 --> 00:12:13.150
and use it as my advantage, but basically how I think about it.

217
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:17.200
Like my philosophy is that your goal shouldn't be like, Oh, I should be really,

218
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:17.500
uh,

219
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.470
I should be a really good data scientist or I should be a really good software

220
00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:24.840
engineer. You should be the ultimate worker. Okay. That sounds kind of, we are.

221
00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.710
But basically what I'm trying to say is you want to be the guy who can solve

222
00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:31.530
everything with anything, right? Like if there's a problem,

223
00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:34.710
you're the guy to solve it. No matter if it's a technical problem,

224
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.250
a business problem, or like an analytics problem and stuff like that,

225
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.920
you want to be the guy that people can depend on.

226
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.050
And that's the person that I'm trying to beat.

227
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:47.130
And for now the skills I want to work on or, you know, building skills,

228
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:51.060
like a software engineer. So yeah. I mean, I haven't done that in ages.

229
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.860
I kind of miss it. Okay. So now what, you know, what am I doing now? Well,

230
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.360
I am unaware employed.

231
00:12:57.361 --> 00:13:02.070
So basically what I do is every day I just sit on my and I work on interview

232
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.560
problems. What else have I been doing? Yeah. So, you know,

233
00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:07.680
because I have so much time in mind, Hans, um,

234
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:13.050
I've been going to blind a lot, uh, blindness this like anonymous, uh,

235
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.710
forum app that you can check, uh, you can check like gossip.

236
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.310
So basically when I worked at like my company X,

237
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.480
what I could have done is I could have gone to blind and see what other people

238
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:28.500
were talking about that also worked at company X. So basically lots of gossip,

239
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.570
but I also use it for non gossip.

240
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.530
And there's a lot of stuff that you can read about in like normal topics where,

241
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.010
uh, just bunch of people from Silicon Valley, they just talk about random stuff.

242
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.830
And most of the time they talk about, you know, switching company,

243
00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:44.430
interviewing ed or TC, total compensation, how much they make.

244
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.790
It's a good way for me to get a feel of what the market is like right now.

245
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.380
So I use it a lot, almost obsessively. A lot of times I check like, okay,

246
00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:53.550
you know, um, you know,

247
00:13:53.551 --> 00:13:57.240
a company X interview process to kind of get a feel of like how they interview

248
00:13:57.241 --> 00:14:00.510
you. So that's why I do, I mean, you guys should totally check it out.

249
00:14:00.511 --> 00:14:05.160
It's pretty cool. Um, yeah. Lots of, uh, lots of anonymous, uh, star.

250
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.260
Yeah. So basically, um, you know, I,

251
00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:10.800
I get a lot of questions sometimes from people saying like, Oh,

252
00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:14.870
how should I do X or where, what should I do to find X, Y or whatever? Oh, wait,

253
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.540
my Canada's almost done. Yeah. So pretty much like, um,

254
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.990
I get a lot of questions where sometimes I'd over know the answer,

255
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.950
but how do I get the answers? Uh, you know, I can go to Google. I go to,

256
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:27.810
you know, I'll go expert to learn some stuff.

257
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.500
I'd use blind to understand how to interview process are. Like,

258
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.470
I use a lot of these websites. So I feel like, you know,

259
00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:36.750
instead of me answering all the questions for you guys,

260
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.900
I should just give you the tool to answer these questions, right?

261
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.880
So there's this quote, you know what they say,

262
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:47.010
give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, teach a man how to use blind,

263
00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:51.350
and then we'll get into a career and buy organic fish from whole foods for a

264
00:14:51.351 --> 00:14:55.130
lifetime. All right. That's all I have to say for today.

265
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.080
Thanks for watching peace.

266
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:15.280
