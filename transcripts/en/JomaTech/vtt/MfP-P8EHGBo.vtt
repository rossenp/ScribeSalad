00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>So you want to get into data science? Right? Well,</v>

2
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:09.270
you're in luck because I work as a data scientist at untitled

3
00:00:09.271 --> 00:00:10.830
company. Wait,

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.550
I work as a data science add untitled company.

5
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.850
Hey guys. Welcome.

6
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.080
<v 1>Welcome to another episode of Joe Dennis.</v>

7
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.690
Welcome.

8
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.523
<v 0>Oh my.</v>

9
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.010
<v 1>Hey guys. Welcome to another episode of gentleman tech.</v>

10
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.160
Now you might be wondering why am I in my room? Well,

11
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.100
that's just how things are going to be from here on out. So quick,

12
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:59.450
a little update. Um, I had to remove my day in the life video,

13
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.360
uh, you know, the one that got me, most of my views, uh,

14
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:06.350
I had to take it down because I violated some policies.

15
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.570
So that's why it's gone.

16
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.880
But today we're going to be talking about something different.

17
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.220
We're going to be talking about how to get a data science job at a, you know,

18
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.480
a large company like Friendster or MySpace, something like that. First of all,

19
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.070
what is data science? Because I have a feeling,

20
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:26.450
a lot of people have misconceptions about data science. So if you do,

21
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.890
I would suggest you to check this video I made with, um, engineering truth.

22
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.060
So yeah,

23
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.540
check that out and hopefully it'll give you an understanding of what data

24
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:38.120
science actually is or what my role is. All right.

25
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.780
So let's get to it to the five tips on how to land a data science job.

26
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.950
Number one, tip, do an internship and have a technical degree.

27
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.450
How I got my first hands-on experience on data science was my internship.

28
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.460
And I did my internship in a large untitled company. And, um,

29
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.740
how I got that internship was, uh,

30
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.120
was I just had a few software engineering background, which you can see, uh,

31
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:05.510
you could see my other internships on a previous videos, but yeah,

32
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:10.280
I had a few internships that software engineering and my degree is in CS.

33
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.370
I never touched data science before. So that's the thing.

34
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:16.910
So the easiest way is to get an internship and then usually they will give you a

35
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.470
full-time offer right after. So here are some examples of good degrees to have,

36
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.690
uh, CS, uh, software engineering, uh, economics, statistics, math,

37
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.560
uh, just engineering in general, like system engineering, uh,

38
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.150
maybe even environmental engineering,

39
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.820
just anything with the word engineering in it. They would, you know,

40
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.150
demonize technical and they will give you an interview. All right,

41
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:42.800
second tip learn SQL or SQL. I'm not sure.

42
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.160
Um, so when you're going to start your work as a data scientist,

43
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.800
no matter where it is, you're always going to have to write SQL.

44
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.330
Cause you got to get the data somehow,

45
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.590
no matter how fancy your Python is and stuff like that in the end,

46
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.370
usually most companies set up their infrastructure so that you query data using

47
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:03.160
SQL. Why? Because it's an easy language and even like analysts or like business

48
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:07.030
intelligence people they use SQL. So now you'll probably have to use SQL too,

49
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:08.890
because it's just easier for them.

50
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.320
And then because they set up the infrastructure like that,

51
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.370
you'll have to use that too.

52
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.590
And you also should learn SQL because all of the interviews I got

53
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.260
that was related to data science, I had a secret question.

54
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.780
Let me show you an example of question.

55
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.850
So I found this take-home exam and I will change it a little bit so

56
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:32.500
that the large company, which is not the original untitled large company,

57
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.610
but another large company that might or might not be related to transportation

58
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.870
gave me this take-home exam. So I'm going to whip it out. So for example,

59
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:44.470
what they would do is they would give you a schema and they will give you a

60
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:49.210
schema. For example, you see ID, client ID, driver, ID, city ID, client rating,

61
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.920
driver rating, and stuff like that.

62
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.180
And then the question would be something like for each of the cities, uh,

63
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.980
San Francisco and Los Angeles calculate 90th percentile

64
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:04.960
difference between actual and predicted ETA for all completed trip within the

65
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:09.880
last 30 days. And then when you do is you have to write queries for that. Yeah.

66
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.300
Uh, I'm not going to go through the answer, but you should,

67
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.030
that would give you an idea of what kind of query you should run.

68
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.950
Tip number three, learn about success metrics and tracking metrics.

69
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.660
That is very, very important.

70
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.570
And it's kind of hard to learn because it's more about product sense.

71
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.740
So why is it important? It's important because when you become a data scientist,

72
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.880
you will be the extrovert on your team on data, right?

73
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.780
So imagine if your team is like at McDonald's and you know,

74
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.160
you're domain data scientists,

75
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.940
then you're the one that will know where everything comes from.

76
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.020
Like all the data sources and also what to measure for success,

77
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:50.470
because you're going to be the one that the PMs asks you like, okay,

78
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.480
how do we know we're doing a good job?

79
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.680
How do we know that the introduction of these new hamburgers that they're

80
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.610
actually successful and making McDonald's a better place for people? You know,

81
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:03.880
sometimes it's easy, sometimes a lot harder to define the success metrics.

82
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.700
I'll give you an example, taking from the same take-home exam.

83
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.440
So imagine if the YouTube creator app, uh,

84
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.930
in case you don't know what the YouTube creator app, it's a,

85
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:17.530
it's an app for YouTube creators like myself. And when you click on it,

86
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.370
you could see like how many views are getting, you know, and how many, uh,

87
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.470
watch time and like what video is performing a lot,

88
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.230
what comments you're getting is basically a tool for creators like myself.

89
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.330
So that's basically what the YouTube creator app is.

90
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.430
So imagine that YouTube creator app is being redesigned, you know,

91
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.890
under adding CTR metrics or ironing, a better interfaces. And they have like a,

92
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.740
I don't know, just better user interface and like a whole facelift.

93
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.450
How do you know that the redesign was successful and what are the success

94
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:45.160
metrics and the tracking metrics. All right.

95
00:05:45.161 --> 00:05:47.890
Let me talk to you about the difference between success metrics and tracking

96
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:51.730
metrics. Success metrics is usually the one that the whole team cares about.

97
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.400
You know, they're always seeing growth, usually at a startup.

98
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.670
It would be like how many active users you have, for example, not vine.com.

99
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.050
<v 2>Bondo to startup can not find.com or you can share 6.1 second videos.</v>

100
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.790
<v 1>So imagine not vine.com. I would care about how many active users,</v>

101
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:11.530
like on a daily basis, how many unique people actually open the app? You know,

102
00:06:11.531 --> 00:06:12.161
I would care about it.

103
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:15.130
That would be my success metrics because that's the main thing I care about for

104
00:06:15.131 --> 00:06:18.910
now. And yeah, and then tracking metrics. I want to make sure, you know,

105
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.380
that they're actually, you know,

106
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.200
one real people or two having a good time on my app.

107
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.530
So what are the tracking metrics? So that would be, for example,

108
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.130
let's think about it. Um, I want to know if they're actually watching a lot of,

109
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.090
you know, videos,

110
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.740
so tracking metrics can be washed time per active user and then,

111
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:38.980
or maybe just watch time in general. And then another thing can be like,

112
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:40.690
how many videos are they watching? You know,

113
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:43.660
I want to make sure that the internet just opening the app and doing nothing.

114
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:48.880
And then also let's see another tracking metrics would be, you know, how many,

115
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.080
uh, how many like force quit do they have? Why do I care about that?

116
00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:55.840
Because I want to make sure I want to track the negative stuff too. Like,

117
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.410
are my, like, are my apps being a buggy? Like if they are,

118
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:00.580
and it keep force quitting,

119
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.050
then maybe the reason why they spend so much time on the app is because it's

120
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:06.160
really buggy. Right?

121
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.940
So I have to track these things to make sure that it's not buggy. Basically.

122
00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:13.450
You want your metrics to be non cheatable and represents success on your

123
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:16.720
company. And then the next question, after asking,

124
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:20.860
like how would you define your success metrics? It would be, how do you test it?

125
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.230
Okay. So here's one thing that you need to know.

126
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.820
You need to know about AB tests.

127
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.380
You need to know about control groups and experimental groups and like how many

128
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.470
people do you need in them enough. So that, uh, enough,

129
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:35.620
so that's statistically significant that you could see the differences,

130
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.630
but also to reduce risk of having a product that you launch. Right?

131
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.510
Because imagine if you're the, the, the launch of the new product,

132
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.720
or like a feature that you built on not fine.com is incredibly.

133
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.190
You don't want everyone,

134
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:52.330
you don't want the whole 50% of your users to be exposed to that experiment.

135
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:57.070
Right? So you have to think about ways to, uh, to make sure you don't risk that,

136
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.120
but also to get enough information that's statistically significant, all right,

137
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:02.290
tip number four,

138
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.690
learn I Python R Tableau or Excel or whatever to manipulate,

139
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.160
visualize and interpret that Utah. So why do you need to know all of this? Uh,

140
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.350
to be honest, in my personal opinion,

141
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.770
a lot of people like to use I Python R because they actually look really,

142
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.240
you know, uh, technical and coding intensive, but, you know, honestly,

143
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.020
I see a lot of good data. Science only use Excel, right?

144
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:29.320
They just grabbed the data using sequel, they manipulate it using SQL,

145
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:33.460
and then they just put an Excel to visualize things because the impact is not

146
00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:35.050
how technical you are,

147
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.210
but how well you communicate those findings and how well translate into product

148
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:43.450
recommendations. Now I'll talk about communication later.

149
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.240
Why do you need to learn all of these? Because you know,

150
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:48.040
you have to manipulate data sometimes sequel,

151
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.520
can't cut it and you need to visualize the data because you need to communicate

152
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:55.890
them later. So, so imagine you have a lot of data and your company, let's see,

153
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.220
let's go back to McDonald's. So what do you do? You do an exploratory analysis.

154
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.790
So imagine you're McDonald's and you have bunch of data about your sandwiches or

155
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:06.030
your hamburgers and stuff like that. So what, the first thing you can do,

156
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.960
you could, you know, use it to download all the data, manipulate them,

157
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:13.860
group them by like, you know, hamburgers or day of the week and stuff like that.

158
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:16.470
And you get discover a lot of things using that. And how would you do it?

159
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:20.610
You would use either Tableau, Excel, R or Python to manipulate things, right?

160
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.190
Because you want to answer your questions, like, all right,

161
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:28.020
which day of the week, um, we have the most sales and now which hamburgers,

162
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:31.080
uh, have, you know, which hamburgers are the most popular,

163
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.850
but then you could also say like,

164
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:36.720
which hamburgers actually have the highest profit margin plus, you know,

165
00:09:36.721 --> 00:09:40.140
sales like, so which one gives you more revenue, you know, and stuff like that.

166
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.090
And then which ones are actually losing money?

167
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.060
Because apparently when I worked there, uh, ice cream,

168
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.410
every time they sell ice cream,

169
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.130
they were actually losing money because employees didn't know how to stop

170
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:52.080
putting ice cream. So they filled it up too much.

171
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.660
So they try to teach us how to put ice cream,

172
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:58.320
but only put around it and leave a big void in the middle so that they save more

173
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:01.500
ice cream. I never did that because I cared about my customers.

174
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:06.360
So I want them to have the best ice cream ever, even if McDonald's losing money,

175
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.180
just saying, so this is why you have to learn, uh,

176
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.750
stuff like I Python R and stuff like that. Yeah. Honestly,

177
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.490
it doesn't matter which one, just as long as you're fast and you're correct at,

178
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.670
you know, creating these, uh, visualizations. So yeah.

179
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.690
So Indiana use any of these technologies to show your results,

180
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.710
to interpret them. And yeah. So that's why you need them. All right.

181
00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:32.100
Number five, you have to learn to communicate really,

182
00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:35.250
really well because the whole point of a data scientist is to communicate their

183
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:38.220
findings, right? Because if you don't communicate your findings,

184
00:10:38.221 --> 00:10:40.590
no one will know. And if no one will know, it's not going to,

185
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.420
it's not going to flourish into anything.

186
00:10:42.421 --> 00:10:45.570
It's not going to forge into any products, learn how to do public speaking,

187
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.940
you know, because they're going to be doing a lot of presentations.

188
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:49.870
You're going to be talking to a lot of people.

189
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.420
Also a lot of cross functional partners,

190
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:54.330
a lot of people like PM's engineers and all that.

191
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.910
You're going to be talking to them all the time and you'll be presenting to

192
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:57.060
them,

193
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.540
learn how to write better because you can't be presenting to everyone in the

194
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.950
company, but, you know,

195
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:05.010
whatever you found is valuable for maybe for another team.

196
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.370
So how do you do that? You write about it and you know, you write PowerPoints.

197
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.710
You are, you read an article within your company.

198
00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:14.250
You write a post when email that's pretty important too, because like, um,

199
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:17.370
writing is a very good medium to reach as many people as possible,

200
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:22.080
especially at work, learn how to make interesting PowerPoints because, uh,

201
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:24.360
when you're going to be presenting to people or when you're going to be

202
00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:27.000
presenting, you know, uh, your, your article,

203
00:11:27.001 --> 00:11:30.120
you want to have graphs and stuff like that. And then you won't,

204
00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:31.380
you don't want it to make it boring.

205
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:34.230
You want it to make it obvious what they're looking at. I mean, that's all,

206
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.790
I see a lot of data scientists.

207
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.370
They have like graphs with like a ton of like fancy crap,

208
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.750
but I can interpret it.

209
00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:43.140
Like I look at it and there's a ton of bars and like colors and stuff like that.

210
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.600
But what am I supposed to look at, dude, I don't have attention span, you know?

211
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.150
And just like a video creator you need to,

212
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.300
we need to get your attention within the five seconds.

213
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.250
That's the same thing with work. If people don't want to read your,

214
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.100
you're not going to have any value added to them because they didn't read your

215
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.070
post. So make sure that when you present a graph,

216
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.390
that it tells exactly what you're supposed to tell. So enough information,

217
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.180
and it's obvious what you're trying to say, and it proves their thesis.

218
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.390
So we have the same, actually. I just say that,

219
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.520
I don't think it's actually a saying, but here's the thing.

220
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:17.500
If you made an interesting analysis, but no one is there to read your analysis.

221
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:21.760
Did you really make an analysis? Hmm. Food for thought,

222
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.560
but yeah. And then bonus, uh, last one, uh, learn predictive modeling.

223
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.890
So this is not super required because, um,

224
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:35.290
it's funny because most people they optimize on this learn predictive modeling,

225
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:36.520
whenever do think data science,

226
00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.060
because they think data science is really related to like forecasting or like

227
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:44.530
finance, finance. It would be pretty important because the whole goal of your,

228
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:47.080
of your job is to make more money. And how do you make more money?

229
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:49.540
You predict the future. So, so that you can capitalize on it,

230
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:54.280
but for us as like a product data scientists, uh, predictive modeling,

231
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.740
isn't that important, but it's good to know.

232
00:12:56.741 --> 00:12:58.930
And it makes you a little bit cooler. So, yeah.

233
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.380
So it might be useful when you're like forecasting goals and stuff like that,

234
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.380
or when you want to build recommendation systems on your product,

235
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.910
but it's not super important, but it adds credibility. And also, you know,

236
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.220
so that you can tell your friends, I, you do modeling. Ooh. All right. So yeah.

237
00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:19.870
So that's about it. That's five tips on how to land a data science shop at an

238
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.430
untitled large company. And, uh, yeah, I hope, I hope that was useful.

239
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:25.540
I hope that was great. Uh,

240
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:29.290
this is pretty short because I don't want to go through the details of it,

241
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:31.750
but if you have any questions, um, you know,

242
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.230
comment down below and I'll try to answer it or I'll try and make another video

243
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.680
later on. So yeah. So don't forget to like this video,

244
00:13:38.681 --> 00:13:43.450
if it added value to your life and also subscribe if you like my videos and, uh,

245
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:45.190
yeah. Peace out. Thanks for watching.
