00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.450
<v 1>Hi guys. All right. Welcome to the video.</v>

2
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.230
We are with parties that cook nature asked me

3
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.650
to tell you mental health and physical health is extremely important.

4
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.873
And today we're gonna learn how to.

5
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.660
<v 2>We're going to divide into two teams and compete against each other,</v>

6
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.540
where we have to make two meals with carrots and Sterling.

7
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.350
And I just want to say real quick that I think cooking is really important,

8
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.210
especially cooking healthy food.

9
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.780
Cause I'm guessing a lot of you programmers than college students spend most of

10
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.070
your time in front of the computer.

11
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.150
And maybe sometimes you skip a meal or you just eat ramen. Well,

12
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.510
as you start to get older, you'll realize that health is really important.

13
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.140
So yeah.

14
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.530
Make sure that you take care of your health with exercise and by eating healthy.

15
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.641
And because of that,

16
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:04.970
you'll probably be a lot more focused and can probably be a lot more productive.

17
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.670
<v 1>All right. I'm gonna introduce you guys to some of my coworkers.</v>

18
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.450
This is my boss sound, Jake coworker boss.

19
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.590
He tells me what to do. Is that true? Okay. What is your role

20
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.620
drama, your actual role? A product manager.

21
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.440
Exactly. That's why you're a PM.

22
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.970
And basically what the S people do is they answer PM questions. True.

23
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.860
He is my boss. Not quickly enough.

24
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.340
I say that here, Cyrus,

25
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.270
you guys probably see my Instagram stories.

26
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:53.000
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.960
<v 1>And he's the guy who trains me, dude,</v>

28
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.130
my hand. It doesn't even, Oh my God, my hands too small, bro.

29
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.820
Yo, look at that. Oh man.

30
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.230
What are your numbers? Yeah. No, not your peak. Your peak?

31
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.610
Yeah. How, how, how much did you weigh and how much did you lift?

32
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.340
One 45 dead lifted. Five, 10 squatting.

33
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.430
[inaudible] look at his posture. This is the humble brag posture.

34
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.890
I just look at Cyrus and I just feel massive

35
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.850
when I see you, I was like, can you send me some of your lifting clips?

36
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.960
I'll I'll put them right here.

37
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.070
<v 0>Wow. Part of the caption. What.</v>

38
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.380
<v 1>A man or Cyrus? What a man.</v>

39
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.060
He pretends to be camera shy, but he's actually humble. Bragging. He's like, ah,

40
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.870
yeah, my muscles aren't Fila deadlift

41
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.650
thousand pound club. Wait, what's it called? Thousand club. Yeah, of course.

42
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.160
Of course. Easy, easy, bro. Oh, okay. It's true.

43
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.840
Can you tell me about your role? My role is an engineering manager. Ooh man.

44
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.000
You're wow. You seem very young as hell. No,

45
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:38.920
you're not. How old are you? 20.

46
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.630
See, already. That's young the way you said that, Kevin, but yeah.

47
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.110
So for aspiring soccer, what can you tell them?

48
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.860
Tips to succeed in the world, check out. You almost feel you.

49
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.250
And then I'm serious. Um, tips

50
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:56.800
cracking the code interview.

51
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.260
That book lists all my jobs and that was saying practice, practice, practice.

52
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.580
What about once you get into the job,

53
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:06.460
how do you succeed as a thought or a full-time Uber?

54
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.350
I would say learn as much as you can from the most senior engineers

55
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.000
write more code. I think my personal opinion is

56
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.370
immerse yourself. Just get yourself with tricky situations,

57
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.860
do a bunch of random things. So basically just do it right?

58
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.840
Just do exactly what I tell them all the time electric. My analogy was like,

59
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.653
nevermind.

60
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.470
<v 2>So just like sports. I think you have to practice,</v>

61
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:39.480
practice and practice like in sports,

62
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:43.230
you wouldn't just read about the sport and then one day hope to be the best at

63
00:04:43.231 --> 00:04:44.520
it. You know, you have to practice,

64
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.520
you have to put in the hours and you have to develop those muscle memories.

65
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.990
Same thing with coding.

66
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.440
You can't just read about it and try to optimize for like the best learning

67
00:04:52.441 --> 00:04:56.160
experience. And again, you just have to get your hands dirty and start coding.

68
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.340
So I tried to infiltrate theater team and get some Intel about what they're

69
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:03.174
making.

70
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.160
<v 1>So are you guys making Abishai I'm making parents like what's the final meal</v>

71
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.360
that is more secretive than Apple. What the hell?

72
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.700
<v 2>Unfortunately, he was as clueless as I am clearly.</v>

73
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.150
People who work in Silicon Valley do not cook for themselves.

74
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.000
<v 1>The team actually smells like a lot of veteran life.</v>

75
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.970
Like we're not making anything. Yeah. It's all that butter.

76
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.470
Even lift bro. Oh. That smells really good, dude.

77
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.530
Wait, wait, let me give my viewers some sense. You guys smell it,

78
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.010
which you say, did you say something? What is that?

79
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.420
Rami? I don't touch that. Yuck. Wait, wait, can you dab it? I want to,

80
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.100
I need to make my touch.

81
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.090
<v 3>Look at my down.</v>

82
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.070
<v 1>What? What's the hardest thing about being an engineering manager?</v>

83
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.810
Artists thing? Yeah. Wait, the light is better than this side artists.

84
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.900
I would say the hardest thing is instead of code you're debugging people.

85
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.770
Oh. And when you're cutting, when it goes to the people, it's obviously not

86
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.090
rational or logical it's code. So it's a little trickier,

87
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.630
but what what's the most common problem that you have to debug and people

88
00:06:31.631 --> 00:06:36.120
usually, I mean, I think the biggest thing for, for engineering engineers,

89
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.080
right? Do you you into like what really gets them excited for my projects,

90
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:44.740
for them, for their career, personal passion, that kind of stuff.

91
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.130
You definitely need to know that your engineers very well.

92
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.370
Nice. Fresh. Starting to heal Sanjay. Sanjay. Can I interview you?

93
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.130
It's okay. Oh, look at that skills.

94
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.100
How do you become a product manager? I be called rock manager. Yeah.

95
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.390
I stumbled upon it for realsies though. How did you do it?

96
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.280
Chose me. You actually want an answer? Yeah,

97
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.350
let's do a real answer. Look at the camera. Not me.

98
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.900
I wanted to be a product manager after school.

99
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.850
I was a computer science minor. Oh really? I didn't know that.

100
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.190
Oh. I couldn't go in and talk about it.

101
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.790
And so what's the next best thing of all things. Acid product manager.

102
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.360
Can you stop please? Uh,

103
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:40.270
and so I spent a couple of years out doing PM stuff, not doing PM.

104
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.110
What were you doing? Doing data analytics. That's what I do. Yeah.

105
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.250
I was in sequel all day. I've seen development, marketing and partnerships.

106
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.880
How'd you transition? I asked my boss, I was like,

107
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.270
my whole team had left and I was like, they wanted me to stay. I was like,

108
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:59.860
I will only say I buy the product. I'm interested in our role in the product.

109
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:00.761
And once a PM,

110
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:05.350
always you recommend people going to the data analyst if they can go to PM right

111
00:08:05.351 --> 00:08:09.520
away. But do you recommend people to go to data analyst before going to PM?

112
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.950
I always say that in order to become a very good man,

113
00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:13.540
you have to learn how to do everything else.

114
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.940
That's not as true when you're really bad.

115
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.240
You can always be a good camper straight out of just doing that from the start.

116
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:20.280
But if you want to be a great piano,

117
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.560
you got to learn how to all the other aurochs get together. Amazing piano.

118
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.520
Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Whoa, that looks heavy.

119
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.790
Are you jacked? Have you been working out?

120
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.790
<v 4>Whoa. Oh man.</v>

121
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.610
<v 1>So this is, this is a result. Oh my God. You dropped some stars. Yeah.</v>

122
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.330
So that's all right. That's all right. Well what is this? Oh,

123
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:45.310
that looks delicious. Butter. I'll be shack.

124
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:50.650
How can we be successful as a software engineer? Like yourself? Impact.

125
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:53.650
Are you stealing from other people we're done?

126
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.200
What do you mean by stealing impact? So you let them do the work and then Oh,

127
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:02.070
interesting. Oh yeah. I made this thing.

128
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.080
The vegetarian. Yeah.

129
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.720
You're going to have the cauliflower steak. Okay. All right. Real answer. Now,

130
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.580
if you want to succeed as an engineer and get promoted, what should you do? Um,

131
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:20.960
you find things that are most impactful and you work on them and you make sure

132
00:09:20.961 --> 00:09:25.280
that people who are in your game agree that it's the most impactful thing.

133
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.220
Okay. What do you mean by impactful? I hear that word a lot.

134
00:09:28.221 --> 00:09:31.550
What does that mean? It means you have a goal that you're trying to fingers,

135
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.390
trying to figure it out. If the funds that you're going to be working on.

136
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.540
So you can't just do whatever your boss asks you to do. Right. Um,

137
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.570
okay. Your boss,

138
00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:48.890
doesn't ask you to do things so you will sometimes have to go and figure it out.

139
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.980
Fascinating. Thank you.

140
00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.280
By the way, Kevin, what do you do for work?

141
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.230
I don't actually do anything also. Does that mean you're a product manager.

142
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.870
Can you tell me how you got into the role that doesn't do anything?

143
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:10.310
Because I really want to do that role.

144
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.080
I was optimizing for the least amount of work that I could possibly do. So

145
00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:21.820
cooking is fabulous. What do you, what do you,

146
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.810
what do you miss most about being a software engineer? Non-manager yeah.

147
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.870
I miss coding. You have miscoding.

148
00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:32.210
So are you saying engineering managers don't code a lot anymore.

149
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.850
When you have a smaller team, you do, but larger teams don't have the time.

150
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:42.920
Do you ever regret becoming a manager? No, because you like people.

151
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:44.810
I like people. Nice.

152
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.180
So Elton, tell me about yourself. I can tell you basically,

153
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.110
how long have you been working as a software engineer? For like 20 years. Oh,

154
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:07.490
wow. So you must be really, really senior [inaudible].

155
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.310
Oh my God. Can you tell me more about the ease? When do people start?

156
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.100
[inaudible] right. And you're, [inaudible]

157
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.640
a young, fresh,

158
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.240
fresh 20 now being, being 40 years old.

159
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.100
He's 17. How do you keep your complexion? So smooth as a 40 year old,

160
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:34.100
simple showering is overrated. Oh my Oh, overrated. Thank you.

161
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.490
Say I don't shower. Well, this is why,

162
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.670
because I'm trying to get perfect complexion. Thanks so much Elton. Well, yeah,

163
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.610
my flexing. No, I don't really see any definition. A little bit harder.

164
00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:53.580
A little bit. We get it.

165
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.800
We get the kitchen. You over there.

166
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.090
Just take a seat and then you cook the freaking meat. Go check.

167
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.563
Hey, how's it going?

168
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.690
Oh, here we go.

169
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.560
<v 5>So then we get that delicious chicken flavor.</v>

170
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.560
<v 1>Now the thing is, you know, you guys don't care.</v>

171
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.060
<v 5>About this jargon, this technical jargon,</v>

172
00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:44.160
because India is about what it tastes like. Right?

173
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.260
But most importantly is how we made it. We made it as a team harmony.

174
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.290
That's why, when you look at this, what does it look like? Yes, exactly.

175
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.440
Because it's all about harmony and bonding for teammates.

176
00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:01.200
So we didn't just make this food for our hats. We made it.

177
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.110
<v 1>Speech on a laptop.</v>

178
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.630
All right. So we're getting to the

179
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.990
PowerPoint and see me had a very strong team effort across cross

180
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:26.100
functions, cross between our team and our project management.

181
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.920
We greatly exceeded expectation.

182
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.730
You can see, we had a nice spread of a mix of meats, vegetables,

183
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:40.080
side dishes, and meats is unbelievable.

184
00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.620
Period of toasted.

185
00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:47.490
We grilled some steak at the nice chilled salad.

186
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.010
And then we tossed out with a nice pineapple dessert.

187
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.330
So you can see we had all our milestones early two months early

188
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.570
and uh,

189
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.493
as a team to

190
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.350
just take that picture two seconds ago.

191
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:17.363
Holy.

192
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.810
Is it recording? All right.

193
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.760
Thank you guys for watching. Join this awesome computation.

194
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.150
It doesn't matter your coworkers,

195
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:49.560
but yeah, let's try this a little bit smoother.

196
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.190
We are at our new apartment. It's not furnished yet,

197
00:15:10.191 --> 00:15:13.370
but we're just looking at it. This is my new roommate.

198
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:19.880
All right, let's check it out. What's this? Oh, hell yeah.

199
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.040
Are you serious? Isn't your bathroom bigger? Because it's two sinks.

200
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.950
Oh, I love this lighting all like the mirror lighting.

201
00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:37.700
It makes you look Jack them. All right.

202
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:42.170
So probably one couch here and then a couch here, your huge couch here.

203
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.630
Projector on the screen. Boom.

204
00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:55.430
I think it's just in case I'm gonna give you

205
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.603
one.

206
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.000
All right. So I hope you liked that quick tour. Uh,

207
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:12.530
I don't want to show you everything yet.

208
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:16.430
And also I want to decorate this place before giving it tour. So

209
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.740
what is it? Cause it's hot. You can feel it,

210
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.030
but yeah. So anyways, we're going to, we're going to go back to work now. AK,

211
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:29.540
we're going to go to the gym. Hit, hit the weights. Yeah.

212
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.570
<v 5>All right guys. So after a long day of work, I usually like to, you know,</v>

213
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:37.810
just like your size a little bit now, why do I exercise? You know,

214
00:16:37.811 --> 00:16:39.400
I think you guys should all exercise too,

215
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.820
because it's really important to keep fit because obviously when you code all

216
00:16:42.821 --> 00:16:44.920
day, you know, it says it's not very healthy.

217
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.100
Cause they're sitting around all day. And also another thing that's important.

218
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.460
I don't want to reinforce the negative stereotypes of programmers.

219
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.770
So I think everyone should go to the gym.

220
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.660
It's good for you because you'll code better.

221
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.300
And also so that we don't look like nerds. So yeah,

222
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.720
there's a few squats. So warm, upset issues.

223
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.750
Yeah. So we're going to start with 95 pounds, five,

224
00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.520
five reps for warmup.

225
00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:14.403
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.520
<v 5>Make sure you have asked the, the grass, make sure to pop that button.</v>

227
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:24.543
<v 1>Okay.</v>

228
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.560
<v 5>So today we're going to try to hit a PR meaning one map. What is it?</v>

229
00:17:29.561 --> 00:17:33.040
One map rep max one rep max one rep max,

230
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:37.420
meaning I just do one rep and I want to see how much I can do. Yeah.

231
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.313
And he's wishing me luck.

232
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.370
<v 1>Um, this is two Oh five. This there's two Oh five. Yeah.</v>

233
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:43.961
<v 5>All right.</v>

234
00:17:43.961 --> 00:17:48.820
My goal is to get to 15 by the end of this month

235
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.130
or we're going to try to source two 15 by the end. So yeah,

236
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.550
because I think that's what intermediate is. How much do you weigh? One 30.

237
00:17:56.551 --> 00:18:01.290
Two pounds. Okay. One 30, five 30. All right.

238
00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:03.150
So we're going for two 25. Yeah,

239
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.330
I think that would pass the intermediate level for my weight class.

240
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.100
<v 0>Okay.</v>

241
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.880
<v 5>All right. Thank you for watching this video. I hope you enjoyed it. You know,</v>

242
00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:36.830
so now you can see what I do during the day in my life. And uh, yeah,

243
00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:41.630
I'm pretty happy. I hit two 25, still a long way to go though, but uh, yeah,

244
00:18:41.631 --> 00:18:45.830
I hope you guys would join my journey of getting jacked resell fan.
