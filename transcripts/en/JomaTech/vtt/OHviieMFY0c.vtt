00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.880
<v 0>All right. Welcome back to my channel today.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.900
We are going to code some JavaScript because it's been a long time.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.700
I haven't been coding, you know,

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.660
cause I work as a data scientist and by data scientists, I mean a data analyst,

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.440
but you know,

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
we call it data scientists at Silicon Valley because we get to get paid more.

7
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.570
If we're called data scientists.

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.330
So pretty much any 12 year old can actually do my job,

9
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.580
but we still get paid a ton to do it.

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.723
Oh wait. Just a minute.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.810
So this video is sponsored by Wix code and I'll talk about this right now.

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.030
So you guys know what Wix is, right?

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.910
The website that allows you to make sunning websites. Well,

14
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:45.140
now they have a Wix code,

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.490
which allows us coders to tinker with the backend so that we can do so much

16
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:53.750
more. So I could finally do so much more by adding a database,

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.900
adding user forms and using JavaScript and their API.

18
00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:00.350
So I could finally make interactive websites. So check this out.

19
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.650
I just made a database right here and then on my home page,

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.180
I connected to the dataset. So now whenever someone writes me a message,

21
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.390
it pops up right here. Once I finished this website,

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.680
I'm going to have a personal wall so I can display all the awesome messages and

23
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.770
support that you guys gave me right here on this website.

24
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.550
So click on the link on the description to get started with your website today.

25
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.380
Anyways, I really missed coding. So if you missed part one and part two,

26
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:28.490
you should go check that out,

27
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.000
but I'll just give you a quick summary of what I'm building previously on

28
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:34.520
cookies code in JavaScript. Never shared it.

29
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.100
I wanted to make an app where you can synchronize watching YouTube between your

30
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.430
friends. So I used it YouTube API to create a player.

31
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.420
Then I also made a play and pause button so that I could send custom requests

32
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.450
back to the server so that I could synchronize between the players.

33
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.600
All right. Lego. My echo, my [inaudible] come on. I turn.

34
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.330
Okay. All right.

35
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:06.530
Let's take a break. All right.

36
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:09.110
So there's something important that I want to talk about. Um,

37
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:12.920
a lot of people have mentioned that I opened the banana. It's not open.

38
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:17.820
It's peel you idiot that I opened the banana wrongly. Oh,

39
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.190
guess what? You're wrong? Oh, well guess what? Your English is wrong

40
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.170
because that's how monkeys open it. Okay. You have to pinch it from here.

41
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.380
Not from here. Like if I want to open the Oh crap. Okay.

42
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:32.900
That was a lot easier than I thought, but usually it's really hard,

43
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:36.740
especially if it's not right. It's like, Oh my God. It's so hard to open it.

44
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.800
Here's how you actually peel a banana. Wow. Good job.

45
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.670
You finally used the word peel. You just pinch it right here.

46
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.280
There you go. It's so much easier. Okay.

47
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.550
See, see how much effort it took. It took so much effort.

48
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.010
And now imagine if you want to, okay.

49
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.530
Okay. Imagine if you want to pass the banana to someone else. Pass it to me now.

50
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.503
Oh, no.

51
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.860
Like how the hell am I supposed to hold it? All right. Now try this one. Wow.

52
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.540
It's like, if there's a, can you hold it properly? I'm going to do it again. Oh,

53
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.630
this is so hard. Totally like this. man. Get one, two, three. Okay.

54
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.980
Wow. Thank you. Look at that. Good thing. There's an end. Good thing.

55
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:35.610
I could hold the tail. It makes it so much easier to pass a banana around.

56
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.070
So there you have it. That's really important.

57
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

58
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.290
<v 0>All right. Okay. Okay. All right. Let's code for real now,</v>

59
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.040
Man. You know what I realized?

60
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.730
There are so many different ways of sitting and I feel like each way,

61
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.840
determines your personality a little bit. Let me tell you what I,

62
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.580
I mean the super straight up stance, super ergonomic,

63
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.810
their chest is popping elbows, aligned desks. I hate those people.

64
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.710
They're so nice to you and perfect. They're probably secretly a serial killer.

65
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.820
No one is that ergonomic. And I do not believe that's comfortable at all.

66
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.070
Now that's the stance.

67
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.060
I believe in perfectly snug optimal for coding efficiently.

68
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.190
I think that's being true to yourself.

69
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.370
And then there's some people that never wear shoes for some reason.

70
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.440
And they love to put their feet up.

71
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.740
It's like they watch too much Def note or something and they think they're

72
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:36.180
quirky and totally random. And then there's this guy who's super stressed,

73
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.160
keeps pulling his hair, you know,

74
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:41.370
swears from time to time and he just looks miserable.

75
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.810
And then we got this guy who's mouth is always open, like 24, seven.

76
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.950
He's probably a gamer or something. And just so concentrated. But come on, man.

77
00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:53.190
Just close your mouth. Okay. Okay. Okay.

78
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.930
For real now let's start coding for real. All right. So let's go to the,

79
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.940
to the web app. Oh, oops. I did not start it in PM. Start.

80
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.500
All right. Great. Great. We have it on here.

81
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.220
So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to add a click event on all

82
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:15.030
of these buttons, like for example, play and stop. So right now,

83
00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:17.340
if you click these, you know, it doesn't really do anything.

84
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.690
But what we want to do is that each time we click the play or the pause button,

85
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.830
we send it to the server.

86
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:26.310
So the server could send it to everyone that's logged in. All right,

87
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.173
let's do that.

88
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.240
All right, cool. So now that we've got the buttons working,

89
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.880
we're going to send this message back to the server,

90
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.350
but first the server has received it.

91
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.263
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

92
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.220
<v 0>Just wait a minute. You know, it takes me some time to read.</v>

93
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.060
<v 1>Okay, got it. Got it.</v>

94
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.500
<v 0>And then now the front end, when you receive these messages,</v>

95
00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:14.710
you have to act on it. So for example, if you receive a play request,

96
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.020
I'm going to play my video. If you receive a pause request,

97
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.180
I'm going to pause my video. Let's do that.

98
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:23.680
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

99
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.950
<v 0>All right. So let's check my Twitter. All right. Thank you, Jake.</v>

100
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.290
For the support. Really, really appreciate it.

101
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.980
And then also we have one question by Samsung.

102
00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.970
What tools do you use for data visualization? For me,

103
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:41.530
I use mostly Tableau and Excel, so it's super easy to use.

104
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.110
I don't even have to write code for it. So. All right.

105
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.180
Thanks for watching this video. If you like it,

106
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:49.570
don't forget to like and subscribe and yes. See you later.

107
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.460
<v 1>This video is.</v>

108
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.090
<v 0>Sponsored by Wix code. Wow. I didn't expect that.</v>

109
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.933
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

110
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.740
<v 2>You are like, how are you related to, uh, we're friends? Are we? Yes.</v>

111
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.370
And Al so, I mean, I kind of have to also decide about your career.

112
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.770
If you're going to get promoted or fired,

113
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.460
if you want him to get promoted or fired, one likes were fired.
