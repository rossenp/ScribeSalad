1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.433
<v 0>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.610
<v 1>Next time don't hit it that hard, but come on in, come on in.</v>

3
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.143
<v 0>All right.</v>

4
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.890
<v 1>So today we're going to do something pretty fun. Welcome to my place again.</v>

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.330
And, uh, yeah, today I'm not the star of the show.

6
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.640
The star of the show today is Matt show my

7
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:32.870
cinematographer. So I'm going to be teaching him how to program.

8
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.190
So you guys ready? It's going to be pretty basic because how much,

9
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:40.850
how much do you know nothing? Are you sure? Yeah. Nothing at all. Nothing,

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.940
but you want to get to Stanford, right? Yes. Right.

11
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.550
<v 1>All right. 30 minutes session, because we can only record for 30 minutes.</v>

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.480
All right. Let's start now. I'm going to, I'm going to read my notes,

14
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:59.300
but pretend you don't see my notes. Okay. Yeah.

15
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.790
So I guess the first question,

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.260
how much programming do you know? Or do you even know what is programming?

17
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.650
Programming is what makes phones?

18
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.470
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, wait, you.</v>

19
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.000
<v 1>Can tell me about yourself a little bit for eight K how old you are. Oh, my 16,</v>

20
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.560
like a good.

21
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.123
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.030
<v 1>I mean, I'm an isolate aligner. Yeah. Well idea of Tim.</v>

23
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.850
And then now I'm making videos with him, but that's about it. So yeah.

24
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.410
Matt is indeed 16 and he's probably the best photographer.

25
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.640
No, which is great because when you're 16, you're pretty cheap. So

26
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.770
not too expensive. Yeah. It keeps just doesn't pay anything. Yeah.

27
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:48.770
I just don't pay anything. Cause, cause he's, cause he's a, he's a fan boy,

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.240
but I, I see the, the investment, you know, potential, potential potential,

29
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.770
but yeah. It's okay.

30
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.370
Cause I'm going to sell video courses soon so we can use information, money,

31
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.730
better buy them so I can pay you. All right.

32
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.570
The reason why I'm doing this is because I want you to get into Stanford.

33
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.580
So you could be closer to where I live so we can make more videos.

34
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.300
Yeah. I don't care if you have like a successful career or not.

35
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.050
So I guess one thing that I want to talk about is that, uh,

36
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.790
when people think about programming, coding,

37
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.300
they think about just making websites and stuff like that, you know is cause,

38
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.210
um, cause whenever I hear about coding, they always say like, Oh,

39
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.270
the first thing you learn should be HTML and CSS. It's like, yes,

40
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:33.980
but first of all, those aren't even coding languages. Did you know that? No. No.

41
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.880
Actually I knew that. Oh, you knew that. Okay. Okay. So you know your. So yeah.

42
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.000
So you usually think about that, but it's actually not even coding.

43
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.480
The coding is basically the art of automation.

44
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.690
The whole point of coding is to what did I say?

45
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.250
Delegate tasks on machine rather than doing it yourself so they can do it

46
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:57.020
automatically. What else did I write? And how do you tell them to do things?

47
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.780
You give them very, very precise and those instructions is basically your code.

48
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.460
All right. So are you ready to learn some fundamentals? Okay.

49
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.850
First function we learn that is already made.

50
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.790
Like you're not going to write this function. It's called print. Okay.

51
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.030
For example, gentleman's dope. Okay.

52
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.290
And then what happens when you run this? You get gentleman's though. Right?

53
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.480
So this thing in between print is a string,

54
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.880
meaning it's words or like characters and you could also put numbers and then

55
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.620
this function is smart enough to print different things, you know? Okay, cool.

56
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.750
So try it yourself. Try to print, um, like, hi,

57
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.800
my name is.

58
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.743
<v 2>Gotcha.</v>

59
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.720
<v 1>Yeah. So that's clearly wrong. I said match. Hope not. It's wonderful. Bulky.</v>

60
00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:51.240
You get the point. So let's learn about functions.

61
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.260
So let me tell you what functions does. So this is the syntax for functions.

62
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.110
Like this is how you write Def means you start a function.

63
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.180
You could write any name. Like, so I write dog.

64
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.560
These parenthesis I'll talk about later, but I'll just add them now.

65
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.300
And then I could print. Don't go. Right?

66
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.200
And then if I run this, what happens is that it runs the whole file.

67
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.000
So now if I run the file in means this has been recorded,

68
00:04:18.001 --> 00:04:19.860
the function has been recorded. So if I run it,

69
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.950
it says doggle so let's do something funky.

70
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.560
What do you think would happen if I print?

71
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.720
And then I put dog there, what do you think that will happen?

72
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.690
It's going to print this whole thing. Like what do you mean?

73
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:39.450
What's it going to just get a print dog? It's actually going to print nothing.

74
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.100
Oh wait. Oh, it is going to get toggle. Sorry, my bad, but okay.

75
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:48.960
So the reason why doggle got printed is because we call this function,

76
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.390
but then why is there none? Like, for example, if I do dog, it prints toggle.

77
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.060
But then if I do print dog, it does nothing.

78
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.440
The reason is because this function returns nothing. Basically this is what,

79
00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:05.670
what what's really happening is returning nothing. But you can return,

80
00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.830
like for example, for, you know, print,

81
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:11.160
print is actually nothing related to what you're going to output in terms of

82
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.650
your function. This is just like a side effect. Right?

83
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.260
So imagine if you do, Oh, wait, I got to run it and then,

84
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.160
okay, so print dog. So what do you think will happen if I do this?

85
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.130
They're going to print and for let's try. Yes it is. Okay, cool.

86
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.710
So basically it returns, you could return stuff.

87
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.640
You can also return mean to return. It means like to imagine, like to,

88
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.930
after you're pressed that function,

89
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.340
it passes on a value so that another function can use it or something else.

90
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.420
Okay. Yeah. So how do you use these things that you pass on?

91
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.230
Good question. You didn't ask me, but good question.

92
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.710
Here's what we call it parameters. Right?

93
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.690
So in your SpongeBob we could add parameters.

94
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.780
So what parameters are our variables kind of, but on functions,

95
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.370
like for example, you could say a parameter, let's just do something easy.

96
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.890
Like hello, just to show you that, you know,

97
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.120
so what happens is let's add hello.

98
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.500
Let's see what happens. Okay. Then SpongeBob.

99
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.540
Now you can add stuff into it. Like let's just add a random number five.

100
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.130
What do you think it's going to print this?

101
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.410
Is it going to add five to the end of hi, my name is Punjab. Yes, that's right.

102
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.760
But you also have to know the operator rate or comparison operators,

103
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.240
which is like, for example, just fine.

104
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.660
So for equals a big distinction,

105
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.530
there's a distinction between like the one equal sign and two equal sign.

106
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.030
One equal sign is when you want to assign something to something to equal sign

107
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:50.390
is you're comparing like is four equals four. Yeah.

108
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.280
So what do you think will happen if I do [inaudible] who will

109
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.720
return true. Yes. Okay. What if I do five?

110
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.650
What do you think that is? What happened? They'll return false. Yeah. It's like,

111
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.610
what if I do? And uh,

112
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.510
more ways to, what have I do this? What do you think?

113
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.050
That's funny. False. No, it's true. Let's do the math

114
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.443
plus X.

115
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:29.090
So I asked him to write a simple function that requires if statements and

116
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:32.090
operators. Let me do some squats.

117
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:35.710
<v 0>Binge channel finished shadow.</v>

118
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.310
<v 1>Hmm. It is negative one. That's good. It's dope. It's dope.</v>

119
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.420
Wow. Good job. Good job.

120
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.600
<v 0>Let me whispered to my channel. All right guys.</v>

121
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.520
<v 1>So I'm actually trying to teach him recursion without him knowing</v>

122
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.240
it's recursion. So let's see if he, uh, if he gets it right.

123
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.480
I'd say probably not, but cool. See

124
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.940
such competence booster. You heard that?

125
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.763
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

126
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.020
<v 1>Joel. I'm done. Yeah.</v>

127
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.633
Check it out,

128
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.610
dude. He can't do that, man. It works up to

129
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.400
yes. Yes. Technically it does work. Yes. But I mean,

130
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.810
what if you don't want to do seven, right? Oops. So yeah.

131
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:11.390
Yeah. It doesn't even return anything. All right. Okay. It's okay. Um,

132
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.750
it's okay. I didn't expect you to get it because you know,

133
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:18.410
it's you really had to think outside the box and stuff like that. But uh,

134
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.320
no worries. This is very creative. I actually liked this.

135
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.780
So basically what I want to teach you is recursion.

136
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.580
So it means you could call the function within the function as in,

137
00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:30.200
you're going to call yourself. All right.

138
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.110
So I'm not going to teach you all this because we're actually running out of

139
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.380
time. So we're going to end it here, but I'm just going to show you real quick,

140
00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:40.700
what the code looks like. All right. So if an equals zero,

141
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.670
turn on. And

142
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.260
So basically what I did here is oops,

143
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:56.390
I did the two initial number for zero one, one. And then Alice,

144
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.450
what do you want to do is you want to add the previous one and the previous,

145
00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:01.520
previous one, right? So all you do is,

146
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.290
and minus one plus and minus two,

147
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.730
and then that's it very simple. All right.

148
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.040
Then if you do flip six, interesting.

149
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.850
I forgot to put return, man,

150
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:23.750
if you put 56, because you're 13,

151
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:27.980
seven 21. There you go. There, you have it. All right.

152
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:32.600
I hope that you enjoyed the small tutorial that would cramp them to 30 minutes,

153
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.080
but, uh, yeah, you did well. I mean, we learned a lot of things in functions,

154
00:11:36.081 --> 00:11:40.280
builder and variables, parameters, and you know, conditions.

155
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.480
So this is pretty good.

156
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.260
Hopefully next time you'll be able to make a web app on your own. Yeah.

157
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.770
Next tutorial. But yeah. So it gives,

158
00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:51.890
you don't know I'm going to maybe start doing some, uh,

159
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.040
Python courses that will, uh,

160
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.160
I don't know how much yet I still have to refine it. And uh, yeah,

161
00:11:57.161 --> 00:11:59.860
I'm really excited because I think finally it's going to be something very,

00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:03.640
