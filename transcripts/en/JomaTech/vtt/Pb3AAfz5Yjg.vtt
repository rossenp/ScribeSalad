00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>So most of these top three programming languages, videos, they always start.</v>

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.690
<v 1>By saying it depends because blah, blah, blah, blah. I won't say that.</v>

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.650
I'm just going to give it to you.

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.130
So the top three programming languages depends what you're trying.

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.060
<v 0>And optimize for. Wow. What a hypocrite. Anyways,</v>

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.070
this video is sponsored by Skillshare.

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.840
So I've bucketed into three main categories or like main purposes for learning a

8
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:27.710
new language. And I think that encompasses most of you. Now.

9
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:29.480
I want you guys to be honest with yourself,

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.430
because I do think that 95% of you guys who say that you want to go

11
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:38.840
into computer science because it is your passion. You are lying to yourselves.

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.370
Now that 95%, they actually care about money, the lifestyle,

13
00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:46.220
or the promise that you'll be able to build a startup that will make you

14
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:47.054
billions.

15
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.040
Now that is totally fine because there's nothing wrong in choosing a career for

16
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:56.360
its financial advantages that is called making informed life

17
00:00:56.361 --> 00:01:00.890
decisions. But don't lie to yourself. Be honest because Earl's,

18
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.460
you might end up hating what you do. But if you're honest, if yourself,

19
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.080
you will understand the trade-off that you made and you accept the setbacks and

20
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:13.880
the negative outcomes of your life also don't feel bad that you

21
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:17.810
suddenly realized her lying to yourself. I've lied to myself. Many times.

22
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.160
I lied to myself saying that I want to be a doctor when I was 13,

23
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.550
because it was my passion to help other people get better.

24
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.710
But obviously as Asians,

25
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.300
we all know what the true reason we want to be doctors

26
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.910
so that we can touch boobies. Right. All right.

27
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:36.770
So now that you're honest with yourself,

28
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.590
put yourself in one of these three camps.

29
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.720
One I want to program 'cause. I want a tech job at a big tech company.

30
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.920
Two.

31
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.840
I want to program because I want to build web apps fast so that I could make

32
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.720
my own product or work for an early startup three.

33
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.480
I want to program so that I could be ahead.

34
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.330
When I start computer science next year, as a freshmen,

35
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.960
I'll also make one assumption. You haven't programmed that much,

36
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.760
or you are a beginner because I don't think most experienced programmers care

37
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.630
about the top languages. They know that most languages are kind of similar.

38
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.610
And what they care about is more about what frameworks or engineering

39
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:21.350
domain they should focus on. All right. So depending on which camp you're in,

40
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:24.620
I'm going to give you the top three programming languages.

41
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.850
Now I'm going to give those to you so that once you start learning stuff,

42
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:32.180
that's actually important like engineering domains or frameworks,

43
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.620
you don't need to relearn these languages so that at least you can get that out

44
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:38.180
of the way. For example,

45
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:43.040
imagine if your goal was to do machine learning or play with

46
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:46.850
data and fit some models, then I would say, you should go with Python,

47
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.260
but learning Python has nothing to do with learning machine learning.

48
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.560
But it's just that once you get to machine learning,

49
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.560
most probably you will use the language Python because of the like

50
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.920
PI torch and stuff like that. All right. So let's start with,

51
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.020
I want to program because I want a tech job at a big tech company. Now,

52
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.070
before we go into that,

53
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:13.420
I want to tell you how the recruiting process works at these big tech companies.

54
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.650
You have three stages, right? The first one is to get an interview.

55
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.350
And then the second stage is to pass the interview.

56
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.270
And then the third stage is to do well in your job. AKA not get fired.

57
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.950
Ask yourself what is my limiting factor? Is it that I can't get the interviews?

58
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.660
Or is it that I can't pass the interviews? Or is it that once I get the job,

59
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.730
I'm not doing very well. And I don't like it.

60
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.930
So think of it as a funnel and understand what your limiting factor is.

61
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.370
And then work on that. If your resume is not picked up by D interviewer,

62
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.520
then it doesn't matter how great of a software engineer you are,

63
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.160
because you're never going to get to that bottom of the funnel.

64
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.840
You're never going to get to start working.

65
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.650
Then there's no chance for you to show off your awesome software engineering

66
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:59.200
skills. That's just how life is unfortunately.

67
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.460
So if your limiting factor is not being able to get interviews,

68
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.920
then that means you have to work on your resume.

69
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.540
And if you will have to work on your resume,

70
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:09.550
it means you have to have work experience there,

71
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.870
but you can't have work experience if you've never gotten a job.

72
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.880
So the alternative is getting referrals and in combination having

73
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:22.450
good personal projects for your resume. However,

74
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.850
if your problem is that you can't pass the interviews,

75
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.960
then that means you just have to up your data structure and algorithm skills.

76
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.980
And that means Lea coding, especially for these big tech companies,

77
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.330
because that's what they test you on.

78
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.140
If your problem is that you can't do your job well, once you get in there,

79
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.980
then most of the time, it's not because of our technical abilities,

80
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:46.810
but it's more about your resourcefulness and how independent I am kind of

81
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:48.040
skills. All right.

82
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:53.020
So here's the top three languages for beginners who want to eventually get into

83
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.750
a big tech company doing a tech job. So number one, Python,

84
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.260
number two, Java and number three C plus,

85
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:06.180
plus these three languages are the best for big tech companies

86
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.020
during coding interviews. And that is what you should be optimizing for.

87
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.020
If you have to put time into one thing,

88
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.950
then I strongly recommend that thing to be leak coding.

89
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.050
Many people have been able to get into jobs like Facebook or Google just

90
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.260
by being good at solving these leak code questions.

91
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.610
Even though some of them might not even know what get is or build files are

92
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.360
crazy now for interviews,

93
00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:38.010
I think using Python is your best bet because it is not typed.

94
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.990
You don't need to do memory management.

95
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.610
And there are a lot of shortcuts that make it easier for you to code during your

96
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:48.720
interview. And that is extremely important because each line of code,

97
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.110
if you save about one or two seconds, that adds up to a lot.

98
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.910
And also you don't need to use your brain to think about the syntax or

99
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.000
a particular language stuff so that you have more time or more space in your

100
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.430
brain to think about the actual problem itself.

101
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.380
Python is also really good because many of the web frameworks like Django and

102
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:14.180
flask are in Python and these frameworks are really good for you to make

103
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.140
personal projects.

104
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.400
And these projects will translate well into your resume to get interviews.

105
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.530
I put Java and C plus plus there,

106
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.190
because I guarantee you that a big tech company,

107
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.260
at least one part of their system is written in Java or C plus plus C plus

108
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.090
plus is usually used for more complex systems when performance is

109
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:37.340
really important, Java, less so,

110
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.960
but it's a great language to build applications. Like for example,

111
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.790
LinkedIn uses it, uh, two Sigma uses it. Palentier uses it. Now,

112
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.030
yes, I put Java and C plus plus below Python,

113
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.210
but they do have one thing over Python.

114
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.160
Your curriculum at school is probably using Java or C plus

115
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.960
plus most universities.

116
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:05.000
I don't think they will teach in Python because Python is not

117
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:09.530
a great language to learn fundamentals like types or, um, you know,

118
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.450
building and compiling and memory management. You don't need that in Python.

119
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.100
So that's why they prefer not to teach those things in Python because

120
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:23.210
Python is an interpreted language. If you don't understand what that means,

121
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.740
don't worry about it because eventually you will. That's how we learn stuff.

122
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.940
We just hear, we just hear a lot of things that gets repeated to us.

123
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:36.290
And over time we connect the dots and then we realize, Oh, that's what it meant.

124
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.450
Python, Java, and C plus plus have tremendous support in Lea code.

125
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:45.140
Usually when they give you answers or solutions to the problems,

126
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:48.410
they give it to you in these three languages. Yeah.

127
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:53.270
So then I put C plus plus below Java because C plus plus is

128
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.800
a very wordy language and that's going to slow you down during interviews.

129
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.030
So that's why C plus plus is at third place. All right.

130
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.920
So if your goal is to build stuff like build web applications and build them

131
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.600
fast and have fun with them,

132
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.340
then I think the top three programming languages are JavaScript,

133
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.600
Java and Swift. This might be a little bit controversial,

134
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:21.800
but I'll explain it later. Now, if you're like, Ooh, JavaScript,

135
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.250
this is a trash language, shut up, stop regurgitating.

136
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:28.940
What you've read on the internet and have your own opinions for Christ's sakes.

137
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.460
Before I explain why I chose these programming languages,

138
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.030
let me explain how web apps are built.

139
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.900
You have a front end and then you have your business logic in your backend.

140
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.060
And then you have storage for your data.

141
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.160
That is usually how web apps are formed to reiterate. You have the front end,

142
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:48.170
that displays to your users.

143
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.970
And then you have the backend that decides what to display depending on your

144
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:56.640
data that you have. And then you also have storage to store your data.

145
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.160
For example, if you're making online tic-tac-toe,

146
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.990
then the front end you displayed the grid for the players to interact with.

147
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.790
And then the backend, you have the logic of saying, Oh, if that's the case,

148
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.050
he wins. If that's the case, she wins. If that's the case, that's a draw.

149
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.450
And then on the data storage side,

150
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:20.250
you store in memory or whatever the state of the game. All right.

151
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:23.700
So now that you understand front end and backend of a web app,

152
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:28.500
let me explain to you why I think JavaScript is number one.

153
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.790
And also why I said that my list was a little bit controversial. Now.

154
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.350
I think my list is a little bit controversial because Python is not in there.

155
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.450
Python is extremely popular for building backends for web applications.

156
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.920
Lamp stack was very popular. Back then lap is Linux Apache,

157
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:48.900
my sequel and PHP.

158
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.320
And then PHB got replaced by Python over time.

159
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.020
And Python became very, very popular.

160
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.620
So a lot of frameworks like Django and flask made a popular,

161
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.010
I actually use Django a lot back when I was in college,

162
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.960
I built a website called porn Dora, but, uh, that's a story for another time.

163
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.360
So yes, Python was really popular,

164
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.950
but then Google released their V8 engine. And then also concurrently,

165
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.570
no JS came along,

166
00:10:15.571 --> 00:10:19.770
which is a runtime environment for JavaScript that caused a bunch of web

167
00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:23.910
frameworks for Java script to pop up, for example, express,

168
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.420
especially because these web frameworks were so new,

169
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.330
they were built with scale in mind,

170
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.010
older frameworks didn't anticipate the scale that we would be operating at.

171
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.360
So they're at a disadvantage compared to the newer sexier

172
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:44.250
frameworks that optimizes on throughput and scalability because of their event

173
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:47.430
driven architecture, capable of asynchronous IO.

174
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.930
So using node JS as your backend is extremely popular for

175
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.410
pet projects or even startups. Now, you know,

176
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.210
Tinder uses no JS for their backend. If you know what have been no,

177
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.820
but I'm serious. They actually use no JS of bender.

178
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.800
What's great about Java script is that it's also good for front end now,

179
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:15.510
you know, websites it's built in HTML, CSS and Java script,

180
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.000
and then also front end frameworks and libraries.

181
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:21.540
You have react and angular JS. In addition,

182
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.460
even for mobile apps,

183
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.410
you now have react native where you can build iOS app

184
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.820
and Android app by using JavaScript. No JS are, I mean,

185
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:38.040
Java script is the only language that you can solely use to build a

186
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.520
whole app end to end. All right, next,

187
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:43.590
I put Java and Swift.

188
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:47.400
The reason why I put Java in Swift is because for mobile development,

189
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.080
you need Java for Android, and then you need Swift for iPhones.

190
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.350
So as you can see,

191
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.640
I never really talked about the specifics or the features of a language.

192
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.470
If you're watching this videos,

193
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.700
I highly doubt that you would care about the intricacies of a programming

194
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:04.534
language.

195
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:09.220
What you should care is how much support do you have on the internet for that

196
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:13.210
language or purpose you're trying to accomplish. For example,

197
00:12:13.211 --> 00:12:16.720
C plus plus is a great language to build performance systems.

198
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.450
But if you want to do data stuff,

199
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.280
there isn't that much popular support for data frame style libraries.

200
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.610
So it's a crappy language. If you want to do data stuff.

201
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.530
Now on the other hand,

202
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:33.640
R is a great language for numerical computation,

203
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.220
but if you want to build web applications for it,

204
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.060
I don't think you have that much support because it's just not that popular to

205
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:42.040
use R to build web applications.

206
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.100
I'm pretty sure someone made a web application framework,

207
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.680
but if there aren't that many people who use it,

208
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.530
then there isn't that much support for it.

209
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.840
And then every time you're going to Google something,

210
00:12:52.841 --> 00:12:54.250
you're not going to find the answer.

211
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.820
So before you jump into a language and build a web app,

212
00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:02.830
what you should do is that you should build a small project and then Google

213
00:13:02.831 --> 00:13:06.790
your way through your answers. And then if you could see that, wow,

214
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.120
every time I Google something, I get an answer right away on stack overflow.

215
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.330
Then it means this language has a lot of support and you should use it,

216
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.030
but if not, then not so much.

217
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.710
And then once you find that that language is probably the best for your use

218
00:13:20.711 --> 00:13:25.420
case, because you have the support of the whole internet, all right.

219
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.610
Now, for the final bucket for you,

220
00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:32.230
people who want to get ahead before starting computer science as a

221
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.480
freshmen, from what I understand, uh,

222
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:39.280
what I said before is that they usually use Java or C plus plus for their

223
00:13:39.281 --> 00:13:42.010
courses. For me, when I was in Waterloo,

224
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.180
the first programming language they taught us in was something called scheme,

225
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:50.650
which was a functional programming language. And then later on,

226
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.600
they taught us using C Nazi plus plus C because they wanted

227
00:13:55.601 --> 00:14:00.040
to teach us memory management so that we understand the fundamentals of memory

228
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:03.490
more. And then later on, we use C plus plus,

229
00:14:03.491 --> 00:14:06.340
so that we learned about object oriented programming.

230
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.050
And then depending on your electives, you could usually use whatever you want,

231
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.550
whatever that gets the job done,

232
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:17.290
but mostly they make you use Java or C plus plus things that require high

233
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:18.190
performance.

234
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.930
You'd usually want a language that you could compile into binary and then run

235
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:27.910
it. So for example, C plus plus is a very popular choice for graphics.

236
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.010
And then C is a also very popular choice for low-level things.

237
00:14:33.011 --> 00:14:37.990
So usually in OSTP classes or embedded systems classes,

238
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.790
you're going to be using C I personally like C plus plus more just

239
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:47.770
because I think once you learn the language and the fundamentals of

240
00:14:47.771 --> 00:14:52.760
it, it's pretty easy to port over other languages, but that's just my opinion.

241
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.110
But anyways, that's pretty much it. Thank you for listening.

242
00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.600

And this one, especially the class is called presentation essentials.

254
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.590
How to share ideas that inspire action by Simon Sineck

255
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.810
in case you don't know Simon Sineck, he is an author and a motivational speaker.

256
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.860
The first time I heard about him is from a viral video where he talks about

257
00:16:00.861 --> 00:16:05.600
millennials in the workplace. I thought he was a great storyteller.

258
00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:10.520
And for me, I think storytelling is an extremely important skill to have.

259
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.250
