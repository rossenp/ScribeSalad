WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>What's up guys.</v>

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.490
All right. So, um, today what we're going to do,

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.630
we are going to interview a quant. Now, what does a Quan,

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
a quant is usually called a quantitative researcher or a quantitative analyst.

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.110
What they do is they work for hedge funds.

6
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.160
I think what they do is they use mathematical models, statistics, you know,

7
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.420
all of these rigorous tools to try to predict a market or try to, you know,

8
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:34.530
think about good investment strategies for hedge fund to make tons and tons of

9
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:35.130
money.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.080
And why do I want to interview a quant is because it is the highest paying

11
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.110
job. Like if you come out of college and you go straight to a quant,

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.850
you can get up to like starting salary, like $200,000. And also that's not even,

13
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.540
what's most appealing about it. It's the bonuses. Now the bonuses,

14
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.570
they can go up to like half a mil. You know,

15
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.720
it's not a surprise that after you worked different four years,

16
00:00:57.721 --> 00:01:00.960
you might get the total compensation of a million dollars a year.

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.120
So we are going to interview quantity.

18
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.160
And also this is a little bit special because this quantity is my

19
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.740
brother. So yeah. Hope you enjoy the interview.

20
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.410
Welcome to the Jomo show.

21
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.770
It's not called Jones show anymore because now I'm doing flogs.

22
00:01:16.771 --> 00:01:20.430
But I know it hasn't been a while since I've done the interview and today we

23
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:23.250
have a special guest David ma.

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.730
So he is a special person,

25
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.230
highly requested because he used to work as a quant at two Sigma.

26
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:33.930
Is that correct? That's correct. That is cool.

27
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.050
So a little intro questions that I usually ask all my viewers.

28
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.850
So Mac or PC Mac, easy iPhone or Android?

29
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.490
iPhone. Wow. You're a fan boy. Yep.

30
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.580
Favorite language Spanish.

31
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.540
<v 1>Yeah, it sounds very nice. Favorite programming. Oh, I see.</v>

32
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:55.370
I see. What do you think?

33
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.560
<v 0>Because people always make that mistake. I'm like, Oh my God.</v>

34
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.260
<v 1>Which, um, you know, I don't really care.</v>

35
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.600
I use Java now. Okay.

36
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.560
<v 0>Well, yeah, we use Java. Wow. Like on your startup. Yeah.</v>

37
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.540
We'll talk about this later. Uh, what about.

38
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.790
<v 1>Favorite editor? Uh, Microsoft word. Um,</v>

39
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.800
also ambiguous because the ideas aren't really nice now these

40
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:25.550
days. Right. Um, but I used to use them otherwise. Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.210
<v 0>I mean, honestly I use them because of you. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.540
Because it gives you me and you gotta, you got to suck it up. Yeah.

43
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.860
Pretty much learn all these commands and stuff. But, um, yeah.

44
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:37.850
I remember you started [inaudible].

45
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.420
<v 1>Because you weren't at Facebook, right? No, no, no, no. Uh,</v>

46
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.590
VIM was first year university. Like I SSH,

47
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.690
like I had to use something, um,

48
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.060
and VIM was one of the choices and like people said it was good,

49
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.720
but then I really got good at Facebook because like,

50
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.640
that was a pretty much one of the only choices. Oh.

51
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.400
<v 0>Wait, I got one more and user submitted tabs or spaces.</v>

52
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.240
<v 1>Obviously spaces.</v>

53
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.960
<v 0>Well, you press space or you mean like you tab,</v>

54
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.250
but then they become space space. Yeah. That's a big,

55
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.310
big differentiator. Yeah. All right. Cool.

56
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.690
So I heard you are a quantitative researcher, uh, is correct. Yeah.

57
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:25.440
So wait, where'd you work again? Uh, two Sigma. Oh, interesting.

58
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.990
I didn't know that. Well, you're a bad brother. Yeah. All right, cool. So, okay.

59
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:31.830
What is two Sigma?

60
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.090
<v 1>Uh, two Sigma is a quantitative hedge fund. Um,</v>

61
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.170
they use mathematics statistics, computer science to, uh,

62
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.100
make money on this stock markets on various financial. Right.

63
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.460
<v 0>Okay, cool. Cool. And then as a quant, what do you do?</v>

64
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.130
<v 1>Uh, there's different types of quants? Uh, the stuff that I did was to find,</v>

65
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.080
to predict, uh, the movements of stock prices and, uh,

66
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.820
through, you know, statistics. Yes.

67
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.880
<v 0>I see. So basically you do a lot of like forecasting forecasting, again.</v>

68
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:04.170
That's a good word. Okay, cool.

69
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.460
So you're trying to predict movements and then you're going to bet on that and

70
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:11.370
stuff like that. And then you probably have like a lot of different,

71
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.910
what else do you have to do with, you have to have, like, I heard a lot of them,

72
00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:17.910
the term, what is it alpha, what does that mean?

73
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.030
<v 1>Offer is just a term to signify that you've, um, uh,</v>

74
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.600
you're able to predict the market better than, uh,

75
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.880
the average person on the market.

76
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.850
<v 0>Oh, got it. Got it. Okay. So hired alpha. Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:36.840
It was about a higher alpha the bedroom cab. Okay. It seems pretty simple. Um,

78
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.540
just a quick question. How much stats,

79
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:43.650
background or math background do you need to be successful as a Quan cause is it

80
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:46.320
like, do you have to be genius? You know, did you do competitions?

81
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.710
<v 1>Definitely not. Uh, it's good to have a solid understanding,</v>

82
00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:54.600
like a basic understanding of statistics to not make the worst mistakes. Got it.

83
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.230
Um, like personally I took third year stats,

84
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.240
third and fourth year stats at Waterloo, which is not, you know,

85
00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:06.470
it's not graduate level or anything like that, but basically the,

86
00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:11.040
the most important things I think is, uh, to have creativity and to,

87
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.560
uh, think critically about your data and like about the process where

88
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:18.360
that data was generated. I think that's more,

89
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.420
much more important than like the actual statistics. Right.

90
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.250
<v 0>So when you mean creativity, what do you mean?</v>

91
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.450
The reason why I ask is because I would think I need creativity as a data

92
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:28.284
scientist,

93
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.790
but also because I think I'm a lot less technical than you in terms of like

94
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:35.400
stats knowledge. Because a lot of the times I'm just like, all right,

95
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.430
let's just average these things up. And then let's just take that variance.

96
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:42.120
Even if there's, they're like, Whoa, like the whole correlated, right.

97
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.100
<v 1>Maybe for you. Um, some, I mean, just talking about those kinds of, uh, stats,</v>

98
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.410
like, Oh, that's actually kind of enough,

99
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.220
as long as you're aware of where your biases are, right.

100
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.890
Your effects are so much larger than whatever bias. Like, it doesn't matter,

101
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.050
like that's a good case,

102
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.670
but when you're trying to find like tiny differences and sure. It will matter,

103
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.420
but hopefully that's not the case because you want to find a lot of alpha.

104
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.910
Right. And that's where the creativity comes in.

105
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.920
You want to find things that other people have not thought of. Maybe like, Oh,

106
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.190
let's use satellite imagery to look at, um,

107
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.520
how full Wells are in order to predict, uh,

108
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.050
some commodity prices and stuff like that. That was creative. Yeah. Um,

109
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.670
at some point it became not creative because I want to do a lot of it. Yeah.

110
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:32.500
Got it.

111
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.950
<v 0>So are you saying that like strategies, like for hedge funds,</v>

112
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.100
if you're the only one doing it, you might be profitable,

113
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:40.590
but if everyone starts doing it.

114
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.630
<v 1>That's great. It becomes that's profitable. That's called crowdedness.</v>

115
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.213
Interesting.

116
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.980
<v 0>So I heard, you know,</v>

117
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:51.670
especially from friends at Citadel that they work super long hours, you know,

118
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:54.940
it's hard. And then a lot of the times when I asked software engineers,

119
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.030
if they would like to switch to finance, because they know that finance,

120
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.960
they pay a lot, you know, but then they always come with the excuse saying,

121
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.860
yeah, but I don't want that like crazy work hours. So is it true? Like,

122
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:07.600
do you work long hours? Okay.

123
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.650
<v 1>It depends on the like personally at two Sigma.</v>

124
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.690
It was not that long.

125
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.970
I think I average 10 hours, 10 hours a day. Okay. Um,

126
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.270
and it's not like it's not 10 hours of like intense.

127
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.560
You have to be always on like, first of all, that was research.

128
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.540
That's what I did. Uh, software engineering is probably, um,

129
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.770
even less hours, uh, at two Sigma,

130
00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.410
the culture at two Sigma was like someone of a, of a balanced culture, uh,

131
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.960
between life and work. Uh,

132
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.070
so they wanted people that would come in and not, uh,

133
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.610
you know, uh, have a good, have a good life,

134
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.810
not leave a long leave too soon. Yeah. That makes sense.

135
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.900
It's it might be true in other companies. Um,

136
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.710
that two Sigma was pretty balanced. Yeah.

137
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.900
<v 0>Do you have any friends who came from Silicon Valley then worked at finance or</v>

138
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:08.050
worked at finance then Silicon Valley. And how do you know how they compare?

139
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:08.530
Like.

140
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.100
<v 1>I think it was pretty similar. Pretty similar. Yeah.</v>

141
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.750
Of course the things that you're working on was pretty different. Um,

142
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.500
but like to see my, try to make, uh, you know,

143
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.600
Silicon Valley style culture. Yeah.

144
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.740
<v 0>So you think it's the same for like Citadel and like other finance companies?</v>

145
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.760
<v 1>It's hard to know. I mean, I've never been there. Uh,</v>

146
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:33.760
they are competitors. They work. Yeah.

147
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.000
<v 0>Nice. Nice. Okay. So let's talk about your background.</v>

148
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:39.340
So how did you get into Quan? Like first?

149
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:43.900
How did you discover it and what do you think like a background should be to be,

150
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:45.020
you know, to get an interview?

151
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.570
<v 1>Right. At least the first time that I heard about like quants,</v>

152
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.790
um, was in my CJ, had it, I had this professor,

153
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.670
uh, he was like, it was 2007, right. Uh, financial crash and like,

154
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.850
like housing crisis and stuff like that. He was like blaming, Oh,

155
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.490
it's the clients like, this is the past stuff.

156
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.930
They use their mathematical models to, to create the financial disaster.

157
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.780
I was talking to my friend. I was like, Oh yeah, that's my guy.

158
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.930
That's why I want to be, you know, and he actually became one.

159
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.460
I didn't even know what it, what it was.

160
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.440
Cause like at that time I wanted to be an actuarial, uh, major.

161
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.580
Cause I was like, Oh, I like math. Let's, let's see what I can do with math.

162
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:31.050
And that's all I knew. Um, but like through the years,

163
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:36.300
uh, at, uh, at Waterloo, um, you know, I learned how to code,

164
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:41.250
I learned about predictive statistics. And then at some point I near the end,

165
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:45.000
I was like, well, all these things together. Um,

166
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:49.800
well it was a good fit for, for it to be a yeah.

167
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.693
Research quantity.

168
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.960
<v 0>So what was your major in, uh, university of Waterloo?</v>

169
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:59.150
<v 1>Mathematics and mathematics at Waterloo is very ambiguous. Yeah. Uh,</v>

170
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.980
you can like take whatever you want.

171
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.600
<v 0>Yeah. So you took stats. Where were you like a math genius? Like,</v>

172
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.800
did you do contests?

173
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.220
<v 1>I mean, I did contest when I was, uh,</v>

174
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:15.140
in high school ranked second in Quebec. Uh,

175
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.260
I didn't know about other. You didn't know that? Oh yeah.

176
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:21.290
I guess only there's only one, uh, competition that ranked second.

177
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.500
That was like my peak. Uh, but otherwise, no,

178
00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:27.050
I wouldn't consider myself genius in any way.

179
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:32.290
It was more combination of multiple things that led to God. Yeah.

180
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.290
It was a computer science stats, uh, and some interest in finance.

181
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.780
<v 0>So if you had to tell a high schooler, like my boy, Matt show behind the camera,</v>

182
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.540
or like an early college student. Yeah. They want to be a quantity.

183
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.460
We really want to be a Quan, but like,

184
00:10:49.461 --> 00:10:51.890
don't even tell me if it's actually my passion or not, but just,

185
00:10:51.891 --> 00:10:55.760
I just want to be quiet. Okay. What do you do right now?

186
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.060
<v 1>Computer science, uh, stats do some Kaggle competitions.</v>

187
00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:02.894
I think that's good.

188
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.940
That is one thing that I discovered pretty early on and I ranked like some,

189
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:10.040
somewhere to the top 10 for a competition.

190
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.560
<v 0>Humble bragging interview for you. Stop saying that you're still talking. Okay.</v>

191
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.060
But.

192
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.890
<v 1>That was at the time when it was easy.</v>

193
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.210
<v 0>Okay, cool. Cool. Nice.</v>

194
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.480
<v 1>'Cause now like, there's like so many PhDs, like it's super competitive.</v>

195
00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:30.380
K on Kaggle. It's overcrowded. Yes, that's right.

196
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.980
<v 0>All right. So what about like, um, like interviewing at these companies? How,</v>

197
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:37.280
how hard is it or like what kind of questions do you ask?

198
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.440
<v 1>I would say it's hard because not because</v>

199
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.100
maybe not because of the questions they asked,

200
00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:48.980
but because so many people want to apply like

201
00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:54.400
these days. I wonder if, if I apply now, whether I would get in,

202
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.630
it's kind of a, what kind of questions do they ask technical questions?

203
00:11:58.631 --> 00:12:01.030
Obviously you have to know your computer science.

204
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:03.040
You have to know your statistics.

205
00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:08.110
I spent a whole day just going through all these questions that people

206
00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:11.860
compiled online. Okay. Where do you find these questions? Um,

207
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.180
like behind the.

208
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.280
<v 0>Cracking, the coding interview.</v>

209
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.990
<v 1>Yeah. Cracking the code, um, uh, glass door.</v>

210
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.190
There's like some quant one that people have compiled like more statistics and

211
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:28.570
like more, uh, probably questions brainteasers um,

212
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.960
like just go through all of them. It's like, just to maximize your chances,

213
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.060
these honestly, I don't think it's like a really good, um, you don't,

214
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.230
it's not like you use this on the job, uh, especially the brain teasers,

215
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.400
but it kind of filters out the people who are like, Oh, I'm going to Yolo this.

216
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.270
Right, right, right. Okay. So basically hardworking people. Yeah. It's,

217
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.220
it's it filters with some training. Yeah.

218
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.230
<v 0>Inclusion. From what I understand, uh, quants, you know, they,</v>

219
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.200
they they're basically like data scientists.

220
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:00.450
I feel like they're a little bit more rigorous, you know,

221
00:13:00.451 --> 00:13:04.380
they use mathematical models to try to predict markets so that they can make

222
00:13:04.381 --> 00:13:07.650
money for the hedge fund was a good summary. Cool. All right.

223
00:13:07.651 --> 00:13:11.190
So let's talk about a little bit of, uh, you know, you as a person, you know,

224
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.090
cause, um,

225
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.860
we want to know like how does one habit interesting to Quan?

226
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.690
So thinking about when you were a kid,

227
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.860
do you think you had like behaviors where it kind of indicated that you're more

228
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:26.190
of a technical person, a more mathematical person? You know,

229
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:29.760
like for me.

230
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.760
<v 1>I was, yeah. So there you can go first.</v>

231
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.770
<v 0>Well, for me, I think it was just like playing games that are like RTS that,</v>

232
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.960
you know, how you had to manage money or stuff like that.

233
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.140
Or also like building stuff in kingdom hearts.

234
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.200
I remember know that that would be a very engineering dream.

235
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.370
<v 1>Yeah. That was very impressive. I really enjoyed reading, uh,</v>

236
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.050
detective stories.

237
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:55.710
<v 0>Oh yeah. I don't know how that relates to Quan.</v>

238
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.770
<v 1>Because you have to investigate data. Right.</v>

239
00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:03.630
I find now like as a data scientists, it's, it's kind of like a,

240
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.730
you're kind of like a detective, but you're your subject is data.

241
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.710
You have things that you want to investigate and you have to like find ways of

242
00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:18.570
like answering that question through evidence. Right. Um.

243
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:24.120
<v 0>I like the, I really like that analogy. Cause it feels like in the end,</v>

244
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:28.440
the data is just data and then all the statistic, goal knowledge,

245
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.380
even if you're really technical, it doesn't make you a better data scientist.

246
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:32.820
Right. What's important. Right.

247
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.820
Is the questions you asked and how you get to those answers.

248
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.770
<v 1>And also like being able to take synthesize all the evidence that you've,</v>

249
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.210
that you've, uh, you've found and into like one coherent story.

250
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:49.530
Right. That's like a very detective thing to do. Right.

251
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:51.000
Cause like if there one,

252
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.520
like if there's like one piece of evidence that doesn't fit with the story it's

253
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.060
something's wrong. Right.

254
00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.250
<v 0>Okay. Cool. So what about, let's talk about now,</v>

255
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.210
what do you do outside of work aside from, you know, when you actually work,

256
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.760
what are your hobbies? Um.

257
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:11.110
<v 1>I do photography a bit these days. It's like your Instagram.</v>

258
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.230
<v 0>I mean, it's not that good. [inaudible].</v>

259
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.350
<v 1>I haven't, I haven't done much in a, in a while. Um.</v>

260
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.810
<v 0>Wait, your hand was actually at the VidMob. Yeah. Wow.</v>

261
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.390
<v 1>So lucky also have david.ma.</v>

262
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.630
<v 0>Yeah. You can check out his website. It's pretty good.</v>

263
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:30.610
<v 1>Yeah. It's pretty. Yeah. I needed some sort of designer contact me, DM me.</v>

264
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:35.320
Wow. It's literally just a yeah. And it's and it's super outdated.

265
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.740
It says I'm a quantitative. Oh yeah. It's not true anymore.

266
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.850
<v 0>Right? True. Yeah. So you're not a quad anymore. So what do you do now?</v>

267
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:48.640
<v 1>Uh, I work at a startup. Um, we're still very small.</v>

268
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:53.110
We are building a real estate agent's assistance and we help,

269
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.040
uh, real estate agents, uh, schedule things with prospects,

270
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:01.750
manage their schedules, collect data about their performances, uh, so that,

271
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.010
you know,

272
00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.340
just this stuff can be automated so that they can focus on the stuff they do

273
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:10.270
best, which is selling to, uh, people who come in.

274
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.690
<v 0>Cool. Cool. You guys doing well.</v>

275
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.630
<v 1>Pretty well. I think pretty well. Nice.</v>

276
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.790
<v 0>All my discord channel.</v>

277
00:16:18.791 --> 00:16:22.600
I also asked them to ask you guys you questions or us questions.

278
00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:25.990
How to get your little brother eight girlfriend.

279
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.790
<v 1>It's hopeless. It's hopeless. It's hopeless.</v>

280
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.430
<v 0>Yeah. Why do you think it's hopeless? What's what's wrong with me?</v>

281
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.580
I have theories, but why do you think?

282
00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:40.780
<v 1>Well, I was actually kidding. He's actually tons of girls.</v>

283
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:44.230
He just doesn't tell you guys. That's not true. It's not part of my brand.

284
00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:48.100
<v 0>Next question. What was Jomo? Like when he was younger?</v>

285
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:55.210
<v 1>Yes. Confidence. Oh really? Yes. That's true. Yeah. That's true.</v>

286
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.320
I think that summarizes the biggest, the biggest difference. Yeah.

287
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.480
<v 0>All right. Next question. Favorite video games or yeah.</v>

288
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.190
<v 1>Um, probably smash. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. I mean,</v>

289
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.030
I hate that. You're better than me. I'm still good, but like it's a really,

290
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.610
it's a really good smash Millie. Yeah.

291
00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.580
You never have to learn the advanced technique still. Yeah. That's true.

292
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.800
That's where you're not blocked. Yeah. I was like,

293
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.540
I'm like trying to weave that or like

294
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:28.060
who.

295
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.100
<v 0>Is smarter Joel or Dave.</v>

296
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.570
<v 1>Then I'm going to give a serious answer for this one. Really serious answer.</v>

297
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.950
When I was a kid, I thought I was smarter. No, I think you,

298
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.560
I think you're so much smarter because as a kid,

299
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:46.000
I like in the earliest stages, I thought like,

300
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.073
Oh yeah,

301
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.840
like IQ tests and like math and like being clever at those kinds of things

302
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:56.160
was meant that you were smarter. And I think I'm better than that.

303
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.003
That kind of stuff

304
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.940
I realized like after some university and like, especially after,

305
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.150
after that, that there was so many ways of being smart.

306
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:12.570
And I kind of find that in general,

307
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.230
like I find you learn things faster than me.

308
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.370
And I think now I think you're smarter than me.

309
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.280
<v 2>Thank you. What kind of music are you going to put on?</v>

310
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.850
<v 0>I don't know. I'll have to think about it. You're smarter than me.</v>

311
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.530
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

312
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.980
<v 0>But yeah. But yeah, definitely like, thank you. First of all,</v>

313
00:18:42.981 --> 00:18:45.870
it's very nice for you to say, but no.

314
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.160
<v 1>But it was not, uh, it was not the charity.</v>

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.050
<v 0>No, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Um, yeah, but I do want to say like, yeah,</v>

316
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.300
definitely like quantitative wise and stuff like that.

317
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.440
You were always like smarter.

318
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.550
Sometimes it did feel like I was like living under your shadow in some ways.

319
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.060
Right. I guess it's cute like that. Yeah.

320
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:10.040
But, uh, but yeah, like, um, I'm glad,

321
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.650
like hopefully someday I feel like, cause you,

322
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.130
in some ways paved the way for me in terms of like my education,

323
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.270
what I did and stuff like that. I just hope that one day I can like give back,

324
00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.310
you know, I think.

325
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:26.060

326
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.660
You don't have a smaller, a younger brother, but right, right, right. Yeah.

327
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.550
You're doing what you can. I think in the end, like whenever we're successful,

328
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.570
you should just lead the way for some other people.

329
